40|$|Poor {{perfusion}} of the {{aortic arch}} is a suspected cause for peri- and post-operative neurological complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). High-speed jets from 8 to 10 FR pediatric/neonatal cannulae delivering ~ 1 L/min of blood can accrue sub-lethal hemolytic damage while also subjecting the aorta to non-physiologic flow conditions that compromise cerebral perfusion. Therefore, we {{emphasize the importance}} of cannulation strategy and hypothesize engineering better CPB perfusion through a redesigned aortic cannula tip. This study employs computational fluid dynamics to investigate novel diffuser-tipped aortic cannulae for shape sensitivity to cerebral perfusion, in an in silico cross-clamped aortic arch model modeled with fixed outflow resistances. 17 parametrically altered configurations of an 8 FR end-hole and several <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone</b> angled tips in combination with jet incidence angles toward or away from the head–neck vessels were studied. Experimental pressure-flow characterizations were also conducted on these cannula tip designs. An 8 FR end-hole aortic cannula delivering 1 L/min along the transverse aortic arch was found to give rise to backflow from the brachicephalic artery (BCA), irrespective of angular orientation, for the chosen ascending aortic insertion location. Parametric alteration of the cannula tip to include a <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone</b> angle (tested up to 7 °) eliminated BCA backflow for any tested angle of jet incidence. Experiments revealed that a 1 cm long 10 ° <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone</b> tip demonstrated the best pressure-flow performance improvement in contrast with either an end-hole tip or <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone</b> angles greater than 10 °. Performance further improved when the diffuser was preceded by an expanded four-lobe swirl inducer attachment—a novel component. In conclusion, aortic cannula orientation is crucial in determining net head–neck perfusion but precise angulations and insertion-depths are difficult to achieve practically. Altering the cannula tip to include a <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone</b> angle has been shown {{for the first time to}} have potential in ensuring a net positive outflow at the BCA. Cannula insertion distanced from the BCA inlet may also avoid backflow owing to the Venturi effect, but the diffuser tipped cannula design presents a promising solution to mitigate this issue irrespective of in vivo cannula tip orientation...|$|E

The influence of the turbine setting level on the volume of the cavity rope and its centerline is investigated, providing a physical knowledge about the hydrodynamic complex phenomena involved in the development of the cavitation rope in Francis turbine operating regimes. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2813052 �...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbulent}} flow in a conical diffuser represents {{the type of}} turbulent boundary layer with positive longitudinal pressure gradient. In contrast to the boundary layer problem, however, {{it is not necessary}} that the pressure distribution along the limits of the boundary layer(along the axis of the diffuser) be given, since this distribution can be obtained from the computation. This circumstance, together with the greater simplicity of the problem as a whole, provides a useful basis {{for the study of the}} extension of the results of semiempirical theories to the case of motion with a positive pressure gradient. In the first part of the paper,formulas are derived for the computation of the velocity and. pressure distributions in the {{turbulent flow}} along, and at right angles to, the axis of a <b>diffuser</b> of small <b>cone</b> angle.

40|$|In {{order to}} assist {{in the design of the}} {{aerodynamic}} shape of a closed circuit wind tunnel, which was built at the Institute for Building Science and Technology (IBST) in Vietnam, a flow analysis was conducted using CFD. The analysis was performed to find out the optimum shape for the wind tunnel. Given the limited length of the wind tunnel within the laboratory, combined with other requirements, a concept design was proposed with two rapid turning <b>diffusers,</b> a contraction <b>cone,</b> and an extended test section. This paper presents the CFD study for the contraction cone and extended test section.

40|$|Low head {{machines}} of the Kaplan type {{are composed}} of several components to ensure high efficiency. Downstream the runner, a draft tube ensures pressure recovery of the flow leaving the runner. Modern draft tubes {{are mainly composed of}} a conical diffuser followed by an elbow and a straight <b>diffuser.</b> The runner <b>cone,</b> attached to the runner, is included in the conical diffuser and thus counter-acts the function of the draft tube since adding angular momentum to the fluid. Variation of the runner cone angular velocity may increase draft tube pressure recovery by delaying eventual separation. While previous research focused only on the draft tube flow, this work presents calculations including runner and draft tube in order to point out possible joint effects. The initial calculations with ω*= 1 are validated by comparison of mean and angular resolved axial and tangential velocity with LDA measurements. Two runner cone angular velocities are simulated: ω*=- 1 (counter-rotating) and ω*= 0 (stationary). A significant efficiency increase is obtained for a stationary runner cone.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringMohammad H. HosniMillions {{of people}} travel by {{commercial}} aircraft each year. The close proximity of passengers aboard an airplane leads {{to one of}} the primary reasons that air quality in an aircraft cabin is of interest. In recent years there have been multiple reported instances of people contracting illnesses after being aboard an aircraft {{for an extended period of}} time. In order to better understand air quality in an aircraft cabin, an experimental study of particulate transport in a half cabin model of a Boeing 767 was performed. In the study, both 3 [Mu]m and 10 [Mu]m particles were tested separately by injecting them into the cabin through a vertical tube, 609. 6 mm (24 in) above the floor, at a single location on the centerline of the half cabin test section. Resulting particulate concentrations were measured at five locations along the centerline of the half cabin test section. It was found that for the 3 [Mu]m particles, the normalized concentration was about one for all of the locations except directly above the injection site. Therefore, the concentrations were approximately the same as the well-mixed concentration, where the well-mixed concentration is the concentration in the test cabin if the test cabin is uniformly mixed. For the same test conditions, the normalized concentrations for the 10 [Mu]m particles were well below one, around 0. 1. Several more concentration measurements using the 10 [Mu]m particles were taken at the same five locations, both on and off the centerline, and for different particle injection and cabin pressure conditions. The concentration results using a <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone</b> to inject the 10 [Mu]m particles into the test cabin and a neutral cabin pressure were higher than the results found using the straight injection tube, but they were not very repeatable. After pressurizing the cabin to slightly above ambient pressure and using the <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone,</b> the resulting average normalized particle concentrations along the centerline were found to be between 0. 4 and 1. 5 and repeatable within the estimated measurement uncertainty. Therefore, it appears that the 3 [Mu]m particles follow the airflow in the test cabin well, but it is not clear if the 10 [Mu]m particles do as well...|$|E
40|$|Supplement I to Project Report No. 29; A Diverging Closed-Jet Test Section for a Water TunnelThe {{original}} closed-jet {{test section}} {{designed for use}} in a 36 -in. water tunnel with an air-bubble resorber was cylindrical and 2. 18 diameters long. It was followed by a parabolic transition, 0. 5 diameter long, to the 7 degree <b>diffuser</b> <b>cone.</b> The effect of diverging test section with a longer diffuser transition in decreasing the pressure gradients and, as a result, lowering the cavitation indices attainable is discussed in this report. Tests on a one-sixth scale model and analyses indicate that a test section diverging at a total angle of about 0 degrees 9. 6 ' would be expected to have an essentially constant core pressure throughout the length of the test section. This divergence angle followed by a nearly 1 -diameter transition should result in a test section which can be operated at cavitation indices as low as 0. 025 or 0. 030 at velocities of 84. 5 fps.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method for}} evaluating the stability characteristics and the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} pulsation of ram-jet engines without heat addition is presented herein. Experimental verification of the theoretical results are included where data were available. Theory and experiment show that the pulsation amplitude of a high mass-flow-ratio <b>diffuser</b> having no <b>cone</b> surface flow separation increases with decreasing mass flow. The theoretical trends for changes in amplitude, frequency, and mean-pressure recovery with changes in plenum-chamber volume were experimentally confirmed. For perforated convergent-divergent-type diffusers, a stability hysteresis loop was predicted on the pressure-recovery mass-flow-ratio curve. At a given mean mass-flow ratio, the higher. value of mean pressure recovery corresponded to oscillatory flow in the diffuser while the lower branch was stable. This hysteresis has been observed experimentally. The theory indicates that for a ram-jet engine of given diameter, the amplitude of pulsation of a supersonic diffuser is increased by decreasing the relative size of the plenum chamber with respect to the diffuser volume down to a critical value at which oscillations cease. In the region of these critical values, the stable mass-flow range of the diffuser may be increased either by decreasing the combustion chamber volume or by increasing the length of the diffuser...|$|R
40|$|Low head {{machines}} of type Kaplan {{are composed}} of several elements to ensure a large efficiency. The flow enters a spiral casing and is distributed to an axial runner through stay and guide vanes. Downstream the runner, a draft tube is essential to ensure high efficiency by increasing the cross-section. Modern draft tubes {{are mainly composed of}} a conical diffuser followed by an elbow and a straight <b>diffuser.</b> The runner <b>cone,</b> attached to the runner, is included in the conical diffuser. By a gradual area increase it allows strong pressure recovery, so flow separation may occur. Furthermore, the runner cone rotates and thus counteracts the function of the draft tube. An ongoing work focuses on the flow around the runner cone by means of CFD and experiments with special interest on the boundary layer. The objectives are to quantify the effects of the runner cone on the draft tube large scale flow. Special attention will be given to runner cone angular velocity and swirl intensity. Preliminary, calculations on a Kaplan model test case at different operating points will give an overview over boundary layer thicknesses and separations points. Different meshes will be combined for the time dependent calculations, which include the runner and the draft tube. Godkänd; 2011; 20111010 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{uniformity}} of fluid flow distribution in microreactors, a header configuration {{consisting of a}} <b>cone</b> <b>diffuser</b> connected to a thick-walled screen has been proposed. The thick-walled screen consists of two sections: the upstream section constitutes a set of elongated parallel upstream channels and the downstream section constitutes a set of elongated parallel downstream channels positioned at an angle of 90 ° {{with respect to the}} upstream channels. In this approach the problem of flow equalization reduces to that of flow equalization in the first and second downstream channels of the thick-walled screen. In turn, this requires flow equalization in the corresponding cross sections of the upstream channels. The computational fluid dynamics analysis of the fluid flow maldistribution shows that eight parallel upstream channels with a width of 300 - 600 m are required per 1 cm of length for flow equalization. The length to width ratio of these channels has to be 2 ̆ 6 gt; 15. The numerical results suggest that the proposed header configuration can effectively improve the performance of the downstream microstructured devices, decreasing the ratio of the maximum flow velocity to the mean flow velocity from 2 to 1. 005 {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers (0. 5 - 10) ...|$|R
40|$|Past {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} {{research has shown}} that the draft tube inlet velocity is critically important to hydropower plant performance, {{especially in the case of}} low-head installations. However, less is known about the influence of flow parameters on turbine performance particularly swirl distribution. Based on the influence of draft tube flow characteristics on the overall performance of a low-head turbine, this research proposes a methodology for optimizing draft tube inlet velocity profiles as a new approach to con-trolling the flow conditions in order to yield better draft tube and turbine performance. Numerical optimization methods have been used successfully for a variety of design prob-lems. However, addressing the optimization of boundary conditions in hydraulic turbines poses a new challenge. In this paper, three different vortex equations for representing the inlet velocity profile are applied to a <b>cone</b> <b>diffuser,</b> and the behavior of the objective func-tion is analyzed. As well, the influence of the quantitative correlation between the swirl-ing flow at the cone inlet and the analytical blade shape, flow rate, and swirl number using the best inlet velocity profiles is evaluated. We also include a discussion on the development of a flow structure caused by the inlet swirl parameters. Finally, we present an analysis of the influence of flow rate and swirl number on the behavior of the optimiza-tion process. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4029837]...|$|R

A set of experiments were carried out to study the effect of some parameters {{on the performance of}} the suggested jet pump. These parameters such as: area ratio (four different area ratios of 0. 16, 0. 22, 0. 26 and 0. 3 were used), driving nozzle outlet diameter to mixing chamber diameter ratios (four ratios were tested with values of 1, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5). Also, two suction inlet configuration were selected (one with cylindrical inlet part, and the another with conical inlet part) and two vertical level positions for jet pump at 10 and 30 mm from sand bed were studied. In addition, the experimental study also includes the performance of the slurry jet pump in two cases (stationary and movable), for the movable case, two speeds for jet pump of 0. 7 and 0. 35 m/min were tested. One type of quartz sand was used with 0. 52 mm mean particle size diameter and with a specific gravity of 2. 65.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringM. H. HosniZ. C. ZhengIn {{order to}} study the {{capability}} of computational methods in investigating the mechanisms associated with disease and contaminants transmission in aircraft cabins, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are used for the simulation of turbulent airflow, tracer gas diffusion, and particle dispersion in a generic aircraft cabin mockup. The CFD models are validated through comparisons of the CFD predictions with the corresponding experimental measurements. It is found that using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with the Werner-Wengle wall function, one can predict unsteady airflow velocity field with relatively high accuracy. However in the middle region of the cabin mockup, where the recirculation of airflow takes place, the accuracy {{is not as good}} as that in other locations. By examining different k-ε models, the current study recommends the use of the RNG k-ε model with the non-equilibrium wall function as a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model for predicting the steady-state airflow velocity data. It is also found that changing the cabin air-inlet nozzle height has a significant effect on the flow behavior in the middle and upper part of the cabin, while the flow pattern in the lower part is not affected as much. Through the use of LES and species transport model in simulating tracer gas diffusion, very good agreement between predicted and measured tracer gas concentration data is observed for some monitoring locations, but the agreement level is not uniform for all the sampling point locations. The reasons for the deviations between predictions and measurements for those locations are discussed. The Lagrange-Euler approach is invoked in the particle dispersion simulations. In this approach, the equation of motion for the discrete phase is coupled with the continuous phase governing equations through the calculation of drag and buoyancy forces acting on particles. The continuous phase flow is turbulent and RANS is employed in order to calculate the continuous phase velocity field. A complete study on grid dependence for RANS simulation is performed through a controllable regional mesh refinement scheme. The grid dependence study shows that using unstructured grid with tetrahedral and hybrid elements in the refinement region are more efficient than using structured grid with hexahedral elements. The effect of turbulence on the particle dispersion is taken into account by using a stochastic tracking method (Discrete Random Walk model). One of the significant features of this study is the investigation of the effect of the number of tries on the accuracy of particle concentration predictions when Discrete Random Walk is used to model turbulent distribution of particles. Subsequently, the optimum number of tries to obtain the most accurate predictions is determined. In accordance with the corresponding experimental data, the effect of particle size on particle distribution is also studied and discussed through the simulation of two different sizes of mono-disperse particles in the cabin with straight injection tube, i. e., 3 µm and 10 µm. Due to the low particle loading, neglecting the effect of particles motion on the continuous phase flow-field seems to be a reasonable, simplifying assumption in running the simulations. However, this assumption is verified through the comparison of the results from 1 -way and 2 -way coupling simulations. Eventually through the simulations for the particle injection using the <b>cone</b> <b>diffuser,</b> the effects of cabin pressure gradient as well as the particle density on particles dispersion behavior are studied and discussed. In the last part of this dissertation, the turbulent airflow in a full-scale Boeing 767 aircraft cabin mockup with eleven rows of seats and manikins is simulated using steady RANS method. The results of this simulation cannot only be used {{to study the}} airflow pattern, but also can be used as the initial condition for running the tracer gas diffusion and particle dispersion simulations in this cabin mockup...|$|R
