25|$|On October 16, 2002, an {{international}} {{team led by}} Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics reported the observation of {{the motion of the}} star S2 near Sagittarius A* over a period of ten years. According to the team's analysis, the data ruled out the possibility that Sgr A* contains a cluster of dark stellar objects or a mass of degenerate fermions, strengthening the evidence for a massive black hole. The observations of S2 used near-infra red (NIR) interferometry (in the <b>K-band,</b> i.e. 2.2 μm) because of reduced interstellar extinction in this band. SiO masers were used to align NIR images with radio observations, as they can be observed in both NIR and radio bands. The rapid motion of S2 (and other nearby stars) easily stood out against slower-moving stars along the line-of-sight so these could be subtracted from the images.|$|E

25|$|As GD 165B is the {{prototype}} of the L dwarfs, Gliese 229B is {{the prototype}} of a second new spectral class, the T dwarfs. Whereas near-infrared (NIR) spectra of L dwarfs show strong absorption bands of H2O and carbon monoxide (CO), the NIR spectrum of Gliese 229B is dominated by absorption bands from methane (CH4), features that were only found in the giant planets of the Solar System and Titan. CH4, H2O, and molecular hydrogen (H2) collision-induced absorption (CIA) give Gliese 229B blue near-infrared colors. Its steeply sloped red optical spectrum also lacks the FeH and CrH bands that characterize L dwarfs and instead is influenced by exceptionally broad absorption features from the alkali metals Na and K. These differences led Kirkpatrick to propose the T spectral class for objects exhibiting H- and <b>K-band</b> CH4 absorption. , 355 Tdwarfs are known. NIR classification schemes for T dwarfs have recently been developed by Adam Burgasser and Tom Geballe. Theory suggests that L dwarfs are a mixture of very-low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs), whereas the T dwarf class is composed entirely of brown dwarfs. Because of the absorption of sodium and potassium in the green part of the spectrum of T dwarfs, the actual appearance of T dwarfs to human visual perception {{is estimated to be}} not brown, but the color of magenta coal tar dye. T-class brown dwarfs, such as WISE 0316+4307, have been detected over 100 light-years from the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{test the}} {{possible}} {{usefulness of the}} pseudo SU(3) coupling scheme a few nuclear properties are examined which {{can be expected to}} be governed largely by the (lg$d~ 2 d+ 3 s+) part of the proton configuration for odd- 2 nuclei and the (lh 2 fs 2 f* 3 p+ 3 p+) part of the neutron configuration for odd-N nuclei. The equivalence between these configurations and pseudo oscillator shells (?$&&) and (~$$$+) is exploited to show that the low-lying natural-parity rotational bands in deformed nuclei can be described approximately by many-particle states which are coupled to leading pseudo SU(3) representation (maximum possible value of 2 i+;) of these configurations. The simple model in which the natural-parity part of the proton and neutron configurations are coupled to leading pseudo SU(3) representation predicts ground state magnetic moments in remarkably good agreement with experiment. The strong hindrance factors observed in certain interband Ml transition probabilities are, however, not predicted by this model. The diagonalization of a simple effective interaction within the leading pseudo SU(3) representation leads to spectra with the experimentally observed ordering of the <b>K-bands.</b> (The case of the Eu and Tm isotopes has been examined in some detail since these are expected to have leading pseudo SU(3) representations with the same quantum numbers (&) but with quite different ordering of the <b>K-bands.)</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Context. The {{transition}} between massive Class II circumstellar disks and Class III debris disks, with dust residuals, {{has not yet}} been clearly understood. Disks are expected to dissipate with time, and dust clearing in the inner regions can be the consequence of several mechanisms. Planetary formation is one of them that will possibly open a gap inside the disk. Aims. According to recent models based on photometric observations, T[*]Cha is expected to present a large gap within its disk, meaning that an inner dusty disk is supposed to have survived close to the star. We investigate this scenario with new near-infrared interferometric observations. Methods. We observed T[*]Cha in the H and K bands using the AMBER instrument at VLTI and used the MCFOST radiative transfer code to model the SED of T[*]Cha and the interferometric observations simultaneously and to test the scenario of an inner dusty structure. We also used a toy model of a binary to check that a companion close to the star can reproduce our observations. Results. The scenario of a close (few mas) companion cannot satisfactorily reproduce the visibilities and SED, while a disk model with a large gap and an inner ring producing the bulk of the emission (in H and <b>K-bands)</b> close to 0. 1 AU is able to account for all the observations. Conclusions. With this study, the presence of an optically thick inner dusty disk close to the star and dominating the H and <b>K-bands</b> emission is confirmed. According to our model, the large gap extends up to 7. 5 AU. This points toward a companion (located at several AU) gap-opening scenario to explain the morphology of T[*]Cha...|$|R

Speckle interferometry in the H- and <b>K-bands</b> and an optical spectrum in the range 5200 [...] 6680 Å with a spectral resolving power of R = 60 000 were obtained at the 6 -m telescope of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Low-resolution spectra in the ranges 0. 46 [...] 1. 4 μm and 1. 4 [...] 2. 5 μm with R ∼ 800 and ∼ 700, respectively, were obtained at the 3 -m Shane telescope of the Lick Observatory.
