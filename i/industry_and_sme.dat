40|$|The {{study focused}} on {{identifying}} {{ways in which the}} delivery of the building infrastructure projects that are executed by SME contractors can be improved. TQM, which has been widely used in other sectors with great success, has been explored as the tool {{that can be used to}} improve the delivery of building projects. The literature review that was conducted focused on the entire spectrum of the project cycle. It first addressed the functioning of the public sector and the legislative mandate of the DPW. Then it addressed the construction <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SME</b> contractors that are working in the built environment. TQM together with its elements were explored in detail to determine its applicability in terms of the delivery of building projects. The empirical study was undertaken to test the outcomes of the literature review in the context of the built environment. A quantitative research method was adopted for the study which achieved a response rate of 44 percent. Descriptive statistics were computed during the analysis of the data with the mode being used as the main measuring tool. The findings revealed that there was an uneven distribution of human capital in the industry and the consulting firms were the biggest benefactors of this. The study also revealed a high turnover rate in the SME contractors while the public sector has the oldest employees. Architects and construction managers were found to be the least represented profession. There was also a high concentration of role players in the Amathole Region. The recommendations were four fold and the Department of Public Works (DPW) as client body had to take the centre stage in implementing such recommendations. The recommendations are meant to address: the development of technical people to enhance their capacity, the reduction of the high turnover rate of technical people, the uneven distribution of resources, and specifying of the roles and responsibilities of all the people that are involved in building infrastructure project...|$|E
40|$|Our goal: stimulate working {{towards a}} {{sustainable}} {{management of the}} Belgian coast. To achieve this goal, common future perspectives, operating the development and sustaining the formulation of the long-term strategic objectives, are needed. The development {{of a set of}} indicators is one way to control and to support such a complex matter as sustainable coastal management. An indicator is a measure (data/number/value/…) used to describe important phenomena as well as to reflect the actual state in a well-defined policy area. A well balanced set of indicators, in which each indicator is evaluated on a regular basis, will map out the evolution towards (or away from) sustainability. A set of indicators is a management tool which will help policy makers to take the right decisions and to communicate {{about the state of the}} art of the coast. In a preliminary study (Centrum voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling, CDO, Ghent University, 2001) a future vision for the Belgian coast was proposed. This vision was developed in close co-operation with civil servants both from provincial and Flemish administrations. In the future vision document six equivalent priorities for sustainable development of the coastal zone were put forward: improving the quality of living and housing environment, preserving and strengthening of the socio-cultural capital, improving the environment and nature, strengthening of the economical texture, supporting tourism and recreation, carrying out governance renewal. Starting from an extensive list of possible indicators for the Belgian coast, an interactive approach was used to deduce a smaller set of indicators which can be used as 'signboard', but also as a directive for the management priorities, a communication tool as well as a basis on which efforts for data collection can be centred on. The extensive list was the object of critical analysis by civil servants and representatives of coastal actors gathered in two workshops (7 June 2002 and 20 January 2003). The results of these workshops were decisive for the final set of indicators. In order to define the indicators, the following policy domains were studied: quality of life, quality of environment, tourism and recreation, quality of work, transport and ports, nature development and management, cultural heritage and immaterial capital, <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SME,</b> use of live resources, institutional organisation and management, social attention. Through this study, indicators able to translate the future perspectives into manageable numerical data were sought for each particular domain. The participants drew up a list of 50 indicators that, in their opinion, can be used to observe in an efficient way the future perspective of the coastal zone. For the top 20 - the 20 most representative - exhaustive filing cards have been set up and data, where possible over several years, have been gathered. These data are now freely available on the website: www. vliz. be/projects/indicatoren. The set of indicators proposed here is by no means final. A barometer being constantly in motion, its regular use will lead to optimise this policy instrument...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Enhancing {{measurement}} of innovation related expenditure in non manufacturing industries. Originality: Expanding an econometric model to measure technological innovation {{on a business}} level. Key literature / theoretical perspective: This paper calls attention to the ways innovation has traditionally been measured in various <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> different business sizes. To date, technological innovation measurements generally apply to the manufacturing industry and/or businesses with a strong Research and Development (R&D) component, which are typically large businesses. Design/methodology/approach: In order to measure innovation in other <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> in order to extend the innovation measurement in Small <b>and</b> Medium Enterprises (<b>SME),</b> we propose an enhanced version of the used Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM) structural economic model. We used the Australian Businesses Innovation Survey (IABS) 2003, which comprises a weighted sample of more than 4500 businesses. Findings: Innovation Related Expenditure makes a positive and significant contribution to technological innovation. We argue that our {{modified version of the}} CDM model provides a more accurate picture of innovation efforts in non-manufacturing <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs</b> that do not have a strong R&D focus. Practical and Social implications: Our findings may enable policy makers to better allocate funding and resources to enhance productivity in <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> businesses not traditionally associated with innovation. 2 page(s...|$|R

The NU-AGE rationale is that a one year Mediterranean whole diet (considered by UNESCO a heritage of humanity), newly designed to meet the nutritional needs of the elderly, will reduce inflammaging in fully characterized subjects aged 65 - 79 years of age, and will have systemic beneficial effects on health status (physical and cognitive). Before and after the dietary intervention a comprehensive set of analyses, including omics (transcriptomics, epigenetics, metabolomics and metagenomics) will be performed to identify the underpinning molecular mechanisms.

In order to take such a role, the Institute needs new products to bridge the gap between sovereign and market-oriented services and to aid the assessment of the patentability of inventions; it also needs a new information infrastructure with external partners, leading to more intensive use of property rights systems and the information they contain, particularly in universities and colleges but also in industry.
