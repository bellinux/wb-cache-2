40|$|The {{absorption}} spectrum of iodine dioxide (OIO), obtained at high resolution between 540 and 605 nm by cavity ring-down spectroscopy, exhibits {{no evidence of}} coarse rotational structure. Furthermore, a laser induced fluorescence spectrum was not observed when pumping the molecule in this region of the visible spectrum. Ab initio quantum calculations were performed {{on the ground and}} first excited states of OIO. The rotational envelopes of the observed absorption bands are very satisfactorily simulated if the lifetime of the excited state is 200 ± 50 fs, indicating prompt predissociation. Quantum calculations indicate photolysis to I + O 2, rather than O + IO. The estimated photodissociation rate of OIO in daylight ranges from 0. 36 to 2. 2 s- 1, depending on the choice of absolute cross-section, which explains why OIO has only been observed in the atmosphere after sunset.

40|$|When one is {{to develop}} program {{families}} traditional programming methods which are intended {{for the development of}} a single program are not appropriate. There are several different approaches available. For example the Draco approach in [18] and the product line engineering process described in [23]. Here we will focus on the FAST process developed at Lucent [24] because it is a reasonably systematic process for engineering families that has been used at Lucent Technologies for years and has proven successful. Lucent/Bell Labs have had success in reducing programming costs and speeding up development times by using the FAST process. In the FAST process, after identifying the commonalities and parameters of variation in family of programs, a special purpose programming language is developed. This language is suitable for writing members of the family. The common features of the family are already built-in; only the differences need to be programmed. McMaster University's Software Engineering Research Group (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) is developing a set of tools to support the use of a broad class of tabular expressions (TTS). Using tabular expressions one may present complex conditional expression in a way that is more easily read, analyzed, and more likely to be correct than either conventional mathematics or conventional programs. In this work I propose to combine these two technologies. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> the FAST process using tabular notation and table-based tools. The results of the commonality analysis of the FAST process, as developed at Lucent, will be used to develop a set of incomplete tabular expressions.

40|$|I {{attended}} m-library 2009 {{conference on}} Jun 23 - 24, 2009 in Vancouver. I participated in two pre-conference workshops and made presentations as well. I made another presentation in session 13 {{of the conference}} with my colleagues. In the pre-conference workshops, I presented “Mobile-friendly Knowledge Management System” (MKMS) which I developed for the conference. The workshop “Mobile Design: Interactive Multimedia to Support Learning and Teaching” includes a hands-on session to allow audiences to practice MKMS on desktop PCs and mobile phones. I received positive response from the audiences, such as the system is mobile-friendly, easy to use, and flexible, etc. They also suggested adding some functionality to the system, e. g. improving user input interface and adding authentication module. In the session 13 held on Jun 24, I, along with Colin E and Guangbing Yang, presented “Create Mobile Content Using a Mobile-friendly Knowledge Management System: The Athabasca University Experience”. I gave more detailed information on MKMS. I think my presentation was pretty successful since most of audiences expressed interest in MKMS and they gave us comments on it as well. In the future, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> the MKMS by adding functionality as follows: •	Authentication and authorization modules •	Quiz module (at least it can handle multiple-choice questions) •	Searchable •	OAI-compatible In general, people have interest in moving educational resources onto mobile devices. I will carry out research on mobile devices {{and find out how}} to make existing system available for mobile devices. 1. Aim of the workshop: The Athabasca University Library has developed many mobile friendly websites and features to help our students access resources. These include an autodetect feature which displays either mobile or desktop content {{depending on the type of}} device; a mobile-friendly Digital Reading Room (DRR) for students to access their course readings, and mobile language websites including ESL grammar, workplace English, and accent reduction. In this workshop we will introduce participants to the mobile technologies that we have adapted and developed, model and explain best practices for mobile multimedia content creation, and have participants create digital content for mobile phones using the iPhone and our mobile knowledge management system. Objectives of the workshop: * Introduce participants to AU’s innovative mobile technologies * Showcase multimedia mobile learning * Hands-on creation of mobile content including interactive exercises 2. Digital library services delivered through mobile devices can offer flexibility in terms of access and content, increased hands-on experience, and enhanced information and mobile literacy skills of learners. Athabasca University (AU) library is pioneering the development of a mobile- friendly digital library (M-library) including the mobile-friendly Digital Reading Room (DRR), Digital Thesis and Project Room (DTPR), Digital Reference Centre (DRC), and AirPAC. The M-library system can auto-detect users’ devices and accommodate both desktop and mobile access to AU library services and resources. This presentation demonstrates the system design, implementation, and evaluation of the M-library system. It provides examples of how AU has applied mobile learning and mobile technology to support and enhance delivery of library services and learning resources, and offers lessons learned to others in the practice. The AU Mobile library project was the recipient of the 2006 Canadian Library Association Library Research and Development Grant for its innovative approach to connecting users and libraries...|$|E

40|$|Similar to {{progressive}} political movements, {{the programs}} of many religious and spiritual groups today are converging around a shared commitment {{to address the}} impending global ecological crisis. The paper explores this convergence {{by looking at the}} impact of environmentalist thought on religious discourses in modern Indonesia, the author’s primary research area, and comparing the findings to similar trends elsewhere. The research shows that the environmental movement is causing a transformation in how people understand the character and practical relevance of religion and spirituality today, in Indonesia and beyond. For some eco-spiritual groups, a heightened environmental awareness has become the central tenet of their monistic religious cosmology. The more significant phenomenon, however, is a socially much broader shift toward more science-friendly and contemporary religious cosmologies within the mainstream of major world religions. Islam and Christianity now officially accept that other forms of life have a right to exist and that humanity has a custodial obligation to protect nature. This new outlook rectifies the previous tendency within dualist religions to view nature as vastly inferior and servile to human interests. It simultaneously is a rejection of materialist-scientific cosmologies widely prevalent in late modern consumer societies, which deny any notion of the sacred. This trend in the world’s religions toward a re-evaluation of the cosmological status of humanity in relation to nature and the sacred, <b>I</b> argue, <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> the prospects of the global environmental movement’s campaign for environmental sustainability...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I want {{to analyze}} what this movie means or can mean. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> {{do this by}} {{focusing}} on the main characters, which are Django and Dr. King Schultz. I want to search beyond the easily spotted aspects of the characters and find deeper layers in them. In other words, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> analyze how we, as audience, can read the characters of Django and Dr. King Schultz. This is the research question of the dissertation and answering it <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> our knowledge about what this movie means or can mean. The story of the movie is, according to the Internet Movie Database, that “with the help of a German bounty hunter, a freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner”. But I believe there is more to this movie than this simple mission. In the first chapter <b>I</b> <b>will</b> analyze the theme of revenge. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> search for the motives behind Django’s revenge and draw a comparison between his actions and actual slave revolts. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also discuss the possibility of this movie being a counter-narrative on dominant US discourse. In the second chapter, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> focus on the theme of abolitionism, which in the US was a movement to end the institution of slavery. Here <b>I</b> <b>will</b> discuss if Django and Schultz can be read as abolitionists. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also draw a comparison between Schultz and historical abolitionist John Brown. In both chapters <b>I</b> <b>will</b> discuss several scenes of Django Unchained.

40|$|Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating {{polypeptide}} (PACAP), a neuropeptide {{belonging to}} the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) /secretion/glucagon family of peptides, interacts with a distinct high-affinity receptor (type I receptor) {{on a number of}} tissues. These PACAP type I receptors have a high affinity for PACAP and a low affinity for VIP and are present in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, where they regulate the release of adrenocorticotropin, luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin, and in the adrenal medulla, where they regulate the release of epinephrine. Type I PACAP receptors are also present in high concentrations in testicular germ cells, where they may regulate spermatogenesis, and some transformed cell lines, such as the rat pancreatic acinar carcinoma cell AR 4 - 2 J. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional expression of the PACAP type I receptor isolated from an AR 4 - 2 J cell cDNA library by cross-hybridization screening with a rat VIP receptor cDNA. The cDNA sequence encodes a unique 495 -amino acid protein with seven transmembrane domains characteristic of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors. A high degree of sequence homology with the VIP, secretin, glucagon-like peptide 1, parathyroid, and calcitonin receptors suggests its membership in this subfamily of Gs-coupled receptors. Results of binding studies and stimulation of cellular cAMP accumulation in COS- 7 cells transfected with this cDNA are characteristic of a PACAP type I receptor. Cloning of the PACAP type <b>I</b> receptor <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> our understanding of its distribution, structure, and functional properties and ultimately increase our understanding of its physiological role...|$|R

40|$|Improving {{income in}} museums {{around the world}} is vitally {{important}} and New Zealand museums are no exception. There is little literature in Museum Studies offering practical strategies for fundraising, with much research focusing on the morality of revenue sources rather than best practice. Research in other disciplines on museum revenue has been problematic as the theories it has attempted to apply are not always applicable. There has also been little research on the local dynamics of revenue generation, and there is therefore an urgent need for practice based research on this topic, such as data for comparative analysis of revenue sources. 	 Responding to gaps in the current literature this thesis analysed innovative and nontraditional revenue generation in three Wellington museums. Innovative and nontraditional revenue encompasses programs, partnering, fundraising, museum-operated businesses, venue hire, museum and third-party websites, phone applications for smartphones, crowdsourcing and e-commerce. Pragmatism provides the research paradigm for this empirical study into current professional practice. The paradigm was enhanced by several concepts including Hansen and Birkinshaw’s, Innovation Value Chain. To examine the local museum situation, data was gathered from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa; the New Zealand Cricket Museum; and Pātaka Art + Museum. Semi-structured interviews with key staff and revenue records were analysed following qualitative and quantitative methods. There were several key findings which highlighted the direct and indirect benefits of innovative and nontraditional revenue. External partnerships, museum staff and volunteers were highlighted as crucial for revenue viability. Ethics and perceptions of revenue also affected revenue generation. Overall the research enhances our knowledge of museum economics in the New Zealand context. I argue that commercial operations need to be integrated into museum practice and that the benefits of this approach should be demonstrated to all staff. Finally, several recommendations are made which <b>I</b> believe <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> the future practice of revenue generation in New Zealand museums...|$|R

I argue that minor deviance, rooted in the party-subculture, <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> social and networking skills that will be beneficial in adulthood. College attainment, serving as a social control, is expected to moderate the effects of deviance, benefiting party-subculture youth. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health dataset, findings suggest that adolescents engaging in minor deviance are more extroverted in adulthood, with little difference in earnings when compared to party-subculture abstainers. However, adolescent deviants continue substance use and deviance into adulthood significantly more than party-subculture abstainers...|$|R
