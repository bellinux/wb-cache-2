5|$|Regular {{hand washing}} {{appears to be}} {{effective}} in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of <b>face</b> <b>masks.</b> No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) was recently introduced in general anesthesia {{as an alternative}} to the <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation for airway maintenance. &# 13; Methods. The effects of LMA insertion, <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation on homodynamic status were studied in 195 normotensive patients who underwent elective transurethral lithotripsy (TUL). The patients were monitored with blood pressure measurement and pulse oximetry. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, succynilcholine and fentanyl and maintained with halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. &# 13; Findings. The heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure increased after LMA insertion. <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation, compared with baseline (P< 0. 05). The hemodynamic changes were significantly greater after tracheal intubation and <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> than after LMA insertion (P< 0. 05). &# 13; Conclusion. We conclude that insertion of LMA is associated with less hemodynamic disturbances than <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation in normotensive patients undergoing elective operations...|$|R
30|$|After <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> distraction, as the {{mandible}} was growing, {{we needed}} more maxillary space for ideal occlusion and maxillomandibular relation. So, we pioneerly applied miniplate as a skeletal anchorage for maxillary protraction [14, 15]. Seven-holed curved miniplates successfully transferred the protraction {{force to the}} maxilla. But, <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> protraction lacked exact vector control and finally dentoalveolar compensation developed. Also, protraction <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> and miniplate anchorage seemed to be weak to overcome the tensile force from palatal scar in this particular case.|$|R
5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the kermes insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, {{with the help of the}} architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of textile industry in Indonesia can potentially increase some occupational diseases that caused by waste products. One of those waste products from textile industry is cotton dust, {{which can cause}} byssinosis. There {{are several ways to}} reduce cotton dust exposure, such as using <b>face</b> <b>mask.</b> This research aim to describe the relationship between employee's knowledge  about byssinosis with <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> utilization in spinning department of a textile factory. This research is a descriptive study with cross sectional approach. The subjects of this research are employees working on Spinning Department. Data gathered using questionnaire about byssinosis and the habit of using <b>face</b> <b>mask.</b> The result of this research shows that 52 (78. 79 %) of 66 respondents have excellent knowledge about byssinosis, meanwhile the other 14 (21. 21 %) show just enough knowledge. Almost all wear a <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> during working hour (92. 42 %). The result of chi square method shows that the relation between employee's knowledge about byssinosis and <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> utilization is really weak (p= 0, 001, contingency coefficient = 0, 381). The result of this research indicates that besides knowledge of byssinosis, there are other factors that can affect <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> utilization.   Key word: Byssinosis, knowledge, face-mask...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Over 2 {{millions}} people congregate in Mecca {{every year}} to perform Hajj. Pilgrims are exposed to air-borne transmitted disease during this overcrowding period. Several measures have been practiced to reduce the spread of disease particularly the respiratory tract related infection. One of the preventive measures is by using <b>face</b> <b>mask.</b> Nevertheless, the use of <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> among pilgrims is shown to be only partially effective. This is attributed to the knowledge on the air borne transmitted disease, attitude towards wearing, technique of application, {{and to some extent}} the design of the <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> itself...|$|R
40|$|Context: Most {{research}} on <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> removal has been performed on unused equipment. Objective: To identify and compare {{factors that influence}} the condition of helmet components {{and their relationship to}} <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> removal. Design: A cross-sectional, retrospective study. Setting: Five athletic equipment reconditioning/recertification facilities. Participants: 2584 helmets from 46 high school football teams representing S geographic regions. Intervention(s) : Helmet characteristics (brand, model, hardware components) were recorded. Helmets were mounted and <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> removal was attempted using a cordless screwdriver. The 2004 season profiles and weather histories were obtained for each high school. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Success and failure (including reason) for removal of 4 screws from the <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> were noted. Failure rates among regions, teams, reconditioning year, and screw color (type) were compared. Weather histories were compared. We conducted a discriminant analysis to determine if weather variables, region, helmet brand and model, reconditioning year, and screw color could predict successful <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> removal. Metallurgic analysis of screw samples was performed. Results: All screws were successfully removed from 2165 (84...|$|R

25|$|A {{full face}} mask is lighter and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most full <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The {{full face mask}} does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for full <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a full face mask under water without assistance, so this is more an inconvenience than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|E
