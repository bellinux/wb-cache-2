While harnessing {{the lowest}} levels by means of vectorization and instruction scheduling only requires local information about the code {{and one of the}} cores, coarser levels raise interdependent trade-offs which necessitate a global approach. This paper introduces Gomet: an extension to GCC which combines a hierarchical intermediate representation of the input program and a highlevel machine description to achieve multi-grain parallelism adaptation. <b>Gomet</b> builds this representation from an inter-procedural dependence analysis, and transforms it to fit the target hardware. Then, it generates specialized C source files to feed the native compiler of each core of the target. Early evaluation of <b>Gomet</b> with simple programs show encouraging results and motivate further developments. ...|$|E

That theater merged with the Petrograd Marionette Theatre and was later renamed the Leningrad Puppet Theatre. In 1929, the Children’s Theatre Book opened and in 1931, the Bolshoi Puppet Theatre opened in Leningrad. By the 1930s, state {{regulations}} required that all performances, i.e. circuses, variety shows, music performances and puppet theaters be controlled by <b>GOMETs,</b> the State Department created specifically for their regulation. One of the measures <b>GOMETs</b> put in place was that performances must be held in established theater venues and {{could no longer be}} itinerant street performances. Sergey Obraztsov gave his first solo performance as a puppeteer in 1923, but worked mainly as a stage actor until 1931, when he was approached by the managers of the Central Children’s Art Studio to form a puppet theater. Becoming the art director of the Central State Puppet Theatre, Obraztsov staged parody-plays with themes geared toward both adults and children. He performed with both glove puppets and marionettes, traveling in and around Moscow until 1938, when he established his own theater. After his theater was bombed during the war, he relocated to Novosibirsk until the war ended. Obraztsov characters evoked a realistic expression and performed both classic folk tales and sophisticated literary works.|$|R
