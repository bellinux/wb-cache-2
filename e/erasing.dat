Mystique stops Magneto from killing Nixon, but goes to murder Trask. Xavier persuades her to spare Trask, altering history and <b>erasing</b> the Sentinels from existence. Magneto and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero. Trask is put behind bars for attempting to sell U.S military secrets to Vietnamese officials.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Natalya meet Wade in the Florida Keys and borrow {{his plane}} {{for the trip}} to Cuba, where the same night, they make love. The next day, while searching for GoldenEye's {{satellite}} dish, they are shot down. Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before <b>erasing</b> all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (Misha), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.|$|E

5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of <b>erasing</b> her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E

5|$|Lynemouth's future came further {{under threat}} in March 2011, {{following}} carbon cutting measures {{announced in the}} 2011 United Kingdom budget. The government's plans meant that the station would cost an extra £40million a year, <b>erasing</b> Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This has made the station's operators consider the option of converting the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself would cost 400 million euros million and then using biomass instead of coal would cost an additional £170million a year.|$|E

5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with <b>erasing</b> the humiliation of the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.|$|E
5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, <b>erasing</b> the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in the first year and $500,000 in the second).

5|$|World WarII (often {{abbreviated}} to WWII or WW2), {{also known as}} the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved {{the vast majority of the}} world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, <b>erasing</b> the distinction between civilian and military resources.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Manila's prewar and Spanish colonial {{architecture}} {{were destroyed}} during its battle for liberation by the intensive bombardment of the United States Air Force during World War II. Reconstruction took place afterwards, replacing the destroyed historic Spanish-era buildings with modern ones, <b>erasing</b> {{much of the}} city's character. Some buildings destroyed by the war have been reconstructed, such as the Old Legislative Building (now the National Museum of Fine Arts), Ayuntamiento de Manila (now the Bureau of the Treasury) and the currently under construction San Ignacio Church and Convent (as the Museo de Intramuros). There are plans to rehabilitate and/or restore several neglected historic buildings and places such as Plaza Del Carmen, San Sebastian Church and the Manila Metropolitan Theater. Spanish-era shops and houses in the districts of Binondo, Quiapo, and San Nicolas are also planned to be restored, {{as a part of}} a movement to restore the city to its former glory and its beautiful prewar state.|$|E
5|$|The Engineering Department had no {{mandate to}} archive the {{programme}} videotapes they held, although typically {{they would not}} be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes. The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial The Highlanders, which were erased on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further <b>erasing</b> and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master videotape of the programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were those for the 1968 serial Fury from the Deep, in late 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Twins {{finally won}} the American League pennant during the 1965 season.

Elected to play first base on his fifth All-Star team, Killebrew became the first player in All-Star game history to be elected at three different positions, having previously been selected to play third base (1959 and 1961) and left field (1963 and 1964).|$|E

50|$|The {{programming}} {{process is}} not electrically reversible. To <b>erase</b> the data stored in the array of transistors, ultraviolet light is directed onto the die. Photons of the UV light cause ionization within the silicon oxide, which allow the stored charge on the floating gate to dissipate. Since the whole memory array is exposed, all the memory is <b>erased</b> at the same time. The process takes several minutes for UV lamps of convenient sizes; sunlight would <b>erase</b> a chip in weeks, and indoor fluorescent lighting over several years. Generally, the EPROMs must be removed from equipment to be <b>erased,</b> since it is not usually practical to build in a UV lamp to <b>erase</b> parts in-circuit. The Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) was developed to provide an electrical <b>erase</b> function and has now mostly displaced ultraviolet-erased parts.|$|R
