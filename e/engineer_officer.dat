Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot {{were made in}} 1890–1891. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government {{to take steps to}} safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an art historian, Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army <b>engineer</b> <b>officer,</b> and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.|$|E
5|$|In August 1907, MacArthur {{was sent}} to the {{engineer}} district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to Fort Leavenworth, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion adjutant in 1909 and then <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at San Antonio, Texas, with the Maneuver Division in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to care for their mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near Johns Hopkins Hospital. Army Chief of Staff, Major General Leonard Wood, took up the matter with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Sturdee {{embarked}} for Australia on 16 November 1918, and his AIF {{appointment was}} terminated on 14 March 1919. He {{was entitled to}} his AIF rank of lieutenant colonel as an honorary rank, but his substantive rank was still only that of a captain. He was given the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920, but this did not become substantive until 1 April 1932. Sturdee initially served as Senior <b>Engineer</b> <b>Officer</b> {{on the staff of}} the 3rd Military District at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne. In 1921, he attended the Staff College at Quetta in British India. He was an instructor in military engineering and surveying at the Royal Military College, Duntroon from 16 February to 31 December 1924, before returning to Melbourne to serve {{on the staff of the}} 4th Division until 26 March 1929. Posted to the United Kingdom, he served at the War Office and attended the Imperial Defence College in 1931.

5|$|On 19 February, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} by helicopter, taking over from 2nd Battalion, US 38th Infantry Regiment. Preece immediately instituted {{a program of}} twenty-four-hour dispersed patrolling, and within two days this had succeeded in reducing the level of Viet Cong activity against the road construction. Two platoons of American M48 Patton tanks were also moved into the area, patrolling by day with the Australian armoured personnel carriers, while securing the laterite pit at night. Several contacts took place and by 22 February the Australians began to suspect that a major attack on them was being planned, noting that they were now facing Main Force elements. In the early morning of 23 February three Viet Cong soldiers were killed in an Australian ambush, while several others were wounded but escaped. The dead soldiers were well equipped with new AK-47 assault rifles and webbing, and they were identified as being from 761st Main Force Regiment. Also captured was a large quantity of ammunition, rations and medical supplies. Later that night a North Vietnamese <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> was also killed in a separate ambush, adding further weight to the Australian suspicions. As dawn broke the next day, two half-platoon ambushes from B Company, 1 RAR—under the command of Major Ian McFarlane—engaged two squads of Viet Cong Main Force. Preece immediately warned Glotzbach of an imminent attack, and then informed Sargent that the Australians were moving {{to set up a}} defensive position, recommending that the engineers relocate in order to join them.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Baptiste Jourdan {{arrived the}} next day with 40,000 men of the Army of the Moselle and took command of the entire force, which would soon be called the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. After the Gosselies defeat, <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> Armand Samuel de Marescot wrote to his friend Lazare Carnot on the Committee of Public Safety, {{explaining}} that a divided command and bad tactics were the cause of the repeated defeats and that the soldiers were becoming discouraged. He noted that better leaders were wanted. La Bas returned to Paris at this time to report that the current command arrangements were not working. Consequently, the Committee of Public Safety directed Desjardin and Charbonnier to come to Paris The order arrived on 8 June.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the cover}} of night, the French mounted sorties with object of {{destroying}} the siege trenches. Mélac personally led several of these attacks. A French <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> named Rovère disguised himself and got within the Imperial lines, but he was found and captured on 8 July. The second parallel was opened on 21 June and the third parallel on 16 July. Mélac flooded the moat on 26 July. The three parallels were completed on 2 August and interconnected. By this date, {{the damage to the}} fortress walls could already be seen. Meanwhile, the besiegers overran the outworks one by one. In this situation, the French increasingly relied on buried mines within threatened outworks. When the Imperials stormed such a position, before retreating, the French would light the fuse and hope that many attackers would be blown up in the ensuing explosion. To prevent these losses, the Imperial engineers dug countermines.|$|E

25|$|Once an Imperial city, Landau {{was awarded}} to the Kingdom of France by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under the {{direction}} of the French military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the city's fortifications were completely reconstructed starting in the spring of 1688 and continuing for three years. In 1689 a fire burned down three-quarters of the city, allowing the French to redesign the streets under the direction of another <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> Jacques Tarade. In 1700 Tarade added the Crownwork on a hill on the northwest side of the city as additional protection. The Queich River split Landau into northern and southern parts. The eight-sided fortress was protected by a bastion at each corner and surrounded by a moat. A clever system of locks allowed the defenders to control the depth of water in the ditches. A fast-flowing waterway called the Flaque made assault impossible on two-thirds of the fortress. A single bridge over the Flaque linked Landau with the Crownwork.|$|E
25|$|Yellowstone {{anchored}} at Quiberon Bay at 0953 on 14 February 1919. Her troubles {{were not}} over, however, as she grazed the jetty wall while entering the locks at St. Nazaire. At 0545, the <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> {{reported to the}} captain that two boilers were under water and the steam was cut off. As Yellowstone moored alongside the nearby quay, her crew broke out a tarpaulin and collision mat. Soon thereafter, Yellowstone, still with way on, nudged into the bridge walk of the lock. By 0630, under tow by a French tug, she reached a safe basin, where she dropped both anchors and her crew began {{to take stock of}} the situation. Divers examining the damage reported that a hole, six inches (15.2cm) in width, had been opened up in Yellowstones side, extending from a point 10 feet (3 meters) beneath the waterline and about six feet (1.8 meters) in length. Drydocked on 11 March 1919, Yellowstone grazed the French passenger ship SS Alesia that morning, causing minor damage to Alesias railings on her promenade deck and boat deck.|$|E

25|$|In 1814 Jones {{visited the}} Netherlands, {{examined}} the principal fortresses, and afterwards met Wellington at Paris. Wellington {{told him that}} he had appointed him, with Brigadier-general (afterwards Sir) Alexander Bryce and another <b>engineer</b> <b>officer,</b> to report on the system of defence for the new kingdom of the Netherlands. The commissioners arrived in Brussels 21 March 1815. On 4 June 1815 Jones was made a C.B. On the appointment of Wellington to the command in the Netherlands, Jones accompanied him round some of the principal points of defence. At the end of August the reports of the commission were taken to Paris by Bryce and Jones and submitted to Wellington, with whom all details were settled by March 1816, when the commission was broken up. Jones was then selected to be Wellington's medium of communication with the Netherlands government for the furtherance of the objects of the report. In the previous December Jones, with Colonel Williamson of the artillery, acting as commissioners of the allied sovereigns, prevented the fortress of Charlemont from falling {{into the hands of the}} Prussians. The commissioners then took possession of Landrecy for the allies, and returned to Paris in January 1816.|$|E
25|$|In {{the face}} of the large Imperial host, the weaker French army of Marshal Catinat fell back, but not before {{reinforcing}} Landau with two battalions of Royal Artillery. Landau was defended by the 72-year-old Lieutenant General Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac who commanded a garrison of 4,095 infantry and 240 cavalrymen. Mélac was notorious for his brutal devastation of the Palatinate in 1688. Aside from the gunners, Mélac's force consisted of two battalions of the Nettancourt Infantry Regiment, one battalion each of the Sarre, Bourbon and Soissonaise Infantry Regiments, two squadrons of the Forsac Cavalry Regiment and the Mélac Free Company. The free company was composed of enemy deserters. Mélac's deputy was Brigadier de l'Esperoux, the infantry commander was Brigadier d'Amigny, the artillery officer was du Breuil, the <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> was Villars and the commander of the Crownwork was Lieutenant Colonel Colomes. After the fortress was surrounded, a number of officers who had been on leave tried to slip through the investment to join their units inside the fortress. On 18 May, Brigadier de Guesques and Colonel de Nettancourt were captured by Palatine cavalry just outside the gates. D'Amigny successfully sneaked in on 16 June disguised as a peasant. During the siege the Nettancourt Regiment was led by Colonel de Gournay.|$|E

25|$|In July 1808 Major Lefebure and Jones were {{selected}} {{to serve as the}} two assistant-commissioners under General Leith, appointed military and semi-diplomatic agent to the junta of the northern provinces of Spain. Jones was attached to the army of the Marquis de la Romana, and conceived a great affection for its commander. Towards {{the end of the year}} Leith was ordered to take command of a brigade and to select an officer to succeed him as commissioner. Leith offered to appoint Jones, but Jones declined, although the high rate of pay was tempting, on the ground that his youth and want of rank would deprive his advice of its proper weight, and he asked instead to join the army. Leith at once appointed him his acting aide-de-camp. Jones continued to act in this capacity until after the skirmish in front of Lugo, when he was ordered, as an <b>engineer</b> <b>officer,</b> to assist in blowing up the bridge over the Tamboya, and was employed with his own corps during the retreat to Corunna. On his arrival in England Jones resumed his staff appointment at Woolwich, and on 24 June 1809 was promoted first captain. On the 9th of the following month he was appointed brigade-major to the engineers under Brigadier-General Fyers, to accompany the expedition under the Earl of Chatham to Walcheren.|$|E
25|$|On 12 July 1806, two {{breaches}} {{began to}} be seen in Gaeta's walls, one at the Breach Battery on the left and one under the Queen's Battery on the right. Surrender was demanded, but Hotz refused. The barrage continued and on the 15th a French <b>engineer</b> <b>officer</b> crept far enough forward to note that the west breach could be attacked. By 16 July, Masséna had heard about the French defeat at Maida and was anxious to capture Gaeta. There remained only 184,000 pounds of gunpowder and less than 5,000 shot, a three-day supply. By this time, the French had 12,000 troops on hand in the infantry divisions of Partouneaux and Gardanne, with the cavalry divisions of Espagne and Mermet in support. Despite the ammunition shortage, the bombardment dragged on, widening the breaches. Normally, the commander of the besiegers kept the time of the final assault on a fortress a secret from the defenders. But Masséna intended to overawe Hotz with his deliberate preparations for attack. On the morning of 18 July {{in full view of the}} defenders, the French massed a force of grenadiers and chasseurs under General of Brigade François-Xavier Donzelot to attack the left breach, while voltigeurs led by Valentin assembled to assault the right breach. The French ostentatiously marched up supporting troops. Masséna's bluff had the intended effect when Hotz put up a white flag at 3:00 PM.|$|E
25|$|Two mounted columns set {{out from}} the Suez Canal on 13 February 1917. Northern Column {{consisting}} of 420 troopers in the 11th Light Horse Regiment, one Royal <b>Engineer</b> <b>officer</b> and four other ranks, one Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) officer with a detachment from 124th Field Ambulance Str. 26, one Royal Flying Corps (RFC) officer and two other ranks and two wireless pack stations, rode out from Serapeum near Ismailia in {{the centre of the}} Canal. Lieutenant Colonel A. W. Jennings Bramly (an Egyptian Government officer with knowledge of the country), Captain F. D. Stirling (General Staff GHQ), and Lieutenant A. H. Stuart (Intelligence Branch, General Staff), along with one aircraft observer and two mechanics to choose advanced landing ground and supervise the transportation of petrol, oil and spare parts accompanied the force. By 14 February the column concentrated at Zogna where a supply dump had been established. Meanwhile, Southern Column consisting of the 6th Mounted Brigade headquarters, with yeomanry from this brigade, and the Indian 58th Rifles rode out from Suez {{at the southern end of}} the Suez Canal, via Heniak, Ayun Sudr, the Mitla Pass and the Darb el Haj towards Nekhl. Three aircraft from No. 1 Squadron based at El Arish worked from the aerodrome of No. 57 Reserve Squadron at Ismailia during the raid, were to report daily on the progress of the two columns, drop messages from headquarters and scout ahead. while a yeomanry force marched from Suez via the Mitla Pass and the Darb el Haj.|$|E
