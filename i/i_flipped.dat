500|$|One of Miles' songs, [...] "We Gotta Live Together" [...] was pared {{down from}} fifteen {{to a little}} over five minutes and another, [...] "Changes", also benefited from trimming, because, as Murray puts it, [...] "a little of [...] goes an {{extremely}} long way". This editing also provided some lighter moments. [...] One of Jeffery's assistants recalled, [...] "Hendrix played me a tape and prefaced it by saying it represented the new direction in his music. [...] He had made up this long loop of tape of the portions edited out of 'We Gotta Live Together'. [...] <b>I</b> <b>flipped</b> out and he started cracking up". [...] After several more editing and mixing sessions at Juggy Sound, the material for the album was readied on February 17. The following day, Hendrix and Kramer met with Bob Ludwig, who supervised the final mastering. [...] Hendrix chose to work with his own mastering engineer, {{because he had been}} dissatisfied with his record company's results for Electric Ladyland. [...] The task was completed on February 19, 1970, and the final track listing included two songs from the third show and four from the fourth and last show.|$|E
500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>flipped</b> out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs {{are the kinds of things}} that are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. [...] For instance, in the episode [...] "House Fancy", television personality Alton Brown guest starred as the character of Nicholas Whithers, the host and judge of a show of the same name. In an interview, Brown described the work as [...] "a blast." [...] He said [...] "I {{came up with this}} voice that didn't sound anything like me. I channeled this very strange person. Only three people I know figured out it was even me when they saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] as the voice of Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show. The episode was also guest starred by musician and The Monkees' Davy Jones who starred in the episode as himself, appearing {{at the bottom of the}} sea with his locker, and Bruce Brown providing vocal cameo as the episode's narrator. Brian Doyle-Murray also reprised his role as the Flying Dutchman for the episode. In [...] "The Card", Ernest Borgnine returned, reprising his role as Mermaid Man. Borgnine later reappeared in the episodes [...] "Ditchin'" [...] and [...] "Shuffleboarding", voicing his recurring role, with Tim Conway as Barnacle Boy. In [...] "Dear Vikings", English actor Ian McShane voiced Gordon, the leader of the large group of Vikings outside of Bikini Bottom. Dennis Quaid also appeared in the [...] "Grandpappy the Pirate" [...] as Grandpa Redbeard, Mr. Krabs' grandfather. Furthermore, Dee Snider, the frontman of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, guest starred in [...] "Shell Shocked" [...] as Angry Jack. Snider said [...] "I knew they must be fans [...] because in the SpongeBob movie, they took my song 'I Wanna Rock' and changed it to 'Goofy Goober Rock.' <b>I</b> <b>flipped</b> at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of a Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham. The former Spice Girl accepted the role because her sons, Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, love the show, were excited when their mother told them of the role, and looked forward to watching the episode with her. Beckham recorded the voice-over in late-2008 in a day, and claimed that she was [...] "thrilled" [...] to provide the vocal cameo. Other guests in the episode included Seinfeld actor John O'Hurley as King Neptune and Skid Row heavy metal vocalist Sebastian Bach as the voice of Triton.|$|E

I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and <b>I</b> <b>flipped</b> it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.|$|E

40|$|The pancake problem, {{which has}} {{attracted}} considerable attention [10, 12, 9, 15], concerns {{the number of}} prefix reversals or flips needed to sort the elements of an arbitrary permutation. The number of prefix reversals to sort permutations is also {{the diameter of the}} often studied n-dimensional Pancake network P n [3, 4, 5, 8, 14, 16]. We consider restricted pancake problems, for example when only 3 of the possible n - 1 flips are allowed. Let f <b>i</b> denote a <b>flip</b> of size <b>i.</b> Each <b>flip</b> is itself a permutation. For example, a flip of size 4, i. e., f 4, on eight symbols has the effect of changing, say, 3 5 1 2 4 6 8 7 into 2 1 5 3 4 6 8 7. f 4 is the permutation 4 3 2 1 5 6 7 8. We investigate sets of permutations corresponding to flips as generators of the symmetric group S n. Let n be the number of symbols in a permutation. We consider sets with either a constant number of generators (<b>i.</b> e., <b>flips)</b> or with log 2 n generators. In special interesting cases, the corresponding Cayley net [...] ...|$|R

We find that in cases when the target cytosine is replaced with thymine (GTGC), KMnO 4 proved an efficient probe for positive display of flipped-out thymines. The generality of this procedure was further verified by examining a DNA adenine-N 6 methyltransferase, M. Taq I, in which case an enhanced reactivity of thymine replacing the target adenine (TCGT) in the recognition sequence TCGA was also observed. Our results support the proposed base-flipping mechanism for adenine methyltransferases, and offer a convenient laboratory tool for detection of flipped-out thymines in protein-DNA complexes...|$|R
