5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 134 taxa of macroinvertebrates have been {{observed}} on the tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek as of May 11, 2012. The average Shannon index in the watershed is 2.2. The Pielou’s Evenness of the watershed is 0.77. EPT testing of microinvertebrate concentration resulted in an EPT index of 15. These values all <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> relatively healthy stream.|$|E
5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles to <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> predator in the air.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|According to Li (2005), several {{morphological}} {{features of}} A. longicervia <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> close relationship to Sarraceniaceae: both taxa exhibit {{one or two}} pitcher wings, a smooth peristome, and pitchers that extend vertically {{from the top of}} a short petiole.|$|E

5|$|Also, cinematographic {{improvements}} that modern viewers would find relatively minor were noted in their day. In the attic scenes, for instance, Hepworth's use of arc lights was celebrated {{for being an}} early use of harsh lighting conditions to create ambiance and <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> dangerous setting. Prints have been saved both in the Library of Congress film archive, and the National Film and Television Archive of the British Film Institute.|$|E
5|$|Among heterodontosaurids, only Heterodontosaurus {{itself is}} known from a {{complete}} skeleton. Fragmentary skeletal remains of Abrictosaurus are known {{but have not}} been fully described, while most other heterodontosaurids are known only from jaw fragments and teeth. Consequently, most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies (defining features) have been described from the teeth and jaw bones. Heterodontosaurus measured just over 1meter (3.3ft) in length, while the fragmentary remains of Lycorhinus may <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> larger individual.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{hierarchies}} of deities, traditional {{conceptions of}} Tao {{should not be}} confused with the Western theism. Being one with the Tao does not necessarily <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu sense.|$|E
5|$|Early blades {{have been}} {{documented}} {{as far back as}} 550-500,000 years in the Kapthurin Formation in Kenya and Kathu Pan in South Africa. Backed pieces from the Twin Rivers and Kalambo Falls sites in Zambia, dated at sometime between 300 and 140,000 years, likewise <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> suite of new behaviors. A high level of technical competence is also indicated for the c. 280 ka blades recovered from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Orion stages are {{numbered}} {{to indicate their}} configuration. The first number, either 38 or 50, indicates {{the diameter of the}} stage. This is followed by various letters.
