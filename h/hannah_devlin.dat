5000|$|In 2017 {{following}} {{the election of}} Donald Trump into office, Happer met with Trump to discuss his potential role of being his science adviser {{and said that he}} would take the job if it was offered. Happer described Trump as [...] "very attentive" [...] and that the president's concerns [...] "were that of a technically literate person." [...] <b>Hannah</b> <b>Devlin</b> of The Guardian wrote that Happer [...] "supports a controversial crackdown on the freedom of federal agency scientists to speak out about their findings, arguing that mixed messages... have led to people disregarding all public health information." ...|$|E
5000|$|When the GWPF's website was {{launched}} in November 2009, a graph used in the logo graphic on each page of the website of '21st Century global mean temperatures' showed a slow decline over the selected period from 2001 to 2008. <b>Hannah</b> <b>Devlin</b> of The Times found an error for 2003 and noted that if the period from 2000 to 2009 had been chosen, then a rise in temperature would have been shown rather than a fall. Bob Ward said that the graph was contrary to the true measurements, and that by leaving out the temperature trend during the 20th century, the graph obscured the fact that 8 of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred this century. The GWPF blamed a [...] "small error by our graphic designer" [...] for the mistake which would now be changed, but said that starting the graph earlier would be equally arbitrary.|$|E
