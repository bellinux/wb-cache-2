5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.36 Squadron {{was established}} on 11March at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{under the control}} of Southern Area Command. Its <b>initial</b> <b>strength</b> was twenty-six personnel and one Douglas DC-2. This was gradually built up to a force of six DC-2s, as well as examples of various de Havilland types including the DH.84 Dragon, DH.86 Express, DH.89 Dragon Rapide, and Tiger Moth. Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to Port Moresby, New Guinea, the squadron relocated to Essendon, Victoria, on 17July. One of the DC-2s crashed at Seven Mile Aerodrome, Port Moresby, on 14September; all aboard were killed. The squadron was transferred to Townsville, Queensland, on 11December 1942. During 1943, it maintained detachments at Essendon and in New Guinea, and began re-equipping with twelve Douglas C-47 Dakotas.|$|E

The Provisional Engineer Detachment (PED), 4817th Service Command Unit, was activated at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, on 10 April 1943. These men performed jobs around the post such as working in the boiler plant, the motor pool and the mess halls. They also maintained the buildings and roads. It reached a peak strength of 465 men, and was disbanded on 1 July 1946.|$|E
30|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{developing}} a new aqueous emulsion-type adhesive for wood or paper use that does not release formaldehyde or volatile organic solvents, a honeymoon-type acrylic adhesive was examined. An adhesive system consisting of acrylic monomers copolymerized with functional monomers and a cross-linking agent was selected {{for the purposes of}} increasing <b>initial</b> adhesive <b>strength</b> and ensuring room-temperature curing. The <b>initial</b> adhesive <b>strength</b> increased by the use of cross-linkers such as dihydrazides and also polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI). Thus an adhesive with reasonable to good <b>initial</b> adhesive <b>strength</b> and room-temperature curing was obtained.

We have used Whitham’s rule to study the variation in the shock strength and the shock velocity after modifying it for inclusion of pressure, energy and flux of radiation. We find the shock increases in strength as it propagates through the envelopes of decreasing density, pressure and temperature. The velocity of the shock decreases for very weak <b>initial</b> shock <b>strengths,</b> for intermediate <b>initial</b> shock <b>strength</b> it first decreases and then increases, while for large <b>initial</b> shock <b>strength,</b> it always increases.

5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand – the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades. A light horse brigade consisted of three regiments. Each regiment included three squadrons of four troops and a machine-gun section. The <b>initial</b> <b>strength</b> of a regiment was around 500 men, although its establishment changed throughout the war. In 1916, the machine-gun sections of each regiment were concentrated as squadrons at brigade-level. Like the infantry, the light horse regiments were raised on a territorial basis by state and were identified numerically (1st to 15th).|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{equipment}} losses {{during the}} German offensive came to 1,614tanks and self-propelled guns destroyed or damaged of the 3,925 vehicles {{committed to the}} battle. The Soviet losses were roughly three {{times larger than the}} German losses. During Operation Kutuzov, 2,349tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of an <b>initial</b> <b>strength</b> of 2,308; a loss of over 100percent. During Polkovodets Rumyantsev 1,864tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of the 2,439 employed. The loss ratio suffered by the Soviets was roughly 5:1 in favour of the German military. However, large Soviet reserves of equipment and their high rate of tank production enabled the Soviet tank armies to soon replace lost equipment and maintain their fighting strength. The Red Army repaired many of its damaged tanks; many Soviet tanks were rebuilt up to four times to keep them in the fight. Soviet tank strength went back up to 2,750 tanks by 3 August due to the repair of damaged vehicles.|$|E
5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.34 (Transport) Squadron {{was established}} on 23February at RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, {{four days after}} the city was bombed for the first time. Coming under the control of North-Western Area Command, the squadron's <b>initial</b> <b>strength</b> was six personnel and two deHavilland DH.84 Dragons. They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia. As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese prisoner of war to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at Wyndham, Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft unserviceable, and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to Daly Waters Airfield on 5March. On 14March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1July, {{a few days after the}} plane crashlanded south of Katherine. The squadron relocated again on 15July, this time to Hughes Airfield. It remained at Hughes until 27August, when it transferred to Manbulloo Airfield; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13December and its aircraft transferred to No.6 Communications Flight.|$|E
