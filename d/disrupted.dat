40|$|ABSTRACT: â-Amyloid (Aâ), {{the primary}} protein {{component}} of Alzheimer’s plaques, is neurotoxic when aggregated into fibrils. We have devised a modular strategy for generating compounds that inhibit Aâ toxicity. These compounds contain a recognition element, designed to bind to Aâ, {{linked to a}} <b>disrupting</b> element, designed to interfere with Aâ aggregation. On {{the basis of this}} strategy, a hybrid peptide was synthesized with the sequence KLVFF (residues 16 - 20 of Aâ) as the recognition element and a lysine hexamer as the <b>disrupting</b> element; this compound protects cells in vitro from Aâ toxicity [Pallitto, M. M., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 3570]. To determine if the length of the <b>disrupting</b> element could be reduced, peptides were synthesized that contained the KLVFF recognition element and a sequence of one to six lysines as <b>disrupting</b> elements. All compounds enhanced the rate of aggregation of Aâ, with the magnitude of the effect increasing as the number of lysines in the <b>disrupting</b> element increased. The greatest level of protection against Aâ toxicity was achieved with compounds containing <b>disrupting</b> elements of three or more lysines in sequence. A peptide with an anionic <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFEEEE, had activity similar to that of KLVFFKKKK, in both cellular toxicity and biophysical assays, whereas a peptide with a neutral polar <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFSSSS, was ineffective. Protective compounds retained activity even at an inhibitor:Aâ molar ratio of 1 : 100, making these some of the most effective inhibitor...|$|R

In Anuta, agricultural activities were <b>disrupted.</b> Various fruit trees and crops, especially in gardens on the island's hills, were destroyed by high winds and heavy rain.

Fruit trees were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at least two years after Zoe's impact. Topsoil was left dry by the cyclone, preventing any immediate replacement of lost crops.|$|E

40|$|A GC-MS {{method was}} {{successfully}} applied to measure simultaneously {{the concentrations of}} endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds (5 dialkyl phthalates, 9 phthalate monoesters, 3 alkylphenols and bisphenol A) in 136 male urine samples. In the present study the method was validated and concentrations of EDCs were determined. The results were compared with results from other studies. Correlations between endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds and also correlations of endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds with two semen quality parameters are presented and evaluated. Significant positive correlations were found between almost all the endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds. The parameter sum of DEHP (SUM DEHP) was positively correlated to all the endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds but negatively to two semen quality parameters. Negative correlations between the endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds and the semen quality parameters could indicate that endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds could cause reproductive problems by decreasing the semen count and quality. This research will have helped to evaluate human exposure to endocrine <b>disrupting</b> compounds.

40|$|Abstract. An {{internal}} 1. 4 -kb Bst Eli fragment {{was used}} to <b>disrupt</b> the benA gene and establish heterokaryons.
