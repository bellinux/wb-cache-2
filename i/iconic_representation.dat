5|$|Tech Tower is {{considered}} an <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of Georgia Tech and {{of higher education in}} Atlanta. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Tower, Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. Kessler Campanile, a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.|$|E
5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of Shiva, in itself.|$|E

All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E

40|$|Is {{language}} {{the key to}} number? This article {{argues that}} the human language faculty provides the cognitive equipment that enables humans to develop a systematic number concept. Crucially, this concept is based on non-iconic representations that involve relations between relations: relations between numbers are linked with relations between objects. In contrast to this, language-independent numerosity concepts provide only <b>iconic</b> <b>representations.</b> The pattern of forming relations between relations {{lies at the heart}} of our language faculty, suggesting that it is language that enables humans to make the step from these <b>iconic</b> <b>representations,</b> which we share with other species, to a generalised concept of number...|$|R
25|$|In this way, Wodiczko’s visual {{repertoire}} for his projections expanded {{beyond the}} body (ears, eyes, and hands {{as indicators of}} human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. “In these projections,” writes Kathleen MacQueen, “the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images – the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce – that is, predicated on a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body – someone’s body – is also an <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.” The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, {{are not meant to}} read as logos for a political agenda, instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.|$|E

30|$|<b>Iconic</b> <b>representations</b> are ubiquitous; {{they fill}} children’s cartoons, add humor to newspapers, and bring {{emotional}} tone to online communication. Yet, the communicative function they serve remains unaddressed by cognitive psychology. Here, {{we examined the}} hypothesis that <b>iconic</b> <b>representations</b> communicate emotional information more efficiently than their realistic counterparts. In Experiment 1, we manipulated low-level features of emotional faces to create five sets of stimuli that ranged from photorealistic to fully iconic. Participants identified emotions on briefly presented faces. Results showed that, at short presentation times, accuracy for identifying emotion on more “cartoonized” images was enhanced. In addition, increasing contrast and decreasing featural complexity benefited accuracy. In Experiment 2, we examined an event-related potential component, the P 1, which is sensitive to low-level visual stimulus features. Lower levels of contrast and complexity within schematic stimuli were also associated with lower P 1 amplitudes. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>iconic</b> <b>representations</b> differ from realistic images in their ability to communicate specific information, including emotion, quickly and efficiently, and that this effect is driven by changes in low-level visual features in the stimuli.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} of prior knowledge and cognitive {{development on the}} effec-tiveness of <b>iconic</b> <b>representations</b> in science visualizations was examined. Middle {{and high school students}} (N = 186) were given narrated visualizations of two chemistry topics: Kinetic Molecular Theory (Day 1) and Ideal Gas Laws (Day 2). For half of the visual-izations, <b>iconic</b> <b>representations</b> of key information were added. Results indicated a main effect of prior knowledge on learning in Day 1. In Day 2, a three-way interaction was found between prior knowledge, age group and icons: icons were effective for all middle school students and for high school students with low prior knowledge, but were not effective for high school students with high prior knowledge. These findings indicate that the expertise reversal effect can be mediated by cognitive development and other factors, not just domain specific prior knowledge...|$|R
500|$|Readers {{and critics}} have {{described}} Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent and creative character, noting that his rather neutral personality—sometimes labelled as bland—permits a balanced {{reflection of the}} evil, folly, and foolhardiness, which surrounds him. [...] The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals, which represent Hergé's own, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist.

500|$|The same <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of the Heavenly Bull was {{depicted}} in the Dendera zodiac, an Egyptian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the celestial hemisphere using a planisphere. In these ancient cultures, {{the orientation of the}} horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward. To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This [...] "sacrifice" [...] led to the renewal of the land. To the early Hebrews, Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet, Aleph.|$|E
500|$|Later critics de-emphasised the {{significance}} of the poems in Wordsworth's artistic development. Hunter Davies (b. 1936) concluded that their impact relies more on their popularity than importance to Wordsworth's poetic career. Davies went on to claim, [...] "The poems about Lucy are perhaps Wordsworth's best-known work which he did in Germany, along with 'Nutting' and the Matthew poems, but the most important work was the beginning of The Prelude" [...] (emphasis in original). Some critics emphasised the importance behind Lucy as a figure, including Geoffrey Hartman (b. 1929), when he claimed, [...] "It is in the Lucy poems that the notion of spirit of place, and particularly English spirit of place, reaches its purest form."

Chronologically, in The Three Stooges' January 1940-released short subject You Nazty Spy! — the first-ever Hollywood parody of Hitler and the Nazis — followed by the October 1940 release of British comedian Charlie Chaplin's parody film The Great Dictator, both the Stooges and Chaplin parodied the globe separately in their works. In the Stooges' July 1941-released sequel to their 1940 short subject, named I'll Never Heil Again, the globe is once again the focus of parody. In Chaplin's 1940 film, the globe is portrayed as a beach ball that bursts {{in front of the}} face of dictator [...] "Adenoid Hynkel". Similarly, in I'll Never Heil Again, the [...] "Axel" [...] partners of Moronikan dictator [...] "Moe Hailstone" [...] play a game of [...] "keep-away" [...] with the globe.

500|$|Sivakasi was {{established}} {{during the early}} 15th century CE. Between 1428 and 1460, a Pandya king Harikesari Parakkirama Pandian ruled {{the southern part of}} Madurai region (comprising modern day Sivakasi and it surroundings). Hindu legend relates that he wanted to construct a temple for the Hindu god Shiva at Tenkasi and went to Kasi to bring a lingam (an <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of Shiva). While returning to his palace with the prized lingam, he rested under the grove of a vilva tree, the favourite tree of Shiva. When a cow carrying the lingam refused to move from the spot, the king realised that the wishes of Shiva were different from his own, and he placed the lingam in the place where the cow halted. The place where the [...] "shivalingam brought from Kasi" [...] was installed {{came to be known as}} Sivakasi. Sivakasi was a part of the Madurai region during the 16th century. Madurai became independent from the Vijayanagar Empire in 1559 under the Nayaks. Nayak rule ended in 1736 and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740– 1754), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725– 1764) in the middle of the 18th century. In 1801, Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency.|$|E
500|$|Regional {{variants}} {{of the word}} Allah occur in both pagan and Christian pre-Islamic inscriptions. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in pre-Islamic polytheistic cults. Some authors have suggested that polytheistic Arabs used the name as {{a reference to a}} creator god or a supreme deity of their pantheon. The term may have been vague in the Meccan religion. According to one hypothesis, which goes back to Julius Wellhausen, Allah (the supreme deity of the tribal federation around Quraysh) was a designation that consecrated the superiority of Hubal (the supreme deity of Quraysh) over the other gods. However, there is also evidence that Allah and Hubal were two distinct deities. According to that hypothesis, the Kaaba was first consecrated to a supreme deity named Allah and then hosted the pantheon of Quraysh after their conquest of Mecca, about a century before the time of Muhammad. [...] Some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of Allah as a name of a polytheist deity centuries earlier, but we know nothing precise about this use. Some scholars have suggested that Allah may have represented a remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities. There is disagreement on whether Allah {{played a major role in}} the Meccan religious cult. No <b>iconic</b> <b>representation</b> of Allah is known to have existed.

2500|$|According to {{the version}} of her birth recounted by Hesiod in his Theogony, Cronus severed Uranus' {{genitals}} and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, which Hesiod interpreted as [...] "foam-arisen"), while the Giants, the Erinyes (furies), and the Meliae emerged from the drops of his blood.

2500|$|The rise of Islam in {{the seventh}} century had also caused some {{consideration}} of the use of holy images. Early Islamic belief stressed the impropriety of <b>iconic</b> <b>representation.</b> Earlier scholarship tried to link Byzantine Iconoclasm directly to Islam by arguing that Byzantine emperors saw the success of the early Caliphate and decided that Byzantine use of images (as opposed to Islamic aniconism) had angered God. This does not seem entirely plausible however. The use of images had probably been increasing in the years leading up to the outbreak of iconoclasm. [...] One notable change came in 695, when Justinian II put a full-faced image of Christ on the obverse of his gold coins. The effect on iconoclast opinion is unknown, but the change certainly caused Caliph Abd al-Malik to break permanently with his previous adoption of Byzantine coin types to start a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only. [...] This appears more like two opposed camps asserting their positions (pro and anti images) than one empire seeking to imitate the other. More striking is the fact that Islamic iconoclasm rejected any depictions of living people or animals, not only religious images. By contrast, Byzantine iconomachy concerned itself only with the question of the holy presence (or lack thereof) of images. Thus, although the rise of Islam may have created an environment in which images were at the forefront of intellectual question and debate, Islamic iconoclasm {{does not seem to have}} had a direct causal role in the development of the Byzantine image debate.|$|E
