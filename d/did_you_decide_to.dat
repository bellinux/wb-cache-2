30|$|The basic {{question}} above begs some immediate follow-up questions, ones that draw on influential factors shared by both metacognitive and EL processes. For example, if participants do switch between perspectives, what contexts or motivations trigger switching (e.g. environment complexity, learning goals, metacognitive monitoring, {{individual differences in}} spatial skills)? To address context, virtual environments could vary landmark similarity, intersection complexity, or field of view range. Different learning goals could change motivations for interacting with an environment. Additionally, think-aloud protocols or direct questions, such as “Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> switch to the other display?” could explore metacognitive and motivational factors impacting perspective switching. In addition, using individual difference measures, such as the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (Hegarty et al., 2002) or the Scale on Sense of Direction and Spatial Representation (Pazzaglia, Cornoldi, & De Beni, 2000) and tying these to contextual factors and metacognitive monitoring should provide insights into how these factors interact. These factors may individually or jointly affect patterns of perspective switching and the different patterns could, in turn, affect EL. Results from studies such as these can provide useful guidance for navigational aid design.|$|E

Teve como objetivo apreender o sentido e o significado do corpo prÃprio do profissional de saÃde no processo de cuidar/cuidado do outro corpo prÃprio que estÃ morrendo no contexto do hospital. Optou-se por uma abordagem qualitativa, na vertente da fenomenologia existencial, a qual contempla a compreensÃo e a interpretaÃÃo do sentido, considerando o sujeito como ser histÃrico-cultural que produz o sentido e o significado do mundo percebido. Foram utilizadas entrevistas com dez profissionais definidos como sujeitos do estudo. As entrevistas foram norteadas pelas questÃes: Como vocÃ chegou a cuidar de doentes terminais? Como vocÃ sente o seu corpo cuidando dos doentes terminais? ApÃs as transcriÃÃes, os depoimentos foram analisados individualmente resgatando os temas: ConsciÃncia Perceptiva do Corpo, Espacialidade do Corpo no Mundo, Limites da ExistÃncia no Corpo. A anÃlise visou Ã reflexÃo hermenÃutica sobre o fenÃmeno, engendrando a apreensÃo do sentido e do significado: do corpo prÃprio do profissional de saÃde em uma perspectiva deste corpo como consciÃncia, que continuamente necessita ser cuidado na essÃncia da sua natureza, durante o processo de cuidar/cuidado do outro corpo prÃprio que estÃ morrendo.

Its goal was to grasp the senses and the meaning of the proper body of the health professional in the process of caring/taking care of the other proper body who is dying within the hospital context. To build intimacy room in the hospital to hear the testimonies of the health professionals about their experiences in taking care of the other one who is dying. To reach that, it was chosen to use a qualitative approach, within the existential phenomenology, which includes the understanding and the interpretation of the meaning, considering the subject as a historical-cultural being who captures the senses and the meaning of the perceived world. It was carried out interviews with ten professionals defined as subjects of study. The interviews presented mainly the following questions: How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> take care of the terminal patients? How do you perceive your body when you take care of terminal patients? After the transcriptions, the testimonies were individually analyzed rescuing these themes: Perceptive Conscience of the body, the place the body occupies in the world, limits of the existence in the body. The analysis aim was the hermeneutical reflection about the phenomenon, grasping the senses and the meaning: the proper body of the health professional in a perspective of this very body as conscience, that continually needs to be taken care of. Therefore, there is a body that directs itself embodied the world, to another elected figures in the funds, before the possibilities that the medium offers and positions that the body takes on this. When the body becomes the "point of view of the world" rather than an object, the structure of space-time existence is reawakened perceptual and objective thinking is usually deleted. There is a conscious intentional restructuring that enabled the development of technology for interdisciplinary care of the body as consciousness by the dynamics of the senses, using the existential phenomenological method in the light of Merleau-Ponty...|$|E

40|$|Horticultural crops {{for export}} Cue: Kenya {{is well known}} as one of the major African {{suppliers}} of fruit, vegetables and flowers to European markets. In January this year, a group of European buyers, including some of the big supermarkets, introduced a new set of standards for horticultural produce. Called Eurepgap, the standards require all suppliers to grow their produce in accordance with strict rules - and to be able to prove that they have done so. Failure to meet the standards could mean that a buyer will refuse to accept the produce, potentially a big loss of income for the farmer. So growing for export markets remains a challenging business, not least for small-scale farmers. To find out how farmers are coping, and to learn about the support offered by the agricultural extension services in Kenya, Eric Kadenge recently visited two farms close to Nairobi. He also spoke to an extension officer who has been helping both farmers with their production and their marketing. IN:		?My name is Bernard Ngoi? OUT:		? alongside their food crops. ? DUR?N		 7 ? 55 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sarah Ndegwa concluding that while growing horticultural crops for export is a demanding activity, it can also be financially rewarding. Transcript Ngoi:	My name is Bernard Ngoi. I plant French beans, baby corns and maize for eating. Kadenge:	Do you also plant the French beans for eating? Ngoi:	No I plant French beans for selling. Kadenge:	Right now we are in your farm and I can see that you are busy as well as your colleagues here. What is happening, what are you doing? Ngoi:	Now we are preparing to plant some French beans. Kadenge:	Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> grow French beans for sale? Ngoi:	It is the crop for which I can get money easily, because we use one and a half months to get money. Kadenge:	What are some of the biggest challenges you face with this crop? Ngoi:	Sometimes when we have no fertilizers or the money where we can get it, it is difficult for us, because if you plant without fertilizer or manure it cannot do well. Also we use some labourers but we give them 120 /- per half day. Sometimes we use a machine for pumping some water. So sometimes we get loss instead of profit. Kadenge:	Why do you have to use labourers? Ngoi:	It is because if we use cows we cannot prepare well, so as to make the French beans grow well. Kadenge:	And you've mentioned that you also have to use a water pump to pump water. Where do you get this water from? Is it from that river ahead of us? Ngoi:	We get water from this river, you can see. Also we built a gabion here - you can see it. And we were helped by local government. We can use it and plant more and we can get money. Kadenge:	Now the level of the water here is very, very low. Is this what usually happens or are there times when you have a lot of water here that it actually flows like a big river? Ngoi:	Yes, in December, January to May it flows very much, and there is plenty of water here. Kadenge:	Other than the problems of pumping water and the cost of production of French beans, what other difficulties do you face in terms of growing French beans? Ngoi:	Sometimes there is some limit in marketing. And if we plant and it is not carried, we lose some kgs (kilograms). Kadenge:	So they are very perishable. They have to get to the market quickly. And how do you carry them from your farm to the market? Ngoi:	We use wheel-barrows to carry these to our nearest market, so it can be carried by the agent to send it to Machakos or Nairobi. SFX	Car stopping, door closing. Kadenge:	We have just arrived at Mr Katumbo's farm. He grows all kinds of fruits but what you can see most as you enter his farm are the mango trees and as you shall discover he has more than five different varieties of mango trees that he grows here. Katumbo:	I am Peter Mutisya Katumbo. I am a horticultural farmer. I grow a variety of mango fruits, oranges, tangerines, tomatoes and also some paw paws. Kadenge:	Of all the crops that you have mentioned, what do you grow most? Katumbo:	Mangoes. I've got about more than 10 mango varieties. Kadenge:	OK. Let?s move closer to this heap of mangoes here. What are they doing here - why are they heaped here? Katumbo:	We are going to ferry these to Nairobi for marketing. Kadenge:	So why don?t we take a walk to the farm and then continue to discuss a little bit more about your mango farming? SFX	Footsteps. Kadenge:	So we are standing just next to one of the mango trees here that seems to be very, very heavy with fruit. Now this is what variety? Katumbo:	This is called Kent. Kadenge:	Now why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> grow mangoes? Katumbo:	I would say I was looking for a crop which can give good returns. This appears to be the only cash crop that can do well here. Kadenge:	Are there any challenges that you face as you bring up these mango trees? Katumbo:	Yeah there are all sorts of challenges. You find various diseases attacking the crop. Spraying of chemicals is very necessary. The required chemicals, for example fungicides. To export mangoes to Europe has become somewhat a big problem, because now we have newly-introduced conditions by EUREPGAP. Kadenge:	Now what word would you have for somebody that is thinking of growing mangoes? Katumbo:	I would like to tell him that growing mangoes should be taken seriously. It seems as though it is the only viable cash crop in this area. Kadenge:	So thank you very much for taking us around your farm and we've enjoyed talking about the various fruits especially about mangoes. SFX	Car stopping. Ndegwa:	My name is Sarah Ndegwa, I am a specialist in horticulture, and I am doing extension work for the Machakos district. I give guidance on production and after production we link the farmers to the market. Kadenge:	We have just visited two of the farmers you work with. One was a French bean farmer and the other one is this mango farmer. Let?s start with French beans. What are the conditions necessary for the cultivation of French beans? Ndegwa:	Generally what is required in almost all of the crops is record keeping. Because you need to know: time of planting, time of spraying, and what chemicals you sprayed, the dosage, the quantity, source of seed, for example - where you bought the seed from. So the farmers have to record every step of their activity, and this also helps in the traceability and also the expected time of harvesting. Each crop has its own chemicals. We do give a spray programme for each crop. And the chemicals depend on the time, the stage of the product. Because let?s say you are harvesting: you need to use chemicals that have a short post harvest interval, like one day or two days. The same thing with mangoes. If you are harvesting, at harvesting stage we actually discourage spraying at harvesting stage for mangoes. So most of the chemicals for mangoes you start when they are flowering. Kadenge:	One of the things that the two farmers have mentioned has been accessibility to the market and the exploitation by middlemen. Is this something that you are able to address, as a horticultural development agency? Ndegwa:	We are working very hard on this because we have been helping the farmers on production and they have managed to do good quality produce. We have a list of exporters that we have approached, and local markets also. So we are trying to link them with the farmer. Like this mango farmer; we just brought an exporter to him and he bought his mangoes and he bought even from the farmers around here. He is able to collect from the farm and pay them on the farm. And the same case with the French bean farmers. We are linking them with a buyer. That way the middlemen issue is being tackled; but only for those farmers we are working with. Kadenge:	But since these are high value crops, are you seeing a difference? Do they change the lives of the farmers here, who may not have been making much from the usual subsistence farming of maize and beans? Ndegwa:	Over the four years that I have been in extension work I have seen horticultural farming making a difference in farmers? lives. They are able to pay their school fees and meet other small expenses, because they are doing their horticultural farming as a cash crop alongside their food crops. End of track.

40|$|Growing {{flowers for}} seed Cue: While the growing of flowers has {{expanded}} {{in certain parts}} of Africa in recent years, as a result of improved storage facilities and air links with European markets, it remains a minority farming activity. For small scale farmers, flower growing may only be possible if they have an agreement with a commercial company, who can provide the necessary seed and inputs, as well as a guaranteed market. For those who grow cut flowers, attention to detail is essential - if the flowers are to reach the customer looking their best, not only must they be expertly grown, but harvesting, packaging and transport must be done according to a very precise schedule. There is, however, another way to earn money from flowers, where the crop is not the flower itself, but the seed it produces. Selling flower seed is a big global business, and in some parts of Africa, farmers are benefiting from the profits to be made. Moses Kilusu, who lives near Arusha in northern Tanzania, is one such farmer. He spoke to Lazarus Laiser about his production of flower seeds. IN:		?Kisarian is a village situated? OUT:		? I am sure I will finish my house. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 45 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Moses Kilusu, who grows flowers for seed production in northern Tanzania. Transcript Laiser	Kisarian is a village situated in Arusha region just ten kilometres from Arusha. And I am standing with a farmer called Moses Kilusu who is living here in Kisarian and he has something to tell us about farming especially the high value crops that he is growing here in Kisarian. Kilusu	(Vernac) The crop we depend on much as commercial crop is beans, but we have another one which is flowers. We started growing it when we discovered that it earns a lot of money. We get the seeds from Multiflower company Ltd. The type of flower we grow here in Kisarian are much productive which are hypomea, zinia, cosmo and targetta. But hypomea is the best and we grow mostly here because it can cope with our climate and soil type. Laiser		Was it difficult to develop a market for the crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) We have the company, they give us seeds free of charge with a condition of selling the seeds to them. So we have not got any problems of market but transport is upon us. Usually we are paid after three months. Laiser		Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> grow this crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) I left the other crops because their profit is very little. As you know that we get very little rain here. Crops like maize, beans, needs a lot of rain and yields are very few or poor. But these type of flowers only needs a little rain, it only receives rain three times and then you can get a ready yield. Laiser		Mr Moses what are the difficult aspects of growing this crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) There are difficulties. First you need to prepare your land or farm by digging it and once the rain has started you plant it. And after two weeks you need to weed it and spray to kill insects. Another difficulty is during the harvest. It is very difficult because you have to cut using a sharp knife and after that you have to collect them together and pound them in order to get off the husks. This process is the hardest one. Laiser	What are the necessary conditions for the cultivation of crop to be a success? Kilusu	(Vernac) What is important to consider carefully before we plant is the climate. Immediately the first rain you have to plant the seeds and the second rains you have to start weeding. Because once you delay in weeding they will not produce. The rain needed is only three times and this can be enough for harvest. We have this kind of rain in Kisarian. Laiser		So you think that this crop is good to grow here in Kisarian? Kilusu	(Vernac) It can fit very well here in Kisarian and the proof is that we have got a lot of profit from this crop. From one acre you can get 120 - 200 kilograms. If I sell them I can get six thousand Tanzanian shillings. This is a big amount of money compared to maize sales. From this farming, when I started other people are afraid of the big work that you need to do. But when they saw our success they have now joined us and they are happy with the profit they are getting. And I believe that others will continue to join. Laiser		Mr Moses what are your future plans? Kilusu	(Vernac) To rent land, to have more acres and expand the plantation of this crop to get many kilograms, and I will get a profit and I am sure I will finish my house. End of trackMoses Kilusu grows ornamental flowers in order to harvest their seed, on his farm near Arusha in Tanzania. He works under contract to the Multiflower company...|$|E

40|$|How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> make {{strategic}} decisions? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> where <b>to</b> {{place your}} bets? Toyota has bet on hybrids; GM has bet on fuel cells. Shell bet on offshore and LNG in the 1970 s. Those {{turned out to}} be great bets. BP placed a big bet on Russia. Nexen-Opti have bet on coke-to-gas technology. EnCana bet on North American gas; Talisman bet on global conventional oil and gas. Strategic Risk All of these choices involve significant strategic risk- the risk associated with major investment decisions that involve long time frames and uncertain outcomes. These are big, tough decisions because they are often company transforming. Think of a $ 10 billion investment in oil sands. It can take years to learn whether the decision is brilliant or a bust. Most difficult, the key factors influencing success are uncertain and are beyond the control of the company. Such factors cannot be analyzed away. No amount of research can resolve risks rising from political, technological, environmental or other factors. Expectations about the future that determine the consequences o...|$|R

The reviewer noted: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> keep the default software, it will cover your basic needs. Xubuntu comes with light weight desktop in XFCE 4.4 and also less tasking programs. If {{you are thinking}} that OpenOffice will come pre-installed on your desktop, you will be greatly surprised as AbiWord and Gnumeric are your default processor and spreadsheet program."

50|$|If, after {{learning}} how a Scottish trust deed works, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> go ahead, the necessary paperwork {{will have to}} be signed. There are two types of trust deed - protected and unprotected. An unprotected trust deed is not binding for a creditor (company or other) who doesn’t agree to the terms. A protected trust deed meanwhile is binding for the creditor, although they have a 5 week period in which to appeal. It’s {{in the interest of the}} trustee to have the trust deed protected, but it’s not essential. It is also worth noting that a trust deed debt must be a minimum of £5,000 to become protected.|$|R
40|$|The 21 st century invites a perhaps begrudging {{acceptance}} of the role that technology plays in {{almost every aspect of}} daily living. Nevertheless, when it comes to incorporating it into language classes, even the most accepting and forward-thinking teachers {{may not be able to}} make the right choices all the time. Indeed, every language teacher could benefit from asking the following pertinent questions (Berk, 2010) : How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> which technology <b>to</b> use in your classroom?; What criteria, if any, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> use to make an informed choice of technological tools?; Are these criteria related to the learners’ features, pedagogy, and learning outcomes?

30|$|The {{responses}} to the question “How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> what <b>to</b> teach and what not to teach?” show a similar variability. For example, a traditional response from the pre-development interviews comes from Hilary who stated “Well of course time is always a constraint…and then if there is extra time then I have more that I can teach”. She also noted, “I have topics that I {{want to make sure}} that I cover over the course of the semester”. This indicated a traditional adherence to syllabus and time constraints. A transitional response, such as John’s, from his pre-development interview where he declared “I think of what skills and knowledge in geology contribute to understanding…that’s what focuses my teaching, because majors make up 90  % of my class”. John’s statement described a distinct shift away from instructor-centered decisions and situational factors to thinking more about his students when he chooses class topics. A reformed response comes from Anne’s post-development interview when she described something she had done recently in one of her courses. She said “I kind of modified the class the second time around to give them [students] a lot more chances to practice peer teaching so that they felt more comfortable before teaching their own classes”. In this response, Anne not only considered the needs of her students, much like John, she also used that student-generated feedback to modify future iterations of her class.|$|R

What’s {{the window of}} time in which {{it should be a}} tax dollar priority to remove graffiti from walls in neighborhoods? When a friend asks you a question and you think the honest answer will hurt him or her, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> what <b>to</b> say? What strategy, or combination of strategies, would you support to keep a lily pad from completely covering the surface of a pond in the local park? Is it best to treat a child’s ear infection with antibiotics? If you had been an advisor to President Truman during World War II, what would your recommendation have been about use of the atomic bomb? Should manmade roads and picnic areas that have been destroyed by floodwaters in national parks be rebuilt, or should the areas be left to return to their reclaimed natural states? As an individual, how do I weigh the short-term versus long-term advantages of investing with fellow tax payers in the local infrastructure, versus keeping more of my money and investing personally in a privately-funded, visionary transportation plan? These questions call for the types of decisions adults typically make in their work, civic, or social lives. Rather than having our students wait until they are adults to grapple with such decisions, we need to offer learning environments in which they can develop thinking habits and techniques that will serve them throughout their adult lives as they experience the unforeseen problem-solving opportunitie...|$|R
30|$|Responses {{to three}} {{questions}} (How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{know when to}} move on to a new topic in class? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> what <b>to</b> teach and what not to teach? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know when your students understand a concept in class?) were the more likely to be coded as “traditional” in the pre-development interviews. When asked about when {{to move on to}} a new topic, the responses ranged from an instructor-centered response from Hilary during her pre-development interview that focused on schedule and time constraints “I really can’t spend more than the…on whatever topic we are scheduled before there is just so much material that needs to be covered”. Moving along the coding spectrum, we can examine a transitional response from Tyler’s pre-development interview that included the students in the decision about when to move on “I pause when they are producing some results…So there are sort of intermediate steps along the way that I can see if they identify this rock sample correctly…” Unlike Hilary’s response, Tyler based his decision to move on partly on the students. An example of a reformed, student-centered reply can be read in Ellen’s post-development interview response “In that case I might run the lecture over into the next time or have a couple of slides, because that’s the point is to get it and the that obviously helps me next time to redesign the lecture”. Ellen is not only considering whether or not students “get” the information but also verbalized the option of revisiting concepts and redesigning future lessons based on her current students’ experiences with the content.|$|R

Tolkien Self-organizing, structured peer-to-peer (p 2 p) overlay networks like CAN, Chord, Pastry and Tapestry offer a novel platform {{for a variety of}} scalable and decentralized distributed applications. These systems provide efficient and fault-tolerant routing, object location, and load balancing within a self-organizing overlay network. One major problem with these systems is how to bootstrap them. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> which overlay <b>to</b> join? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> find a contact node in the overlay to join? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> obtain the code that you should run? Current systems require that each node that participates in a given overlay supports the same set of applications, and that these applications are pre-installed on each node. In this position paper, we sketch the design of an infrastructure that uses a universal overlay to provide a scalable infrastructure to bootstrap multiple service overlays providing different functionality. It provides mechanisms to advertise services and to discover services, contact nodes, and service code. 1...|$|R
