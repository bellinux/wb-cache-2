5|$|The first attack upon Kobe was by one B-25 bomber {{as a part}} of the Dolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. With Japan's {{success in}} {{expanding}} its territory through south-east Asia at the time, an attack by <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> was not expected at the time and it was reported that some residents even waved flags at the plane as it flew overhead, thinking it was a Japanese aircraft. One resident of Hyogo ward was the only fatality of the bombing of Kobe on that day.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency {{conditions and}} conflicting {{pressures on the}} military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} combat {{involving}} the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940. In {{six days of}} aerial battles, eleven German aircraft were downed, {{with a loss of}} two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed. Following these incidents, on 6June, the chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, protested the attacks, claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake. Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government. In a second, more pointed demand on 19June, Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a flagrant act of aggression, and if these interceptions continued, Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation. The next day, General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and on 1July 1940, the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots, without admitting any had occurred. On 16 July, the German government declared that the events were settled. Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943, when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{modernisation}} in the VVS’ frontline strength {{had started to}} gain pace and strength. The alleged technical primitivism of Soviet aircraft is a myth.

Only 37 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1 and 201 MiG-3s were operational on 22 June, and only four pilots had been trained to fly them. The attempt to familiarise pilots with these types resulted in the loss of 141 pilots killed and 138 aircraft written off in accidents {{in the first quarter of}} 1941 alone. On 31 August, the first <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> arrived. The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was among those handed over but the Soviets did not have Russian-language manuals.

25|$|In January 1999 Airbus {{established}} a separate company, Airbus Military SAS, to undertake development {{and production of}} a turboprop-powered tactical transport aircraft, the Airbus Military A400M. The A400M is being developed by several NATO members, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the UK, {{as an alternative to}} relying on <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> for tactical airlift capacity, such as the Ukrainian Antonov An-124 Ruslan and the American C-130 Hercules. The A400M project has suffered several delays; Airbus has threatened to cancel the development unless it receives state subsidies.|$|E
25|$|After researching <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{such as the}} C-130J Super Hercules, C-17 Globemaster III, and Airbus A400M, the Japanese Ministry of Defense {{concluded}} that there was no aircraft in production that possessed the capabilities that the JASDF required. In response to this need, the Japanese MOD commenced the production of plans to develop an indigenously designed and manufactured transport aircraft. In 1995, Kawasaki appealed to the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) to issue funding {{for the development of a}} domestically-built C-X transport aircraft. In 2000, the JDA began forming its requirement for the replacement military airlifter; early determinations for the proposed project included that it would be powered by turbofan engines, possess the range to reach Hawaii from Japan, and carry double the payload of the C-130.|$|E

On 31 January 2014, {{the first day of}} Lunar New Year, Chinese media reported that the Chinese Naval Air Force of the East Sea Fleet scrambled two Su-30MKK jet fighters with missiles under wings to inspect, monitor, and expel <b>foreign</b> military <b>aircraft</b> entering the ADIZ. On February 1, the Japanese Defense Minister Onodera said [...] "While we are aware of the press report, we have no announcement to make as we did not find anything extraordinary to speak of" [...] at a press conference. The Chinese PLA Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan later confirmed that the intruding military aircraft belong(s) to JASDF. He also condemned Japan's provocation during the most important Chinese holidays.|$|R
25|$|By late 1965, British Eagle {{placed an}} order for two Boeing 707-320Cs. The aircraft, which were to be {{delivered}} in early 1967, were primarily intended for passenger and freight charters to the Far East and Australia. To avoid paying the 14% tax the British Government had imposed on imported, new <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> to protect competing British models, the airline needed to persuade the Board of Trade {{that there was no}} equivalent home-grown alternative. It also cited the Board's earlier decision to approve BOAC's application for an import duty waiver on two new Boeing 707-336Cs as a precedent. Despite being offered a mixed-traffic version of the Super VC10 and acknowledging that aircraft's superior passenger appeal, British Eagle favoured the 707-320C because of its greater payload and range. This made the 707 a more attractive aircraft for the kind of charter operations envisaged.|$|E
25|$|Around an hour later, the Zeppelin drifted {{low over}} the island, and Dutch units on the ground opened fire on her. The Netherlands was a neutral country and Dutch forces had {{standing}} orders to fire on overflying, <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A south wind blew the L 19 offshore and, some time during the night of 1–2 February, the Zeppelin came down in the North Sea. Loewe dropped a bottle into the sea, with a report on his situation and with letters to his family; this was found {{a few weeks later}} by a yacht near Gothenburg, Sweden. The German Navy put ships to sea that night to search for the L 19, but they only discovered one of her fuel-tanks, still containing fuel. This was likely dropped as a desperate measure to save weight and remain aloft.|$|E
25|$|That the Canberra was a <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{meant that}} its superiority {{in terms of}} {{performance}} did not guarantee political support, {{in spite of the}} urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs; there were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able to mesh with USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered when, in part due to its production lines being sustained at full capacity to meet orders from the Royal Air Force in addition to those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company, under which it was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing many of the political opponents that had opposed the project.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Eagle {{acquired}} {{the first three}} of an eventual six Douglas DC-6s for long-range charter and scheduled operations. These were the airline's first pressurised aircraft. They were also its first imported aircraft (the initial batch of three had been sourced from the US). This acquisition marked an important change regarding UK airlines' aircraft procurement policies as new legislation permitted (for the first time) that aircraft imported from abroad — usually American models — could be paid for in dollars. The {{lack of access to}} foreign exchange to finance overseas aircraft purchases prior to the change in legislation had compelled all private UK airlines to equip their fleets either with British-built civilian/ex-military aircraft or war-surplus, foreign-built military transport planes that had served with the RAF Transport Command — mainly Douglas Dakotas. Their state-owned counterparts had to seek Government dispensation to import <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which was only granted when no suitable British alternatives were available. These measures had been designed during the early post-war years to conserve as much of Britain's scarce US dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves as possible.|$|E
500|$|The Rogožarski IK-3 was a 1930s Yugoslav low-wing, monoplane, single-seat fighter with {{retractable}} landing gear, {{designed by}} Ljubomir Ilić, Kosta Sivčev and Slobodan Zrnić {{as a successor}} to the Ikarus IK-2 fighter. Its armament consisted of a hub-firing [...] autocannon and two fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. It was considered comparable to <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109E and came into service in 1940. The prototype crashed during testing, but a total of twelve production aircraft had been delivered by July 1940.|$|E
500|$|Flight testing resumed {{in early}} 1942 and the M-71-powered versions, which now {{included}} the re-engined first prototype, {{proved to be}} faster than the Messerschmitt Bf 109F by [...] at sea level and [...] at [...] with {{a top speed of}} [...] at that altitude. It was recommended for immediate production, even before it began combat trials in November 1942. All three aircraft were assigned to the 728th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 3rd Air Army of the Kalinin Front and were tightly controlled to prevent the loss of the prototypes. For example, all sorties had to be flown over Soviet-controlled territory and required the express permission of the 3rd Air Army staff to fly. Pilots' reports were quite enthusiastic; the 728th's commander, Captain Vasilyaka wrote: [...] "The I-185 outclasses both Soviet and <b>foreign</b> <b>aircraft</b> in level speed. It performs aerobatic maneuvers easily, rapidly and vigorously. The I-185 is the best current fighter from the point of control simplicity, speed, maneuverability (especially in climb), armament and survivability." ...|$|E
