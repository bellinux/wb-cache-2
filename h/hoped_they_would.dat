5|$|After his much publicized {{problems}} on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U–boat threat {{expected}} so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive {{was part of a}} wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. George Borrow was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, {{in the same manner as}} Q-ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> carry home the stigma of defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E
25|$|Wilder's {{force of}} some 4,000 men was paroled and {{directed}} to Bowling Green, where Bragg <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be {{a drain on}} Buell's supplies. The delay caused by the Confederate victory at Munfordville may well have cost them a much more important prize– Louisville.|$|E

25|$|Soldiers with uniforms {{showing the}} German flag, who {{identified}} themselves as German KSK, special forces, came to interrogate him.

25|$|Nicias, {{exhausted}} and suffering from illness, now believed {{it would be}} impossible to capture Syracuse. He wrote a letter to Athens, not trusting messengers to give an accurate report, and suggested that they either recall the expedition or send out massive reinforcements. He <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> choose to recall him, if not the whole expedition, but instead they chose to send reinforcements, under Demosthenes and Eurymedon. Eurymedon left immediately with ten ships, and Demosthenes left sometime later with a much larger force. Meanwhile, in early 413 BC Sparta acted on Alcibiades's advice to fortify Decelea, and the Athenian force sent to relieve it was destroyed.|$|E
500|$|While at school, Rimsky-Korsakov took {{piano lessons}} {{from a man}} named Ulikh. These lessons were sanctioned by Voin, who now served as {{director}} of the school, because he <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> help the youth to develop social skills and overcome his shyness. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that, while [...] "indifferent" [...] to lessons, he developed a love for music, fostered by visits to the opera and, later, orchestral concerts.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Brooks became {{increasingly}} reclusive and paranoid; she sank into a depression {{and refused to}} see the doctors Barney sent. [...] Bitter at Lahovary's presence during their last years, which she had <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> spend exclusively together, she finally broke off contact with Barney. [...] Barney continued to write to her, but received no replies. [...] Brooks died in December 1970, and Barney on February 2, 1972 of heart failure. They are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris, Île-de-France, France.|$|E
500|$|Revelation {{reveals that}} the {{brothers}} remained exiled on two different Ages for almost twenty years, where Atrus and Catherine <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> reform. In Revelation, Sirrus and Achenar escape their prisons, and Sirrus plans on swapping bodies with his sister Yeesha {{in order to learn}} the Art and kill his parents. Achenar, who has reformed during his imprisonment, instead works with the Stranger to save his sister. Sirrus is killed when the mind-switch fails; Achenar is fatally poisoned when he repairs the machinery to save his sister. [...] In Myst, Sirrus was played by Robyn Miller, and Achenar by brother Rand; in Revelation, the brothers are played by Brian Wrench and Guy Sprung, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Once an hour, in {{an attempt}} to fill the gap in their sector, they ran a jeep patrol up and down the line to stay in contact with units on their right and left flank and to detect any enemy movement. They <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be {{relieved}} soon: [...] "We weren't trained to occupy a defensive position in the front lines. We were trained to patrol and get information about the enemy," [...] Bouck said in an interview 60 years later. On the night of December 16, they heard the clanking of armor and the sound of vehicles in the distance; Bouck ordered his men to remain awake. The temperature ranged from [...] to the low [...] during the day.|$|E
60|$|A strange indefinable feeling between self-respect and shyness made Aurelia {{shrink from}} the point-blank {{question}} whether the ungrateful little things had acknowledged their obligations to her.

50|$|The shelter {{initially}} housed accommodation {{for over}} 150 dogs and at peak {{times more than}} 100 animals could be brought in each week.

Those of a better breed would be kept for longer in the <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be rehomed.|$|R
500|$|A special [...] "Wonderful World" [...] {{edition of}} the [...] "Gloss Silver" [...] Nintendo DS Lite was created and sold as a bundle with the game {{as part of its}} Japanese release. The game's early plot was adapted into a two-chapter {{one-shot}} manga by Shiro Amano, published over two issues of Monthly Shōnen Gangan. In North America, the manga has been released online via the Square Enix Members website, along with mobile phone ring tones. Both Nomura and Tatsuya Kando stated that they <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{be given the opportunity to}} create a sequel to the game. Neku, Shiki, Joshua, Beat, and Rhyme appear in the video game [...] as non-playable characters who are challenged to a task similar to the Reapers' Game. The cameos are the first non-Disney and non-Final Fantasy characters to appear in the Kingdom Hearts franchise.|$|E
500|$|Mullally {{revealed}} that the show's writing team was [...] "notorious for tinkering with the script's laugh lines", even during the actual taping of the episodes. She <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> resist that urge for the live episode. Messing, however, was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts; [...] "I have a gut feeling that, like, 10 minutes before we go they'll be like, 'Oh, no, no, you know what? Change this line to this. Now we're locked – go.'" [...] Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot {{and was unable to}} walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.|$|E
500|$|The Ferreira {{family are}} a fictional {{family from the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, that {{appeared}} on screen between 2003 and 2005. Created by Tony Jordan and introduced by Louise Berridge as a new Asian family, producers <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> become central to the show. However, after Indian actor Dalip Tahil {{was forced to leave}} due to a controversy over his work permit, a major plot involving the family had to be scrapped and was replaced with a kidney transplant storyline that was branded [...] "boring". It was later revealed that the dropped storyline involved Dan being murdered by his children and buried in a shallow grave. The characters were also called [...] "unrealistic", [...] "annoying", and [...] "unlikeable" [...] by many of the show's fans and critics. They were blamed for a decline in the show's viewing figures and were eventually axed by Kathleen Hutchison after bosses struggled to find storylines for the family. Jordan later admitted the family's members were [...] "the least successful characters [...] created".|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Kampfgruppe Auschwitz (Combat Group Auschwitz) was {{organized}} {{with the aim}} of sending out information about what was happening. Sonderkommandos buried notes in the ground, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be found by the camp's liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.|$|R
5000|$|An {{aspiring}} photographer friend {{took pictures}} of Porizkova {{and sent them to}} the Elite modeling agency in 1980, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> notice her own photography skills. However, instead of taking the photographer on board, Elite head John Casablancas noticed Porizkova's physical beauty and potential, and offered her a ticket to Paris.|$|R
50|$|Gustafson {{stated that}} his goal when writing Animal Orchestra {{was not for}} it to just be {{entertaining}} for children but also educational. His goal with Eddie: The Lost Youth of Edgar Allan Poe was to introduce young readers {{to the work of}} Edgar Allan Poe in <b>hopes</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> explore his writings.|$|R
500|$|Parker and Stone {{themselves}} were not entirely {{pleased with the}} final result of [...] "Margaritaville". Although they liked the idea, they felt the main storyline involving {{the economy and the}} subplot involving Stan and the Margaritaville blender did not come together in the end as the duo originally <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> when they started writing the script. Parker said of the episode, [...] "I give the concept on this an A, and the execution like a C-." [...] In its original American broadcast, [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was watched by 2.77 million overall households, according to the Nielsen Media Research, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said of the episode, [...] "The episode was the most back-handed endorsement imaginable of President Obama's economic bailout plan. Or the most withering dismantling of it. As usual, South Park had it both ways." [...] Tucker also said of Cartman's blaming the Jews for the recession, [...] "Among its many achievements, South Park has exposed anti-Semitism to such relentless ridicule over the years, it deserves some sort of humanitarian award." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. De Ferran stated that: [...] "I think first of all, I'd {{like to say that}} we're still running under {{a little bit of a}} cloud with all of the things that happened in the U.S. last week and what happened to (Alex) Zanardi is still in all of our minds." [...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter from Zap2it {{was pleased}} when Rose and Bernard {{returned}} in [...] "Greatest Hits". After this reappearance, Patrick Day from the Los Angeles Times <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be featured more often, saying [...] "If they brought these two back ... just to kill them, {{it will be}} anti-climactic". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called their return a [...] "sight-for-sore-eyes". Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune thought Rose was speaking for the fans when she said [...] "If you say 'live together, die alone' to me, Jack, I'm going to punch you in your face", and hoped Rose and Bernard would feature more often in future episodes. The couple were ranked twelfth in IGN's list of the top fifteen characters from the first three seasons. The critics from IGN also liked Rose's [...] "live together, die alone" [...] line, which they called [...] "both surprising comic relief and the stuff of solid character development; characters like Rose remember and evolve, even if they {{spend most of their}} time on the sidelines". The couple were called [...] "the unofficial heart of the show" [...] by the critics, who noted every appearance made by them was a welcome one. Erin Martell from TV Squad thought Rose's role in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] was [...] "awesome", because she asked all the questions fans have been asking.|$|E
50|$|Many growers {{resorted to}} their own methods in attempt to resolve the issue. Chemicals and {{pesticides}} were used to no avail.

None of these methods were successful.|$|R

50|$|The {{character}} of Henry Rush became famous for wearing sweatshirts from various American colleges and universities.
