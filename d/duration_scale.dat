40|$|We study inelastic {{resonant}} {{scattering of}} a Gaussian wave packet with the parameters {{close to a}} zero of the complex scattering coefficient. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that such near-zero scattering can result in anomalously-large time delays and frequency shifts of the scattered wave packet. Furthermore, we reveal a close analogy of these anomalous shifts with the spatial and angular Goos-Hänchen optical beam shifts, which are amplified via quantum weak measurements. However, in contrast to other beam-shift and weak-measurement systems, we deal with a one-dimensional scalar wave without any intrinsic degrees of freedom. It is the non-Hermitian nature {{of the system that}} produces its rich and non-trivial behaviour. Our results are generic for any scattering problem, either quantum or classical. As an example, we consider the transmission of an optical pulse through a nano-fiber with a side-coupled toroidal micro-resonator. The zero of the transmission coefficient corresponds to the critical coupling conditions.

40|$|The perceptual changes (PCs) {{associated}} with viewing an ambiguous figure like the Necker cube (NC) {{can be considered}} as a series of independent events in time. The time between successive PCs is then percept duration, and the frequency distribution of percepts plotted against duration is adequately modelled by a gamma distribution (Borsellino et al, 1972 Kybernetik 10 139 - 144). A logarithmic transformation on the <b>duration</b> <b>scale</b> enabled us to model the subsequent distribution with a Gaussian. The cumulative Gaussian fitted to the normalised ogive allowed simple comparison of observer performance in different conditions. We found no differences between ogives generated for the standard 'cube-up' and 'cube-down' 3 -D perceptual alternatives. When observers recorded 2 -D perceptual alternatives, the ogives were shallower and shifted to the right. This suggests that the neural mechanisms governing PCs between 3 -D and 2 -D perceptual alternatives differ from those that govern the PCs between the opposing 3 -D perceptual alternatives of 'cube-up' and 'cube-down'. Further, we show that the same analysis can be applied to reaction times generated in an inhibition-of-return (IOR) task.

40|$|A {{survey of}} Type II supernovae {{explosion}} models {{has been carried}} out to determine how their light curves and spectra vary with their mass, metallicity, and explosion energy. The presupernova models are taken from a recent survey of massive stellar evolution at solar metallicity supplemented by new calculations at subsolar metallicity. Explosions are simulated by the motion of a piston {{near the edge of the}} iron core and the resulting light curves and spectra are calculated using full multi-wavelength radiation transport. Formulae are developed that describe approximately how the model observables (light curve luminosity and <b>duration)</b> <b>scale</b> with the progenitor mass, explosion energy, and radioactive nucleosynthesis. Comparison with observational data shows that the explosion energy of typical supernovae (as measured by kinetic energy at infinity) varies by nearly an order of magnitude [...] from 0. 5 to 4. 0 x 10 ^ 51 ergs, with a typical value of ~ 0. 9 x 10 ^ 51 ergs. Despite the large variation, the models exhibit a tight relationship between luminosity and expansion velocity, similar to that previously employed empirically to make SNe IIP standardized candles. This relation is explained by the simple behavior of hydrogen recombination in the supernova envelope, but we find a sensitivity to progenitor metallicity and mass that could lead to systematic errors. Additional correlations between light curve luminosity, duration, and color might enable the use of SNe IIP to obtain distances accurate to ~ 20 % using only photometric data.

40|$|Abstract. A stream {{interaction}} region (SIR) forms when a fast solar stream overtakes a slow stream, leading to structure that evolves as an SIR {{moves away from}} the Sun. Based on Wind (1995 – 2004) and ACE (1998 – 2004) in situ observations, we have conducted a comprehensive survey of SIRs at one AU, including a separate assessment of the longer-lasting corotating {{interaction region}}s (CIRs) that recur on more than one solar rotation. In all there are 196 CIRs, accounting for about 54 % of the 365 SIRs. The largest proportion of CIRs to SIRs (64 %) appears in 1999, and the smallest proportion (49 %) is in 2002. Over the ten years, the annual number of SIR events varies little, from 32 up to 45. On average, the occurrence rate of shocks at SIRs at one AU is about 24 %. Seventy percent of the SIRs with shocks have only forward shocks, more than twice the percentage of SIRs with only reverse shocks. This preponderance of forward shocks is consistent with the deflections of forward and reverse shocks relative to the ecliptic plane. In order to help address the effect of SIRs and CIRs on geomagnetic activity, we determine the solar-cycle variation of the event <b>duration,</b> <b>scale</b> size, the change in velocity from slow stream to fast stream, and the solar-cycle variation of the maximum magnetic field, peak total perpendicular pressure, and other properties.

This standard procedure is recommended for measuring the distribution coefficient (K{sub d}) of a contaminant in a specific soil/groundwater system. One objective of the current tests was to identify experimental conditions {{that can be used in}} future interlaboratory studies to determine the reproducibility of the test method. This includes the recommendation of a standard soil, the range of contaminant concentrations and solution matrix, and various test parameters. Quantifying the uncertainty in the distribution coefficient that can be attributed to the test procedure itself allows the differences in measured values to be associated with differences in the natural systems being studied. Tests were conducted to measure the uptake of Cs and Sr dissolved as CsCl and Sr(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } in a dilute NaHCO{sub 3 }/SiO{sub 2 } solution (representing contaminants in a silicate groundwater) by a NIST standard reference material of San Joaquin soil (SRM 2709 a). Tests were run to measure the repeatability of the method and the sensitivity of the test response to the reaction time, the mass of soil used (at a constant soil-to-solution ratio), the solution pH, and the contaminant concentration. All {{tests were conducted}} in screw-top Teflon vessels at 30 C in an oven. All solutions were passed through a 0. 45 -{mu}m pore size cellulose acetate membrane filter and stabilized with nitric acid prior to analysis with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Scoping tests with soil in demineralized water resulted in a solution pH of about 8. 0 and the release of small amounts of Sr from the soil.

The pH values of all solutions were adjusted to about pH 8. 5 so that the effects of pH and concentration could be measured separately.

The dive durations of smaller turtles were equivalent to that of larger individuals despite their relatively smaller oxygen stores and higher mass specific metabolic rates.

Smaller turtles had a relatively higher cloacal bursae surface area than larger turtles, which allowed them to extract a relatively larger amount of oxygen from the water. By removing the ability to respire aquatically (hypoxic conditions), the dive duration of the smaller turtles significantly decreased restoring the normal positive relationship between body size and dive duration that is seen in other air-breathing vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Fast radio bursts (FRBs) with unknown origin emit a huge {{luminosity}} (about 1 Jy at 1 GHz) with a {{duration of}} milliseconds or less at extragalactic distances estimated from their large dispersion measure (DM). We propose herein a scenario for a collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD) as the progenitor of the FRBs by considering the burst <b>duration</b> <b>scaling</b> to the collision time and the radio luminosity proportional to the kinetic energy of the collision. The relations among the observed flux density, pulse width, and the DM are derived from the model and compared with the statistical results from the observed 28 FRBs. Although the sample is quite small, we tentatively report a nearly inverse-square correlation between the observed peak flux density and the DM excess, which is assumed to be dominated by the intergalactic medium. This result also implies a narrower distribution of intrinsic pulse widths than observed widths for the FRBs. A shorter burst is thus expected to be brighter in the model. The NS-WD collision scenario would explain only non-repeating FRBs but, if the remnant of the merger is a magnetized pulsar, it might also account for repeating FRBs.

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed that {{aftershock}} <b>duration</b> <b>scales</b> with the mainshock recurrence interval [Dieterich, 1994]. This implies a <b>scaling</b> between after-shock <b>duration</b> and mainshock magnitude. To see {{if such a}} scaling exist, we compare properties of aftershock sequences associated with mainshocks whose size span several magnitude units. Earthquake properties were examined along two northern California fault segments, one is the Calaveras fault, another is a northern segment of the San Andreas fault. The rst study area contains the rupture area of the M 6 : 2, 1984 Morgan Hill, and the latter is adjacent {{the southern end of}} the M 7 : 1, 1989 Loma Prieta rupture. Both the Morgan Hill and the Loma Prieta aftershock activities lasted 1 3 108 seconds. On the other hand, aftershock activities of small-to-moderate mainshocks lasted about 1 2 106 seconds. Nevertheless, there is no evidence for scaling between mainshock size and aftershock duration for moderate-to-small mainshocks. It thus seems that large earthquakes, because they break the entire seismogenic depth and interact with deeper parts of the crust, trig-ger a relaxation mechanism that is inactive during aftershock activity due to moderate-to-small quakes, and whose characteristic relaxation time is much longer than that of the brittle crust.

40|$|Background The Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) {{predicts that}} {{gestation}} duration, lactation duration, and their sum, total development time, are constrained by mass-specific {{basal metabolic rate}} such that they should scale with body mass with an exponent of 0. 25. However, tests of the MTE’s predictions have yielded mixed results. In an effort to resolve this uncertainty, we used phylogenetically-controlled regression to investigate the allometries of gestation duration, lactation duration, and total development time in four well-studied mammalian orders, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia. Results The results we obtained are {{not consistent with the}} predictions of the MTE. Gestation <b>duration</b> <b>scaling</b> exponents are below 0. 25 in all four orders. The scaling exponent for lactation duration is below 0. 25 in Carnivora and Rodentia, indistinguishable from 0. 25 in Artiodactyls, and steeper than 0. 25 in Primates. Total development time scales with body mass as predicted by the MTE in Primates, but not in artiodactyls, carnivores, and rodents. In the latter three orders, the exponent is 0. 15. Conclusions Together, these results indicate that the influence of basal metabolic rate on mammalian maternal investment durations must be more complicated than the MTE envisages, and that other factors must play an important role. Future research needs to allow for the possibility that different factors drive gestation duration and lactation duration, and that the drivers of the two durations may differ among orders...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{acknowledge}} the Natural Environment Research Council for support with this work (grant NER/A/S/ 2003 / 00616). Simple scaling arguments suggest that, among air-breathing divers, dive <b>duration</b> should <b>scale</b> approximately with mass to the one-third power. Recent phylogenetic analyses appear to confirm this. The same analyses showed that duration {{of time spent}} at the surface between dives has scaling {{very similar to that}} of dive duration, with the result that the ratio of dive duration to surface pause duration is approximately mass invariant. This finding runs counter to other arguments found in the diving literature that suggest that surface pause <b>duration</b> should <b>scale</b> more positively with mass, leading to a negative scaling of the dive-pause ratio. We use a published model of optimal time allocation in the dive cycle to show that optimal decisions can predict approximate mass invariance in the dive-pause ratio, especially if metabolism scales approximately with mass to the two-thirds power (as indicated by some recent analyses) and oxygen uptake is assumed to have evolved to supply the body tissues at the required rate. However, emergent scaling rules are sensitive to input parameters, especially to the relationship between the scaling of metabolism and oxygen uptake rate at the surface. Our results illustrate the utility of an optimality approach for developing predictions and identifying key areas for empirical research on the allometry of diving behavior.
