The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to develop an <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> in bright-field microscopy technique in order to support students ’ achievement of their intended learning outcomes. An <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> on bright-field microscopy technique was developed in CD-ROM format which included various elements: text, images, animations, video, and audio. Thirty first-year biomedicine students in Universiti Sains Malaysia attended a 3 -hour fixed laboratory session for conventional teaching and learning for bright-field microscopy technique. All subjects then answered a set of questionnaires. Subjects were provided with multimedia teaching and learning materials. After the task, all the subjects were given the second set of questionnaires to measure their level of acceptance and satisfaction with the <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system.</b> It is anticipated that the <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> in bright-field microscopy technique would be suitable as a supporting learning aid for the laboratory or practical session...|$|E

This problem consists of the problem of establishing identities in formal mathematical systems and hence is formally unsolvable. However, {{there is a way to}} cope with the issue. We suggest to reinforce the standard algorithm for function comparison with an additional pointwise checking procedure. An error might appear in this case. The article provides a detailed analysis of the probability of this error. It appears that the error probability is extremely low in most common cases. Generally speaking, this means that such an additional checking procedure can be quite successfully used in order to support standard algorithms for functions comparison.

30|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the problem-posing process and reveals the trends of the process. Problem-posing activities could provide us with valuable insight into a learner’s understanding of mathematical concepts and processes. Studies in this area suggest that problem posing has {{a positive influence on}} a learner’s ability to solve problems. There is significant improvement in the problem-solving performance of learners. In addition, problem posing could guide learners to achieve understanding of mathematical concepts. Technology-enhanced learning has been developed to realize and actively promote learning by problem posing. Several methods of problem-posing activities on an <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> have been proposed, such as posing questions, learning from examples, and learning by problem posing as sentence integration. Additionally, considerable studies have been analyzing the results of posed problems and the learning effects. Moreover, investigational studies that examine the process of a learner’s activities in an <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> to reveal behavior have been conducted, and deep examination of learner behaviors may make beneficial contributions to the educational technology field with the adoption of process analysis. This study investigates the problem-posing processes of Japanese elementary students in actual classes by analyzing the log files of the learners’ problem-posing activities on a computer-based learning system with sentence integration, which is called Monsakun.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} reports research {{concerning the}} adaptation of <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> to students' different learning styles (LSs), particularly {{in relation to the}} analysis and planning of <b>Interactive</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILSs). Given the primacy of <b>Interactive</b> <b>Learning</b> and its pedagogical implication on educational designs, the motivation for this research is better understanding of students' different learning preferences and perceptions of Computer Mediated Learning Interactions (CMLIs), as this may present some insights into what and how interactivity can be incorporated more purposefully and efficiently into <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> designs. This research undertakes {{a review of the literature}} relating to LSs' theories, which have been used to explore how individual learners approach learning, as well as different Learning Interactions in relation to <b>Interactive</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILSs). The work undertaken in this research makes its contribution to the field in that it represents one of the first explicit investigations of the relationship between students' LSs (Active-Reflective/Visual Verbal dimensions) and their attitude towards different CMLIs that constitute essential part of ILSs, in terms of use, perceptions and learning preferences, from the users' (learners) perspective rather than the teachers and/or designers of these systems. The research provides evidence to support the differing views of learners of different LSs as well as evidence of common attitudes towards certain CMLIs. However, it warns against and highlights some of the limitations of using the LSs in isolation and the importance of considering other factors and aspects of students' individual differences. A model is proposed to guide the planning and design of ILSs, and to raise the designers' and teachers' awareness of learners' differences and call upon them to take necessary steps to consider actual learners' LSs in the learning design. Implications of the findings in terms of interactivity design considerations are discussed; research limitations and recommendations for future work are made.
