5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing into the wall at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|President Warren G. Harding visited Fairbanks in 1923 {{as part of}} a trip {{to hammer}} in the {{ceremonial}} final spike of the railroad at Nenana. The rail yards of the Tanana Valley Railroad were converted for use by the Alaska Railroad, and Fairbanks became the northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and its second-largest depot.|$|E

5|$|The route was {{approved}} {{and the bill}} received royal assent on 28 March 1893 as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1893.

The depot {{would have been at}} the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at James Street and Lower Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} {{the entire length of the}} line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E

The south end of the steam railway was at the east end of the Stark Street ferry between Portland and East Portland on the Willamette River. The north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was at a landing on the Columbia that served ferries traveling between Oregon and Vancouver, Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Transit Authority {{displaced}} the Carlton Midway Inn {{to open a}} new CTA terminal at {{the airport}} on October 31, 1993, for the new Chicago 'L' Orange Line that connected Midway to Chicago's Loop. Midway Airport is the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> which crosses the southwest part of the city before ending at the Loop. The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00am to 1:00am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. The trip from Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The head {{linesman}} {{is positioned}} on one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage. He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen {{on his side}} of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.|$|E

50|$|At <b>the</b> far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's <b>Lines</b> is <b>the</b> Queen's <b>Lines</b> Battery, which mounted one 12-pdr between 1781-1834. The gun {{was then}} {{replaced}} by an 8-inch brass howitzer, and between 1859-89 a ten-inch howitzer and three 24-pdr carronades were mounted there. Behind <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> three tunnels called <b>the</b> Queen's <b>Lines</b> Galleries were dug out in 1789 to provide bomb-proof shelters. At <b>the</b> eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines,</b> Queen's Advance and Queen's Lookout (built in 1727) provide views out over the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain.|$|R
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, {{the line of}} scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired {{at the end of a}} quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|The line shares tracks {{with the}} Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza northward to Fort Totten. It {{is a quick}} link between {{downtown}} Washington and National Airport, and shares nearly all of its track with either the Green or Blue Line. The Yellow Line has only two stations that are not shared by any other lines (Eisenhower Avenue and Huntington), and only two sections of track that are not shared by any other lines – the section at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> and the section between the Pentagon and L'Enfant Plaza stations, crossing the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The newly established, {{strategically}} strong defensive British line {{remained in}} place until mid September 1918 when the advance to Damascus and Aleppo, which ended the war in this theatre, took place. It stretched across from the Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of Jerusalem. The line was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E
25|$|By dark, the {{fighting}} had petered out on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> Union assault had cost it 2,200 casualties, versus about 1,800 for the Confederates, but some progress had been made. They almost broke <b>the</b> Confederate <b>line,</b> {{which was now}} pinned in place with Union entrenchments being dug only yards away. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generals, including Upton and Meade, were furious at Grant for ordering an assault without proper reconnaissance.|$|R
25|$|Most {{heritage}} railways {{only have}} short lines {{and do not}} often have turntables at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> A tank locomotive has good visibility for the driver in both directions. As the trains being hauled are usually light, the tank locomotive is more fuel efficient than a large tender locomotive.|$|R

5|$|The second route {{would have}} {{originated}} in Fort Hamilton {{at the south}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Similar to the 1890 proposal, it would have followed the routing of the current Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (constructed from 1959 to its opening in 1964). The Fort Hamilton proposal was the shortest route of the two, though it would require tunneling through deeper waters. As part of the proposal, {{it was suggested that}} the Fourth Avenue Line be extended past its original terminal at 86th Street in Bay Ridge to a temporary ferry terminal at 95th Street (now the 95th Street Station).|$|E
5|$|While a {{contestant}} {{is in the}} vault, contestants who {{are waiting}} in the line play various mini-games. The games played include passing ten people in the line through a hula-hoop; if successful, those ten move straight {{to the beginning of}} the line. Other challenges include two teams of five working as a group to move a beach ball across a track and offering random contestants the opportunity to open a red envelope that can send them to the beginning or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of {{widespread}} and determined Turkish counterattacks fought from 27 November to 1 December by the 7th Turkish Army they evacuated Jerusalem. Troops from the Australian Mounted Division were the first mounted troops to enter Jerusalem in December 1917. Towards the end of December the British Empire forces at the Battle of Jaffa and the Defence of Jerusalem succeeded in pushing the Turkish armies north. A strong British defensive line was established which remained in place until mid September 1918. The line stretched across from well north of the Nahr el Auja on the Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of Jerusalem. It was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E

5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three {{sections}} {{that are not}} are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and the northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from {{just east of the}} Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a new test track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E
5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built {{a number of}} stations at the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M, which provided only a single-platform station {{at the end of}} its line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E
