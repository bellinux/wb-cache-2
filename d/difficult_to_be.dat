Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his work}} on the Smithsonian, but before the Scott Building {{finished}} construction, Alexander traveled to New England, where he was assigned to a project at the entrance of Boston harbor. That project, the rebuilding of Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, was widely considered {{to be one of the}} most <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attempted by the U.S. Government up to that time. Designed by Brigadier General Joseph Totten, head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lighthouse was intended to replace a structure that had been destroyed in an 1851 storm. With multiple ships wrecking on the ledge annually, the need for a lighthouse was crucial. Appointed superintendent of the lighthouse construction in April 1855, newly promoted Captain Alexander modified Totten's design in accordance with conditions at the site. Because the site of the lighthouse was continually awash, except at low tide and calm seas, the work of preparing the interlocking granite blocks and iron framework of the lighthouse was done at nearby Government Island, adjacent to Cohasset, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|It {{has already}} proven <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{recognized}} as having standing when a fix {{is not used}} for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E

The market for literary works was small and it was only possible to make a living by writing virtually non-stop. Heine was incapable of doing this so he never had enough money to cover his expenses.

Behind this lies an extensive, at least 30-meter-wide anti-infantry entanglement, which is a mixed system of apron fences, wire concertinas, electric fences, traps, mines, nail spikes and spike pits. Both elements are well camouflaged by good location (relief) and by plants (e.g. small height bushes in front of ditches).|$|E

25|$|Therefore, it is {{suggested}} to follow the following rule of thumb: the dates from de Graaf and Ricklefs for the period before the Siege of Batavia can be accepted as best guess. For the period after the Siege of Batavia (1628–29) until the first War of Succession (1704), the years of events in which foreigners participated can be accepted as certain, but–again- are not always consistent with Javanese version of the story. The events in the period 1704–1755 can be dated with greater certainty since in this period the Dutch interfered deeply in Mataram affairs but events behind kraton walls are in general <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dated precisely.|$|E

The route he discovered in 1793 — ascending the West Road River and descending the Bella Coola River — opened up new sources of fur but proved to be too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> practicable as a trading route to the Pacific. Fraser was thus given responsibility for extending operations to the country west of the Rockies in 1805.

25|$|Caesar is {{the primary}} source for the {{location}} of the Eburones. The exact borders are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> certain about, but the region that they and their fellow Germani inhabited corresponds to some extent with the later Roman district of Germania Inferior, enclosed by the northern bend of the river Rhine, and including a stretch of the Meuse river (Dutch: Maas) stretching from the Ardennes until the river deltas of the Rhine and Meuse. In the early medieval church this evolved into the original church province of Cologne (later stretching beyond the Rhine), which included the Diocese of Liège that had evolved from the Civitas Tungrorum. This large area included large parts of what are now the southern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, and the German Rhineland.|$|E

Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip-synching tracks, believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show.
