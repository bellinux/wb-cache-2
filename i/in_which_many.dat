5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just before he left the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E

5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> of its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{geographic}} {{location of the}} city, {{with respect to the}} principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E
5|$|Allen played less {{frequently}} in 1932, {{even though he}} wanted to secure {{a place in the}} MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932–33 season. He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games, but did not play in the season's only Test match. His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> of those involved were potential selections for the touring team; he took eight wickets in the game, and after the second trial was named in the MCC team. The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed, and there were several who criticised the selectors. He was low in the national batting and bowling averages; critics pointed out his infrequent appearances in first-class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour. Having been named in the team, Allen did not play again in the season. In eight first-class matches, he scored 113 runs at 11.30 and took 25 wickets at 25.36.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{atypical}} scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, American Dad! has {{a controversial}} season number discrepancy <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> are divided {{as to how}} many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between American Dad! creators and the show's official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website. At Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, American Dad! co-creator Mike Barker hinted that an American Dad! movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. What with Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear {{if any of these}} plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.|$|E
5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He beat his own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921. The tournament was {{gradually}} expanded, and by 1921 it cost $5,800 to arrange. That year, Henry Hall set a world length record in the hill, jumping 70meters (229ft). Three thousand spectators watched the games, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> of the world's elite skiers competed. To accommodate the extra spectators, Canadian Pacific Railway stationed sleeping cars at Revelstoke to supplement the hotels. In 1922, Isabel Coursier debuted as Big Hill's first women jumper. In 1923, the tournament climaxed with 99 participating ski jumpers. In 1925, while sick with the flu, Nelsen beat Hall's world record by jumping 73meters (240ft). The record would remain until 1930.|$|E
5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E

5|$|For many {{maritime}} indigenous cultures {{throughout the}} North Pacific, especially the Ainu in the Kuril Islands, the Koryaks and Itelmen of Kamchatka, the Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, the Haida of Haida Gwaii {{and a host}} of tribes on the Pacific coast of North America, the sea otter has played an important role as a cultural, as well as material, resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the sea otter was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea otter pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea otter bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea otter baculum as a medicine for fever.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was {{repopulated}} with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location. The ultimate {{origin of the}} name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from {{the name of the}} high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning shore, or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning beautiful shore.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike {{in the rest of the}} state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{attributed}} his recall to Moscow {{to mental}} disorder {{on the part}} of Stalin, who feared conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated Leningrad case, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason. Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.|$|E
5|$|More widely, 1936 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the Great Terror, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>many</b> of the composer's friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed. These included his patron Marshal Tukhachevsky (shot months after his arrest); his brother-in-law Vsevolod Frederiks (a distinguished physicist, who was eventually released but died before he got home); his close friend Nikolai Zhilyayev (a musicologist who had taught Tukhachevsky; shot shortly after his arrest); his mother-in-law, the astronomer Sofiya Mikhaylovna Varzar (sent to a camp in Karaganda); his friend the Marxist writer Galina Serebryakova (20 years in camps); his uncle Maxim Kostrykin (died); and his colleagues Boris Kornilov and Adrian Piotrovsky (executed).
