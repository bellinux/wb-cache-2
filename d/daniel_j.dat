5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor <b>Daniel</b> <b>J.</b> Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{constant}} threat by Japanese aircraft and warships, {{it was difficult for}} Allied forces to resupply their forces on Guadalcanal, which were often under attack from Imperial land and sea forces in the area. In early November 1942, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field in another attempt. Therefore, the U.S. sent Task Force67 (TF67)—a large reinforcement and re-supply convoy, split into two groups and commanded by Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner—to Guadalcanal on 11 November. The supply ships were protected by two task groups—commanded by Rear Admirals <b>Daniel</b> <b>J.</b> Callaghan and Norman Scott—and aircraft from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The transport ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November near Guadalcanal by Japanese aircraft based at Buin, Bougainville, in the Solomons, but most were unloaded without serious damage. Twelve Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the U.S. ships or by fighter aircraft flying from Henderson Field.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with <b>Daniel</b> <b>J.</b> Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E
