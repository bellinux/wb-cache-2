5|$|Within Oryzomyini, a 2006 phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Marcelo Weksler which used both morphological and DNA sequence data found {{some evidence that}} Oryzomys is most closely related to a group including Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. Although analyses based on morphological and combined data supported this relationship, sequences of the Rbp3 gene alone instead placed Oryzomys among a group that included Nectomys, Sigmodontomys, {{and a few other}} genera. In all analyses, Oryzomys appeared within clade D of Oryzomyini. The relationship between Oryzomys and the Holochilus group was supported by five synapomorphies (shared derived characters)—absence or reduction of both the <b>hypothenar</b> and interdigital pads; reduction of ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the claws; having the back margin of the zygomatic plate of the skull at the same level as the front of the first upper molar; and the anterocone (front cusp) of the first upper molar divided by an anteromedian fossette. The first three are adaptations to the semiaquatic lifestyle that Oryzomys {{and the members of the}} Holochilus group share, and may thus be examples of convergent evolution.|$|E

500|$|Euryoryzomys emmonsae is {{a fairly}} large, long-tailed rice rat with long, soft fur. The hairs on the back are [...] long. It {{generally}} resembles E.nitidus in these and other characters, but has a longer tail. E.macconnelli is slightly larger and has longer and duller fur. In E.emmonsae, the upperparts are tawny brown, but a bit darker on the head because many hairs have black tips. The hairs of the underparts are gray at the bases and white at the tips; overall, the fur appears mostly white. In most specimens, there is a patch on the chest where the gray bases are absent. The longest of the vibrissae (whiskers) of the face extend slightly beyond the ears. The eyelids are black. The ears are covered with small, yellowish brown hairs and appear dark brown overall. The feet are covered with white hairs above and brown below. There are six pads on the plantar surface, but the <b>hypothenar</b> is reduced. The ungual tufts, tufts of hair which surround the bases of the claws, are well-developed. The tail is like the body in color above, and mostly white below, but in the [...] nearest the tail tip it is brown below.|$|E
500|$|Merriam divided his palustris-mexicanus {{group in}} two [...] "series" [...] {{according}} {{to the color of}} the underparts (white or [...] ). Goldman divided his palustris group in two [...] "sections"—a couesi section with O.couesi and six related species, and a palustris section with O.palustris only. He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker, more brownish, longer fur, and larger sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate). As Weksler's 2006 analysis included only O.couesi and the marsh rice rat among species of Oryzomys in the strict sense, he could not test those groups. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred with Goldman's division, listing additional characters, and noted that the palustris group may be more semiaquatically adapted than the members of the couesi group are. In the latter, the fur is usually reddish-brown, as opposed to grayish-brown in the palustris group. Members of the couesi group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{in the side of the}} skull above the molars, and a more highly developed anterolabial cingulum on the third lower molar (a crest at the front of the tooth). The <b>hypothenar</b> pad of the hindfoot, located on the sole far from the fingers, is present in the couesi group, but absent in the palustris group. Interdigital webbing may be more highly developed in the palustris group. Using morphological data, Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between O.couesi and O.gorgasi to the exclusion of O.palustris, but with low confidence. The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the palustris and couesi groups, but a Costa Rican sample (assigned to O.couesi) was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other.|$|E

50|$|The flexor digiti minimi brevis is one {{of three}} muscles in the <b>hypothenar</b> muscle group. These three muscles form the fleshy mass {{at the base of the}} little finger, and are solely {{concerned}} with the movement of digit V. The other two muscles that make up the <b>hypothenar</b> muscle group are the abductor digiti minimi and the opponens digiti minimi. From anatomical position medial to lateral is the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and opponens digiti minimi.|$|E

50|$|Palmaris brevis is a thin, {{quadrilateral}} muscle, placed {{beneath the}} integument of the ulnar {{side of the}} hand. It acts to fold {{the skin of the}} <b>hypothenar</b> eminence transversally.|$|E
50|$|The flexor digiti minimi brevis is a <b>hypothenar</b> {{muscle in}} the hand that flexes the little finger (digit V) at the metacarpophalangeal joint. It lies lateral to the {{abductor}} digiti minimi.|$|E
5000|$|The ulnar canal or ulnar tunnel (also {{known as}} Guyon's canal or tunnel) is a {{semi-rigid}} longitudinal canal in the wrist that allows {{passage of the}} ulnar artery and ulnar nerve into the hand. [...] The roof of the canal {{is made up of}} the superficial palmar carpal ligament, while the deeper flexor retinaculum and <b>hypothenar</b> muscles comprise the floor. The space is medially bounded by the pisiform and pisohamate ligament more proximally, and laterally bounded by the hook of the hamate more distally. It is approximately 4 cm long, beginning proximally at the transverse carpal ligament and ending at the aponeurotic arch of the <b>hypothenar</b> muscles.|$|E
50|$|The volar digital veins on each finger are {{connected}} to the dorsal digital veins by oblique intercapitular veins. They drain into a venous plexus which is situated over the thenar and <b>hypothenar</b> eminences and across the front of the wrist.|$|E

50|$|The opponens digiti minimi (opponens digiti quinti {{in older}} texts) is a muscle in the hand. It is of a {{triangular}} form, and placed immediately beneath the palmaris brevis, abductor minimi digiti, and flexor brevis minimi digiti. It {{is one of}} the three <b>hypothenar</b> muscles that controls the little finger.|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} muscle groups are the thenar (thumb) and <b>hypothenar</b> (little finger) muscles; the interossei muscles (four dorsally and three volarly) originating between the metacarpal bones; and the lumbrical muscles {{arising from the}} deep flexor (and are special {{because they have no}} bony origin) to insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Scolomys ucayalensis has a head-and-body {{length of}} between 80 and 90 mm and a tail around 83% of this. The head is small but broad with a pointed snout and small rounded ears. The fur {{is a mixture}} of fine hairs and thicker, {{flattened}} spines. The dorsal surface is some shade of reddish-brown to reddish-black, sometimes grizzled or streaked with black, and the underparts are grey. The tail is nearly naked, and the hind feet are small but broad. The <b>hypothenar</b> pad (next to the outer digit on the sole of the foot) is either absent or reduced in size on the hind feet, and this contrasts with the otherwise similar Scolomys melanops which has well-developed <b>hypothenar</b> pads. The karyotype of S. ucayalensis has 2n = 50 and FN = 68, while that of S. melanops has 2n = 60, FN = 78.|$|E
50|$|The {{abductor}} digit minimi develops at {{an early}} stage from an ulnar muscle primordium of the superficial layer of the original undifferentiated mesenchyme of the hand, together with the flexor digitorum superficialis (medial primordia) and the abductor pollicis brevis (radial). In contrast, the remaining <b>hypothenar</b> muscles are derived from the deep layer at a later stage.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, split hand {{syndrome}} is a neurological syndrome {{in which the}} hand muscles {{on the side of}} the thumb (lateral, thenar eminence) appear wasted, whereas the muscles {{on the side of the}} little finger (medial, <b>hypothenar</b> eminence) are spared. Anatomically, the abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous muscle are more wasted than the abductor digiti minimi.|$|E
50|$|The ear has a helical margin that {{is pulled}} upward and towards the back. The {{anterior}} superior margins are rolled. Tragus and antitragus are small, lobulated and equal in size. The manus {{has a unique}} raided pads; the interdigital pads are separated from the palm by a structure called deep flex urge line. The palm consist of two elongated central pads, a <b>hypothenar</b> pad and a thenar pad.|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, the {{abductor}} digiti minimi (abductor minimi digiti, abductor digiti quinti, ADM) is a {{skeletal muscle}} {{situated on the}} ulnar border of the palm of the hand. It forms the ulnar border of the palm and its spindle-like shape defines the <b>hypothenar</b> eminence of the palm together with the skin, connective tissue, and fat surrounding it. Its main function is to pull the little finger {{away from the other}} fingers (i.e. abduction).|$|E
50|$|The flexor digiti minimi brevis, {{like other}} <b>hypothenar</b> muscles, is innervated by the deep {{branch of the}} ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve arises from the spinal nerve levels C8-T1. The spinal roots of C8 and T1 then merge to form the lower trunk, {{anterior}} division, medial cord, and finally produce the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve has a superficial and deep branch, {{but it is the}} deep branch that innervates the flexor digiti minimi brevis.|$|E
5000|$|Skin: The pigment is {{deposited}} {{throughout the}} skin but only becomes apparent in certain locations where the concentration is great {{enough to be}} seen clinically. This usually occurs in areas where connective tissue is thick (joints, tympanic membrane) or {{close to the surface}} of the skin (thenar and <b>hypothenar</b> eminences and the sides of the fingers). In exogenous ochronosis, the hyperpigmentation is localized to the area where the inciting agent is applied. Intradermal nevi can appear like blue nevi.|$|E
50|$|Trisomy 21 (Down {{syndrome}}): People with Down syndrome have {{a finger}} print pattern with mainly ulnar loops, and a significantly different angle between the triradia a, t and d (the 'adt angle'). Other differences often include a single transverse palmar crease ("Simian line") (in 50%), and {{patterns in the}} <b>hypothenar</b> and interdigital areas, lower ridge counts along digital midlines, especially in little fingers, which corresponds to finger shortening in those with Down syndrome. There is less variation in dermatoglyphic patterns between people with Down syndrome than between controls, and dermatoglyphic patterns {{can be used to}} determine correlations with congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome by examining the left hand digit ridge count minus the right hand digit ridge count, and the number of ridges on the fifth digit of the left hand.|$|E
50|$|Klumpke's {{paralysis}} {{is a form}} of paralysis {{involving the}} muscles of the forearm and hand, resulting from a brachial plexus injury in which the eighth cervical (C8) and first thoracic (T1) nerves are injured either before or after they have joined to form the lower trunk. The subsequent paralysis affects, principally, the intrinsic muscles of the hand (notably the interossei, thenar and <b>hypothenar</b> muscles) and the flexors of the wrist and fingers (notably flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus). Forearm pronators and wrist flexors may be involved, as may dilators of the iris and elevators of the eyelid (both of which may be seen in the case of associated Horner's syndrome). The classic presentation of Klumpke's palsy is the “claw hand” where the forearm is supinated and the wrist and fingers are flexed. If Horner syndrome is present, there is miosis (constriction of the pupils) in the affected eye.|$|E
