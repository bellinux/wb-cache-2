500|$|According to the White House, the {{incoming}} Clinton administration had heard reports of irregularities in the Travel Office and possible kickbacks {{to an office}} employee from a charter air company. [...] They looked at a review by KPMG Peat Marwick which discovered that Dale kept an off-book ledger, had $18,000 of unaccounted-for checks, and kept chaotic office records. [...] White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and the White House counsels thus decided to fire the Travel Office staff and reorganize it. [...] The actual terminations were done on May 19, 1993, by White House <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> David Watkins. [...] There was also a feeling among the White House and its supporters that the Travel Office had never been investigated by the media due to its close relationship with press corps members and the plush accommodations it afforded them and favors it did for them. (Congress would later discover that in October 1988, a whistleblower within the Travel Office had alleged financial improprieties; the Reagan White House counsel looked into the claim but took no action.) ...|$|E

500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know {{that there would be}} hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played no role in the firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E

Terry Dolan, who worked as <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> under Romney and several other governors, has said that scrubbing the servers was a common practice but that selling the hard drives was not. When news of the actions became widely known in 2011, a Romney spokesperson said that the purchase of the computer equipment [...] "complied with the law and longtime executive branch practice." [...] State government officials and aides to Romney's three predecessors as governor said that they did not know of any prior sales of hard drives to staffers.
