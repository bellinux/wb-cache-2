I will say in passing that I don't believe there is another scout in the West that would have brought a full bottle of whiskey 300 miles." ...|$|E

He walked in Paradise among the trees of the garden, Amyas; and so will we, and be content with what He sends. Why should we long for the next world, before we are fit even for this one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] she declared. [...] "I haven't {{had such}} a {{wonderful}} five minutes since I can remember! You are a dear to <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me,</b> Sir Timothy." ...|$|R

6000|$|The queen smiled--her teeth sparkled like pearls. [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> to life, then I am yours," [...] she said, and {{she kissed}} him upon the lips.|$|R
60|$|In the end, just as I {{was about}} to trek seawards, an old friend, Maputa, turned up at my wagons--that same man who <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> the message from Panda before we started to attack Bangu.|$|E
60|$|What {{amazed me}} {{was that he did}} not seem to be shocked by the revelation near as much as I had feared. So this matter <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> {{happiness}} where I looked for nothing but sorrow.|$|E
