5|$|Numerous game {{players have}} also {{reported}} problems with static shocks to the X-Plorer guitars causing various fret buttons (usually the green one) to permanently malfunction. Multiple exchanges of guitars have not solved the problem, as exchanged guitars also exhibit the problem. To date, RedOctane has not solved the problem, and <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> to extend warranties to replacement guitars, time limiting the warranty {{back to the}} original date of purchase.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, {{with a couple of}} units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> to comment on the issue.|$|E

5|$|The US National Marine Fisheries Service <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> {{a permit}} for Marine World Africa USA on one {{occasion}} to import four False Killer Whales caught in a Japanese drive hunt. In recent years, dolphins from the Japanese drive hunts have been exported to China, Taiwan and to Egypt. On multiple occasions, members of the International Marine Animal Trainers Association (IMATA) have also been observed at the drive hunts in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E

Also, he <b>had</b> <b>refused</b> to let the boys pay his fine.|$|R
5|$|The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on {{the side}} of the Central Powers and was {{ultimately}} defeated. During the war, the empire's Armenians were deported to Syria as part of the Armenian Genocide. As a result, an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 Armenians were killed. The Turkish government <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> to acknowledge the events as genocide and claims that Armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone. Genocidal campaigns were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the Assyrians and Greeks. Following the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, the victorious Allied Powers sought to partition the Ottoman state through the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament is also {{responsible}} for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion {{it led to the}} resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the budgetary power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission. Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the European External Action Service, Parliament has a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in 1828, Paris. Sebastian, now the {{intelligent}} but immoral 3rd Marquess of Dain, meets his match in Miss Jessica Trent, who has {{arrived in the}} city to rescue her unintelligent, nearly penniless brother Bertie from Dain's bad influence. Dain and Jessica are instantly attracted to the other, though each seeks to hide their feelings. Dain has developed a hard, sarcastic personality; he is hostile to noblewomen, as he believes they care only for money. Jessica, a 27-year-old beautiful, strong-willed bluestocking, <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> dozens of marriage proposals over the years and wishes to maintain her independence.|$|E

5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels {{in the wider}} world. She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy woman who <b>has</b> <b>refused</b> to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although {{most studies}} report high {{frequencies}} of consent to HIV tests, {{critics argue that}} clients are subject to pressure, that acceptors later indicate they could not <b>have</b> <b>refused,</b> and that provider-initiated HIV testing raises serious ethical issues. We examine the meaning of consent and why clients think they could not <b>have</b> <b>refused.</b> Methods: Clients in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda were asked about consenting to HIV tests, whether {{they thought they could}} <b>have</b> <b>refused</b> and why. Textual responses were analyzed using qualitative and statistical methods. Results: Among 926 respondents, 77 % reported they could not have said no, but in fact, 60 % actively consented to test, 24 % had no objection and only 7 % tested without consent. There were few significant associations between categories of consent and their covariates. Conclusions: Retrospectively asking clients if they could <b>have</b> <b>refused</b> to test for HIV overestimates coercion. Triangulating qualitative and quantitative data suggests a considerable degree of agency...|$|R
