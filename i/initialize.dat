5|$|Instead of {{an eighth}} dual-GPU video card, the single-GPU GTX 275 {{is in the}} {{computer}} because, {{out of all the}} video cards in the Fastra II, the GTX 275 is the only one the Fastra II's BIOS can fully <b>initialize.</b> The total amount of GPUs is 13. The video cards together bring 12 teraflops of computing power. Four of the six GTX 295 video cards have 2 PCBs, while the other two have only 1 PCB.|$|E

She is {{prevented}} by Professor, Erik, Hank, and Wolverine, but Erik decides to kill her as {{the surest way to}} prevent the apocalyptic future. Hank intervenes and exposes himself, Erik, and Mystique as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President Richard Nixon to <b>initialize</b> the Sentinel program.|$|E

5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to <b>initialize</b> a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E

B(x) is a copy of the last C(x) since L was updated and <b>initialized</b> to 1. b is a copy of the last discrepancy d (explained below) since L was updated and <b>initialized</b> to 1. m is the number of iterations since L, B(x), and b were updated and <b>initialized</b> to 1.|$|R

25|$|A {{constructor}} is {{a special}} method that is called automatically when an object is created. Its purpose is to <b>initialize</b> {{the members of the}} object. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not return anything. They may take parameters like any other method.|$|E

25|$|A stored-program {{computer}} {{requires an}} initial computer program stored in its read-only memory to boot.

25|$|The {{basic problem}} is that the {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory. And by the time it finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and <b>initialize)</b> non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E
25|$|The {{developer}} of an installer package may write code {{to serve their}} own purpose, delivered as a DLL, EXE, VBScript or JavaScript. This can be executed during the installation sequences, including when the user clicks a button in the user interface, or during the InstallExecuteSequence. Custom Actions typically validate product license keys, or <b>initialize</b> more complex services. Developers should normally provide inverse custom actions for use during uninstall.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} code {{defines a}} class named Person. In addition to <b>initialize,</b> the usual constructor {{to create new}} objects, it has two methods: one to override the <=> comparison operator (so Array#sort can sort by age) {{and the other to}} override the to_s method (so Kernel#puts can format its output). Here, attr_reader is an example of metaprogramming in Ruby: attr_accessor defines getter and setter methods of instance variables, but attr_reader only getter methods. The last evaluated statement in a method is its return value, allowing the omission of an explicit return statement.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough in {{most cases}} class {{initialization}} works as expected, some static fields may be read before being <b>initialized,</b> despite being <b>initialized</b> in their corresponding class initializer. We propose an analysis which compute, for each program point, the set of static fields {{that must have been}} <b>initialized</b> and discuss its soundness. We show that such an analysis can be directly applied to identify the static fields that may be read before being <b>initialized</b> and to improve the precision while preserving the soundness of a null-pointer analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Thread B {{notices that}} the shared {{variable}} has been <b>initialized</b> (or so it appears), and returns its value. Because thread B believes the value is already <b>initialized,</b> {{it does not}} acquire the lock. If B uses the object before all of the initialization done by A is seen by B (either because A has not finished <b>initializing</b> it or {{because some of the}} <b>initialized</b> values in the object have not yet percolated to the memory B uses (cache coherence)), the program will likely crash.|$|R
5000|$|References {{cannot be}} uninitialized. Because it is {{impossible}} to reinitialize a reference, they must be <b>initialized</b> as soon as they are created. In particular, local and global variables must be <b>initialized</b> where they are defined, and references which are data members of class instances must be <b>initialized</b> in the initializer list of the class's constructor. For example: ...|$|R
25|$|Finally, we {{actually}} don't need uDummy because it's there {{just to put}} all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and <b>initialize</b> default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which {{is the end of}} our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} formed in February 1954. The country school of Dutch Hollow closed; therefore, some members felt {{that they needed to}} keep the {{community}} spirit alive. The club’s initial hobby was shell craft although they ventured into sewing, ceramics, and cookbook making. The original nine members consisted of Emma Tindall, Violet Pulfer, Jean Paterson, Kathleen Gibson, Gladys Carey, Helen Fritz, Kathryn Eger, and Lois DeBlois. Tony Fritz loaned the group $40 to <b>initialize.</b> Thereafter, it charged ten cents for each cup of coffee to raise funds. Members celebrated the 20th, 25th, and 40th anniversaries at the parish hall by playing cards and games, and feasting.|$|E
25|$|The front crawl swimmer uses a {{tumble turn}} (also {{known as a}} flip turn) to reverse {{directions}} in minimal time. The swimmer swims close to the wall as quickly as possible. In the swimming position with one arm forward and one arm to the back, the swimmer does not recover one arm, but rather uses the pull/push of the other arm to <b>initialize</b> a somersault with the knees straight to the body. At {{the end of the}} somersault the feet are at the wall, and the swimmer is on his or her back with the hands over the head. The swimmer then pushes off the wall while turning sideways to lie on the breast. After a brief gliding phase, the swimmer starts with either a flutter kick or a butterfly kick before surfacing no more than 15 m from the wall.|$|E
50|$|Member {{variables}} can be <b>initialized</b> in an initializer list, with {{utilization of}} a colon, {{as in the}} example below. This differs from the above in that it <b>initializes</b> (using the constructor), rather than using the assignment operator. This is more efficient for class types, since it just needs to be constructed directly; whereas with assignment, they must be first <b>initialized</b> using the default constructor, and then assigned a different value. Also some types (like references and const types) cannot be assigned to and therefore must be <b>initialized</b> in the initializer list.|$|R
50|$|With newer x86 {{processor}}s, {{the processor}} cache {{can be used}} as RAM until DRAM is <b>initialized.</b> The processor cache has to be <b>initialized</b> into Cache-as-RAM mode as well, but this needs fewer instructions than <b>initializing</b> DRAM. Also, the Cache-as-RAM mode initialization is specific to CPU architectures, thus more generic than DRAM initialization, which is specific to each chipset and mainboard.|$|R
