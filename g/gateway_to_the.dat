As a result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common. These frequent losses combined with the town's strategic location as the <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of myths and legends {{associated}} with the origin of the name Delhi. One of them is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50BC and named it after himself. Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Hindi/Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved. The coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal. According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort and later named the fort dehali. Some historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a corruption of the Hindustani words dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning 'threshold' or 'gateway'—and symbolic of the city as a <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gangetic Plain. Another theory suggests that the city's original name was Dhillika.|$|E

5|$|As a <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had {{a strong}} {{regional}} style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles.

Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan {{similar to that of}} Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Graf {{returned}} {{to active duty}} {{at the end of}} July, III./JG52 had re-equipped with the Bf109G, and was back at Taganrog in the south. On the ground, the German Army’s summer offensive, Fall Blau, was underway, and the city of Rostov, <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caucasus, had fallen. In mid-August, III./JG52 moved forward to provide air cover as the army tried to establish bridgeheads across the Kuban River to capture the Black Sea ports. Geschwaderkommodore Gordon Gollob, of nearby JG77, was temporarily appointed to command JG52, after Major Herbert Ihlefeld, was severely wounded in a take-off accident. Gollob rivalled Graf for highest scoring pilot on the Eastern Front. On 14 August, both pilots had 120 victories. Soon after, Graf led a detachment of experienced aces from III./JG52 re-assigned to JG3 to cover the assault on Stalingrad. The detachment came under the command of Hauptmann Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke from JG3.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property.|$|E

Kiyomori, the de facto ruler of Japan between 1160 and 1180, moved his official residence to Fukuhara, in what is modern-day Hyogo. Fukuhara became the capital of Japan for a brief period near the end of Kiyomori's rule. A monument erected shortly after his death, the Kiyomori-zuka, stands in the gardens of a shrine opposite Kiyomori Bridge, also named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Windsor was not {{initially}} {{used as a}} royal residence; the early Norman kings preferred to use the former palace of Edward the Confessor {{in the village of}} Old Windsor. The first king to use Windsor Castle as a residence was Henry I, who celebrated Whitsuntide at the castle in 1110 during a period of heightened insecurity. Henry's marriage to Adela, the daughter of Godfrey of Louvain, took place in the castle in 1121. During this period the keep suffered a substantial collapse– archaeological evidence shows that the southern side of the motte subsided by over 6ft (2m). Timber piles were driven in to support the motte and the old wooden keep was replaced with a new stone shell keep, with a probable <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-east and a new stone well. A chemise, or low protective wall, was subsequently added to the keep.|$|E
