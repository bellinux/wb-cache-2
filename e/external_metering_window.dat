50|$|In photography, through-the-lens (TTL) {{metering}} {{refers to}} a feature of cameras whereby the intensity of light reflected from the scene is measured through the lens; as opposed to using a separate <b>metering</b> <b>window</b> or <b>external</b> hand-held light <b>meter.</b> In some cameras various TTL metering modes can be selected. This information can then be used to set the optimal film or image sensor exposure (average luminance), {{it can also be}} used to control the amount of light emitted by a flash unit connected to the camera.|$|R

Possible locations include on a utility pole serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises {{adjacent to the}} consumer unit / distribution board. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but <b>external</b> <b>meters</b> may be more prone to vandalism.|$|R
50|$|The Pen EE was {{introduced}} in 1961 and was the amateur model, with fully automatic exposure and fixed focusing. It is a true point and shoot camera, and has a 28mm f/3.5 lens. The Pen EE family is easily recognized by the selenium <b>meter</b> <b>window</b> around the lens.The Pen EE.S, launched in 1962, is the same model with a 30mm f/2.8 and a focusing ring, made necessary by the wider aperture.|$|R

5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, cameras {{did not have}} {{built-in}} exposure meters, andmany photographers did not have <b>external</b> exposure <b>meters.</b> Consequently,it often was necessary to calculate exposure fromlighting conditions.

40|$|In a {{wind tunnel}} facility, the direct {{measurement}} of forces and moments induced on the model are performed by a force measurement balance. The measurement balance is a precision-machined device that has strain gages at strategic locations to measure the strain (i. e., deformations) due to applied forces and moments. The strain gages convert the strain (and hence the applied force) to an electrical voltage that is measured by <b>external</b> <b>meters.</b> Thermal gradients can complicate the process, however. Thermal gradients on the balance cause differential expansion (or contraction) of {{various parts of the}} balance that induce a strain that is detected by the strain gages and is indistinguishable from an external applied force. The thermal gradients can result when testing is done at elevated temperatures or at cryogenic temperatures such as at the National Transonic Facility (NTF) at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) ...|$|R
5000|$|With a {{removable}} viewfinder, the F-1's flash coupler originally attached atop the rewind crank. Initially, {{there were two}} flash couplers, D and L. The D model was a simple x-synch coupler that allowed any non-dedicated manual or auto flash to be used. The Flash Coupler L contained two batteries (now hard to find, one being originally a 1.35v mercuric oxide and the other being the uncommon PX-1 size), one which powered a light to light up the <b>metering</b> <b>window</b> visible in the viewfinder, {{and the other to}} work with the original Canon Auto tuning system (CATS). The CATS used a special auto flash, the SpeedLite 133D and Flash auto Rings A, B, A2 and B2 and Canon 50 mm and 35 mm Lenses which signalled through the cords the distance of the subject and the charge level of the flash to allow match needle flash photography.|$|R
30|$|First, {{methods for}} {{back-light}} compensation detection and operation, {{that are based}} on the (difference of) measured signals in various areas of the image, have intrinsic problems if the object of interest is miss-positioned, or if it leaves the area of interest. The consequence is the severe underexposure of the important foreground object. To detect the change of object position, areas of interest are often set several times larger than the size of the object. However, the average intensity level of the whole <b>metering</b> <b>window</b> can be so high {{and the size of the}} object of interest can be very small, that insufficient back-light compensation occurs and the object details still remain invisible. Second, the changed object position can also give problems to the video-level controller, due to a considerable change of the measured signal because of the large differences in weights of the metering zones. These problems can be solved by dynamic weighting schemes.|$|R

50|$|The Kiev 17 {{and later}} 19/20-Line, {{available}} since around 1980, constituted {{some of the}} most westernized 35 mm SLRs available {{in the days of the}} Soviet Union. To satisfy the large internal demand, there was no discernible export at the time they would have found a ready market in the West. Instead, the Zenit with an <b>external</b> selenium <b>meter</b> was sold in large numbers. It was Soviet policy to export domestic surplus rather than the more desirable items of their manufacture.|$|R
50|$|Konica's {{single lens reflex}} cameras pioneered auto-exposure in cameras with focal-plane {{shutters}} {{and fully}} interchangeable lenses. The Konica Autoreflex of 1965 used an <b>external</b> light <b>meter</b> cell to set the lens diaphragm automatically after the user selected a shutter speed. With the Autoreflex T of 1968, Konica improved this design into a through-the-lens meter, using the same automation system. (The user could also set the exposure manually on these cameras). Other camera makers eventually adopted auto-exposure as well, but Konica was the first.|$|R
5000|$|Before the 1970s, many cameras had an [...] "accessory shoe" [...] or [...] "cold shoe", {{intended}} to hold flashes that connected electronically via an outboard cable, or other accessories such as <b>external</b> light <b>meters,</b> special viewfinders, or rangefinders, {{such as the}} Leica. These earlier accessory shoes were mostly the same U shape, and thus provided the template for {{the introduction of the}} hot shoe. Any required electrical connections were made using external cables and connectors, such as the PC connector.|$|R

50|$|The {{installation}} of the ODU employs automated tools for simplified antenna alignment and commissioning. The installation procedure is identical anywhere within the satellite service area {{and the use of}} circular polarization further simplifies the setup which permits to reduce the time and cost of the home installation. Although the installation could be done by some advanced users, it is recommended to contact a certified Tooway installer.Poor alignment of the dish system results in higher error rates and a lower broadband speed. The relatively unique transmission system of Turbo Code 8PSK used is not recognized with standard DVB-S or DVB-S2 installation meters.Horizon Global Electronics manufactures a Test and Measurement meter specifically designed to align the Tooway dish. HD-TC8 Applied Instruments also manufactures a Test and Measurement meter, the model Super Buddy 29, designed to align the Tooway dish. Super Buddy 29None of these two meters are able to do the new Viasat SurfBeam DVB-S2 signals. Also for these higher capacity signals and in addition on the higher Ka band, the accuracy of the installation becomes much more critical. Maxpeak AB (publ) manufactures a meter specifically for these new signals, SAM-plus (DVB-S2 ACM and VCM)http://www.maxpeak.tv/samplus.php?lang=eng. The current KA-SAT Surfbeam TRIA (dish receiving block) incorporates an audible tuner allowing accurate pointing of the dish without any additional <b>external</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Lens transmittances of 60%–90% are typical, so T-stops are {{sometimes}} {{used instead of}} f-numbers to more accurately determine exposure, particularly when using <b>external</b> light <b>meters.</b> [...] T-stops are often used in cinematography, where many images are seen in rapid succession and even small changes in exposure will be noticeable. Cinema camera lenses are typically calibrated in T-stops instead of f-numbers. In still photography, {{without the need for}} rigorous consistency of all lenses and cameras used, slight differences in exposure are less important, however, T-stops are still used in some kinds of special-purpose lenses such as Smooth Trans Focus lenses by Minolta and Sony.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if it was feasible to collect information regarding energy use and hot water delivery from tankless gas water heaters using the sensors and controls built into the water heaters. This could then be used to determine the water heater efficiency ? the ratio of energy out (hot water delivered) to energy in (energy in the gas) in actual residential installations. The goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible, and to avoid invalidating warranties or exposing researchers to liability issues. If feasible this approach would reduce the costs of instrumentation. This paper describes the limited field and laboratory investigations to determine if using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters is feasible for field monitoring. It was more complicated to use the existing gas flow, water and temperature sensors than was anticipated. To get the signals from the existing sensors and controls is difficult and may involve making changes that would invalidate manufacturer warrantees. The procedures and methods for using signals from the existing gas valves, water flow meters and temperature sensors will vary by model. To be able to monitor different models and brands would require detailed information about each model and brand. Based on these findings, we believe that for field monitoring projects it would be easier, quicker and safer to connect <b>external</b> <b>meters</b> to measure the same parameters rather than using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters...|$|R

2500|$|Simple point-and-shoot cameras rely almost {{exclusively}} on their built-in automation and machine intelligence for capturing images {{under a variety of}} situations and offer no manual control over their functions, a trait which makes them unsuitable for use by professionals, enthusiasts and proficient consumers (aka [...] "prosumers").

40|$|The {{identifiable}} {{pattern of}} the qualitative geomorphologic parameters such as steepness and concavity values that derived from the slope-area analysis of 28 tributaries in the San Gabriel Mountains were used to estimate relative rock uplift rates. The {{results suggest that the}} eastern region of the San Gabriel Mountain is controlled by a high rock uplift rate while the western region is controlled by a low rock uplift rate. Furthermore, arrangement of the variations of the steepness and concavity values suggests the presence of an active fault zone between the western and the eastern region of the San Gabriel Mountains. This tectonic zone is responsible for the apparent differentiation in rock uplift rates between the two mountain regions. This conclusion is supported from previous knowledge that suggests faster exhumation and high erosion rates of the East San Gabriel (ESG) block and slower exhumation and lower erosion rates of the Western San Gabriel (WSG) block (Spotila, J., Blythe, A., House, M., Niemi, N., Gregory, B., 2002). Moreover on the technological side of this project, plots of steepness or concavity values derived from analysis of SRTM (30 meter resolution), ASTER (30 meter resolution), USGS (30 meter resolution) and USGS (10 meter resolution) DEMs analysis suggest that USGS DEM- 10 meters and SRTM DEM- 30 meters are currently the most accurate methods to accurately quantify differential steepness and concavity values for the area of the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California. Finally, the application of different smoothing options on the plots of slope-drainage area analysis of the tributaries of the San Gabriel Mountains suggests that a 600 <b>meter</b> <b>window</b> size is the optimum size with more reliable information and better noise elimination.
