40|$|Background & aims: Despite a {{widespread}} belief that adequate dietary <b>intake</b> {{is needed to}} maintain weight during childhood cancer treatment, conclusive data about adequacy of <b>intake</b> are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to assess the adequacy of energy and protein <b>intake</b> in a heterogeneous childhood cancer population against 3 different norms. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 115 children diagnosed with cancer and assessed dietary <b>intake</b> after diagnosis and at 3, 6, and 12 months. <b>Intake</b> was assessed against recommended daily allowances (RDA), <b>intake</b> in healthy controls, and calculated individual requirements; and subsequently related to changes in nutritional status. Results: Energy <b>intake</b> was lower than RDA and lower than in healthy controls at all measurement points; whereas energy <b>intake</b> matched individual requirements at 2 of the 4 measurement points. Protein <b>intake</b> in childhood cancer patients was lower than in healthy children. However, protein <b>intake</b> was almost twice the RDA and {{one and a half}} times the individual requirements. During the study period, weight and fat mass (FM) increased significantly while fat free mass (FFM) remained low. Energy <b>intake</b> was negatively associated with weight and FM, and protein <b>intake</b> was not associated with FFM. Conclusions: The patients’ weight increased; whereas their energy <b>intake</b> was lower than RDA and lower than in healthy controls. This indicates that the average <b>intake</b> was more than adequate. Percentage <b>intake</b> of individual requirements matched with increased weight. Therefore, the use of this norm is preferable to RDA or <b>intake</b> in healthy controls when determining the adequacy of dietary <b>intake</b> in both clinical practice and futures studies...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of stress}} with {{different}} material in <b>intake</b> valve {{is the main}} purpose of this project. This research was carried about the stress impact in <b>intake</b> valve head where the most wear would occur at particular different RPM. The study of this thesis is based on previous research in <b>intake</b> valve stress and fatigue by experiment. Without actual experiment, <b>intake</b> valve stress can be analyzing by simulation using ALGOR software and specific RPM with specific maximum cylinder pressure can be calculated via GT-POWER software. Three most common <b>intake</b> valve materials was tested to be compared between stress which are common steel <b>intake</b> valve material, ceramic <b>intake</b> valve material and titanium alloy <b>intake</b> valve material. The best material for <b>intake</b> valve within the three material tested would be titanium alloy <b>intake</b> valve.

40|$|SUMMARY-The water <b>intake</b> of rats during {{growth of}} the Walker 256 tumor remains high in the {{presence}} of a spontaneously declining food <b>intake.</b> The water <b>intake</b> associated with food <b>intake</b> can be assessed by regarding the spontaneous food <b>intake</b> as ael libitum, and this leaves a large component of the actual water <b>intake</b> unaccounted for; or it can be assessed by regarding the spontaneous food <b>intake</b> as restricted, and this leaves a small but appreciable component unaccounted for. Rats that have recovered from the acute el'fecfs of lateral hypothalamic lesions and that no longer have the normal drinking response to food deprivation show, during tumor growth, a small component of water <b>intake</b> not accountable to food <b>intake</b> and of a size and time of occurrence comparable to the laHer estimate for intact tumor bearers. The elevation in water <b>intake</b> induced by the tumor and not accountable to food <b>intake</b> appears not to depend on lateral hypothalamic mechanisms.

40|$|<b>Intake</b> of lignans {{has been}} {{assessed}} in different study populations, {{but so far}} none of the studies has compared the daily <b>intake</b> of lignans and the urinary excretion of plant and enterolignans. We assessed the <b>intake</b> of lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in 100 Finnish men consuming their habitual omnivorous diet, and measured the 24 h urinary excretion of plant and enterolignans to compare the <b>intake</b> and metabolism. Dietary determinants of lignan <b>intake</b> and their urinary excretion were also determined. The mean <b>intake</b> of lignans was 1224 (SD 539) mg/d, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol covered 78 %. Almost half (47 %) of the <b>intake</b> of lignans was explained by the <b>intake</b> of rye products, berries, coffee, tea and roots. The urinary excretion of plant lignans corresponded to 17 % and enterolignans to 92 % of the <b>intake</b> of lignans. The urinary excretion of plant lignans was explained 14 % by the <b>intake</b> of rye products and <b>intake</b> of coffee, and consequently 3 – 7 % by the <b>intake</b> of water-insoluble fibre. The urinary excretion of enterolactone was explained 11 % by the <b>intake</b> of vegetables and rye products, 14 % by the <b>intake</b> of water-soluble fibre and only 4 % by the <b>intake</b> of lariciresinol. Although the assessed <b>intake</b> of lignans corresponded well with the urinary excretion of lignans, the enterolactone production {{in the human body}} depended more on the dietary sources of lignans than the absolute <b>intake</b> of lignans.

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate <b>Intakes</b> (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol <b>intakes</b> of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective The role {{of breakfast}} energy in total daily energy <b>intake</b> {{is a matter}} of debate. Acute feeding {{experiments}} demonstrated that high breakfast energy leads to greater overall <b>intake</b> supported by cross-sectional data of a free-living population. On the other hand, a large intraindividual analysis has indicated that a high proportion of breakfast to overall <b>intake</b> is associated with lower daily energy <b>intake.</b> To evaluate these apparently contradictory results in greater detail both ways of analysis were applied to the same data set of dietary records. Methods On an intraindividual basis total daily energy <b>intake</b> was related to the absolute values of breakfast energy <b>intake</b> or to the ratio of breakfast to overall <b>intake,</b> respectively. Food <b>intake</b> of 280 obese and 100 normal weight subjects was analyzed who recorded over 10 (obese) or 14 (normal weight) consecutive days, respectively. Results Increasing breakfast energy was associated with greater overall <b>intake</b> in normal weight and obese subjects. The increasing ratio of breakfast to total daily energy <b>intake</b> was associated with a significant reduction of overall <b>intake</b> on days where post-breakfast energy was significantly reduced. Correlational and multiple regression analysis support the concept that absolute breakfast calories have the strongest influence on daily energy <b>intake.</b> Conclusion Reduced breakfast energy <b>intake</b> is associated with lower total daily <b>intake.</b> The influence of the ratio of breakfast to overall energy <b>intake</b> largely depends on the post-breakfast rather than breakfast <b>intake</b> pattern. Therefore, overweight and obese subjects should consider the reduction of breakfast calories as a simple option to improve their daily energy balance. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relations}} between restrained, emotional, and external eating and total energy <b>intake,</b> and total fat and carbohydrate <b>intake</b> controlling for body mass index and physical activity. The sample consisted of 475 female students.

Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data. The results showed that restrained eating was consistently negatively related to energy <b>intake</b> and fat and carbohydrate <b>intake,</b> whereas external eating was positively related to all dependent variables. Emotional eating was not related to energy <b>intake</b> or fat and carbohydrate <b>intake.</b> Thus, restrained eaters seem to restrict their energy <b>intake,</b> while external eating was found to be associated with higher levels of energy <b>intake,</b> especially of fat <b>intake...</b>|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{polyphenol}} <b>intake</b> {{contributes to}} the understanding of polyphenols’ health benefits. However, information about human polyphenol <b>intake</b> is scarce, especially in the elderly. This study aimed to estimate the dietary <b>intake</b> and major sources of polyphenols and to determine whether there is any relationship between polyphenol <b>intake</b> and micronutrient <b>intake</b> in healthy elderly Japanese. First, 610 subjects (569 men, 41 women; aged 67. 3 ± 6. 1 years) completed food frequency questionnaires. We then calculated their total polyphenol <b>intake</b> using our polyphenol content database. Their average total polyphenol <b>intake</b> was 1492 ± 665 mg/day, the greatest part of which was provided by beverages (79. 1 %). The daily polyphenol <b>intake</b> differed largely among individuals (183 – 4854 mg/day), also attributable mostly to beverage consumption. Coffee (43. 2 %) and green tea (26. 6 %) were the major sources of total polyphenol; the top 20 food items accounted for > 90 %. The polyphenol <b>intake</b> did not strongly correlate with the <b>intake</b> of any micronutrient, suggesting that polyphenols may exert health benefits independently of nutritional <b>intake.</b> The polyphenol <b>intake</b> in this elderly population was slightly higher than previous data in Japanese adults, and beverages such as coffee and green tea contributed highly to the <b>intake...</b>|$|R

Personalised feedback consisted of one sentence expressing current fat <b>intake</b> {{as a percentage of}} total calorific <b>intake.</b> Changes in fat <b>intake</b> from baseline to five months post-intervention were evaluated.
