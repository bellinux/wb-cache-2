25|$|With every geometry, Felix Klein {{associated}} {{an underlying}} group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically {{represented as a}} hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved {{with respect to the}} Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is a priori meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E

2500|$|The main {{notion of}} Ivan Illich {{is the concept}} of counterproductivity: when {{institutions}} of modern industrial society impede their purported aims. For example, Ivan Illich calculated that, in America in the 1970s, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> the time spent to work to earn the money to buy a car, the time spent in the car (including traffic jam), the time spent in the health care industry because of a car crash, the time spent in the oil industry to fuel cars ...etc., [...] and you divide the number of kilometres traveled per year by that, you obtain the following calculation: 10000km per year per person divided by 1600 hours per year per American equals 6km per hour.

2500|$|Pitchfork stated [...] "T.I. {{has always}} been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other {{mainstream}} rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's [...] (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that [...] "Clifford “T.I.” Harris is one of America’s greatest songwriters. I’m not just talking about hip-hop, either—even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has more ways to score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it’s pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it’s time to start talking." [...] Stylus Magazine noted [...] "T.I.’s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.’s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning “Top Back” to the slyly tender “Gone,” every chime chimes when it’s supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion’s share of the praise: the cataclysmic “What You Know” and ostentatious “Bankhead” both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.’s lines with velveteen strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn’t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won’t be T.I.’s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it’s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kosterlitz is {{best known}} for his work as one of the key discoverers of endorphins. [...] He {{performed}} a famous experiment that he envisioned in a dream while sleeping. He stimulated a strip of guinea pig intestine electrically and record its contractions with a polygraph. He then found that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>added</b> opiates to the solution, the intestine would not contract. Opiates inhibit intestinal contraction. Those contractions were later found to resume in the presence of both opiates and an antagonist such as naloxone. Later, endogenous endorphins were discovered by applying pig brain cell homegenate to the apparatus. This caused the contractions to cease. The degree to which an opiate agonist inhibits contractions in the guinea pig ileum is highly correlated to its potency.|$|R
