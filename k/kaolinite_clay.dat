2500|$|Pictographs are {{paintings}} or {{drawings that}} have been placed onto the rock face. Such artworks have typically been made with mineral earths and other natural compounds found {{across much of the}} world. The predominantly used colours are red, black and white. Red paint is usually attained through the use of ground ochre, while black paint is typically composed of charcoal, or sometimes from minerals such as manganese. White paint is usually created from natural chalk, <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clay</b> or diatomaceous earth. Once the pigments had been obtained, they would be ground and mixed with a liquid, such as water, blood, urine, or egg yolk, and then applied to the stone as paint using a brush, fingers, or a stamp. Alternately, the pigment could have been applied on dry, such as with a stick of charcoal. In some societies, the paint itself has symbolic and religious meaning; for instance, among hunter-gatherer groups in California, paint was only allowed to be traded by the group shamans, while in other parts of North America, the word for [...] "paint" [...] was the same as the word for [...] "supernatural spirit".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax [...] "recalcitrant" [...] cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of [...] "mechanochemistry" [...] has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, a common bentonite or <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clay,</b> that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{phosphate}} anion adsorption on the permeability values of homoionized <b>kaolinite</b> and montmorillonite <b>clays</b> is presented. The homoionized sodium, calcium and hydrogen clays are prepared by repeatedly washing the clays with 2 N solutions of corresponding chlorides. Phosphate adsorption was induced by treating homoionized clays with phosphoric acids for different periods varying upto 1000 hrs. The coefficient of permeability of the clays was determined from one dimensional consolidation test results. The decrease in the permeability of <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clays</b> on phosphate adsorption has been explained on the fabric changes. For montmorillonite, both cation exchange and phosphate adsorption causes significant changes which are explained based on variation in the thickness of diffuse double layer...|$|R

40|$|Cells of Bacillus subtilis {{exhibited}} higher affinity towards hematite than to kaolinite. Bacterial {{cells were}} grown and adapted {{in the presence}} of hematite and kaolinite. Higher amounts of mineral-specific proteinaceous compounds were secreted {{in the presence of}} kaolinite while hematite-grown cells produced higher amounts of exopolysaccharides. Extracellular proteins (EP) exhibited higher adsorption density on kaolinite which was rendered more hydrophobic. Hematite surfaces were rendered more hydrophilic due to increased adsorption of extracellular polysaccharides (ECP). Significant surface chemical changes were produced due to interaction between minerals and extracellular proteins and polysaccharides. Iron oxides such as hematite could be effectively removed from <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clays</b> using selective bioflocculation of hematite after interaction with EP and ECP extracted from mineral-grown cells.

50|$|Alkalinity {{problems}} are {{more pronounced in}} clay soils than in loamy, silty or sandy soils. The clay soils containing montmorillonite or smectite (swelling clays) are more subject to alkalinity problems than illite or <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clay</b> soils.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} to get the active mineral {{admixtures}} for dry mixes is kaolin clay baking at temperature of 600 - 800 Â°Ð¡. The reason for application such an additive is that among all modern minerals the most reaction-active towards a lime is metakaolinite. Possibility of application of mixed-layer clays of the Penza region as a structuring additive in lime dry mixes is considered. Differential-thermal analysis of <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clays</b> from various deposits was carried out. The structure of sand-lime specimens was being studied by method of X-ray phase analysis. Efficiency of application of clay that was baked at temperature of 400 - 500 Â°Ð¡ is shown. It is indicated that introduction of the clay burned at temperature of 400 - 550 Â°Ð¡ in number 10 % from mass of a lime promotes durability increase in compression that is 17, 85 - 63 %, as a function of technology, temperature of baking and a type of clay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The lectrical {{conductivity}} {{of saturated}} kaolinite clay-water-electrolyte systems of dif-ferent particle size distributions and of illite and montmoriUonite clays were determined over the frequency range of 50 -l 08 c/s. The conductivity increases as the frequency increases, and the experi-mental values show two distinct dispersions, {{one in the}} low frequency range {{and the other in}} the high frequency range. The frequency range over which the first dispersion occurs is experimentally shown to be dependent on particle size. The average particle size is uniquely related to the frequency at which half the dispersion occurs. The magnitude of conductivity variation, the high frequency conductivity and the streaming potential values are related to the microscopic permeability coefficient. This microscopic permeability coefficient, evaluated from a knowledge of the above electrical properties, is shown to be uniquely related to the Darcy permeability coefficient at various consolidation states of the <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clays.</b> Similar unique relationships have been observed inillitic clays...|$|R

The theoretical effects of particle shape on effective hydrodynamic volume and shear resistance for ideal suspensions are considered. The rheological properties of hydrogen and sodium mono base-exchanged <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clays</b> were determined, using a rotational viscoIneter, on slips containing up to 50 g solids per 100 g slurry. Changes in rheological properties were also evaluated as a hydrogen slip containing 20 g solids per 100 g slurry was converted into the sodium form. The discussion includes the effect of differences in charges and charge distribution on the sodium and hydrogen particles and the resulting effects on particle orientation and flocculation. Correction factors for dissociation and particle interference have allowed the use of Einstein's equation for the viscosity of a suspension up to concentrations of about 40 percent solids for the hydrogen kaolinite system, and about 50 percent solids for the so-dium kaolinite system...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kaolinite</b> <b>clay</b> {{occurs in}} {{abundance}} in soils that have formed from the chemical weathering of rocks in hot, moist climatesâ€”for example in tropical rainforest areas. Comparing soils along a gradient towards progressively cooler or drier climates, {{the proportion of}} kaolinite decreases, while the proportion of other clay minerals such as illite (in cooler climates) or smectite (in drier climates) increases. Such climatically-related differences in clay mineral content are often used to infer changes in climates in the geological past, where ancient soils have been buried and preserved.|$|E
50|$|Bioavailability, or {{the amount}} of a {{substance}} that is physiochemically accessible to microorganisms is {{a key factor in}} the efficient biodegradation of pollutants. O'Loughlin et al. (2000) showed that, with the exception of <b>kaolinite</b> <b>clay,</b> most soil clays and cation exchange resins attenuated biodegradation of 2-picoline by Arthrobacter sp. strain R1, as a result of adsorption of the substrate to the clays. Chemotaxis, or the directed movement of motile organisms towards or away from chemicals in the environment is an important physiological response that may contribute to effective catabolism of molecules in the environment. In addition, mechanisms for the intracellular accumulation of aromatic molecules via various transport mechanisms are also important.|$|E

Afterwards, 47,000 saplings were planted on the hillsides. But most of these plants died due to drought in 1951 and excessive rain in 1952. Weitz carried on planting trees, by 1960, he had planted 355,000 trees on 170 dunams with on a 2% not surviving. Although Azariah Alon (co-founder of the SPNI), who lived nearby called the foresters [...] "barbarians". They destroyed native vegetation with fire and planted pines and eucalyptus. Alon then confronted Sharon Weitz (Yosef's son and head of the northern region Forestry Department). Azariah used his radio show to put forward his arguments. Yosef agreed to a change in the tree plans, and left the upper region of Barkan Mount, unplanted. Also many of the other pine trees died due to being planted too dense.

A stronger acid species was also found in untreated and in organic-free, HCl-treated samples (washed free of excess acid). The end points for organic-free and/or ion-exchanged samples were used to predict he end points for untreated samples. A surface-chemical model involving MOH 2 +, MOH, and MO- species (where M = Al and/or Fe) was fitted to the titration data and to the cation-exchange capacities. MOH 2 + is the stronger acid and MOH the weaker acid; exchange of Na + counterions by H + converts MO-Na + sites to MOH sites. Humic acid was probably complexed or chelated to some hydroxylated Al/Fe sites through COOH and phenolic OH groups. The COOH groups contributed supplementary stronger acid species which were not exchangeable, whereas the OH groups contributed supplementary weaker acid species and also increased the CEC relative to that for organic-free samples.
