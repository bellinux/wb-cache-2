40|$|Various {{activities}} that intend to enhance performance, reliability, {{and availability of}} storage systems are scheduled with low priority and served during idle times. Under such conditions, idleness becomes a valuable “resource ” {{that needs to be}} efficiently managed. A common approach in system design is to be nonwork conserving by “idle waiting”, that is, delay the scheduling of background jobs to avoid slowing down upcoming <b>foreground</b> <b>tasks.</b> In this article, we complement “idle waiting ” with the “estimation ” of background work to be served in every idle interval to effectively manage the trade-off between the performance of <b>foreground</b> and background <b>tasks.</b> As a result, the storage system is better utilized without compromising foreground performance. Our analysis shows that if idle times have low variability, then idle waiting is not necessary. Only if idle times are highly variable does idle waiting become necessary to minimize the impact of background activity on foreground performance. We further show that if there is burstiness in idle intervals, then it is possible to predict accurately the length of incoming idle intervals and use this information to serve more background jobs without affecting foreground performance...|$|R

Shadowing aurally presented text reduced prospective memory performance, presumably because it prevented verbal rehearsal of the prospective instructions.

They may cause data loss if the storage system is operating under reduced redundancy, because of previous failures. In this paper, we evaluate effectiveness of two known techniques to detect and/or recover from latent sector errors, namely scrubbing and intra-disk data redundancy. These two techniques are treated as background activities that complete without affecting the otherwise normal operation of the storage system. We focus on how disk idle times can be managed to effectively complete these background tasks without affecting <b>foreground</b> <b>task</b> performance, while reducing the window of vulnerability for data loss.

The framework estimates when {{and for how long}} idle times can be utilized by low priority background tasks, without violating pre-defined performance targets of user <b>foreground</b> <b>tasks.</b> The estimation is based on monitored system information that includes the histogram of idle times.

This proposal argues for using these idle capacities speculatively, increasing system performance for correct predictions. In such a system, all resources will ideally be constantly loaded with either regular <b>foreground</b> <b>tasks,</b> or speculative idle-time tasks. The key contribution of this proposal {{is a model}} for non-interfering use of idle resource capacity, based on three principles: resource prioritization between regular foreground and idle-time use, preemptability of idle-time processing, and isolation of speculative side effects. Current operating systems fail to provide all three capabilities.

As a direct measure of sustained attentional resource allocation in early visual cortex we used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by distinct flicker frequencies of task and distractor stimuli.

In this paper, we propose an analytic model to evaluate the performance trade-offs of the amount of background work that a storage system can sustain. The proposed model results in a quasi-birth-death (QBD) process that is analytically tractable. Detailed experimentation using a variety of workloads shows that under dependent arrivals both foreground and background performance strongly depends on system load. In contrast, if arrivals of foreground jobs are independent, performance sensitivity to load is reduced. The model identifies dependence in the arrivals of foreground jobs as an important characteristic that controls the decision of how much background load the system can accept to maintain high availability and performance gains.

Participants detected brief intervals of coherent motion in an array of otherwise randomly moving squares superimposed on words of positive, neutral or negative valence. Processing of the <b>foreground</b> <b>task</b> was assessed by behavioural responses and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by the squares flickering at 15 Hz.

In contrast, the time course of behavioural data and SSVEP amplitudes revealed no interference with the task regardless of the emotional connotation of distractor words. This dissociation of emotion effects on early perceptual versus lexical stages of processing suggests that written emotional words do not inevitably lead to attentional modulation in early visual areas.

Interpretation of these data may be limited because of polydrug use, psychosocial stressors, and increased psychopathology that have been reported in MDMA users. This study was designed to directly assess the pharmacological effect of MDMA on prospective memory and brain activity in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twelve recreational MDMA users received MDMA 75 mg and placebo and performed an objective prospective memory task during functional imaging. During prospective memory task performance subjects were engaged in a <b>foreground</b> <b>task</b> that consisted of a simple reaction time to visual stimuli (Go trials) and a prospective task of withholding a response during trials that were part of a dynamic memory set (No go trials).

Functional imaging showed that MDMA decreased BOLD activation during Go trials in the thalamus (left), putamen (left), precuneus (left), and the inferior parietal lobules (bilateral), as compared to placebo.

Firstly, the negative effect of overemphasis on score was not manifested with the order of comments followed by revealing scores. The scores were released only after the participants completed the learning cycles.

As a result, this should enhance the learning impact and dilute the negative effect of scores substantially. The reflective and metacognitive steps are <b>foregrounded</b> for this <b>task</b> and attracted most of the participants’ attention and effort. The increment in effort and time spent on the learning task itself then further off-set the negative effect of scores.

Taking images from eight widely used datasets, we crowdsource labeling the images as "ambiguous" or "not ambiguous" to segment in order to construct a new dataset we call STATIC. Using STATIC, we develop a system that automatically predicts which images are ambiguous. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our prediction system over existing saliency-based methods on images from vision benchmarks and images taken by blind {{people who are trying}} to recognize objects in their environment.

40|$|Abstract. Human perception, in a {{world of}} {{continuous}} and seamless exposure to visual and auditory stimuli, is increasingly challenged to information overload. Among the primary human senses, vision, audition and tactation, particularly the sense of touch appears underemployed in todays designs of interfaces that deliver information to the user. While about more than 70 % of the information perceived by humans is delivered via the sight and hearing channel, only about 21 % is perceived via the haptic sense. In situations of work or engaged activity, where both the visual and auditory channel are occupied because of the involvement in the <b>foreground</b> <b>task,</b> notifications or alerts coming from the background, and delivered via these channels tend to fail to raise sufficient levels of attention. With this paper we propose to involve the haptic channel for situations where important notifications tend to be ”overseen ” or ”overheard”. We opt for a vibro-tactile notification system whenever eyes, ears and hands are in charge. A body worn, belt like vibration system is proposed, delivering tactile notifications to the user in a very subtle, unobtrusive, yet demanding style. Vibration elements seamlessly integrated into the fabric of an off-the-shelf waist belt, lets the system deliver patterns of vibration signals generated by modulating amplitude, frequency, duration and rhythm – so called tactograms – to eight well positioned vibra elements.

Researchers have mostly focused on addressing the former challenge, suggesting solutions based either on exploitbased penetration detection or anomaly-based misbehavior detection, but yet stopping short of comprehensive solutions that leverage merits of both approaches. The second challenge, however, is rarely addressed; doing so comprehensively is important since these systems can introduce substantial overhead and cause system slowdown, more so when the system load is high. We present Rootsense, a holistic and real-time intrusion prevention system that combines the merits of misbehaviorbased and anomaly-based detection. Four principles govern the design and implementation of Rootsense. First, Rootsense audits events within different subsystems of the host operating system and correlates them to comprehensively capture the global system state. Second, Rootsense restricts the detection domain to root compromises only; doing so reduces run-time overhead and increases detection accuracy (root behavior is more easily modeled than user behavior). Third, Rootsense adopts a dual approach to intrusion detection – a root penetration detector detects activities that exploit system vulnerabilities to penetrate the security perimeter, and a root misbehavior detector tracks misbehavior by root processes. Fourth, Rootsense {{is designed to be}} configurable for overhead management allowing the system administrator to tune the overhead characteristics of the intrusion prevention system that affect <b>foreground</b> <b>task</b> performance.

40|$|The {{auditory}} modality {{offers several}} advantages {{as a means}} of communication for the purposes of location-based services (LBS), including fast response time [1], low processing and storage overheads [2], and hands/eyes-free mobility. However, with more and more sound-producing technology being used in day-to-day life, the battle for our acoustic attention has led to a steady rise in acoustic noise levels [3]. In an already noisy environment, it is tempting for the sound designer to simply use more volume {{as a means of}} gaining the listener’s attention but this creates a vicious circle of noise whereby every sound designer is merely struggling {{to be heard over the}} noise of every other sound designer. The field of soundscape theory however, may offer some potential solutions in this regard. Soundscape theory, as described by Schafer [4, 5] and Truax [6], considers sound from a more holistic point of view and the concept of listening modes considers the different levels of attention we pay to auditory stimuli depending on context and location within the soundscape. While several different theoretical listening modes have been proposed across the various acoustic disciplines, there is still a need for empirical data to support the existence of these modes. One area in which there is a certain amount of empirical data is in relation to spectral bandwidth and what Krause has called his ‘niche theory’ [7 - 9]. Niche theory describes the way in which different species appear to occupy discrete frequency bandwidths within the soundscapes of natural habitats; it is argued that this natural balance keeps redundant noise to a minimum and enables more efficient acoustic communication. If the principles observed in niche theory were to be observed in human listening behavior then a new approach to sound design might be possible whereby auditory stimuli exploit specific frequency bandwidths in order to maximize information exchange without necessarily raising noise levels. In this paper we outline a proposed experiment whereby listeners are asked to engage in a <b>foreground</b> <b>task</b> that encourages competitive conversation while also attending to a background listening task whereby participants have to acknowledge background non-speech sound bursts of varying spectral bandwidth presented at random intervals.

Firstly, in order to obtain enhanced backgrounds of noisy ancient documents, a novel foreground/background segmentation algo-rithm based on SLIC superpixels, is introduced. Once, the SLIC technique is carried out, the background and foreground superpixels are classified. Then, an enhanced and non-noisy background is achieved after processing the background superpixels. Subsequently, Gabor descriptors are only extracted from the selected foreground su-perpixels of the enhanced gray-level ancient book document images by adopting a multi-scale approach. Finally, for ancient document image segmentation, a <b>foreground</b> superpixel clustering <b>task</b> is performed by partitioning Gabor-based feature sets into compact and well-separated clusters in the feature space. The proposed algorithm does not assume any a priori information regarding document image content and structure and provides in-teresting results on a large corpus of ancient documents. Qualitative and numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the enhancement and segmentation quality...|$|R
60|$|We find, {{according}} to this its internal structure, which, I believe, {{with the assistance of}} Turner, can scarcely now be misunderstood, that the earth may be considered as divided into three great classes of formation, which geology has already named for us. Primary--the rocks, which, though in position lower than all others, rise to form the central peaks, or interior nuclei of all mountain ranges. Secondary--the rocks which are laid in beds above these, and which form the greater proportion of all hill scenery. Tertiary--the light beds of sand, gravel, and clay, which are strewed upon the surface of all, forming plains and habitable territory for man. We shall find it convenient, in examining the truth of art, to adopt, with a little modification, the geological arrangement, considering first, the formation and character of the highest or central peaks; then the general structure of the lower mountains, including in this division those composed of the various slates which a geologist would call primary; and, lastly, the minutiæ and most delicate characters of the beds of these hills, when they are so near as to become foreground objects, and the structure of the common soil which usually forms the greater space of an artist's <b>foreground.</b> Hence our <b>task</b> will arrange itself into three divisions--the investigation of the central mountains, of the interior mountains, and of the foreground.|$|R
