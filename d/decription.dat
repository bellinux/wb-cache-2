Observations {{were made on}} 52 samples collected from 21 different sites (June 1994 - 1995) and resulting enrichment cultures. Scale morphology was examined using transmission electron microscopy. Over 70 species of scale-bearing nanoflagellates from four classes and 17 genera were illustrated, namely: Chrysophyceae - Apedinella, Chrysolepidomonas, Meringosphaera, Paraphysomonas (8 spp); Prymnesiophyceae - Chrysochromulina (32 spp), Corymbellus, Imantonia, Pavlova, Phaeocystis (2 spp), Prymnesium (2 spp); Prasinophyceae - Dolichomastix (2 spp), Mamiella, Mantomiella, Pyramimonas (7 spp); Dinophyceae - Heterocapsa; and, of uncertain taxonomic affinities, Petasaria and Thaumatomastix (3 spp). Seventeen of the nanoflagellate species found were new records for Australian waters, specifically: Chrysochromulina acantha, C. ahrengotii, C. aff. brachycylindra, C. aff. camella, C. mactra, C. aff. scutellum, Pavlova pin guis, Chrysolepidomonas cf. marina, Paraphysomonas antarctica, P. bandaiensis, P. foraminfera, P. cf. takahashii, Dolichomastix nummulifera, D. aff. tenuilepis, Mamiella gilva, Petasaria heterolepsis and Thaumatomastix cf. thomseni.

More recently, the northeastern coast of Guadeloupe was affected by a tsunami that had been generated around Montserrat by pyroclastic flows entering the sea, during the July 2003 eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. We use a modified version of the GEOWAVE model to compute numerical simulations of both events. Two source hypotheses are considered for each tsunami. The comparison of the simulation results with reported tsunami height data helps to discriminate between the tested source <b>decriptions.</b> In the Martinique case, we obtain a better fit to data when considering three successive lahars entering the sea, as a simplified single source leads to an overstimation of the tsunami wave heights at the coast.

These findings emphasize the importance of an accurate description of the relevant volume as well as the timing sequence of the source event in landslide-generated tsunami modelling.

Recently, our lab made efforts in exploring {{the roles of}} Cdk 5 in human tumor cells. The published results demonstrated that Cdk 5 {{plays an important role}} in tumorigenesis of medullary thyroid carcinoma cells. In addition, drug-induced Cdk 5 overactivation was also found to cause apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. The preliminary results of 2006 -NSC grant indicated that Cdk 5 could regulate androgen receptor (AR) transactivation and downstream proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we also identified the protein interaction between ErbB family protein and Cdk 5. In addition, an old-history drug for tumor differentiation, retinoic acid (RA), was believed to activate Cdk 5 kinase activity and cause neuronal differentiation. According to the <b>decriptions</b> above, the goal of this grant is to understand whether the roles of RA on growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells are directly through regulating the expression and kinase activity of Cdk 5 and its activator, p 35, or whether the roles of RA on regulating Cdk 5 activity are indirectly through intracellular calcium-dependent ErbB activation. First, the effects of RA on Cdk 5 -p 35 -dependent growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells will be identified. Second, the involvement of cAMP-related pathways in RA-induced influences of Cdk 5 /p 35 will be investigated. Third, RA-induced influences on Cdk 5 /p 35 -dependent downstream signaling pathways of androgen receptor will be discussed. Forth, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry was used to verify whether RA-induced change of cell cycle pattern is through the alteration of Cdk 5 /p 35 protein expression and kinase activity. Fifth, investigate whether Cdk 5 /p 35 protein expression and kinase activity are involved in RA-induced changes of growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of xenografted prostate cancer cells in nude mice (pleasec see the scheme for detail). According to our present and expected results (please see the supplemental data), RA possibly causes the differentiation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through Cdk 5 /p 35 -related signalings and ErbB family might be involved in this pathway.

40|$|The risk, price {{inconsistency}} {{and environmental}} impact associated {{with oil and}} gas exploration and production have geared a focus on renewable energy. Wind power, the fastest growing source of renewable power generation in Europe, is a major competitor to oil and gas. The strong and stable wind at offshore locations and the increasing demand for energy have surged the application of wind turbines in deep water. Wind turbines are categorized into Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) based on their respective orientation of axis of rotation. A floating wind turbine will experience large loads from wind, waves and rotating blades. Research has focused on the design, structural integrity, platform motion and installation of floating horizontal-axis wind turbines (FHAWTs) to better understand the performance of different concepts and to provide the basis for detailed structural design. However, the application of floating vertical axis wind turbines (FVAWTs) in deep offshore has potentials due to its economic advantage in installation and maintenance. Research in the development of FVAWTs is still green. However, a variety of studies applied different simulation tools to investigate the response characteristics of FVAWTs to provide the conceptual design <b>decriptions</b> and detailed evaluation of technical feasibilities of the various concepts. This thesis adopted a 5 MW Baseline FVAWT from Wang’s PhD work. The FVAWT is a novel concept combining the 5 MW DeepWind rotor and the DeepCwind semi-submersible from the Offshore code comparison collaboration Continuation (OC 4) project. The response characteristics of the FVAWT was evaluated using a coupled non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic model (the Simo-Riflex-DMS code) which was developed by Wang for modeling FVAWTs. This coupled model incoorporates the models for the turbulent wind field, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, structural dynamics and controller dynamics, and the simulation is performed in a fully coupled manner in time domain. The FVAWT has been studied in a systematic manner, which includes a comprehensive investigation of the aerodynamics of the wind turbine to analyze the dynamic response of global motion for the floating system; considering normal operating condition to emergency shutdown event; as well as comparing the FVAWT with a FHAWT. However, the fatigue analysis for structural components such as blades, tower and mooring lines have not been performed. For FVAWTs, the continuously varying aerodynamic loads on the rotor lead to considerably higher load level of the fatigue loads and number of load cycles. Therefore, it is significant to evaluate fatigue damage based on the time history of calculated response. The rainflow counting technique is used for short-term fatigue cycle counting. The Mlife tool from NREL is used to calculate the short-term fatigue damage equivalent loads for the FVAWT. Furthermore, this work is extended to model and evaluate the performance of a 5 MW Optimised FVAWT in terms of power production, structural dynamic response, global motion and short-term fatigue damage on structural components. The 5 MW Optimised FVAWT is a concept combining the optimised 5 MW DeepWind rotor from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the DeepCwind semi-submersible from the OC 4 project. The two FVAWT concepts were evaluated under the same environmental condition. The response characteristics of both 5 MW FVAWTs were studied under steady wind and turbulent wind conditions based on the statistical analysis and the spectral analysis of their responses to explore the effects of turbulence. The results identified that the effect of turbulence on the both FVAWTs resulted in an increased power generation, higher power variation, higher excitation for low frequency motions, greater fatigue damage but a reduction in the 2 P effects. However, the effect of turbulence is negligible on the bending moment at the blade extremes but leads to higher loads on mooring lines and tower base especially at wind speeds above the rated wind speed. Furthermore, the results of the fatigue analysis showed that at wind speeds farther from the rated wind speed (14 m/s), the internal loads could have lower damaging effects than at wind speeds closer to the rated wind speed. Moreover, the dynamic response of the 5 MW Baseline FVAWT is compared with the 5 MW Optimised FVAWT in terms of power production, bending moment of structural components, global motion and short-term fatigue equivalent loads under turbulent wind condition. The results identified the 5 MW Optimised FVAWT to have lower Fore-Aft (FA) but higher lower Side-Side (SS) bending moment of structural components, lower motions amplitude, lower short-term fatigue equivalent loads and reduced 2 P effects...|$|R

The questions are focused on if it is possible to identify specific and unique attributions, for example made to the Father, which are not attributed to the Son or the Spirit and vice versa. And if there are ways in which the <b>decriptions</b> overlap each other, in terms of characteristics, roles or functions. What makes for example talk about the Father {{different from that of the}} Spirit; and are there any kind of linguistic tensions in Pauls' way of describing God and his actions? The main sources used to answer these questions have, of course, been the letters in the canon of the New Testament ascribed to, and read by the church as written by Paul the apostle. I have studied the corpus as a whole, but I also wanted to let the individual passages and even whole letters be interpreted (as far as possible) with a sensibility for the narrower contexts in which they stand. I read through the letters and identified where, how often and in what way Paul uses the different terms – written apart from each other as well as together. I primarily used the official swedish translation Bibel 2000 by Bibelkommissionen, but where there in comparison with other translations seemed to be different options at hand, I consulted the greek text as presented in Novum Testamentum Graece by Nestle-Aland. Secondary literature consists primarily of well-known and recognized bible commentaries, books and exegetical dictionaries by for example Joseph A. Fitzmyer, James D. G. Dunn, Martin Hengel, Ferdinand Hahn, Gerhard Schneider, N. T. Wright etc. What I have found in my study is that Paul uses the terms and titles in a way that, on the one hand carefully and in somewhat systematically seeks to describe them as distinct from one another. First in the obvious way of denoting them as Father, Son and Spirit (the Son is not called the Father and the Spirit is not the Son, and so forth); and secondly they are given different theological roles and functions in the salvation history. The Spirit did not for example take on flesh and die for the sins of humanity, and the Son did not raise from the dead by himself. Prayer and thanksgiving, likewise, seems only to be offered to God, the Father, and never the Spirit or Christ, even though the proper way of praying and giving thanks to Him, according to Paul, is through or in the name of Jesus Christ and in the Spirit. But on the other hand Paul uses a language that makes it impossible to understand God only in such a categorical and distinguishing way. In several ways he talks about Father, Son and Spirit with an overlapping language of description when it comes their theological characteristics, roles and functions. The Father is known as “Father” in relation to the Son, and it is always God, the Father who is said to act in, with and through the Son and the Spirit. The Son and the Spirit never works by, or for them selves in opposition with God's will, but are constantly fulfilling God's purposes and pointing at the glorification and importance of him or one another. Paul's use of the terms makes it obvious that they as Father, Son and Spirit is fully interdependent on each other. God the Father appears and reveals himself through and in the Son and the Spirit. And in turn, the Son and the Spirit enables experience, availability and revelation or understanding of each other and of the Father. Paul's christology would have no grounds or relevance if there were no patriology; and likewise his patriology would be rather abstract and unsatisfactory without his pneumatology of the Spirit as God's renewed presence amongst his people. Therefor, for Paul, talk about God is necessarily talk about Father, Son and Spirit...|$|R
