5|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{productive}} lead-up, Davidson faltered {{in his first}} outing as Australia's Test spearhead. He conceded 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 behind on the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and left them a note asking them to report. The pair then went to sleep at the home of some supporters who had hosted the team for <b>dinner</b> <b>the</b> previous day.|$|E
5|$|McDowell's {{original}} {{script is}} far less comedic and much darker; the Maitlands' car crash is depicted graphically, with Barbara's arm being crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly drown in the river. A reference to this remained in all versions of the script, as Barbara remarks that her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during <b>dinner,</b> <b>the</b> Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack the Deetzes by tangling them to their chairs.|$|E

Edward was banker and Williams acted as the croupier. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats.

5|$|During <b>dinner,</b> <b>the</b> {{family is}} euphoric {{with their new}} powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about {{what they should be}} doing with them.

Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E
5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a <b>dinner.</b> <b>The</b> focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk was the {{dominant}} magnate in the East Anglia region. When the region's peasants revolted in 1381, {{he became a}} central figure in their repression. While in Bury St Edmunds, he was taken by surprise by the rebels while eating <b>dinner.</b> <b>The</b> rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster, attempted to force Suffolk to join the rebellion, hoping to lend legitimacy to the cause. When this failed, Litster turned to other prominent men. Suffolk then fled disguised as a groom, reaching London by way of St Albans. He soon returned to Bury with a force of 500 lances, and met little resistance. Much of the work suppressing the rebellion had been undertaken by Henry Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, leaving Suffolk to apprehend the remaining rebels for trial. In the rebellion Suffolk suffered financially: the peasants plundered property worth £1,000 from his castle at Mettingham.|$|E

5|$|While {{overseen by}} Heston Blumenthal, the head chef {{in the kitchen}} is Ashley Palmer-Watts. Palmer-Watts has {{previously}} worked with Blumenthal since 1999, and for five years was head chef at Blumenthal's other restaurant, the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck. The two chefs researched historical menu choices {{with help from the}} British Library and food historians. Blumenthal's first experience of historical cuisine was in 2000 when he discovered a recipe for roast chicken which required the bird to be plucked alive, and then cooked with a small volume of mercury. This was further enhanced as he filmed Heston's Feasts for Channel 4, in which he created a variety of feasts from different historical eras including Tudor, Medieval and Victorian. Despite being called <b>Dinner,</b> <b>the</b> restaurant is also open for lunch as the meaning of the name is intended to be the main meal of the day, regardless of the time at which it is eaten.|$|E
5|$|To claim her right, Mary Tudor began {{assembling}} {{her supporters}} in East Anglia and demanded to be recognised as queen by the Privy Council in London. When her letter arrived on 10 July 1553 during <b>dinner,</b> <b>the</b> Duchess of Suffolk, Jane's mother, and the Duchess of Northumberland broke into tears. Mary was gathering strength, and on 14 July the Duke marched to Cambridge with troops to capture her. As it came, {{he passed a}} tranquil week until he heard on 20 July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. On the orders of the Privy Council Northumberland himself now proclaimed Queen Mary at the market-place and awaited his arrest. His wife {{was still in the}} Tower, but was soon released. She tried to intercede personally for her imprisoned husband and five sons with Mary, who was staying outside London. However, five miles before reaching the court the Duchess was turned away on the Queen's orders. She then wrote a letter to her friend Lady Paget, the wife of William, Lord Paget, asking her to plead with the Queen's ladies for her husband's life. Her plea, if it went not unheard, was in vain, and the Duke of Northumberland was executed on 22 August 1553 on Tower Hill after having recanted his Protestant faith.|$|E
