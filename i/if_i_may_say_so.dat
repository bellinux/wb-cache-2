He made the {{following}} remarks during a light-hearted speech to an American audience in New York, while {{on his way to}} attend her coronation in 1953: [...] "We in Australia, of course, are British, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> to the boot heels...but we stand together–our people stand together –till the crack of doom." ...|$|E
2500|$|NMPs {{were made}} a {{permanent}} feature of Parliament {{with effect from}} 1 July 2010. Prior to this change, Parliament had to decide within six months after every election whether to appoint NMPs. The rationale for the changes was given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Parliament on 27 May 2009. According to him, the main motivation behind having NMPs as a permanent {{part of the system}} of government in Singapore {{was the fact that the}} scheme had been a great success and had improved the quality of debate in the House: [...] "The scheme has worked well. The NMPs represent non-partisan alternative views in Parliament, and the NMPs have made effective contributions and raised the quality of debate in Parliament. Sometimes, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> they may have outshone even the Opposition MPs. This NMP scheme should be a permanent part of our political system." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{religious}} polemic {{of about}} this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the richest Romans. Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul-smelling barbarians. Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> to the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians, yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the Romans. So you find men passing over everywhere, now to the Goths, now to the Bagaudae, or whatever other barbarians have established their power anywhere... We call those men rebels and utterly abandoned, whom we ourselves have forced into crime. For by what other causes were they made Bagaudae save by our unjust acts, the wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and extortion {{of those who have}} turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder? ...|$|E
6000|$|Me, mother dear? [...] You, faith, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it dutifully! [...] Had {{all been}} left to me, some time ere now [...] He would have wedded Kate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless I'll have a look," [...] said Bellew, with a smile, [...] "for I'm {{a bit of}} {{a doctor}} myself in such matters,--about a quarter of one, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{keeping a}} shop--this shop," [...] {{returned}} Mr Blurt; [...] "you {{once told me}} you were versed in natural history; here is a field for you: a natural-historical shop, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so." ...|$|R
60|$|TREISURE. I trust {{they will}} not find a mare's nest, sir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly disappointed, Little Bill, but sort o' ways scumbusticated, so to speak--perplexed, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Kind o' ways puzzled, d'ee see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, {{you were}} always your own self, unwise and {{reckless}} and with something in it kindred to mine, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> without offence.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are trying}} to be. I know. But you didn't ought to burgle. You are not the man to burgle. You are, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it--the thing will have been pointed out to you before--a coward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see! Putting {{two and two}} together, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so--" [...] and {{he glanced}} from her to the young men--"I see. Most decidedly, most one-sidedly, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> use the vulgarism, I see--e--e! Oh! but what a blow you give me! What a blow you give me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} more devil, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it, stirred up in a lady. There was two bright red spots on her cheeks, {{and her eyes}} looked exactly like a wildcat's I'd seen in the zoo. Her foot kept {{slapping}} the floor all the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not--I hope not. But you {{are beyond}} such influences. It seems to me, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> {{that you are}} beyond all influences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must congratulate you, Inspector, on {{handling}} so {{distinctive and}} instructive a case. Your powers, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> without offence, seem superior to your opportunities." ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [again gallant] But surely, Mrs Lutestring, {{that has}} been your own fault. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> a lady of your attractions need never have been lonely.|$|E
5000|$|Amy Dobek of the University of Missouri-Kansas City Library {{says that}} [...] "it’s {{not so much}} the stories {{themselves}} that are side-splittingly funny - it’s the combination of her histrionic storytelling style and her primitively mad skills with MSPaint that put her, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> over the top." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was he who}} {{had called}} Melbury by name. [...] "You look very down, Mr. Melbury--very, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> as much," [...] he observed, when the timber-merchant turned. [...] "But I know--I know. A very sad case--very. I was bred to the law, as you know, and am professionally no {{stranger}} to such matters. Well, Mrs. Fitzpiers has her remedy." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment, {{and then went}} on deprecatingly: [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> am glad he has married. After all, it is {{scarcely}} fit for a man to live as he has done, stripping himself of everything. It has been all effort and self-denial, and you can do so much to make things pleasant for him." ...|$|R
60|$|CUSINS [cautiously] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Lady Brit, I think Charles has rather happily {{expressed}} {{what we all}} feel. Homer, {{speaking of}} Autolycus, uses the same phrase.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{very glad}} to have the {{privilege}} of your acquaintance; and, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty sympathy. Good-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I fear you may {{possibly}} have {{to submit to}} {{a certain amount of}} good-natured chaff, but nothing more. All, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> is forgiven, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that, sir, you are right, and yet wrong. She was a packet, and (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it) {{a famous}} one." [...] His gaze {{travelled}} aloft, and descending rested on mine {{with a sort}} of gentle resignation. [...] "But the old pennon is down, as you see. At present she sails on a private adventure, and under private commission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, [...] "before {{we crossed}} the big divide I wasn't aware of your existence, and I'd only a hazy idea that I might come to England some day. Now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it, I've joined your group of friends and entered into their lives. One feels it can't have sprung from nothing; it isn't blind chance." ...|$|R
500|$|... they be very secret, and yet do I hear a {{whispering}} {{that they}} can find no presumptions of evil. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> to your Lordship my conscience: I think some of them be sorry for it, God forgive me. … Mine own opinion is much quieted … the circumstances and as many things as I can learn doth persuade me that only misfortune ...|$|R
60|$|It was no {{very great}} grief {{to me to}} do that, for he was, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> hardly worthy {{to have such a}} subaltern. I saluted, however, in silence.|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. [After a pause.] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I quite {{agree with}} you. I have often taken {{the liberty of}} warning your sister against going out in all weathers like this.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were quite}} correct," [...] {{returned}} the Minor Poet. [...] "I have a distinct recollection of having made {{one or two}} observations myself. Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I talked rather well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard from}} him {{but a few days}} ago," [...] Guy said. [...] "He is {{detained}} in England by the illness of Dame Margaret, or he would have hastened hither on hearing that the French army was moving north. I need scarcely ask how you are, Mistress Katarina, for you have changed much, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it without offence, for the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We haven't seen her? Oh we see bang off--with a click like a steel spring. It's our trade, it's our life, and {{we should}} be donkeys if we made mistakes. That's the way I saw you yourself, my lady, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so; that's the way, with a long pin {{straight}} through your body, I've got you. And just so I've got her!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "You had an option, sir. You {{could have}} said, 'I {{am not going}} to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I {{am not going to}} ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir—to say 'no'—and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but {{my brother}} has dressed up!" [...] cried the girl. [...] "Very much so. No end, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Why he's {{bearing down on}} you now in all his glory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} much, my fair lord; and yet, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> it is {{somewhat}} crowded together, so that my Lady Loring can, mayhap, scarce follow it. Were it in shorter periods----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{understand}} the affair at all," [...] Mr. Fischer declared, [...] "and, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I am a little weary of it. I came here to discuss another matter altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|MAZZINI [troubled]. You have {{completely}} upset me, Mrs Hushabye, by {{all you have}} said to me. That anyone could imagine that I--I, a consecrated soldier of freedom, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so--could sacrifice Ellie to anybody or anyone, or that I should ever have dreamed of forcing her inclinations in any way, is a most painful blow to my--well, I suppose you would say to my good opinion of myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm jiggered," [...] the man muttered, [...] "if it ain't Mr. Glover!" [...] Then he said aloud: [...] "Glad {{to see you}} back, sir. The ship's {{crew were}} all glad {{when they heard the}} other day that the news had come as how you were safe, for we had all been afraid you had been murdered by them niggers. You are looking mighty queer, sir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|KAUNITZ. [...] "Dangerous to the repose of Europe, those Russian encroachments on the Turk. Never will Imperial Majesty consent that Russia possess Moldavia or Wallachia; War sooner,--all things sooner! These {{views of}} Russia are {{infinitely}} dangerous to everybody. To your Majesty as well, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so; and no remedy conceivable against them,--to me none conceivable,--but this only, That Prussia and Austria join frankly in protest and absolute prohibition of them." ...|$|R
