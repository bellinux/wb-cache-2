25|$|Although {{the first}} arrivals were almost entirely {{made up of}} convicts and soldiers, {{it was not long}} before rumours of Van Diemen's Land began to attract free settlers, {{allowing}} Hobart Town to grow. But Hobart Town's isolation also led to a large number of 'undesirables' seeking to escape from former crimes, escaping the law, or <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for a life of solitude finding their way to the fledgling town. The area around the docks was rife with crime and prostitution, and heavy drinking and fighting were common.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{material}} {{at all levels}} from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from CBeebies, through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities, to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of Google Scholar. For distance education, help with homework and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> up more detail on an interesting fact, {{it has never been}} easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.|$|E
25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After {{crossing}} the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for a place to go, too. While lighting {{up the rest of the}} fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they don't distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} {{started with the}} Badgers {{receiving}} the kickoff. Wisconsin put together another impressive scoring drive using 12 plays to go 76 yards. The drive was closed out by a James White 2-yard touchdown run but kicker Kyle French missed the extra point, the Badgers lead to 34–0. Punt by Tech, punt by Wisconsin and punt by Tech again. The Badgers took over at their own 20-yard line and got to Tech's 42-yard line as the third quarter came to a close. Wisconsin then turned the ball over on downs.

After a Tech turnover-on-downs, a Wisconsin missed field goal, the Golden Eagles ran the clock out and the Badgers start the season 2–0 after a 48–0 victory over Tennessee Tech.|$|E
25|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, where Loki accuses nearly every female in {{attendance}} of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The {{introduction to the}} poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he knows all about herthat Freyja is not lacking in blame, {{for each of the}} gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjectshe says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

500|$|Melish engaged Constance Ortmayer {{to design}} the coin. Ortmayer later remembered, [...] "I was {{recommended}} by them, someone came through Cincinnati... they were <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for somebody so they recommended me". Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly on April 4, 1936 that the original [...] "lacked distinction and artistic merit" [...] and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, withholding approval.|$|E

He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day.

I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'".

500|$|During {{his time}} at Ipswich, Ramsey began experimenting with a new style of play that would {{eventually}} lead to success in the World Cup and led to his England team being styled, [...] "The Wingless Wonders". As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing fullbacks, who would naturally {{expect to see a}} winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As Bobby Charlton remarked, [...] "The Spanish fullbacks were <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at each other while we were going in droves through the middle". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.|$|E

[...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it." ...|$|E

The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony.

Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further.
