50|$|Rufigallol is {{particularly}} toxic to the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum {{and has a}} synergistic effect {{in combination with the}} antimalarial drug <b>exifone,</b> which has structural sumilarities to rufigallol.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} report we described the synergistic antimalarial interaction between two structurally similar compounds, rufigallol and <b>exifone.</b> To explain this phenomenon, we proposed that <b>exifone</b> is transformed inside the parasitized erythrocyte into a xanthone with potent antimalarial properties. We {{speculated that the}} transformation process was induced by the prooxidant activity of rufigallol. On {{the basis of this}} model we hypothesized that <b>exifone</b> would act synergistically with other oxidant drugs. In the present study we have found a similar synergistic interaction between <b>exifone</b> and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) against both chloroquine-susceptible and multidrug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The prooxidant activity of ascorbic acid against Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes is believed to result from an intraerythrocytic Fenton reaction occurring in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite. The hydroxyl radicals produced during this process are believed to attack <b>exifone,</b> which undergoes cyclodehydration to become 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentahydroxyxanthone (X 5). Evidence presented to support this "xanthone hypothesis" includes the demonstration that the <b>exifone</b> ==> X 5 transformation occurs readily in vitro under mildly acidic conditions in the presence of iron, ascorbic acid, and oxygen...|$|E
40|$|We have {{discovered}} a remarkable synergistic antimalarial interaction between rufigallol and the structurally similar compound <b>exifone.</b> The synergistic effects were produced in chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant clones of Plasmodium falciparum. The degree of potentiation as estimated by standard isobolar analysis was approximately 60 -fold for experiments initiated with asynchronous parasites. The most pronounced synergism was observed in experiments with synchronized trophozoite-infected erythrocytes, in which the degree of synergy was at least 300 -fold. While the mechanism underlying this drug potentiation remains unresolved, it is hypothesized that rufigallol acts in pro-oxidant fashion to produce oxygen radicals inside parasitized erythrocytes. These radicals would attack <b>exifone,</b> thereby initiating its transformation into a more potent compound, a xanthone...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAntioxidant 8 -alkylamino- 1, 4 -benzoxazines, (R,S) -(3 -tert-butyl- 8 -phenylethylamino- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 5 -yl) (phenyl) methanone (S 24429) and (R,S) -(3 -cyclopentyl- 8 -benzylamino- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 5 -yl) (phenyl) methanone (S 24718), were {{prepared}} {{according to a}} two-step one-pot electrochemical procedure. These compounds had been selected from a previous study of structure / activity. Both compounds (1 – 100 μM) prevented the fall in ATP levels caused by 24 h of hypoxia in astrocytes. Both compounds (1 and 10 mg/kg i. p.) were powerful neuroprotective agents in protecting against the lesions induced by 15 mg S-bromo-willardiine injected into the cortex or white matter of 5 -day old mice pups. In contrast, <b>exifone,</b> an antioxidant compound, was inactive at these doses. S 24429 and S 24718 appear to be novel neuroprotective agents, which are effective in a model of brain damage mimicking the lesions underlying cerebral palsy...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) into senile plaques {{is one of}} the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. Aggregated Abeta is toxic to cells in culture and this has been considered to be the cause of neurodegeneration that occurs in the Alzheimer disease brain. The discovery of compounds that prevent Abeta toxicity may lead {{to a better understanding of}} the processes involved and ultimately to possible therapeutic drugs. Low nanomolar concentrations of Abeta 1 - 42 and the toxic fragment Abeta 25 - 35 have been demonstrated to render cells more sensitive to subsequent insults as manifested by an increased sensitivity to formazan crystals following MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction. Formation of the toxic beta-sheet conformation by Abeta peptides is increased by negatively charged membranes. Here we demonstrate that phloretin and <b>exifone,</b> dipolar compounds that decrease the effective negative charge of membranes, prevent association of Abeta 1 - 40 and Abeta 25 - 35 to negatively charged lipid vesicles and Abeta induced cell toxicity. These results suggest that Abeta toxicity is mediated through a nonspecific physicochemical interaction with cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{erythrocytic}} {{development of}} Plasmodium falciparum {{is divided into}} the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages based on morphologic assessment. Using highly synchronous ring and trophozoite cultures of P. falciparum, we observed considerable differences in their sensitivity to hydroxyxanthones: trophozoites were much {{more sensitive to the}} drugs than ring-stage parasites. Trophozoites treated with a prototypic xanthone, the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentahydroxy derivative (X 5), were arrested in their development and became degenerate in appearance within 24 hr of drug exposure. These morphologic changes appeared to reflect the cytotoxic nature of the action of the drug against the parasite, since daughter ring-stage forms were not observed following addition of the drug. That X 5 was more active against parasites in the later stages of intraerythrocytic development is consistent with the proposed mode of action, inhibition of heme polymerization. Knowledge of the structure-activity relationships for xanthones as anti-malarial agents has also been expanded. Xanthones with a hydroxyl group in the peri-position exhibited decreased antimalarial activity, possibly due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl and consequent reduced affinity for heme. Paired hydroxyls attached to {{the lower half of the}} xanthone greatly enhanced drug potency. We were led to investigate the antiparasitic action of xan-thones by the discovery of a remarkable antimalarial synergy between <b>exifone</b> (a hexahydroxybenzophenone) and two ox...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Autoimmune {{inflammatory}} diseases can {{be triggered}} by specific bacteria in susceptible individuals. Terminalia ferdinandiana (Kakadu plum) has documented therapeutic properties as a general antiseptic agent. However, the high ascorbic acid levels in Kakadu plum fruit may interfere with this activity. Methods: T. ferdinandiana leaf solvent extracts were investigated by disc diffusion assay against a panel of bacteria known to trigger autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Their MIC values were determined to quantify and compare their efficacies. Toxicity was determined using the Artemia franciscana nauplii bioassay. Non-targeted HPLC separation of crude extracts coupled to high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy with screening against 3 compound databases {{was used for the}} identification and characterisation of individual components in crude plant extracts. Results: Methanolic, aqueous and ethyl acetate T. Ferdinandiana leaf extracts displayed potent antibacterial activity in the disc diffusion assay against the bacterial triggers of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The ethyl acetate extract had the most potent inhibitory activity, with MIC values less than 120 姯ml against P. mirabilis and A. baylyi (both reference and clinical strains). The ethyl acetate extract had similar potency against K. pneumonia (both reference and clinical strains), but had higher MIC values (2733 姯ml) against P. aeruginosa. The methanolic extract was also a potent inhibitor of bacterial growth, with MIC values generally < 1000 姯ml. In comparison, the water, chloroform and hexane leaf extracts were all substantially less potent antibacterial agents, with MICs values generally well over 1000 姯ml. All T. ferdinandiana leaf extracts were either nontoxic or of low toxicity in the Artemia fransiscana bioassay. Non-biased phytochemical analysis of the ethyl acetate extract revealed the presence of high levels of tannins (<b>exifone</b> (4 -galloylpyrogallol), ellagic acid dehydrate, trimethylellagic acid, chebulic acid, corilagin, punicalin, castalagin and chebulagic acid). Conclusion: The low toxicity of the T. ferdinandiana leaf extracts and their potent inhibitory bioactivity against the bacterial triggers of autoimmune inflammatory disorders indicates their potential as medicinal agents in the treatment and prevention of these diseases.
