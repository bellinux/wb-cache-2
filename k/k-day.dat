50|$|Students {{attending}} Michigan Technological University have a {{wide range}} of activities to participate in, {{whether or not they are}} living in the residence halls. In addition to the various small interest groups which form throughout the year, they participate in Greek Life, Student Organizations, and the Enterprise Program; many organize and attend campus traditions, such as <b>K-Day,</b> the Parade of Nations, and the Winter Carnival (which also attracts alumni from across the country); furthermore, there are motivational drives to raise student activity levels and involvement in the school community, typically for those without membership in a student organization.|$|E

50|$|The {{name was}} changed to Capital Ex, in 2006. There was some {{controversy}} over the change in name from Klondike Days, with many locals continuing {{to refer to the}} exhibition as Klondike Days or <b>K-Days.</b>|$|R
40|$|Several {{alternative}} {{definitions of}} extreme events are proposed. As {{the first step}} a statistical analysis of daily precipitation measurement time series from the Hurbanovo SHMI Observatory and elaboration of potentially dangerous precipitation events is carried out. Then, combined characteristics based on daily temperature, daily air humidity and daily precipitation totals are computed. The drought index based on normalized deviations from long-term averages is defined. Alternatively, to define extreme events "Data envelopment analysis " (DEA) is employed with <b>K-day</b> periods of values of temperature, humidity and precipitation corresponding to decision making units. In this paper we have used the period of K = 10 days for both methodologies for identification of extreme events. The results of all definitions of extreme events are compared...|$|E
40|$|The anthors {{emphasizes}} {{the necessity for}} considering the variability of the estimate ofT-year event in hydrologic frequency analysis and proposes a framework for evaluatingprobability distribution models. The variability (or estimation error) of T-year event is usedas a criterion for model evaluation as well as three goodness-of-fit criteria (SLSC, MLL,and AIC) in the framework. The jackknife and the bootstrap methods play important rolesin estimating the variability. For the annual maxima of <b>k-day</b> precipitation (k= 1, 2, 3) inthe Lake Biwa basin, the Gumbel distribution {{is regarded as the}} best among five distributionmodels with two parameters; for the daily precipitation at Osaka, the SQRT-exponential-typedistribution of maximum is the best among ten distributions with two or three parameters. The bootstrap method also reveals the relationship between the amount of data and theestimation error of T-year event...|$|E

Remaining errors are our responsibility. THE RETURN IDENTITY PROPOSITION UNDER PRICE LIMITS Many of the empirical studies involving the estimation of the return-generating process (RGP) under conditions of a price-limit regime base their arguments on the equality of the aggregate market return during a <b>k-day</b> limit sequence and the aggregate theoretical return during those periods had the exchange not adopted a price-limit regime. Using an extension of Vives (1995) model, we investigate whether this equality, called here the Return Identity Proposition (RIP), actually holds. We demonstrate that the RIP may not hold when noise traders act in the markets. This result implies that while the RIP may practically be useful in empirical studies of price limits, one should also consider cases where it does not hold...|$|E
5000|$|In Alberta, Canada, the {{tradition}} is also {{closely associated with}} the major summer fairs and exhibitions of each town and city, including most famously <b>K-Days</b> in Edmonton, and the Calgary Stampede in that city. The Calgary Stampede, Canada's largest rodeo, had been associated with pancake breakfasts since 1923 when a local rancher began serving pancakes from his camp stove during the festivities to anyone who came by. [...] The tradition soon became for local businesses and charities across Calgary and Edmonton to host breakfasts for their employees, customers, and others during the Stampede and <b>K-Days.</b> Likewise with Western Days in Red Deer, etc. Besides the fairs and rodeos, pancakes are also widely served on Canada Day, including at the Alberta Legislature.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a novel classification algorithm called MCC (Minimal Cover Classification), which {{works well for}} numerical data and categorical data. Given a new data tuple, it provides values for each class that measures {{the likelihood of the}} tuple belonging to that class. We then apply the MCC algorithm on real stock market data to predict the `upward' or `downward' trend of k-days stock returns. To improve the prediction accuracy we use the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse transform to filter noise whilst preserving the trend of global movement of time series in the time domain. The experimental result shows that the MCC algorithm is comparable to C 4. 5. Using MCC as a mining algorithm to predict the `upward' or `downward' trend of <b>k-day</b> stock returns, the average hit rate on pre-processed data is 20. 55 % higher than that on the original data. This means that the prediction accuracy has been remarkably improved by means of the proposed MCC algorithm on noise filtered time series...|$|E

40|$|A {{regional}} {{frequency analysis}} of heavy <b>k-day</b> precipitation totals (k = 1 to 7 days) {{has recently been}} {{carried out in the}} Czech Republic by means of the L-moment-based regionalization approach proposed by Hosking and Wallis. This method has generally been considered a kind of standard in the field of the frequency analysis since the early 1990 s worldwide. However, there are other frequently referred regionalization techniques in the literature, {{and one of the most}} remarkable methods is the region-of-influence (ROI) approach. Its main idea is that there is no need to delineate fixed boundaries between the proposed regions but rather each site can have its own “region ” – a group of sites that are sufficiently similar to the site of interest. The ROI method has been proposed in order to overcome possible inconsistencies that may occur on boundaries of fixed homogeneous regions. In such cases, a classical approach of the regional analysis may lead to undesirable step changes of variables and estimated quantiles; such problems are eliminated in the ROI method by defining a unique set of stations (a “region of influence”) for each site under study. The ROI method has up to now been used predominantly in connection with a flood frequency analysis; the current study is one of the first attempts to develop the ROI approach to the frequency analysis of precipitation extremes. A comparison of the results with findings of the “standard ” regional frequency analysis methods in the area of the Czech Republic is performed. Key words: regional frequency analysis, region-of-influence approach, extreme precipitation events, Czech Republic...|$|E

40|$|Lentic cave {{habitats}} {{are almost}} always heterotrophic habitats where there are food and oxygen input from the surface. This hydrological exchange {{seems to be the}} key factor shaping most groundwater communities. Litter processing in cave water environments has not been experimentally studied as much as it has in lotic subterranean systems, although detritus is likely a critical resource for organisms inhabiting shallow groundwater habitats. The present study sought to evaluate the processing rates and the nitrogen and phosphorous dynamics in plant debris deposited in lentic habitats of two Neotropical limestone caves during 99 days. 84 – 10 × 10 cm 2 litterbags with mesh sizes of 0. 04 mm 2 and 9 mm 2 were used. In each weighed litter bag, 50 green, intact plant leaf disks (± 2. 0 gr/bag) were conditioned. At the end of the experiment, the average weight loss was only 17. 4 %. No macroinvertebrates were found associated to the debris, but significant differences in the processing rate in relation to the cave and mesh size were observed. The weight loss rate of the plant debris was considered slow (average 0. 003 <b>K-day).</b> The amount of nitrogen and remaining phosphorous in the plant debris in the two caves showed variations over time with a tendency to increase probably due to the development of microorganisms which assimilate nitrogen and phosphorus. The slow processing rate of the plant debris can be due mainly to the fact that these lentic cave habitats are restrictive to colonization by shredder invertebrates. Furthermore, the abrasive force of the water, which {{plays an important role in}} the processing and availability of fragmented debris for colonization by microorganisms, is absent...|$|E

Although far away from Dawson City and the Klondike River, Edmonton became known as a [...] "Gateway to the North" [...] for gold prospectors en route to Canada's North. It was in the city that many would collect the {{necessary}} goods for trekking up north in search of wealth. Individuals and teams of explorers arrived in Edmonton and prepared for travel by foot, York boat, dog team, or horses. Travel to the Yukon over land via what was sometimes called the [...] "all Canada" [...] route—and the prospectors that took this route—were often referred to as [...] "overlanders".

5000|$|Johnstone's {{activism}} and philanthropy work began in Edmonton, Alberta {{in the summer}} of 2011 when he began going door-to-door around various neighbourhoods by himself collecting food and clothing donations for various charities, such as the Edmonton Food Bank, the youth shelter, and various homeless shelters and soup kitchens. In June 2013, Can Man Dan provided immediate assistance to Calgary's Food Bank and those affected by the 2013 Alberta floods in the form of 4000 pounds of food. In December 2013 and 2014, local Edmonton chain restaurant - Delux Burger Bar featured Can Man Dan as their [...] "Celebrity Chef". Delux Burger Bar locations across Edmonton added the [...] "Can Man Dan burger" [...] to their menus and gave a portion of the burger sales to the Edmonton Food Bank on Dan's behalf. Johnstone made headlines in April 2014 after he announced that he would wrestle in a professional wrestling match with Canadian wrestling promotion, the PWA (The Prairie Wrestling Alliance) to raise money, food and awareness for Edmonton's homeless youth population. Despite suffering a fractured nose during the bout, Johnstone ultimately won his debut wrestling match raising thousands of dollars and thousands of pounds of food for Edmonton's Youth Empowerment and Support Services (YESS), an organization that Dan's mother had used when she was a teenager. In June 2015, Johnstone was ranked fourth in [...] "WO? Magazine"'s list of the [...] "Top 5 Anti-Poverty Activists". In the summer of 2015, Johnstone was voted in by Edmonton's general public to serve as an honorary parade marshal for their annual <b>K-Days</b> festival parade. Johnstone, along 5 other community heroes and various departments of Edmonton's first responders were made honorary parade marshals and each given $2500 to donate to a charity of their choice.|$|R
