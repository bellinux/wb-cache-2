40|$|International audienceThanks {{to reduced}} switch stress, {{high quality of}} load wave, <b>easy</b> <b>packaging</b> and good extensibility, the {{cascaded}} H-bridge multilevel inverter is widely used in wind power system. To guarantee stable operation of system, a new fault diagnosis method, based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Relative Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), is proposed for H-bridge multilevel inverter. To avoid the influence of load variation on fault diagnosis, the output voltages of the inverter is chosen as the fault characteristic signals. To shorten the time of diagnosis and improve the diagnostic accuracy, the main features of the fault characteristic signals are extracted by FFT. To further reduce the training time of SVM, the feature vector is reduced based on RPCA that can get a lower dimensional feature space. The fault classifier is constructed via SVM. An experimental prototype of the inverter is built to test the proposed method. Compared to other fault diagnosis methods, the experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|In this letter, a new {{microstrip}} line {{to groove}} gap waveguide (GGW) transition has been proposed. The transition {{is based on}} a resonant cavity, which efficiently helps to couple the field from microstrip line to GGW. In this transition, the microstrip section is extended into the cavity without any requirement of contact with the GGW. Such contactless transition inside the waveguide is advantageous as it allows <b>easy</b> <b>packaging</b> and integration of millimeter wave circuitry with gap waveguide components such as filters and array antennas. Alumina (epsilon(r) = 9. 9) was used as the microstrip substrate for the proposed transition in this letter. Measured results for the V-band transition show a relative bandwidth of 26 % for a return loss better than 10 dB. The maximum insertion loss of the manufactured back-to-back prototype is found to be 1. 32 dB, which also includes the losses of a 5. 45 -mm-long microstrip line on an Alumina substrate. After subtracting the losses in the microstrip section, the losses in a single transition are found to be varying between 0. 145 and 0. 38 dB over the bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{filters are}} very {{important}} in optical fibre systems. Examples of their applicatinos are ASE filtering or gain-flattening in EDFA's. Current devices are basically bandpass filters based on thin film technology, which uses some bulk optic techniques, and loss filters based on long period gratings written in fibres. However, the response of these gratings is highly sensitive to-changes of temperature and strain, besides the grating strength decays over time. All-fibre filters based on twin-core fibres designed to phase-match at the filtering wavelength were demonstrated sometime ago. We present a highly reproducible and accurate way of tuning the coupling wavelength of a mismatched twin-core fibre over 500 nm wavelength range. The filter wavelength is controlled by reducing the fibre diameter on a coupler rig while the filter strength is tuned by adjusting the fibre length. Strain and temperature sensitivity of these filters have been also characterised. They present high environmental stability (~ 0. 26 nm/ 100 °C and 7. 8 x 10 nm/µ epsilon) which allows <b>easy</b> <b>packaging.</b> Therefore, we demonstrate {{the implementation of a}} tunable, low loss and high quality all-fibre bandpass or bandstop filter...|$|E

30|$|Packages are {{re-usable}} {{components for}} most of object-oriented systems. To promote reuse in object-oriented systems and to make deployment and maintenance tasks <b>easy,</b> <b>packages</b> in object-oriented systems must be cohesive. Quantification of cohesion of packages can be very useful in assessing their reusability, quality etc. In this paper, a new measure for the measurement of package cohesion is proposed. The cohesion of a package is {{measured in terms of}} the degree of intra-package dependencies among its elements. The hierarchical structure of packages has also been taken into account during the measurement. The proposed measure has been validated theoretically as well as empirically. An empirical study has been conducted using 25 packages taken from six open-source software projects developed in Java. The proposed package cohesion measure is found to be a useful indicator of external quality factors such as the reusability of packages. The proposed metric is also established as a better predictor of code reusability than the existing cohesion measures.|$|R

This is a complex task that is hampered {{by the fact that}} configuration models are abstractions of the real world and cannot contain all dependencies between the artifacts and the environment. For embedded systems this is crucial because calibration is used to adjust the product to its operating environment. In this paper we show how prepackaged variability makes the configuration of complex embedded systems <b>easier.</b> <b>Packages</b> of artifacts known to work well together are introduced into the configuration model and used during product derivation. Functionality of these artifacts is shown to the outside of the package. Based on this functionality the packages are selected and integrated into the product.
