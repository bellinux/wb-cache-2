500|$|However, RCA Records, {{their former}} label who {{released}} Hello Master outside their native Canada {{in all other}} territories starting in 2006, became hopeful that the band's next record would have similar success.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of phototherapy with a newly-developed 1450 -nm diode laser in patients with mild to moderate acne.

Only one patient discontinued treatment due to vesicle formation as an adverse effect. Phototherapy using this diode laser source was effective and well tolerated in acne patients, suggesting that this phototherapy may be a new modality for the treatment of acne...|$|R

We formulated a basic {{model of the}} optimal level of shopping frequency. Hanoi consumer survey data has been analysed using the binary choice Probit model to measure factors that influence the major characteristics related to the high-shopping frequency patterns of Vietnamese consumers. The results consolidate {{the validity of the}} basic model and show that freshness, convenience (distance), gender and the presence of children in the household had a significant effect on the frequency of shopping. In contrast, factors such as owning a refrigerator as well as income did not have a significant effect in shaping consumer shopping behaviour. ...|$|R

2500|$|Over time, as the {{importance}} of the Grand Vizier within the Ottoman system rose {{at the expense of the}} palace, it became common to hold an afternoon meeting (ikindi divani) to wrap up leftover issues, after the afternoon prayer (ikindi), at the Grand Vizier's residence. Eventually, the ikindi divani came to meet <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and took over a large part of the Council's actual business. The Grand Vizier's pre-eminence was formalized in 1654, when a dedicated building (bab-i ali, the [...] "Sublime Porte", or pasha kapısı) was constructed to serve the Grand Vizier both as a residence and as an office. The bureaucracy serving the Imperial Council was gradually transferred to this new location, and by the 18th century, the Imperial Council itself had, according to Bernard Lewis, [...] "dwindled into insignificance". The reformist sultans of the late 18th/early 19th century replaced the Imperial Council by a new institution, as well as forming special councils to apply their reforms. This system gradually evolved into a Western-style cabinet government.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the lipid-lowering effects of methanolic extract of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) leaves in rats fed an high cholesterol diet, and {{compared with a}} standard hypolipidemic drug, Questran (Qu). The effects of VA on the lipid profile were assessed by measuring the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, lipid peroxidation (LPO), phospholipid, and glutathione (GSH) in the plasma and liver of the rats. Administration of cholesterol at a dose of 30 mg/ 0. 3 ml, <b>five</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for nine consecutive <b>weeks</b> resulted in <b>a</b> significant increase (p 0. 05) in the PMF HDL-cholesterol and phospholipid levels of the treated rats when compared to hypercholesterolemic rats. There were significant decreases (p < 0. 05) in the LPO levels of extract-treated rats. Precisely, VA at 100 and 200 mg/kg decreased the levels of plasma and PMF LPO by 38 %, 42 % and 35 %, 45 %, respectively. In addition, VA augmented the cholesterol-induced decrease in PMF glutathione levels of the rats. Taken together, these results suggest the lipid-lowering effects of VA and, probably serve as a new potential natural product {{for the treatment of}} hyperlipidemia...|$|R

In conclusion, a strength training program is highly recommended for female overhead athletes combined with a proper flexibility regimen to promote best practice. ...|$|R
