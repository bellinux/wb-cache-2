5|$|Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and {{are believed}} to have transferred to humans (a process known as zoonosis) in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

5|$|W11 {{is found}} {{in a family of}} South German Draft horses {{descending}} from a single white stallion, in which the causative mutation is thought to <b>have</b> <b>originated.</b> The mutation responsible for the W11 phenotype is a splice site mutation of intron 20 (c.2684+1G>A).|$|E
5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to take}} advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> from the explosion of the SN 1987A supernova.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery; {{a sample of}} the latter was discovered to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> in Oxford in the 2nd century.

5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago, {{explosive}} activity {{occurred at}} Ciomadul. That timespan {{coincides with the}} deposition of tephra from volcanoes in Italy in Europe; {{it is possible that}} tephra also came from Ciomadul. Indeed, the age of Ciomadul's last eruption overlaps with the age of the Campanian Ignimbrite. Some tephra layers found in two drilling cores of the Black Sea may <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> at Ciomadul.|$|E
5|$|Dactyl may <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> at {{the same}} time as Ida, from the {{disruption}} of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E
5|$|Gumbo z'herbes may <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> {{with the}} French, Germans, or West Africans. It has {{similarities}} to the French dish potage aux herbes ("soup with greens"), {{as well as}} to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.|$|E

5|$|Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles {{usually found}} in plants, {{complete}} {{with their own}} genomes. These apicoplasts are thought to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> through the endosymbiosis of algae and {{play a crucial role}} in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{an example}} of an aposematic organism. Their bright {{coloration}} advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to <b>have</b> <b>originated</b> at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.|$|E
