[...] After experimenting with different producers, originating from Nashville, Swift chose Chapman because of the unique sound he put into songs. Big Machine Records was skeptical about hiring Chapman because he had never done a studio album prior to Taylor Swift, only demos. Swift described the songs he produced as [...] "the right chemistry hit" [...] and therefore, Big Machine Records accepted Chapman producing some of the album's songs. In the end, Chapman produced {{all but one of the}} tracks on Taylor Swift. Recording was executed during a four-month period before 2005 was over.|$|E

I was mad enough, I can tell you; for if Rebecca made any noise and woke her father he could overtake that old mare long before she could get to the village.

500|$|Universal also {{submitted}} Sheriff's {{first draft}} to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer Joseph Breen {{than it had}} from the British. Breen reported back that the script [...] "contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code." [...] A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted on October 24 and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who {{had no interest in}} the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of Show Boat, encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film. On January 14, 1936, producer E. M. Asher advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> and <b>that</b> a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.|$|R
50|$|Britain was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the money}} <b>that</b> {{belongs to the}} metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did {{not only have to}} pay for infrastructural {{development}} but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends. As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having {{a significant impact on the}} colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies. This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, then Lord Passfield. Its initial annual budget of £1 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the infrastructure of transport, electrical power and water supply in colonies and dominions abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade. The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now <b>use</b> metropolitan funds <b>to</b> develop the colonies.|$|R

50|$|Ted Kennedy {{had been}} asked to take his brother Robert’s place at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and had refused. He ran for Senate Majority Whip in 1969, but many had thought that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> as a {{platform}} for 1972. But then came the notorious Chappaquiddick incident that killed Kennedy's car passenger Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy refused to run for president in 1972 and 1976. Many of his supporters suspected that Chappaquiddick had destroyed any ability he had to win on a national level. However, in the summer of 1979, Kennedy consulted with his extended family, and that fall, he let it leak out that because of Carter’s failings, 1980 might indeed be the year. Gallup had him beating the president by over two to one.|$|E

[...] Dylan's and Clayton's publishing companies sued each other over the alleged plagiarism. As it turned out, Clayton's song was derived from an earlier folk song entitled [...] "Who's Gonna Buy You Chickens When I'm Gone?", which was in the public domain. The lawsuits, which were settled out of court, had no effect on the friendship between the two songwriters.|$|E
50|$|At Battleground, Kevin Owens {{defeated}} AJ Styles to win {{his third}} United States Championship. On the following episode of SmackDown, Styles wanted to invoke his championship rematch, but he was interrupted by the returning Chris Jericho, who also wanted to invoke his rematch from when he lost the title to Owens back in May. As both Styles and Jericho were contractually owed rematches, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon decided that they would both get their rematches for the title in a triple threat match that night against Owens, where Styles pinned Jericho to regain the title. After the match, Owens invoked his championship rematch for the following week. During the rematch that episode, Owens attacked the referee, but lost even though both shoulders {{were not on the}} mat. A frustrated Owens confronted Shane and SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan and demanded a rematch, but with a competent referee. Bryan scheduled the rematch for SummerSlam and made Shane the special guest referee. The following week, the three met in the ring where Shane said he would call the match fairly. A brawl eventually broke out between Owens and Styles and Styles accidentally performed a Pele Kick on Shane. The following week, Styles called out Shane to apologize, but Shane said there was no need to. Styles then asked Shane if he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> against him to screw him over at SummerSlam. Shane said no, but that if Styles lays a hand on him during the match, he would fight back, unlike normal referees. Owens came out and said that he liked that because that meant that Styles could not get himself intentionally disqualified. He then offered a hand shake to Shane, who refused and said that Owens should shake Styles hand. A physical confrontation broke out between Owens and Styles that Shane tried to stop, but it ended with Owens accidentally performing a Superkick on Shane.|$|E
40|$|The {{attribute}} selection techniques for supervised learning, {{used in the}} preprocessing phase to emphasize the most relevant attributes, allow making models of classification simpler and easy to understand. Depending on the method to apply: starting point, search organization, evaluation strategy, and the stopping criterion, there is an added cost to the classification algorithm that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>that</b> normally will be compensated, in greater or smaller extent, by the attribute reduction in the classification model. The algorithm (SOAP: Selection of Attributes by Projection) has some interesting characteristics: lower computational cost (O(mn log n) m attributes and n examples in the data set) with respect to other typical algorithms due {{to the absence of}} distance and statistical calculations; with no need for transformation. The performance of SOAP is analysed in two ways: percentage of reduction and classification. SOAP has been compared to CFS [6] and ReliefF [11].
