40|$|Pig dung {{was used}} as manure at 18 and 36 t/ha/year in carp polyculture (without {{supplementary}} feeding) for 270 days. It was observed that pig dung at both the levels did not degrade the physico-chemical properties (pH, dissolved oxygen and alkalinity) of water. The nutrient (phosphates and nitrates) level of water was higher <b>in</b> <b>manured</b> ponds than control ponds (no manuring, only supplementary feeding). Further, plankton levels (phyto- and zooplankton) were also significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>manured</b> ponds. The growth of Catla catla and Labeo rohita was significantly more <b>in</b> <b>manured</b> ponds than <b>in</b> control ponds. Growth of Cirrhinus cirrhosus and Cyprinus carpio was significantly more <b>in</b> ponds <b>manured</b> with pig dung at 18 t/ha/year than in control ponds {{and the growth of}} Ctenopharyngodon idellus was significantly more in control than <b>in</b> <b>manured</b> ponds...|$|R

40|$|Sulfadimethoxine is {{a widely}} used sulfonamide {{veterinary}} antibiotic and could {{be a source of}} agricultural contamination. Therefore, infor-mation is needed about its degradation kinetics <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> under aer-obic conditions. Based on the analysis of first-order kinetics and the assumption that sulfadimethoxine availability for degradation in ma-nure could be limiting, a new kinetic model was developed and was found to fit the degradation kinetics well. The degradation rate <b>in</b> sterile <b>manure</b> was found to be much lower than <b>in</b> nonsterile <b>manure,</b> indicating that biodegradation was significant. <b>In</b> biologically active <b>manure,</b> the degradation rate constant decreased with increasing ini-tial concentration of sulfadimethoxine, implying that the activity of the degrading microorganisms was inhibited. Increasing moisture or temperature was found to increase sulfadimethoxine degradation <b>in</b> <b>manure.</b> Mixing manure containing high levels of sulfadimethoxine wit...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{releases}} of house fly Musca domestica (L) and stable fly Stomoxys calcitrans (L). Produced by manure piles accumulated nearby horse stables and dairy farm village in Abu-Graib provide continuous threat to inhabitants west of Baghdad. Timing of fly’s mass release {{in association with}} the presence of Escherichia coli <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> piles was examined at these locations. Experimental result indicated that flies survived during cold period of December and January in form of larvae deep <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> piles where temperature was around 15 - 17 °C. Once the population of fly’s larvae started to increase by the second week of February, the concentration of E. coli was up to 80 × 106 CFU mL− 1 <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> suspension. Later when larval population reached to a maximum number by the last week of April, the concentration of E. coli <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> sample dropped down to 38 × 102 CFU mL− 1. Similar trend was observed with the proportion of E. coli to general bacteria present <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> samples where the percent decreased from 89 % in early season to 1. 5 % when maximum number of larvae was recorded. The correlation coefficient (R) between the number of larvae and coli form bacteria was =- 0. 73657. These results suggest the association of larval development with the consumption of E. coli. Thus manipulation of bacterial community <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> piles may lead to possible eradication of fly’s seasonal release...|$|R

40|$|The ubiquitary {{occurence}} of phosphane <b>in</b> technical <b>manure</b> {{treatment plants}} was confirmed {{using a new}} gaschromatographical method. Additionally, phosphane is captured {{in a variety of}} soil and liquid matrices (manure, soils, sediments, metals, feed of animals). Different sources of phosphane <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> could be identified: 1. The feed of animals contains phosphane in concentrations which are in a close correlation to the phosphane concentrations <b>in</b> <b>manure.</b> 2. Phosphane is liberated from metallic surfaces upon contact to corrosive microbial metabolity. 3. The biogenic production of phosphane was observed under conditions of selective inhibition of methanogenesis in anaerobic mineralisation of organic compounds, exclusively. Free organophosphanes could not be detected <b>in</b> technical <b>manure</b> treatment plants. The results permit the formulation of strategies for the reduction and prevention of phosphane emissions <b>in</b> <b>manure</b> treatment plants. (orig.)
