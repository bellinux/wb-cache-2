40|$|A major {{field of}} {{research}} at the future accelerator facility at GSI will be the exploration of the QCD phase diagram in the region of high baryon densities. This approach is complementary to the studies of matter at high temperatures performed at the CERN-SPS, RHIC and the future LHC. Experimental observables and the proposed detector system will be discussed. 1 The accelerator project at GSI GSI has presented plans for a new International Accelerator Facility for Beams of Ions and Antiprotons which will provide unique research opportunities in the fields of nuclear, hadron and plasma physics [1]. The planned accelerator will deliver primary beams (protons up to 60 GeV, Uranium up to 23 AGeV, Nickel up to 30 AGeV) and secondary beams (rare isotopes and antiprotons) with high intensity and quality. The research program includes the study of nuclei far from stability, hadron spectroscopy, the study of compressed nuclear matter, the investigation of plasmas induced by ion and laser beams and atomic physics. The future facility comprises a double-ring synchrotron, rings for accumulation, cooling and storage of primary and secondary beams, and dedicated <b>detector</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The <b>layout</b> of the facility is displayed in figure 1. A major {{field of research}} will be the study of super-dense baryonic matter as produced in heavy-ion collisions at energies of up to about 30 AGeV. The aim of the experiments is to explore the QCD phase diagram at high net baryon densities and moderate temperatures. This approach is complementary to the heavy-ion collision program performed at CERN-SPS, RHIC and at the future LHC where strongly interacting matter at very high temperatures and low net baryon densities is formed. The experimental investigation of super-dense baryonic matter is expected to provide information on (i) the properties ofFigure 1 : Schematic layout of the existing (left part) and the planned accelerator facility at GSI (right part). hadrons in dense matter, (ii) the deconfinement phase transition from hadronic to quark-gluon matter at high baryon densities, and (iii) the equation-of-state of strongly interacting matter.
