50|$|On July 30, 2014, it was {{announced}} that the E. W. Scripps Company would acquire Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. The combined firm will retain their broadcast properties, including WSYM, and spin off their print assets as Journal Media Group. The deal would make WSYM a sister station to WXYZ and WMYD in Detroit. Also in July 2014, WSYM began operating MyNetworkTV outlet WHTV through a local marketing agreement. That station was previously operated by Media <b>General</b> (<b>owner</b> of CBS affiliate WLNS-TV) and was based out of that station's facility. Through the new arrangement with WSYM, WHTV would offer additional local programming. The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014. It was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.

50|$|On January 27, 2016, Nexstar {{announced}} that it would acquire Media <b>General,</b> <b>owner</b> of KWQC-TV, for $4.6 billion. The new name of the combined company is Nexstar Media Group. Due to FCC regulations which prohibit ownership of two or more of the top four TV stations in any television market, Nexstar was required to sell either WHBF or KWQC to another company. Nexstar was allowed to keep KGCW, either in its existing duopoly with WHBF or under a new duopoly with KWQC as that station is ranked below the top four ratings threshold. On June 3, 2016, Nexstar revealed that it would keep WHBF and its Green Bay sister station WFRV-TV and sell Media General stations KWQC and its Green Bay sister station WBAY-TV to Gray Television for $270 million. On January 11, 2017, the FCC approved the transaction and the merger between Media General and Nexstar was completed on January 17, 2017.|$|E

A similar waiver was refused to KNIN-TV in Boise as the station, a CW affiliate {{at the time}} the waiver application was filed, appeared to have reasonable prospects of financial break-even without a takeover by Journal-owned ABC affiliate KIVI-TV; that decision was subsequently appealed, with the waiver being granted upon further review (Journal Broadcast Group would eventually be required to sell KNIN in 2014, as the station's financial condition improved enough in its post-2011 existence as a Fox affiliate to make it unsuitable for the E. W. Scripps Company - which {{was in the process of}} purchasing Journal's broadcasting unit in a deal in which Journal simultaneously merged with Scripps' publishing unit - to acquire it under a renewed waiver, in addition to the fact that it could not acquire it legally as the market had fewer than eight unique owners).|$|E

There is no {{strictly}} accurate {{definition of}} an estray {{to be found in}} any reported decision but from all of them may be deduced the following: An estray is an animal, by nature tame and reclaimable, having a value as property generally recognized by law, as a sheep, ox, hog, or horse, which is found wandering and the owner of which is unknown. Animals on which the law sets no value as a dog or cat and animals ferae naturae as a bear or wolf cannot be considered as estrays.2 Right to Forfeit. a. At Common Law The right to forfeit the title of the owner to estrays has been recognized from a very remote period. At the common law they were originally forfeited to the king as the <b>general</b> <b>owner</b> and lord paramount of the soil; and later they most commonly belonged to the lord of the manor by special grant from the crown.

50|$|It {{turned out}} to be the Panthers' last game.

50|$|After the season, the {{majority}} of USFL owners, led by New Jersey <b>Generals</b> <b>owner</b> Donald Trump and Chicago franchise owner Eddie Einhorn voted to move the league to a fall schedule.

50|$|In 1984, {{the league}} began {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} competing head-to-head with the NFL by playing its games in the fall beginning in 1986. The strongest proponents of playing in the fall were Chicago owner Eddie Einhorn and <b>Generals</b> <b>owner</b> Donald Trump. Einhorn and Trump argued that if the USFL moved to the fall, it would eventually force a merger with the NFL in which the older league would have to admit at least some USFL teams. They also argued that if a merger did occur, the surviving teams' original investment would more than double.|$|R

5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. <b>Generals</b> <b>owner</b> Donald Trump had given Taylor a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|R
