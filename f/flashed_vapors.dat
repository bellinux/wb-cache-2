50|$|The {{composition}} of the gas that is flashed is dependent on many factors, therefore {{it is suggested that}} all extractions be analyzed to determine accurate compositional values. As a generality, this definition applies to the nature of flashing hydrocarbons (HC) that make up oil and natural gas, “If the saturated liquid is a multi-component liquid (for example, a mixture of propane, isobutane and normal butane), the <b>flashed</b> <b>vapor</b> is richer in the more volatile components than is the remaining liquid". Although the flashed portion will be primarily components with higher volatilities (lighter HC), heavier HC will also <b>flash</b> into the <b>vapor</b> phase to some extent.

40|$|Two-phase flows hold an {{interest}} {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. In the safety field, one such topic is the accidental release of flammable and toxic pressure-liquefied gases. In case of such a release, a <b>flashing</b> <b>vapor</b> explosion takes place resulting in a very dense two-phase cloud. In particular, if the released substance is flammable, this cloud can be combustible and can lead to deflagration or detonation. For understanding the source processes of flashing and risk assessment, data related to cloud characteristics (i. e. droplet size, velocity, temperature) is needed especially in the near region of the release. Due to the non-equilibrium nature of the near field regions accurate data measurement is not possible with intrusive techniques. Therefore, laser-based optical techniques like Global rainbow Thermometry (GRT) and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) are tempted. The main object of the present work is to assess the mean size and temperature evolution along a flashing two phase R 134 A jet. GRT gives a smaller mean diameter than PDA because GRT measures only the most spherical thus smaller droplets. The temperature evolution by GRT differs much from thermocouple measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{is to develop a}} model for a five-effect evaporator system. Vapor bleeding is incorporated in the model as a means {{to reduce the amount of}} steam consumed in the evaporator. Since evaporation is the most energy-intensive stage in any industrial operation, measures to reduce energy consumption in the evaporator-house are greatly beneficial towards making an operation cost-effective. Other energy reduction schemes like condensate, feed and product <b>flashing,</b> <b>vapor</b> compression etc. are also available. Vapor bleeding brings about an increase in the steam economy of the process, but at the added cost of the required heat exchangers. A model for an evaporator used for the concentration of sugar solution is developed using a set of non-linear equations derived from the mass and energy balance relations. These equations are then solved using the Newton-Raphson method by developing a matlab code for the same. For the present system steam requirement without vapor bleeding is computed first. Other variables like effect temperatures and liquor flow rates are also a result of the modeling procedure.

50|$|The most {{hazardous}} {{property of}} acetone is its extreme flammability. At temperatures greater than acetone's flash point of -20 C, air mixtures of between 2.5% and 12.8% acetone, by volume, may explode or cause a <b>flash</b> fire. <b>Vapors</b> can flow along surfaces to distant ignition sources and flash back. Static discharge may also ignite acetone vapors, though acetone {{has a very}} high ignition initiation energy point and therefore accidental ignition is rare. Even pouring or spraying acetone over red-glowing coal will not ignite it, due to the high concentration of vapour and the cooling effect of evaporation of the liquid. It auto-ignites at 465 C. Auto-ignition temperature is also dependent upon the exposure time, thus at some tests it is quoted as 525 °C. Also, industrial acetone is likely to contain {{a small amount of}} water which also inhibits ignition.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{process plants}} are {{primarily}} {{made up of}} two basic units, i. e. reactors and separators. In a typical plant fresh reactants are partially converted to products in a reactor and the mixture of reactants and products is then transferred to a separator unit for purification. For economic reasons unreacted material or expensive catalysts must be recycled back to the reactor unit. We investigate the dynamic behavior of a coupled reactor separator system. The upstream reactor is modeled as a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and the downstream separator as a binary one-step distillation unit (flash). The outflow of the CSTR is used as the input of the flash unit. Coupling arises due to the recycle of the liquid stream (the bottoms) of the separator to the reactor. The CSTR is operated under isothermal and ideally mixed conditions. A simple first order reaction A to B is studied. The flash is nonreactive and the mixture of A and B {{is assumed to be}} homogeneous and ideal. In particular, three different types of isobaric flash control strategies are considered: a) fixed flash temperature, b) fixed flash heating rate (including an adiabatic flash), and c) fixed <b>flash</b> <b>vapor</b> flow rate. For each of these flash operation modes we discuss three different flow control strategies for the CSTR: a) fresh feed flow controlled, b) reactor effluent flow controlled, and c) both of these flow controlled (variable CSTR holdup). We can show that the individual units always possess unique, stable and feasible steady states. Surprisingly, even for this very simple model system, more complex dynamics involving infeasibility, multiple steady states and stable oscillations can be observed in many cases as soon as the recycle is closed. It is shown that the behavior crucially depends on the flow control {{as well as on the}} flash control strategy. Stability criteria are derived and instabilities are systematically identified to predict the conditions for possible pitfalls a practicing engineer may encounter in operation of this type of reactor separator system, which is a basic unit in many industrial plants...|$|R

If <b>vapor</b> recompression, bottom <b>flashing</b> or heat pump assisted distillation systems are applied on the C 1 –C 2 and/or C 2 –C 3 distillation columns, extremely large values of compression ratio (~  3 – 5) will be required for providing the possibility of heat transfer from the top product to the bottom one. This means that application of bottom <b>flashing</b> or <b>vapor</b> recompression on these distillation columns is not economical. However, an opportunity for energy saving may arise when a process engineer considers the two columns together as a system.

A thermocouple installed in the water line just upstream of the nozzle provided a measure of the feedwater temperature. Initial tests were run with belljar exhaust orifice number two which provided a pressure in a range about 7 mm Hg abs. The feedwater temperature was heated to a temperature of 45 C.

If an electric boost pump is mounted in the fuel tank to push fuel toward the engine, as is common practice in fuel-injected automobiles, the fuel pressure in the lines is maintained above ambient pressure, preventing bubble formation. Likewise, if the fuel tank is mounted above the engine and fuel flows primarily due to gravity, as in a high-wing airplane, vapor lock cannot occur, using either aviation or automotive fuels.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{mathematical}} model based on set of nonlinear equations has been developed for synthesis of multiple effect evaporator (MEE) systems. As evaporator house {{is one of the}} most energy intensive units of pulp and paper industries, different configurations are considered in the model to reduce the energy consumption. These are condensate, feed and product <b>flashing,</b> <b>vapor</b> bleeding, steam splitting, etc. Along with these the present model also accounts the complexities of real MEE system such as variable physical properties, boiling point rise. Along with complexities discussed above, the present model also accounts the fouling resistance. For this purpose a linear correlation is developed to predict fouling resistance based on velocity as well as temperature difference. The fouling resistance observed by this correlation is within the limit shown in the literature (Muller-Steinhagen and Branch, 1997). It reduces overall heat transfer coefficient by 11. 5 % on average. For the present study two MEE systems of typical Indian pulp and paper industries are considered. First MEE system selected for modeling and simulation is seven effect evaporator system located in north India which is being operated in a nearby Indian Kraft Paper Mill for concentrating weak black liquor using plate falling film evaporators. This system employs steam splitting in first two effects, feed and product flashing along with primary and secondary condensate flashing to generate auxiliary vapor, which are then used in vapor bodies of appropriate effects to improve overall steam economy of the system. The second system used for present study is located in south India. It is ten effect evaporator system used for concentrating black liquor and being operated in mixed flow sequence. In this system feed and steam splitting as well as vapor bleeding is employed. For seven effect evaporator system total fourteen models are developed. Initially, a simplest model without any variation is derived based on mass and energy balance. Further, it is improved by incorporating different configurations such as variation in physical properties, BPR, steam splitting, feed, product and condensate <b>flashing</b> and <b>vapor</b> bleeding. These models are developed with and without fouling resistance. The governing equations of these models are nonlinear in nature. Further, it is observed that for these models the number of equations as well as the number of variables are equal and hence unique solution exist for all cases. The set of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved using software called ‘system of non linear equations’. However, in the present work to incorporate the complex interactions of variables during solution of model an iterative procedure is used. For seven effect evaporator system total 14 models are proposed to visualize that how individual configuration is affecting the steam economy of the MEE system. The comparison shows that maximum steam economy is observed for the model where flashing as well as vapor bleeding are used. In comparison to the simplest system the improvement in steam economy through best model is found as 27. 3 %. The modified seven effect evaporator system, obtained using best model, requires four shell and tube heat exchangers and five pumps. This modification has total capital investment as Rs 29. 3 lakh. However, saving in steam consumption is found as Rs 21. 8 lakh/year thus, total payback period for the modified seven effect evaporator system is 1. 3 years. For ten effect evaporator system improvement in steam economy is observed by 12. 8 % in comparison to existing system. It incorporates three preheaters which use bled vapor from the system. Based on the comparison with published model as well as industrial data it is found that the present model can be effectively applied to simulate the real MEE system and improve the steam economy of MEE system by 15 %...|$|R

In binary cycle, the working fluid is superheated by geothermal fluid and then expands in turbine for power generation. Addition of a regenerator to binary cycle improves the thermal efficiency. For identical conditions of geothermal fluid, the power generated by a regenerative binary cycle is slightly {{higher than that of}} basic binary cycle. Another advantage of the regenerative binary cycle is that the heat rejection rate of the system is lowered by using the regenerator. Geothermal fluid from well may exist in two phases, vapor and liquid, if the fluid in well is self-flowing. To avoid scaling, submersible pump may be used to force the fluid out of a well. When pump is used, there will be no vapor at the wellhead. Effects of pumping on power output and heat rejection of binary cycle have been evaluated in Section III. For geothermal fluids with high content of non-condensable gases, a non-condensing plant may be used. Condensing plants have much higher thermal efficiencies than non-condensing plants.
