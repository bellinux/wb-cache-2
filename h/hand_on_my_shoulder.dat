60|$|He {{laid his}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{just as he}} had done at Freeport.|$|E
60|$|He {{laughed and}} put his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> as he bade me good night.|$|E
60|$|As I {{was turning}} away {{she got up}} quickly and put her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|She put her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{and drew}} {{me down to}} kiss her.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood there}} fidgeting {{about for a}} bit, and then he puts his <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|She paid no heed to me; {{she came}} back and put her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and thoughtfully and sadly looked up in my face.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} cabin door behind him, and, {{crossing}} over, laid a strong <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{laid his}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and gave me}} a slight turn, {{pointing}} with his other arm at the same time.|$|E
60|$|I knew my face darkened, {{and perhaps}} hope and {{happiness}} died in it. Swiftly she placed a kind <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As I turned away, {{one of the}} gentlemen, a victim, {{noted for}} his {{sporting}} propensities, followed me, and laying his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> asked:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She paused, came {{round to}} where I was sitting, perched {{herself on the}} end of the table, and, resting her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> added gently: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} {{guess so}} simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, placing her white <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and smiling {{straight}} into my face.|$|R
6000|$|But Tarvrille {{restrained}} his forbidding arm, {{and then}} after a second's interval put a <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "Come," [...] he said....|$|E
60|$|As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt a <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and a rough voice which I knew well.|$|E
60|$|She didn't {{seem to hear}} me: she put her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{and kept}} me where I was, sitting by her side.|$|E
60|$|An {{expression}} of surprise and pleasure passed over her face; she rose, and putting her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{as if to}} keep me still in the place I occupied, looked at me intently.|$|R
6000|$|... "’I don’t think so,’ ses Miss Butt, {{putting her}} <b>’and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> ’Sit down and {{stay where you}} are. I don’t {{want you to get}} hurt, if it is. Let {{somebody}} I don’t like go.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Harry, {{you are to}} {{put your}} <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Meinik will follow close behind you, and will keep his arms round you, in case you need help. Of course, we shall go along very slowly." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I shuddered {{at the thought}} that for {{anything}} I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.|$|E
60|$|The Sibyl {{laid her}} dry, fleshless <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and forced me roughly {{back into the}} chair from which I had just risen.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and looked at}} me in anxious silence. I saw she {{understood}} the serious risk that threatened us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I put my broom agin the wall, and {{we walked}} round to the Bull’s Head like a couple o’ brothers. We ’ad two pints apiece, and then he put his <b>’and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and talked as man to man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{change a}} {{dilapidated}} hut into a charming cottage in one afternoon," [...] she said, placing both <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> as she spoke, [...] "but I will {{do all that}} I can, and all {{that you ought to}} do, if you were here. That much I promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How could I look {{men in the}} face, and {{how could}} I ever see the Maid again, if I go not?" [...] I said; and, {{loosening}} her grasp, she laid her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and so gazed on me steadfastly, as if my picture could be fixed on the tablets of her brain.|$|R
60|$|He clapped a <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> as he finished, but {{it seemed}} to me that there was more {{determination}} than hope in his voice.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker {{rose to his}} feet. He put his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He was {{the very}} {{prototype}} of the self-respecting, conscientious, prospective father- in-law.|$|E
6000|$|This {{state of}} happy {{unconsciousness}} had scarcely lasted--it seemed to me--two minutes, when I {{was awakened by}} Peterkin laying his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, as {{we passed}} {{under the shade of}} cottonwoods, he clamped a big <b>hand</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} me. Putting one <b>hand</b> heavily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{he forced}} me to face him once more.|$|R
60|$|Something aroused me--a patter of {{footsteps}} or a rustle of skirts. Then a soft thud behind me gave me {{at once a}} start and a thrill. First I saw Sally's little brown <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Then her head, with hair all shiny and flying and fragrant, came round over <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> softly smoothing <b>my</b> cheek, until her sweet, saucy, heated face was right under my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} put your <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> where it's steep," [...] he suggested. [...] "Still, we're {{not going to}} have much trouble in getting down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pip," [...] said he, {{putting his}} large <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and moving {{me to the}} window, [...] "I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{he stole}} {{up to us}} again, and {{suddenly}} clapping his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} <b>hand</b> caressingly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> drawing {{me a little}} closer to her; and it {{remained}} there.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{remember}} now {{a word of}} all the vague threatenings against the sundering universe with which I replied. Her <b>hand</b> was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> as she listened....|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{then that}} I 'ad been done, and I was just walking out o' the shop, {{pretending to be}} deaf, when Mr. Watson {{come back with a}} silly young {{policeman}} wot asked me wot I meant by it. He told me to get off 'ome quick, and actually put his <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> but it 'ud take more than a thing like that to push me, and, arter trying his 'ardest, he could only rock me a bit.|$|R
