Regarding his preparation for the role, Sarsgaard stated, [...] "I actually did hang with this biologist from Tulane that was <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>just</b> the most eccentric guy they could find. He was entertaining, and he and I actually worked on my lecture that I give in [...]" [...] About his character Sarsgaard remarked, [...] "He's got shades of gray. It's eccentricity on top of eccentricity".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I {{think most of us}} went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>just</b> the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>just</b> heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lawyer {{representing}} Jamie Lockett filed a {{contempt of}} court complaint against Fairfax Media, publisher of The Dominion Post. He told Radio New Zealand [...] "I {{think it is a}} fairly cynical move by the Dominion to sell newspapers. They have obviously looked at it from a commercial point of view and felt they can make more money by publishing it and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>just</b> adds to the level of contempt." [...] On 10 April 2008 the solicitor general confirmed he would take {{contempt of court}} proceedings against Fairfax Media and Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst, stating that [...] "The articles were sensational in tone and highly memorable. The fact of the publications themselves became national news." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{initially}} touted {{to return}} to Augusta State University for the 2011/12 season as late as 11 July 2011, Purser announced just three days later that he was unlikely to play another NCAA season. While Purser said he enjoyed his time with the Jaguars, he said it may be better for {{him to stay in}} Perth, citing [...] "At this stage it looks like I might be staying, just because academically my units that I've started back here [...] don't match up. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>just</b> looking at a number of factors, that I may be staying." [...] Soon after, Purser informed coach Dip Metress of his departure, after joining a shortlist of players fighting for the final spot on the Perth Wildcats roster – the most successful team in the National Basketball League (NBL). Joining Purser on the shortlist included three members of the Wildcats' 2010/11 extended squad – Greg Hire, Tom Jervis and Everard Bartlett. No matter the outcome, Wildcats coach Rob Beveridge guaranteed Purser involvement with the team in 2011/12, with the worst-case scenario being a development player role. Not to Purser's displeasure, on 11 August, Hire was awarded with the final roster spot. Purser was undeterred by the Wildcats' decision not to award the final spot to him, instead relishing the prospect of becoming an NBL development player. Purser appeared in 10 games for the Wildcats during the 2011/12 season, scoring a total of 20 points. Highlights for Purser included scoring 6 points in 5½ minutes against the New Zealand Breakers at home on 23 December 2011 in just his third NBL game; being nominated for the NBL's Round 23 Play of the Week for his athletic three-point play in the final period against the Cairns Taipans on 11 March 2012; and being nominated for the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second place with a 19–9 record and took down the third-seeded Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, with Purser seeing game time in Game 3 on 7 April 2012. The Wildcats went on face the New Zealand Breakers in the NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 2–1.|$|E

In this autoethnography, I explore the chameleon metaphor for meanings and implications in my personal and professional identity as a female educator by seeking answers to questions stemming from Mitchell and Weber (2005) : <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? I analyzed my own autobiographical journals using the four-part Listening Guide (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, 2 ̆ 6 Bertsch, 2003) coupled with theme-based family coding to examine changes by choice and changes by force particular to my personal and professional experiences. Notions of home, belonging, and change as a journey emerged as themes that served to frame my identity and highlighted the importance of self-inquiry for educators as an applied practice within the greater context of the profession...|$|R
