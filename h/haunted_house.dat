5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game <b>Haunted</b> <b>House.</b> Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>haunting</b> <b>house</b> tales - fictions which depict {{an active and}} malevolent house - {{through the lens of}} postmodernism.

As is claimed, the <b>haunting</b> <b>house</b> does away with the idea that knowledge about the house and its past is empowering, since the supernatural events are not caused by a gruesome crime of the past...|$|R
