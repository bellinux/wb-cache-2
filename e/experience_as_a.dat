Bush therefore nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge David Souter instead. The selection of Thomas to instead replace Marshall preserved the existing racial composition of the court.|$|E

5|$|After he {{successfully}} completed secondary school in early 1926, {{he joined the}} Reichswehr as a offizieranwärter (officer cadet) on 1 April 1926. He was posted to the 19th Infantry Regiment during which he spent four years commanding a Gebirgsjäger (mountain infantry) platoon. While {{he was with the}} regiment, the Reichswehr was absorbed by the Wehrmacht. Now part of the Gebirgs Brigade, Raithel gained <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> signals officer and company commander, and was promoted to Hauptmann (captain). With the creation of the 1st Gebirgs Division in April 1938 he was appointed as the adjutant of the 99th Gebirgsjäger Regiment. At the outbreak of war in September 1939 he was an instructor at the mountain infantry school at Fulpmes in the Stubai Alps. He was married and {{he and his wife had}} two daughters.|$|E

5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but {{he chose not to}} wait for the Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for his <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern {{for the success of}} their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E
5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chance {{to be involved in}} the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E

5|$|As a young adventurer, Fossett {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{participants}} in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> skier, he was in the first group of 'citizen athletes' to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59h, 53min, 30s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{spent five}} years in an orphanage before {{beginning}} his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in his court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company which launched numerous magazines and papers, including, in 1888, the Financial Times. He over-reached himself with an ambitious public flotation of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.|$|E

5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming {{into the bottom of}} the ninth inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year.|$|E
5|$|Harley later {{also joined}} the AIS-AFL Academy as an {{assistant}} coach and mentor. Prior to the 2010 AFL season, it was further announced that Harley would join the Channel 7 network football commentary team, replacing Nathan Buckley in the leading special comments role. Harley admitted that his previous <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regular panellist on the football program One Week at a Time during his playing days had fuelled an interest in working within the media industry. He is currently the general manager of football at the Sydney Swans and will become their CEO in 2019.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
