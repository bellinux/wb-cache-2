40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to deepen the understanding of the concept of company growth. With sales growth used as an operational measure, and in contrast with growth models offered by e. g. Greiner (1972 / 98) and Churchill & Lewis (1983), this study reveals a number of motives, enablers and consequences of growth. The empirical part investigates these aspects of growth within wholesale-SMEs between 1991 and 1996. With a response rate of 41 %, information is gathered on management, finance, and marketing issues related to the true factors that <b>drive,</b> <b>enable,</b> and follow from sales growth...|$|E
40|$|The UN and NATO have {{implemented}} separate approaches to civilian-military cooperation. Central in both approaches {{is a need}} for information sharing between civilian and military actors. Without shared information, cooperative planning becomes impossible. For military actors secret information makes sharing difficult and for civilian actors, principles hinder close cooperation. Scholars in the field of intelligence study have identified that states and organizations share information if the benefits of such, outweigh costs and risks. This thesis examines institutional differences between the UN mission MINUSMA in Mali and NATO mission ISAF in Afghanistan, in order to better understand how institutional factors, affect sharing of information. With an outset in Rational Choice Institutionalism and by use of Elinor Ostrom’s Institutional Development and Analysis Framework, an analytical instrument is designed. Through inductive review of interviews, first-hand accounts and reports; factors that <b>drive,</b> <b>enable</b> and hinder civilian-military sharing are indicated. The thesis indicates that the institutional framework of MINUSMA forms interdependency between civilian and military actors, while sharing in ISAF was enabled only when common goals were agreed upon. Military and civilian actors, in both MINUSMA and ISAF point to unclear mandates and vague goals as primary barriers to civilian-military sharing. ...|$|E
40|$|A locally {{assembled}} {{image viewer}} system with pocket-size iPOD (80 GB) and flash (2 GB) drives for gigabyte storage, display and transfer of digital medical images, oriented towards training purposes, is described. Both the iPOD and flash <b>drive</b> <b>enable</b> storage {{of thousands of}} images from diverse medical-imaging equipments. The iPOD, in addition, can display with sufficient resolution any of these images {{and serves as a}} transportable preview device. Through the use of a computer, these devices can access/ store/ display the images/ photos from a CD, digital camera or the internet. A TV image viewing unit is also provided. The operational features and the advantages of these devices are discussed in detail. The quality assurance (QA) of the displays has been successfully carried out with standard test patterns. The image quality has been tested with dynamic and static medical images. The system will be highly useful for storage and remote display of multitude of images from several modalities in the hospital, as well as other images, {{from the point of view}} of education and training. It has good potential for use in clinical diagnosis as well. Other recent advancements using iPHONE and improved but expensive computers, integrated with picture archiving and communication system (PACS) as well as radiology and hospital information system (RHIS) for versatile applications in modern radiology, are also highlighted. This system, assembled with indigenous equipments, is much less expensive and specially suited for teaching radiologists, physicists and technologists, particularly in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Utilizing {{nanometer}} vibration {{of surface}} acoustic wave for friction <b>drive</b> <b>enables</b> nanometer stepping <b>drives</b> of a {{surface acoustic wave}} motor. Number of driving waves varied step displacement readily, and decrease of driving waves brought about 2 nm step motion as a minimum step of an experimental setup. We proposed a simulation model so as to control step displacement at open loop condition. The simulation model represented the characteristic transient response of the surface acoustic wave motor, {{and it can be}} applied to an open loop control of a rigid structural surface acoustic wave motor. However, the experimental setup did not have enough rigidity. Accurate simulation of the experimental setup requires taking elastic deformations into consideration. We, therefore, proposed a mechanical equivalent circuit model that takes accounts of compliance of the structure. I...|$|R
