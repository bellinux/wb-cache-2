40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of granular matter within a two-dimensional flow around a moving disk is investigated experimentally. Using {{a combination of}} photoelastic and standard tessellation techniques, the strain and stress tensors are estimated at the grain scale in the time-averaged flow field around a large <b>disk</b> <b>pulled</b> at constant velocity in an assembly of smaller disks. On the one hand, one observes inhomogeneous shear rate and strongly localized shear stress and pressure fields. On the other hand, a significant dilation rate, which has the same magnitude as the shear strain rate, is reported. Significant deviations are observed with local rheology that justify the need of searching for a non-local rheology. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

50|$|When {{the current}} is applied, it creates {{magnetic}} flux. This passes into the rotor {{portion of the}} field. The hysteresis disk physically passes through the rotor, without touching it. These disks {{have the ability to}} become magnetized depending upon the strength of the flux (this dissipates as flux is removed). This means, as the rotor rotates, magnetic drag between the rotor and the hysteresis disk takes place causing rotation. In a sense, the hysteresis <b>disk</b> is <b>pulled</b> after the rotor. Depending upon the output torque required, this pull eventually can match the input speed, giving a 100% lockup.|$|R

50|$|This was a tiebreaker, usually {{between the}} warriors {{for the right}} to hold the warrior belt. If the top warrior had been less than stellar and a fellow warrior close in the rankings had {{performed}} well, but not well enough to win the belt outright, the two warriors would compete in Ultimate Body Slam. This game was simply a test of endurance; each player stood on a platform behind a metal disk.

40|$|The full cell to half cell {{coupling}} {{is vital}} since side coupling {{was not used}} in this gun design. We further improved the technique of using mode separation for eld balance tuning [5]. To measure the eld balance versus mode separation {{it is necessary to}} measure Ez on axis for the-mode, II. Field Balance versus Mode Separation We haveinvestigated two di erent types of waveguide to full cell coupling schemes. The-coupling scheme was produced using a: 37500 diameter cutting ute running: 226800 center to center in the x direction, the thickness of the coupling iris is: 091700. The z-coupling scheme was produced by cutting out a: 91300 x: 65000 rectangle with the long dimension in the z-direction, the thickness of the coupling iris was: 10800. In the nal gun design we haveelected to use the-coupling scheme since its dipole eld, before symmetrization, is an order of magnitude less than the z-coupling scheme. We havemeasured the dipole eld o set by a transverse <b>disk</b> <b>pull</b> in the waveguide plane and the To produce high brightness low emittance electron beams necessary for X-ray FEL application such as the LCLS [3] we havedeveloped a 1. 6 cell emittance compensated S-band photocathode RF Gun that is designed to minimize emittance growth due to the dipole component ofEz. Toac complish this we haveeliminated the side coupling into the half cell that is used in the original BNL RF gun design [4], which is designed to suppress the zero-mode. The coupling between the two cells was improved by an increase in the beam iris, which also increased the mode separation between the zero and-modes. The coupling between the waveguide and full cell was studied using two di erent coupling schemes. The full cell was symmetrized to minimize emittance growth due to the TM 110 mode. The half cell length has been increased to provide more RF focusing. Resistive temperature control was elected over water cooling to facilitate design and minimize construction costs. III.

50|$|In 1903 Arthur P. and Charles H. Warner, two {{brothers}} from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented Auto-meter. The Auto-Meter used a magnet {{attached to a}} rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal <b>disk.</b> Measuring this <b>pull</b> provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument. The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart & Clark Company of Chicago. The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on {{the vast majority of}} automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{interaction}} with a gas disk may produce young planetary systems with closely-spaced orbits, stabilized by mean-motion resonances between neighbors. On longer timescales, after the gas is gone, interaction with a remnant planetesimal <b>disk</b> tends to <b>pull</b> these configurations apart, eventually inducing dynamical instability. We {{show that this}} can lead to a variety of outcomes; some cases resemble the Solar System, while others end up with high-eccentricity orbits reminiscent of the observed exoplanets. A similar mechanism has been previously suggested as the cause of the lunar Late Heavy Bombardment. Thus, it may be that a large-scale dynamical instability, with more or less cataclysmic results, is an evolutionary step common to many planetary systems, including our own.

40|$|A set of {{experiments}} has been performed {{to study the}} extensional behavior of {{a thin layer of}} liquid (silicone oil), trapped between two smooth plexiglass <b>disks</b> that are <b>pulled</b> apart in a controlled manner. Different values of separation velocities, liquid viscosities, and liquid layer thicknesses were used to obtain a range of capillary numbers, all in the surface tension dominated regime. Force, displacement, and time information have been recorded for each expenmental run. Qualitative visual data has also been gathered for the selected runs. From the quantitative data, force-displacement, and stress-strain plots have been generated to analyze the trends in extensional behavior of the thin liquid layers. Visual data were used to observe the competing regimes (viscous regime and surface tension regime) that are taking place in the process of liquid layer separation. This study could offer fundamental insight into the phenomenon of cavitation and its applications, help to better understand the role of thin liquid layers in material deformations.

40|$|Self-similarity {{has been}} the {{paradigmatic}} picture for the pinch-off of a drop. Here we will show through high-speed imaging and boundary integral simulations that the inverse problem, the pinch-off of an air bubble in water, is not self-similar in a strict sense: A <b>disk</b> is quickly <b>pulled</b> through a water surface, leading to a giant, cylindrical void which after collapse creates an upward and a downward jet. Only in the limiting case of large Froude number the neck radius h scales as h(- h) ^ 1 / 4 ∝τ^ 1 / 2, the purely inertial scaling. For any finite Froude number the collapse is slower, and a second length-scale, the curvature of the void, comes into play. Both length-scales are found to exhibit power-law scaling in time, but with different exponents depending on the Froude number, signaling the non-universality of the bubble pinch-off.

The adhesive tape is wrapped around a <b>disk</b> and is <b>pulled</b> with a constant speed at a fixed distance. In a narrow range of the pull speed, the angular speed of the contact line exhibits stick-slip behaviors with irregular bifurcations, which is then followed by the appearance of a period one stick-slip motion before displaying chaotic behaviors with distinctively positive Liapunov exponents.

40|$|Nous présentons une revue des différents travaux expérimentaux et théoriques effectués sur le phénomène de {{coalescence}} en limitant principalement notre discussion au cas de la coalescence d'une goutte isolée à une {{interface plane}} ou déformable. La coalescence se divise en deux phases distinctes : le drainage et la rupture du film interfacial. Ce film est constitué du liquide de la phase continue séparant la goutte de l'interface. La condition de rupture est principalement contrôlée par les forces électrostatiques dues à la double couche et par les forces de Van der Waals. Les résultats expérimentaux mettent en évidence un phénomène de coalescence partielle ainsi que l'existence d'une distribution statistique du temps de coalescence. Ils montrent également l'influence complexe de nombreux paramètres physiques et physico-chimiques sur le temps de coalescence. On rappelle les principaux modèles théoriques décrivant le drainage et la rupture des films liquides. Ces modèles permettent, entre autre, d'aboutir à des expressions mathématiques reliant le temps de coalescence à des paramètres tels que la tension interfaciale, les densités et les viscosités des fluides, la taille des gouttes. The problem {{linked to the}} stability of oil-in-water emulsions (e. g. deoiling of water) and water-in-oil emulsions (e. g. dehydration of crudes) {{is one of the}} major problems encountered in the petroleum industry. From the thermodynamic standpoint, an emulsion is always unstable (Fig. I. 1). The kinematic stability characterizing the separation rate of the dispersed phase from the continuous phase can nonetheless be controlled by the coalescence of droplets present in the emulsion (Fig. I. 2). This article reviews various experimental and theoretical works on the phenomenon of coalescence but the discussion is limited mainly to the coalescence of an single drop at a flat or deformable interface. The coalescence of a single drop is governed by the drainage and rupture of the thin liquid film of continuous phase separating it from its homophase or from another drop. Let us consider the coalescence of a drop at an interface (Fig. I. 3). When the distance h between the drop and the interface becomes less or equal to the radius Rd of the drop (h < ou = Rd), the pressure inside the film increases. This pressure is responsible for the apparent immobilization of the drop, its deformation, and the drainage of the film. Depending on the case, the film can then reach either an extreme thickness hf or a critical thickness delta beyond which the film becomes unstable and breaks down. In the latter case there is coalescence. Experimental research has shown the existence of :(a) A statistical distribution of the coalescence time (Fig. I. 6). This distribution seems to be linked to the presence of impurities in the systems investigated. (b) A phenomenon of partial coalescence (Fig. I. 7). The coalescence of a drop generally occurs in several stages. The experimental results of several authors concerning the influence of physical and physicochemical parameters on the coalescence time are given in Table I. 1. Quantitative as well as qualitative differences can be seen (e. g. influence of the diameter of the drops). Drainage of the filmReynolds model (Fig. II. 1) : We consider the flow of a thin liquid film of viscosity µc between two parallel rigid disks of radius R and area A. The <b>disks</b> are <b>pulled</b> together by an external force F. The thinning rate Vre of the film and the coalescence time tau(re) are given by. In this model, the drainage of a film is governed by the viscous dissipations inside this film. In the more general case of a flat or curved film of constant thickness h, these expressions become here n, the number of immobile interfaces, can take the value 0, 1 or 2 (Fig. II. 2). The mobilityor immobilityof the interfaces are defined by the following boundary conditions in which vr is the radial component of the fluid velocity. The mobility of an interface in governed by two factors :(a) The ratio of the dispersed-phase viscosity to the continuous-phase viscosity. (b) The gradient of concentration of the surfactants at the interfaces (Fig. II. 4). In reality, the interfaces are never either perfectly mobile or perfectly immobile. Therefore, the thinning rate expression given above must be altered. It is given by Eq. II. 16 for pure systems, and by Eq. II. 21 in the presence of surfactants. When the external force F corresponds to the forces of gravity, the area of the external film A depends on the Bond number Nbd (Fig. II. 6), given by where g, DeltaP, gamma and Psi represent the acceleration of gravity, the difference in density, the interfacial tension and the volume of the drop respectively. The general expressions of Vre and tau(re) are given in Table II. 1. During the coalescence of a drop, the thickness of the film is not uniform. Generally the thickness of the film reaches its maximum at the middle and its minimum at the outer edge (experimental results in Figs. II. 7 - 11; theoretical results - SLCH model - in Fig. II. 14). This is called the dimple phenomenon and it is due to the existence of a radial pressure gradient inside the film (Figs. II. 15 - 16). The thinning rate at the outer edge of the film differs from Vre only by a multiplicative constant (Eq. II. 39). Rupture of the filmThe thickness at which disturbances present at the interfaces may develop is called the critical thickness delta. If these disturbances do develop, the film becomes unstable and breaks down causing the coalescence of the drop. The conditions for film rupture are governed by the disjunction pressure Pi, which depends mainly on electrostatic intermolecular forces and Van der Waals forces. Some theoretical results for the critical thickness value and the corresponding coalescence time are given for different cases in the third section (Eqs. III. 12, 16, 17, 18; Table III. 1). Theoretical models of the drainage and the rupture of thin liquid films may explain the experimental results. They allow one to clearly see the influence on the coalescence time of the following factors : the interfacial tension, the fluids density and viscosity, the drops size, the presence of surfactants, and the intermolecular forces...|$|R
