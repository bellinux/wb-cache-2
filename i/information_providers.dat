Rightsway International, an independent human rights group, has condemned President Koroma for allegedly dictating to the committee about obtaining the confession. A statement later released by the group read:"Rightsway is disappointed that Tam Baryoh's forced confession has been published widely by pro-government media outlets and social networks. The publication of forced confessions {{is often used to}} discredit dissident news and <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> This is a media propaganda tool used by dictatorial regimes, to avoid being exposed, investigated and punished for the grave violations of human rights." ...|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, low {{international}} wheat {{prices have}} often encouraged {{farmers in the}} United States to change to more profitable crops. In 1998, the price at harvest of a [...] bushel was $2.68 per. Some <b>information</b> <b>providers,</b> following CBOT practice, quote the wheat market in per ton denomination. [...] A USDA report revealed that in 1998, average operating costs were $1.43 per bushel and total costs were $3.97 per bushel. In that study, farm wheat yields averaged 41.7 bushels per acre (2.2435 metric ton/hectare), and typical total wheat production value was $31,900 per farm, with total farm production value (including other crops) of $173,681 per farm, plus $17,402 in government payments. There were significant profitability differences between low- and high-cost farms, mainly due to crop yield differences, location, and farm size.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{expansion}} of internet healthcare platforms, online practitioner legitimacy and privacy accountability face unique challenges such as e-paparazzi, online information brokers, industrial spies, unlicensed <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> that work outside of traditional medical codes for profit. The American Medical Association (AMA) states that medical websites {{have the responsibility to}} ensure the health care privacy of online visitors and protect patient records from being marketed and monetized into the hands of insurance companies, employers, and marketers. With the rapid unification of healthcare, business practices, computer science and e-commerce to create these online diagnostic websites, efforts to maintain health care system’s ethical confidentiality standard need to keep up as well. Over the next few years, the Department of Health and Human Services have stated that they will be working towards lawfully protecting the online privacy and digital transfers of patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).|$|E
2500|$|Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was {{hosted by}} PRQ, a Sweden-based company {{providing}} [...] "highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services". PRQ {{is said to}} have [...] "almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs". Currently, WikiLeaks is hosted mainly by the Swedish Internet service provider Bahnhof in the Pionen facility, a former nuclear bunker in Sweden. Other servers are spread around the world with the main server located in Sweden. Julian Assange has said that the servers are located in Sweden (and the other countries) [...] "specifically because those nations offer legal protection to the disclosures made on the site". He talks about the Swedish constitution, which gives the <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> total legal protection. It is forbidden according to Swedish law for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper. These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authorities to eliminate WikiLeaks; they place an onus of proof upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, [...] "WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade encryption to protect sources and other confidential information." [...] Such arrangements have been called [...] "bulletproof hosting".|$|E
