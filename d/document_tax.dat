The Trust is funded through a <b>document</b> <b>tax</b> {{at a rate of}} $0.45 for every $100.00 connected to the document. Florida law Sections 201.02 and 201.031 authorizes counties to levy the surtax on documents that transfer interest on real property, with an exemption for single-family residences. Since the program's inception, the Trust has assisted more than 7,000 first-time homeowners with low-interest second mortgages, helped construct 15,000 units of affordable rental housing. The Trust funds programs for first or second mortgages, property acquisition for affordable housing cooperatives, or new construction. However, new construction cannot comprise more than 50% of each year's funding allocations. At least 50% of funding must benefit low-income families rather than moderate-income. Since the program's inception, the Trust has assisted more than 7,000 first-time homeowners with low-interest second mortgages, helped construct 15,000 units of affordable rental housing.|$|E
