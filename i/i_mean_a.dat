It’s something that I did with her voice. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>a</b> lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E
500|$|While {{the single}} {{did not receive}} {{significant}} radio play in the US, MTV placed its video on high rotation. The version most often shown was edited to remove the mermaids' bare breasts. Greenwood said, [...] "we would've understood {{if they had a}} problem with some guy chopping his arms and legs off, but <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>a</b> woman's breasts! And mermaids as well! It's fucked up." [...] MTV Europe played the video uncut for two weeks because the channel's official censor was ill and unable to work; after that time the channel ran the cut version of the video. A later US version of the video saw the mermaids wear bathing suits, while the uncut version was later compiled along with other Radiohead videos on the DVD and home video release 7 Television Commercials and [...]|$|E
500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>a</b> lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E

But if it is by accident that generation cannot follow from the emission of the semen, the act is not against nature on that account, nor is it sinful; the case of the woman being barren would be a case in point." ...|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{argue that}} there may be a {{dichotomy}} between the conception of a ‘separate aural training subject’ and the conception of a ‘complementary aural training subject’ in classical specialist higher music education.
