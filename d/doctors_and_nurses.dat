Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses.</b> The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E

She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups.

5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. <b>Doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E

After the storm dissipated, <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> traveled to the city to assist in {{the aftermath}}, while trains carried food and water. A train from Monterrey to Tampico carried food, medicine, and soldiers to assist in rebuilding, but was delayed by ongoing flooding. Military planes were utilized to transport aid. Martial law was declared in Tampico following the storm, and officials imposed a 7 p.m. curfew. Uninjured citizens helped clear the roads. President Abelardo L. Rodríguez asked the governors of the Mexican states to send aid and for residents to send money to the Bank of Mexico. Following the storm, residents overcrowded the buildings that remained standing in Tampico.|$|E

5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
5|$|The US {{provided}} emergency food, medical care, {{clothing and}} shelter at reception centres in Saigon {{and elsewhere in}} the south.
