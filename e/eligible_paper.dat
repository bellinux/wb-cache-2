For many years, the guiding principle of the Fed was the ‘Real Bills Doctrine ’ under which the Fed ‘rediscounted ’ <b>eligible</b> <b>paper</b> (lending reserves to banks) to facilitate trade. During WWI, the Fed purchased Treasury debt as interest-earning assets, {{although it was not}} noticed until the 1920 s that this added bank reserves, supporting a multiple expansion of deposits [...] the ‘deposit multiplier’. In 1924 the Fed first attempted to operate countercyclically, loosening policy in recession to increase bank lending. However, bond purchases did not increase reserves because banks retired loans at the discount window [...] the first of many times that the Fed learned it could not ‘push on a string’: reserves, loans, and the money supply are demand determined and cannot be increased directly through monetary policy. Symmetrically, analysts found that bond sales merely forced banks to the discount window to replace lost reserves. Hence, the Fed could not control bank lending through attempts to control reserves.

40|$|Atrazine (ATR) is a {{commonly}} used agricultural herbicide {{that has been}} the subject of epidemiologic studies assessing its relation to reproductive health problems. This review evaluates both the consistency and the quality of epidemiologic evidence testing the hypothesis that ATR exposure, at usually encountered levels, is a risk factor for birth defects, small for gestational age birth weight, prematurity, miscarriages, and problems of fetal growth and development. We followed the current methodological guidelines for systematic reviews by using two independent researchers to identify, retrieve, and evaluate the relevant epidemiologic literature on the relation of ATR to various adverse outcomes of birth and pregnancy. Each <b>eligible</b> <b>paper</b> was summarized with respect to its methods and results with particular attention to study design and exposure assessment, which have been cited as the main areas of weakness in ATR research. As a quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible, the study results were categorized qualitatively as positive, null, or mixed. The literature on ATR and pregnancy-related health outcomes is growing rapidly, but the quality of the data is poor with most papers using aggregate rather than individual-level information. Without good quality data, the results are difficult to assess; however, it is worth noting that none of the outcome categories demonstrated consistent positive associations across studies. Considering the poor quality of the data and the lack of robust findings across studies, conclusions about a causal link between ATR and adverse pregnancy outcomes are not warranted.

40|$|Purpose. Health-care {{providers}} invest substantial {{resources to}} establish and implement hospital quality management systems. Nevertheless, few tools are available to assess implementation efforts and their effect on quality and safety outcomes. This review aims to (i) identify instruments to assess the implementation of hospital quality management systems, (ii) describe their measurement properties and (iii) assess the effects of quality management on quality improvement and quality of care outcomes. Data sources. We performed a systematic literature search from 1990 to 2011 in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. In addition, we used snowball strategies, screened the reference lists of <b>eligible</b> <b>papers,</b> reviewed grey literature and contacted experts in the field. Study selection and data extraction. Two reviewers screened <b>eligible</b> <b>papers</b> based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and all authors extracted data. <b>Eligible</b> <b>papers</b> are {{described in terms of}} general characteristics (settings, type and level of respondents, mode of data collection), methodological properties (sampling strategy, item derivation, conceptualization of quality management, assessment of reliability and validity, scoring) and application/implementation (accounting for context, organizational adaptations, sensitivity to change, deployment and effect size). Results. Eighteen <b>papers</b> were deemed <b>eligible</b> for inclusion. While some common domains emerged in measurement conceptualization, substantial differences in scope persist. The instruments' measurement properties were insufficiently described and only few instruments assessed links between the implementation of quality management systems (QMS) and improvement strategies or outcomes. Conclusions. There is currently no well-established measure to assess the implementation and effectiveness of quality management systems. Future research should address this gap. © The Author 2013...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) {{recommends}} {{researchers to}} investigate {{a wide variety of}} behavioural and health outcomes. However, researchers often investigate only a part of occupational health (OH) in relation to light. A literature study (2002 – 2017) regarding the relationship between office lighting conditions and OH was performed to identify gaps and methodological issues. Method: The OH outcomes investigated in this paper were grouped according to the International Classification of Diseases and analysed per category: physical and physiological health, mental health, eye health, sleep parameters and visual comfort. Results: Findings from the literature study (20 <b>eligible</b> <b>papers)</b> showed that all OH aspects were mostly but not exclusively measured subjectively. Furthermore, most studies investigated only a fraction of office lighting parameters and OH aspects. Conclusions: It seems that Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) and illuminance mainly correlate with OH. However, this may also be explained by gaps and methodological issues in studies described in <b>eligible</b> <b>papers.</b> Based on the literature study, an overview was composed elucidating gaps and methodological issues of office lighting and OH studies.

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} recognition of gaps between best scientific evidence and clinical practice. This systematic review aimed {{to assess the}} volume and scope of peer-reviewed cancer research output in the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. Methods: <b>Eligible</b> <b>papers</b> were published in English and reported on evidence-practice gaps in cancer care. The electronic database Medline was searched for three time periods using MeSH headings and keywords. Abstracts were assessed against eligibility criteria by one reviewer and checked by a second. Papers meeting eligibility criteria were coded as data-based or non-data-based, and by cancer type of focus. All data-based papers were then further classified as descriptive studies documenting the extent of, or barriers to addressing, the evidence-practice gap; or intervention studies examining the effectiveness of strategies to reduce the evidence-practice gap. Results: A total of 176 <b>eligible</b> <b>papers</b> were identified. The number of publications significantly increased over time, from 25 in 2000 to 100 in 2010 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Of the 176 identified papers, 160 were data-based. The majority of these (n[*]=[*] 150) reported descriptive studies. Only 10 studies examined the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce discrepancies between evidence and clinical practice. Of these, only one was a randomized controlled trial. Of all data-based studies, almost one-third (n[*]=[*] 48) examined breast cancer care. Conclusions: While the number of publications investigating evidence-practice gaps in cancer care increased over a ten-year period, most studies continued to describe gaps between best evidence and clinical practice, rather than rigorously testing interventions to reduce the gap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Performance of {{specialty}} referrals is coming under scrutiny, but {{a lack of}} identifiable measures impedes measurement efforts. The objective {{of this study was}} to systematically review the literature to identify published measures that assess specialty referrals. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature for measures {{of specialty}} referral. Searches were made of MEDLINE and HealthSTAR databases, references of <b>eligible</b> <b>papers,</b> and citations provided by content experts. Measures were eligible if they were published from January 1973 to June 2009, reported on validity and/or reliability of the measure, and were applicable to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development healthcare systems. We classified measures according to a conceptual framework, which underwent content validation with an expert panel. Results We identified 2, 964 potentially <b>eligible</b> <b>papers.</b> After abstract and full-text review, we selected 214 papers containing 244 measures. Most measures were applied in adults (57 %), assessed structural elements of the referral process (60 %), and collected data via survey (62 %). Measures were classified into non-mutually exclusive domains: need for specialty care (N = 14), referral initiation (N = 73), entry into specialty care (N = 53), coordination (N = 60), referral type (N = 3), clinical tasks (N = 19), resource use (N = 13), quality (N = 57), and outcomes (N = 9). Conclusions Published measures are available to assess the specialty referral process, although some domains are limited. Because many of these measures have been not been extensively validated in general populations, assess limited aspects of the referral process, and require new data collection, their applicability and preference in assessment of the specialty referral process is needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{modulation}} {{difficulties are}} common in children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whilst both hyporesponsivity and hyperresponsivity have been established in ASD comparative to typically developing controls, it has been proposed that hyporesponsivity may distinguish the sensory profile of ASD from other neurodevelopmental conditions. This paper aimed to systematically evaluate evidence for a syndrome-specific profile of hyporesponsivity in individuals with ASD when compared to individuals from clinical comparison groups, evaluating 10 <b>eligible</b> <b>papers.</b> Support was cautiously identified for a syndrome-specific sensory profile of hyporesponsivity. Four factors that reduced variability in findings were as follows: chronological age, type of comparison group, sensory measure and quality of study. Whilst hyporesponsivity in ASD was identified, the use of poorly defined comparison groups, over-representation of children with ASD and intellectual disabilities, and younger age ranges complicate generalisation of this body of work.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of eight databases and considered papers looking at primary care aspects of surviving cancer at least 3 years past diagnosis. RESULTS: Ten <b>eligible</b> <b>papers</b> in four categories: consultation rates in primary care, cancer screening, use of preventative services and chronic disease management. There was no conclusive evidence that cancer survivors have increased rates of consultation in primary care. The studies reported that cancer screening is well managed in survivors.

40|$|Background: Studies of {{psychiatric}} populations have reported associations between childhood adversity and volumes of stress-related brain structures. This meta-analysis investigated these associations in non-clinical samples and therefore {{independent of the}} effects of severe mental health difficulties and their treatment. Methods: The MEDLINE database was searched for magnetic resonance imaging studies measuring brain structure in adults with and without childhood adversity. Fifteen <b>eligible</b> <b>papers</b> (1781 participants) reporting hippocampal volumes and/or amygdala volumes were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Results: Those with childhood adversity had lower hippocampus volumes (hedges g = − 0. 15, p =  0. 010). Controlling for gender, this difference became less evident (hedges g = − 0. 12, p =  0. 124). This association differed depending on whether studies included participants with some psychopathology, though {{this may be due to}} differences in the type of adversity these studies examined. There was no strong evidence of any differences in amygdala volume.

40|$|Background: Echinococcosis is {{a complex}} {{zoonosis}} that has domestic and sylvatic lifecycles, {{and a range of}} different intermediate and definitive host species. The complexities of its transmission and the sparse evidence on the effectiveness of control strategies in diverse settings provide significant challenges for the design of effective public health policy against this disease. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool for simulating control packages under locally specific transmission conditions to inform optimal timing and frequency of phased interventions for cost-effective control of echinococcosis. The aims of this review of 30 years of Echinococcus modelling were to discern the epidemiological mechanisms underpinning models of Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis transmission and to establish the need to include a human transmission component in such models. Methodology/Principal Findings: A search was conducted of all relevant articles published up until July 2012, identified from the PubMED, Web of Knowledge and Medline databases and review of bibliographies of selected <b>papers.</b> <b>Papers</b> <b>eligible</b> for inclusion were those describing the design of a new model, or modification of an existing mathematical model of E. granulosus or E. multilocularis transmission. A total of 13 <b>eligible</b> <b>papers</b> were identified, five of which described mathematical models of E. granulosus and eight that described E. multilocularis transmission. These models varied primarily on the basis of six key mechanisms that all have the capacity to modulate model dynamics, qualitatively affectin...|$|R
