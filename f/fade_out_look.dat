5000|$|The song <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> only to {{come back}} even louder, and then <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> a second time. This idea was taken from The Beatles' songs [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] and [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever." ...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{reference}} to the film and its title, the song has no distinctive beginning, nor an end. While many songs <b>fade</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "The NeverEnding Story" [...] not only <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> but also <b>fades</b> in, thus making it [...] "never ending".|$|R
5000|$|The album {{contains}} a Kiss cover-song [...] "Almost Human". In Lordi's version [...] "Almost Human"-song <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> only {{to come back}} even louder, and then <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> a second time. This idea was taken from Kiss' song [...] "I Love It Loud".|$|R
50|$|Both the {{original}} and radio edit of the song was often played over the airwaves during the late 1970s. The difference is the song <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> before the second saxophone solo and ending guitar melody that would itself eventually <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> with primary instruments being removed.|$|R
5000|$|Of note, 1960s record {{releases}} {{of the second}} version, as well as subsequent hits packages of the song, feature a <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending. The cold ending version (heard in one episode of the television series) was first released on Arista's [...] "Then And Now, The Best Of The Monkees" [...] in 1986. Subsequent hits packages and reissues of the single on their Flashback label also feature the longer version. Early examples of the Flashback single release have the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending. The original Colgems single has the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending.|$|R

5000|$|Note: The {{ending of}} the album version of [...] "Diamond Sun" [...] is a parody of [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] by The Beatles. Just as the song <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> the song <b>fades</b> in with only the {{percussion}} beat and <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> again with Alan Frew's voice saying [...] "I buried Paul".|$|R
5000|$|Another aspect in {{the film}} are the <b>fade</b> <b>outs,</b> which are {{traditionally}} used in movies to represent time passing or to conclude a certain scene, instead bring the viewers {{back to the point}} in time which the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> began. The occasional <b>fade</b> <b>outs</b> and <b>fade</b> ins to Julie's character are used to represent an extremely subjective point of view. According to Kieślowski: [...] "at a certain moment, time really does pass for Julie while at the same time, it stands still. Not only does her music come back to haunt her at a certain point, but time stands still for a moment." ...|$|R

30|$|What the {{framework}} advocates is {{a twist of}} the “fading” mechanism in the conventional sense of scaffolding. The teachers’ scaffolds need not be <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> but are transformed into student scaffolds. The student scaffolds may <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> by itself when individual students become more adept in the target knowledge and skills and therefore need less support from their peers.|$|R
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the song were made. The album version had an extensive musical interlude both {{in the middle of}} the song and as a <b>fade</b> <b>out,</b> the single edit excluded both interludes and brought the song to a cold-sustained end (the song stops on the note before the interlude would've begun and holds it in a <b>fade</b> <b>out).</b>|$|R
