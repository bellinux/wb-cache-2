40|$|As global {{temperatures}} keep increasing and {{the amount}} of Co 2 equivalent stuff in the atmosphere is at record level, the key links between GDP growth, energy consumption expansion and greenhouse gases emission increases must be more researched, although economic growth and ecological capital has been much debated: Can they today be combined to give both prosperity and environmental sustainability? On the micro level, many projects show that this is indeed possible. But on the macro level, global emissions of greenhouse gases follow the advancement of country affluence closely. The link is the constantly increasing need for more energy, provided by fossil <b>fuels.</b> The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> policies are probably forthcoming too late to avoid disasters...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{discovers that}} <b>G</b> <b>20</b> country governments’ support to fossil fuel production marries bad economics with potentially disastrous consequences for climate change. In effect, governments are propping up {{the production of}} oil, gas and coal, much of which cannot be used if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change. The report documents, for the first time, the scale and structure of fossil fuel production subsidies in the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> countries. The evidence points to a publicly financed bailout {{for some of the}} world’s largest, most carbon-intensive and polluting companies. It finds that, by providing subsidies for fossil <b>fuel</b> production, the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> countries are creating a ‘lose-lose’ scenario. They are directing large volumes of finance into high-carbon assets that cannot be exploited without catastrophic climate effects. This diverts investment from economic low-carbon alternatives such as solar, wind and hydro-power.

40|$|The {{increasing}} environmental concern, {{the demographic}} {{and economic growth}} of the emerging economies and the progressive reduction in the world reserves of crude oil forced the transportation sector to consider the use of alternative fuels (natural gas and hydrogen enriched methane) and renewable sources (bio-gases). The processes employed for biogas production are responsible for blends made up by different percentages of methane, CO, H 2 and inert gases. Such a variety results into {{a wide range of}} heating values as well as chemical and physical properties and inevitably affects the engine combustion process and performance. The present paper investigates the effect of different <b>fuel</b> blends (<b>G</b> <b>20,</b> <b>G</b> 25 and HCNG 30) on the performance of a 1. 4 litre spark ignition engine and specifically it aims at highlighting the need for an algorithm to be implemented in the engine ECU and capable to identify the mixture composition so as to set the proper engine control parameters. Improved combustion behaviour was achieved when hydrogen was added to methane with the drawbacks of reduced engine exhaust temperatures and increased in-cylinder pressure. G 25 operations were in turn characterized by a decrease in the engine power output associated with the replacement of methane with inert gase...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{physicochemical}} fuel characteristics and engine performance-emission features of three prospective alternative transportation fuels: Alexandrian laurel biodiesel (ALBD), jatropha biodiesel (JBD) and GTL fuel at high idling conditions. The blends of GTL <b>fuel</b> (<b>G</b> 10, <b>G</b> <b>20),</b> JBD (J 10, J 20) and ALBD (AL 10, AL 20) with diesel had been investigated in a multi-cylinder diesel engine at different load-speed conditions. Analysis of the fuel properties showed a linear variation of the major fuel properties with an increase of alternative fuel quantity in the blends. Engine performance test results revealed an average decrease of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) (ca. 8. 65 – 12. 26 %) and brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) (ca. 8. 27 – 11. 51 %), but a higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) (ca. 8. 56 – 12. 58 %) by GTL blends, whereas, the biodiesel blends showed higher BSFC (ca. 5. 01 – 12. 18 %) and BSEC (ca. 3. 41 – 9. 67 %) and lower BTE (ca. 3. 68 – 9. 93 %), respectively, than those of diesel. Referring to the emission analysis, the results revealed that GTL blends showed a slight reduction in NO x (ca. 3. 89 – 6. 85 %), but {{a significant reduction in}} CO (ca. 48. 25 – 51. 38 %), HC (ca. 44. 81 – 51. 43 %) and smoke (ca. 15. 21 – 18. 78 %), respectively, when compared to diesel.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the roles played by Indian and South African {{actors in the}} <b>G</b> <b>20</b> networks. It explores the mechanisms, internal dynamics and evolution of the networks and also how Indian and South African actors contribute to <b>G</b> <b>20</b> outcome formulation and consensus dissemination. The study adopts a process-focussed approach {{in order to examine}} the diverse logics of interaction which shape <b>G</b> <b>20</b> outcomes. The study provides the most significant empirical study of the evolution of Indian and South African participation in the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> to date. It also provides a comprehensive account of the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> 's evolving roles in steering IMF governance reforms, in crisis management and response and in global development governance. The thesis details how IMF governance reforms have been <b>G</b> <b>20</b> led since 2006 and how <b>G</b> <b>20</b> deputy deliberations have incrementally overcome seemingly intractable conflicts outside of the more formal confines of the IMF executive board. With regards crisis management and response, the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> has twice played a crucial overseeing role. The thesis illustrates in particular how Indian perspectives on <b>G</b> <b>20</b> post crisis management have carried more weight since 2008. With regards global development governance, the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> has undergone a partial and contested developmental turn since the creation of the leaders' level networks. South African <b>G</b> <b>20</b> participants, as representatives of the only African <b>G</b> <b>20</b> member, have adopted a niche leadership role in this developmental turn. Overall South Africa is positioned as an engaged middle power in the <b>G</b> <b>20,</b> whose <b>G</b> <b>20</b> representatives draw upon honest brokerage and leverage their African leadership role as key sources of <b>G</b> <b>20</b> influence. Meanwhile, Indian <b>G</b> <b>20</b> participants are positioned as representatives of an increasingly engaged rising power, who nevertheless primarily focus their <b>G</b> <b>20</b> efforts on endeavours to prevent the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> from overly encroaching on Indian policy space.

Authored by Mike Callaghan AM, Daniela Strube, Susan Harris Rimmer, Emmanuel Nnadozie, Azamat Abdymomunov, Gary Hawke, Ron Duncan and Raymond Saner. Key findings: 	The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s work has myriad implications for non-member countries. The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> process needs to reflect this in a meaningful way. 	The first step for the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> to assuming its broader, global responsibility is to push ahead with its efforts to promote growth in the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> economies, since other countries will also significantly benefit from a stronger, more sustainable and more balanced recovery in the world’s biggest economies. 	The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> can do a lot to address non-member countries’ concerns without losing its focus and core agenda. Promoting reform in international organisations and facilitating productive cooperation with non-members and invited guests are two key areas. 	Now that the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> approaches its six anniversary, the effectiveness of its outreach process warrants a constructive and outcome-oriented debate. Outreach is of critical importance to the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s long-term success.

The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s immediate response to the 2008 financial crisis was considered to be a success, but its effectiveness has waned since then. There are, however, two aspects of business regulation where the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> has successfully facilitated international cooperation to achieve significant outcomes that have affected the business climate in <b>G</b> <b>20</b> members.

The Monitor contains papers covering the four policy areas discussed at Think 20 2014 : The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s economic and finance challenges, trade liberalisation, infrastructure and development. The papers are not {{a summary of the}} meeting nor do they reflect the agreed views of participants. Key findings The development of a combined <b>G</b> <b>20</b> growth strategy, which outlines how <b>G</b> <b>20</b> members are working together to lift growth, along with the release of each member’s individual growth strategy, should be elevated as top priorities for Brisbane. The multilateral trading system remains the strongest force for economic growth and the best defence against distorting protectionism. As part of embracing the importance of trade to growth, <b>G</b> <b>20</b> leaders should aim to provide strategic guidance {{on the future of the}} multilateral trading system. The renewed focus of the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> on infrastructure is a positive development given the global infrastructure shortfall, however the first question for the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> should be where or whether it can actually add value to the efforts of international organisations and individual countries in facilitating increased infrastructure investment. The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s primary development goal, under Australia’s presidency, should be to strengthen the links between the major, but currently uncoordinated, development processes underway in 2014 / 15. These include the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s own framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth, UNFCCC COP 21, the post- 2015 MDGs, and the UN’s sustainable development agenda. By establishing a strategic convergence group, the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> could ‘assist upstream’ to these processes by “shaping coherent, convergent outcomes”...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the real {{position}} of the European Union {{in the global economy}} and to evaluate its ability to present common interests, priorities and objectives of the Member States and achieve its acceptance on the international scene. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first one deals with global and economic governance and <b>G</b> <b>20,</b> a forum for international cooperation in the field of economic and financial problems. The second chapter is focused on the European Union, one of the twenty members of <b>G</b> <b>20,</b> and macroeconomic position of the EU in <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> There are also mentiond economic, fiscal and trade policy of the European Union. The last part is devoted to the Union's negotiating power within the <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> Negotiating power is evaluated on the basis of EU's common position on the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> agenda compared with the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> summit declarations.

40|$|The next <b>G</b> <b>20</b> Summit {{will take}} place in Hamburg on 7 / 8 July 2017. Under the Chinese Presidency, the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> adopted the Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the 2016 Summit in Hangzhou. The 2030 Agenda had been signed by heads of state and {{government}} during the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2015.

40|$|Provides a {{guide to}} the {{policies}} that <b>G</b> <b>20</b> members will have to tackle to achieve the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s 2 per cent growth target, drawing on the recommendations of the IMF, OECD and a number of international think tanks. Key findings 	A key initiative in Australia’s 2014 <b>G</b> <b>20</b> Presidency is to lift global growth by more than 2 per cent over five years above what the IMF was forecasting in the October 2013 World Economic Outlook. The Brisbane Action Plan, to be released at the Brisbane Leaders’ Summit, will detail the new policy measures proposed by <b>G</b> <b>20</b> members to achieve the growth target. Since the target is for an extra 2 per cent in global growth, it will require extra policy measures. 	To have credibility, the additional policy steps outlined in the Brisbane Action Plan should cover the policy gaps that the IMF and OECD have identified for each <b>G</b> <b>20</b> member. 	Significant structural reforms will be required by <b>G</b> <b>20</b> members. Such reforms are often contentious and the IMF and OECD have warned there is a high implementation risk. To help maintain political momentum in advancing the reforms, <b>G</b> <b>20</b> members should commit to the international organisations regularly publishing implementation reports for each <b>G</b> <b>20</b> member along with overall progress towards meeting the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s growth target. The date for the first progress reports should be agreed at the Brisbane Summit...|$|R
40|$|Australia and {{the world}} needs a focused and {{effective}} <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> But the forum {{is in danger of}} losing its way. This Analysis identifies nine key lessons from the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s history that can help relaunch it. This should be Australia’s goal when it chairs the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> in 2014. Key findings:Drawing on nine lessons from previous summits on {{what works and what does}} not, the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> needs an explicit multi-tracked approach. A wide range of issues should continue to be advanced in the <b>G</b> <b>20,</b> but leaders should focus on a few key issues where they can have an impact. Let the leaders lead.

40|$|In May 2014, Griffith University and the Lowy Institute for International Policy jointly {{organized}} the conference â€˜G 20 and Developmentâ€™. This conference brought together academics, policymakers, {{representatives of the}} civil society and other development stakeholders to discuss {{the role of the}} <b>G</b> <b>20</b> as a development actor. Four key themes were addressed: (i) the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> as a global steering committee: performance and challenges, (ii) the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> as a development actor: governance, agenda and accountability, (iii) mainstreaming development in the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> agenda and (iv) <b>G</b> <b>20</b> â€™s contribution in other development policy areas.

40|$|In this Lowy Institute Analysis, <b>G</b> <b>20</b> Studies Centre Director Mike Callaghan {{examines}} what outcomes {{from the}} Brisbane <b>G</b> <b>20</b> Summit in November would help reinvigorate the forum and render this year 2 ̆ 7 s Summit a success. Key findings 	While Australia {{has sought to}} strengthen the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> by pursuing during its presidency a more focused agenda, events in 2014 have increased the challenges confronting the global economy and the <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> The Brisbane Summit needs {{to demonstrate that the}} spirit of cooperation is alive and well within the <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> 	To be a success, the Brisbane Summit requires a headline outcome, engaged leaders, a minimum of rhetoric, a focus on implementation, and clear evidence of cooperation between members. 	Achievements should include a focus on implementing the reforms needed to achieve the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s growth target, a renewed effort on multilateral trade liberalisation, and concrete steps to modernising international taxation...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{profile of}} the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> in the {{aftermath}} of the Global Financial Crisis has led to various forms of concern about the legitimacy of this forum. While debates about the legitimacy of the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> are important and ongoing, they overlook the important observation that the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> is also attempting to perform a key role in legitimating global capitalism. This role of legitimating global capitalism emphasises the importance of the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> to act, and be seen to act, to normalise global capitalism, to strengthen global economic governance, and also facilitate a political consensus with regard to key policy issues. This essay critically examines the role that the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> plays in legitimating global capitalism and contends that the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> is not just a technical forum of international policy-making but also a political forum for creating and performing visible responses to problems which are seen to be socially responsive...|$|R
40|$|The <b>G</b> <b>20</b> {{acted as}} a crisis manager when global {{financial}} markets were under threat in 2008 and 2009, and contributed to a positive outcome. However since then, in the more routine work of crisis prevention, its performance has been less convincing at best, and criticism of its effectiveness has increased. Nevertheless, a global governance forum such as the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> is necessary. Allowing the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> to slide slowly into irrelevance would be unfortunate because a global crisis manager is once again needed, this {{time to deal with}} the European sovereign-debt crisis The first priority is to promptly finalise the macro-coordination framework still under construction, and strengthen it by bringing intra-regional imbalances explicitly to the fore. These should be treated as global imbalances under <b>G</b> <b>20</b> responsibility if they have global implications, as the euro crisis certainly does. Second, decisions should be taken on how the emerging country bloc represented in the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> could contribute to provide financial-market support in conditions of stress. The 3 - 4 November Cannes <b>G</b> <b>20</b> summit is an opportunity to strengthen the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s role...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the policing of a major international political event (the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> Meetings in Brisbane, Australia in 2014) {{from the perspective of}} the police and representatives of demonstrator groups who participated in the event. The article locates the policing of the 2014 <b>G</b> <b>20</b> meetings within the history of the policing of major international political meetings in other countries. It analyses the legal framework within which the policing of the Brisbane <b>G</b> <b>20</b> meeting was undertaken, comparing and contrasting these with legal frameworks developed for similar meetings and associated demonstrations in other jurisdictions. In the case of the Australian <b>G</b> <b>20</b> Act, the legislation prioritized security over human rights, including the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly. The strategies and planning processes applied by police in the lead up to the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> are discussed, including the efforts made to ensure policing responses were respectful of the democratic rights of protesters. Drawing on interview and other data, the article reveals a diversity of perspectives on the ‘human rights’ policing and dialogue models, and provides an assessment of ‘Operation Southern Cross’ based on the post-event review of the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> legislation undertaken by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission. The authors conclude that the policing of <b>G</b> <b>20,</b> based on extensive dialogue and minimization of coercive public order strategies, fostered a peaceful <b>G</b> <b>20</b> event. The article concludes with observations about the perceived success of <b>G</b> <b>20</b> policing in Australia, and indicates some lessons learned for best practice policing for future global events.

40|$|Since it {{hosted the}} <b>G</b> <b>20</b> summit and since Trump’s ascent to the US presidency, China has {{promoted}} {{its role as}} a defender of free trade. In line with European interests, China has also become a supporter of <b>G</b> <b>20</b> attempts to tackle the emerging crisis of globalisation. Indeed, China has many reasons to be a facilitative player in the <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> However, its engagement entails limitations for the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> going forward. Compared to India, another emerging power, China has assumed {{an active role in the}} <b>G</b> <b>20,</b> seeking to put its stamp on the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> agenda and calling for the forum’s transformation from a crisis-response mechanism to one of long-term economic governance. There are various incentives for China to play this role: the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s small but widen­ed membership relative to the G 7, the opportunities for status enhancement and for pushing global governance reforms, the loose institutional design, and the focus on issues that China feels comfortable dealing with. However, China’s prospective engagement has limits. We cannot expect China to agree to a widening of the agenda beyond financial and economic issues. Also, it seems unlikely that China would offer the kind of visionary leadership necessary to fill the hegemonic vacuum should the United States continue to disengage from global governance. In the longer term, attempts by the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> to tackle its perceived lack of legitimacy are unlikely to be welcomed by China. Calls for institutional consolidation, transparency, and accountability in the move towards more representative global institutions go against China’s key motives in supporting the <b>G</b> <b>20.</b> The corridor for Sino–European cooperation in tackling the crisis of globalisation through the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> is clearly circumscribed: only if the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> agenda stays focused on core financial and economic issues will China remain a facilitative player in this grouping. The sole way to prevent increasing tension between the <b>G</b> <b>20</b> ’s efficiency and its legitimacy is to push for continued reforms of the traditional global institutions, allowing emerging powers a bigger say in the existing international order. If the architecture of global governance cannot be reshaped from within these global institutions, incentives for China to leverage its growing stature within alternative institutions will increase...|$|R
