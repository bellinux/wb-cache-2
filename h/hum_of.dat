5|$|Keith Baxter {{said that}} the film's soundtrack was post-dubbed months after filming was completed, and that actors Fernando Rey and Marina Vlady were dubbed by {{different}} actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and Michael Aldridge recorded voices for several characters in post-production. Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a power generator, used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it. The score was composed by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, {{who had worked with}} Welles on Othello. The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK. During the editing, Welles showed a rough cut to the visiting head of the Cannes Film Festival, who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.|$|E

25|$|There {{is usually}} a <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> {{expectancy}} when Holmes and Sutcliffe appear, their faces wreathed in smiles, and chatting happily together. They seem to be sharing some all-absorbing joke. Holmes, proudly wearing his Yorkshire cap, walks with quick, short steps, shoulders erect and head in the air, {{doing his best to}} look as tall as (John) Tunnicliffe. Sutcliffe has dark, glossy hair and usually disdains the valued White Rose cap when batting. He strolls casually along by the side of Percy, keeping his weather eye open for the wicket-keeper's end and the honour of taking the first ball.|$|E

500|$|Another {{symbolic}} {{sound is}} the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a mosquito. Although his producer insists that these parasites don't live in Los Angeles (since [...] "mosquitos breed in swamps; {{this is a}} desert"), its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she's been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the movie's score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.|$|E
500|$|Steve Lowe {{called the}} song [...] "penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles" [...] with [...] "a repugnance for {{prevailing}} yuppified social values". Among the loosely connected {{imagery of the}} lyrics, Footman identified the song's subject as [...] "the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-Stepford Wife, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on Prozac, Viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover." [...] Sam Steele called the lyrics [...] "a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be {{that we live in}} such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto from Loudwire {{praised the}} band's musicianship and wrote, [...] "While U2 songs are often sacred ground, Thirty Seconds to Mars handle their {{rendition}} of 'Where the Streets Have No Name' perfectly." [...] Kayleigh Burn, writing for Chemical magazine, awarded the album five stars {{out of a}} possible five and felt that the band [...] "conquer the listener with a barrage of stunning vocals, memorable guitars and the recurring <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> the violins." [...] She opined that [...] "Hurricane" [...] was [...] "the best representation of a steadfast performance" [...] and commented that the album [...] "lends the opportunity for a tranquil and calm display of their abilities and more importantly, their hearts." [...] At the end of 2011, the Unplugged version of [...] "Hurricane" [...] won the MTV Award for Best Live Performance, with critic James Montgomery commenting that the band's performance [...] "is very much a communal thing, one where a celebration never seems all that far off." ...|$|E

500|$|Walton's {{works of}} the 1920s, while {{he was living in}} the Sitwells' attic, include the {{overture}} Portsmouth Point, dedicated to Sassoon and inspired by the well-known painting of the same name by Thomas Rowlandson. It was first heard as an entr'acte at a performance in Diaghilev's 1926 ballet season, where The Times complained, [...] "It is a little difficult to make much of new music when it is heard through the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> conversation." [...] Sir Henry Wood programmed the work at the Proms the following year, where it made more of an impression. The composer conducted this performance; he did not enjoy conducting, but he had firm views on how his works should be interpreted, and orchestral players appreciated his [...] "easy nonchalance" [...] and [...] "complete absence of fuss." [...] Walton's other {{works of the}} 1920s included a short orchestral piece, Siesta (1926) and a Sinfonia Concertante for piano and orchestra (1928), which was well received at its premiere at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert, but has not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> the internal combustion engine car at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E

Living in the camp caused distortion, deformed and destroyed the children's psyche. Along the walls of [...] "The Primer World" [...] there are pre-war primers in Polish, Belarusian and Hebrew.

They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping.

2500|$|In [...] "Viviendo", {{the poet}} {{is in the}} city, walking in the {{twilight}} surrounded by the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> traffic. [...] The poet feels part of a machine that is slowly ticking away time. [...] He reaches {{the realization that the}} individual can die without the machine either slowing or stopping, regardless of whether the individual has completed his part of the work of that machine. [...] As time goes by, the sight of tables on a cafÃ© terrace remind him that there is after all a human component to this machine. [...] The conclusion that emerges is again resignation to the inevitability of death but there is no sense of consolation, merely an unconvincing stoicism of a man journeying from nothingness to nothingness. [...] It is a very different feel to [...] "A vista de hombre".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the chaos}} of {{production}} and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and sound effects. Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an [...] "organic soundtrack". Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck. The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as {{a combination of the}} <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as {{he was looking for a}} buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum. For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone.|$|E
2500|$|A {{noise gate}} sets a {{threshold}} where {{if it is}} quieter it will not let the signal pass {{and if it is}} louder it opens the gate. [...] A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a compressor. [...] Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. [...] Without a noise gate, the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals. [...] With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.|$|E
