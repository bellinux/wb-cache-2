5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is <b>disseminated</b> <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and <b>disseminated</b> <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation.</b> These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E

40|$|Signs of <b>disseminated</b> <b>intravascular</b> {{clotting}} {{were observed}} {{during the development}} of BNML myelomonocytic leukaemia in rats, when the peripheral leucocyte count exceeded 20, 000 /microliters and more than 50 % blasts {{were present in the}} circulation. BNML cells, harvested from blood and tested in appropriate systems, were found devoid of any procoagulant activity (PCA) even following prolonged in vitro incubation with endotoxin. Thus, it appears that these rat leukaemic cells share the same inability to express PCA which had been previously described in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal rats.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{transfusion}} of peritoneal leukocytes, platelets, or cell suspension medium on the activation of <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> {{and on the}} generation of capillary microclots was studied in 51 granulocytopenic and thrombocytopenic rabbits. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia induced by feeding the cytoxic drug busulfan prevented the activation of <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> and the occurrence of renal glomerular microclots after two injections of endotoxin. The transfusion of platelets into busulfan-pretreated rabbits increased the mean platelet count from 2, 400 to 205, 000 cells/mul, but platelet-transfused rabbits did not exhibit activation of <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> after endotoxin injection. If however, granulocytopenic and thrombocytopenic rabbits were transfused with peritoneal leukocytes (1. 0 X 10 (9) cells/kg) before the second injection of endotoxin, activation of <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> occurred, and microclot formation in renal glomerular capillaries was observed in {{a high percentage of}} animals. Positive reactions to endotoxin were obtained in leukocyte-transfused rabbits even with platelet counts of 1, 000 cells/mul before the second injection of endotoxin.

5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme creatine kinase and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate <b>disseminated</b> <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation.</b> High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm.

French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as <b>disseminated</b> <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation,</b> although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets.

40|$|Primary cardiac non-Hodgkin lymphomas are fast-growing {{intracavitary}} and/or intramyocardial nodular masses, while secondary lymphomas {{most commonly}} infiltrate the cardiac tissue. By any definition, cardiac non-Hodgkin lymphomas usually manifest through arrhythmias, refractory heart failure, pericardial effusion, and embolic stroke. We here describe {{a case of}} a cardiac non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which the following, previously undescribed features manifest simultaneously. It occorre in a polytransfused hepatitis C virus-positive splenectomized thalassemic patient; it rapidly grew, giving rise to an enormous right atrial mass and, this notwithstanding, it was completely asymptomatic. This cardiac lymphoma was discovered during staging for a CD 20 + large B-cell lymphoma of the tonsils. In particular, transesophageal echocardiography, showing that this prolapsing mass had a wide base on the atrial wall, led us to strongly suspect the lymphomatous origin of the mass itself. Notwithstanding anti-CD 20 antibody therapy, urgent surgery was unavoidable and histology revealed that the mass consisted of lymphoma proliferation infiltrating even the right atrial wall and the pericardium. During the postoperative course the patient presented with a massive, fatal hemopericardium consequent to <b>intravascular</b> <b>disseminated</b> <b>coagulation.</b> This very unusual case, occurring in a hepatitis C virus-positive thalassemic patient, suggests that a case control study on the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in such patients may be interesting. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundNecrotising {{enterocolitis}} is {{the most}} frequent and severe acquired gastrointestinal disease in newborns and still has high mortality. There are few published papers about prognostic factors of death in our country. ObjectiveTo know the factors associated with death in patients with necrotising enterocolitis. Material and methodsRetrospective, descriptive, comparative study with a case–control design was conducted on patients with necrotising enterocolitis during a 5 -year period. ResultsDeceased patients had significantly lower platelet counts compared to survivors (p= 0. 022) and the prognostic factors associated with mortality were anaemia (p= 0. 006, OR= 15. 62), stage III of necrotising enterocolitis (p< 0. 001, OR= 47. 5), to require surgical treatment (p< 0. 001, OR= 47. 5), to have intestinal necrosis (p= 0. 001, OR= 48. 5) or perforation (p= 0. 016, OR= 24. 25), to have medical complications, specifically <b>intravascular</b> <b>disseminated</b> <b>coagulation</b> (p< 0. 001, RR= 98), and multi-organ failure (p< 0. 001, RR= 2).

40|$|Cortistatin is a {{recently}} discovered cyclic neuropeptide related to somatostatin {{that has emerged}} as a potential endogenous antiinflammatory factor based on its production by and binding to immune cells. Because human septic shock involves excessive inflammatory cytokine production, we investigated the effect of cortistatin on the production of inflammatory mediators and its therapeutic action in various murine models of endotoxemia. Cortistatin down-regulated the production of inflammatory mediators by endotoxin-activated macrophages. The administration of cortistatin protected against lethality after cecal ligation and puncture, or injection of bacterial endotoxin or Escherichia coli, and prevented the septic shock-associated histopathology, such as infiltration of inflammatory cells and <b>intravascular</b> <b>disseminated</b> <b>coagulation</b> in various target organs. The therapeutic effect of cortistatin was mediated by decreasing the local and systemic levels of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins. The combined use of cortistatin and other antiinflammatory peptides was very efficient treating murine septic shock. This work provides the first evidence of cortistatin as a new immunomodulatory factor with the capacity to deactivate the inflammatory response. Cortistatin represents a potential multistep therapeutic agent for human septic shock, to be used in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or as a complement to other therapies...|$|R

25|$|<b>Disseminated</b> <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> (DIC) is a {{pathological}} process {{characterized by the}} widespread activation of the clotting cascade that results {{in the formation of}} blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body.

25|$|Blood {{products}} such as packed red blood cells, platelets or fresh frozen plasma may also be used.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{thrombin}} active in vivo in the intravascular space (blood and endothelial surface), both basally and in experimental <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation,</b> {{is measured by}} way of the accessibility of thrombin to intravascular hirudin.

Intravenous infusion of Salmonella endotoxin elicits an increase in the circulating concentration of hirudin-thrombin complex that begins within 15 min and is 20 - 30 times basal after 4 hr. Induction of mild <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> is evidenced by a modest reduction in plasma fibrinogen concentrations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of reticuloendothelial (RE) blockade on the pulmonary hemodynamic and gas exchange response to thrombin induced low-grade <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> was studied in dogs during fibrinolytic inhibition. Neither saline infusion nor experimentally induced RE blockade significantly increased pulmonary vascular resistance, physiologic dead space, or pulmonary venous admixture. <b>Intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> {{in the absence}} of RE blockade resulted in a significant (p less than 0. 05) elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance which was transient and returned to prechallenge levels over a two to four hour period. This response was not associated with any significant change in physiological dead space. In contrast, <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation</b> in the presence of RE blockade resulted in significant (p less than 0. 05) hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities. These included an acute elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance, a decrease in arterial oxygenation, an increase in pulmonary venous admixture, and a sustained elevation in physiologic dead space. These events were associated with an elevation in the lung wet-to-dry weight ratios. Gas exchange and hemodynamic alterations afterthrombin infusion during RE blockade suggest a functional role for the reticuloendothelial system in the prevention of pulmonary injury during <b>intravascular</b> <b>coagulation.</b> Thus, this study suggests a possible role of the RES in minimizing pulmonary injury during states of increased microaggregate formation...|$|R
