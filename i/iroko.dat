Following this, he would {{continue}} as a writer, broadening his writing to cover topics such as politics and government, socio-economic conditions and even the history of Benin. On June 14, 2007, Moumouni released his book Pour un Bénin métamorphosé, la Nation que nous voulons, a book which examined political and socio-economic conditions in Benin since 1960. He worked on the book for seven years. The book was critically acclaimed, Professor Felix <b>Iroko</b> calling it Moumouni's victory on adversity.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally crafted djembes are {{carved from}} a single log of hardwood. A number of {{different}} wood species are used, {{all of which are}} hard and dense. Hardness and density are important factors for the sound and projection of the djembe. The most prized djembe wood is lenke (Afzelia africana), not because it necessarily sounds better than other woods, but because the Malinké believe that its spiritual qualities are superior. (Malinké traditional wisdom states that a spiritual energy, or nyama, runs through all things, living or dead.) Besides lenke, traditional woods include djalla (Khaya senegalensis), dugura (Cordyla africana), gueni (Pterocarpus erinaceus), gele (Prosopis africana), and <b>iroko</b> (Milicia excelsa).|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, {{a number}} of {{preventive}} measures were instigated, including the removal of bulkheads to increase airflow and the fumigating of the ship against the deathwatch beetle. The following decade saw the replacement {{of much of the}} decayed oak with oily hardwoods such as teak and <b>Iroko,</b> which were believed to be more resistant to fungus and pests. The decision to restore Victory to her Battle of Trafalgar configuration was taken in 1920, but the need to undertake these important repairs meant this was not achieved until 2005, in time for the Trafalgar 200 celebrations. Victorys foretopsail was severely damaged during the Battle of Trafalgar, perforated by upwards of 90 cannonballs and other projectiles. It was replaced after the battle, but was preserved and eventually displayed in the Royal Naval Museum.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Iroko</b> {{is a large}} {{hardwood}} tree from {{the west coast of}} tropical Africa that can live up to 500 years. [...] The tree is known to the Yoruba as <b>ìrókò,</b> logo or loko and is believed to have supernatural properties. [...] <b>Iroko</b> is known to the Igbo people as oji wood. [...] It is one of the woods sometimes referred to as African teak, although it is unrelated to the teak family. The wood colour is initially yellow but darkens to a richer reddish brown over time.It is yielded mostly (probably) by Milicia excelsa. In much of the literature on this timber the names of the trees that yields it are given as Chlorophora excelsa and Chlorophora regia.The tree is feared in some cultures where it originates and hence is shunned or revered with offerings. Yoruba people believe that the tree is inhabited by a spirit, and anybody who sees the Iroko-man face to face becomes insane and speedily dies. According to the Yoruba, any man who cuts down any <b>Iroko</b> tree causes devastating misfortune on himself and all of his family, although if they need to cut down the tree they can make a prayer afterwards to protect themselves. [...] They also claim that the spirit of the <b>Iroko</b> can be heard in houses which use <b>Iroko</b> wood, as the spirit of the <b>Iroko</b> is trapped in the wood. In Nigeria the <b>iroko</b> wood is of much lower quality due to soil conditions as well as root-rot. [...] Some Westerners refer to the wood as [...] "poor man's teak".|$|E
