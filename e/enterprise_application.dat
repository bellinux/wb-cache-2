40|$|Electronic {{business}} (e-business) plays a {{major role}} in modem economic networks due to its shorter cycle time and faster information transactions. Building <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications</b> that can coordinate activities, decisions, and knowledge across many functions is a good solution for e-business. Hence, how to implement <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications</b> successfully has become an increasingly important management issue. Although success of information systems (IS) has received fairly extensive attention from prior research, issues regarding whether functions and service delivered by systems can be justifiably relied on by users are seriously ignored, especially complex systems like <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications.</b> Thus, this paper attempts to extend this kind of concept, perceived dependability, into DeLone and McLean's IS success model to explore how it influences success of <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications.</b> Results from a survey of 170 respondents taken from six internationalized e-businesses in Taiwan strongly support that perceived dependability is indeed an important factor for success of <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications.</b> Additionally, over and beyond the effects of dependability on success of <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications,</b> it can help practitioners and managers get deep insights into how to implement e-business successfully.

This applies also to <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications,</b> a novel category of software systems.

This paper shows why existing intermediate representations of objectoriented software are not suitable for performing reverse engineering upon <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications</b> and proposes an intermediate representation (a model) for <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications</b> which facilitates the process of reverse engineering upon this type of applications.
