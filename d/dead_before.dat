5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; {{he was certainly}} <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' and {{in the thick of}} the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.|$|E

5|$|Espanto Jr. is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} ring name of Jesús Andrade Salas (born May 11, 1956), a retired Mexican luchador, or professional wrestler. Over his 25-year-long career, Andrade worked under {{a number of different}} aliases, most importantly as Espanto Jr. ("Terror Jr."), later on as El Santo Negro ("The Black Saint"), and as the first person to work as Pentagón. Andrade was forced to retire from wrestling after suffering a life-threatening injury during a match that briefly left him clinically <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> being revived {{in the middle of the}} ring.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|No {{mention of}} Osorkon IV is known after 716 BC. Some archaeological {{findings}} suggest that shortly after this date, Bocchoris (Bakenrenef) of the 24th Dynasty may have expanded his realm eastward, supplanting Osorkon at Tanis. In 712 BC, Piye's successor Shebitku marched northward and defeated Bocchoris. When around the same year King Iamani of Ashdod sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt, Shebitku {{was in fact the}} sole ruler of Egypt, and returned Iamani to the Assyrians in chains. In any case, Osorkon IV was seemingly <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} set {{six months after}} the series six finale, where Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) and Adam Carter were kidnapped by the Redbacks, a {{mercenary}} group known for kidnapping intelligence officers and selling them to be tortured. At the end of the episode, Jo appears to have been killed by Adam to spare her from the torture before they could be rescued. However, in a flashback it is revealed Jo played <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> rescue teams arrived, and later beats her kidnapper, Boscard (Gus Gallagher), to death. At first undecided, {{towards the end of the}} episode Jo returns to duty. In the meantime, Sir Harry Pearce secures the release of MI5 officer Lucas North, who was imprisoned in Russia for eight years.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Scar {{debuted in}} The Lion King (1994). The jealous younger brother of Mufasa, Scar was next-in-line {{to take the}} throne until his nephew Simba, Mufasa's son, was born, {{replacing}} him. Determined to usurp the throne and become king himself, Scar devises a plan to kill both Simba and Mufasa. Cleverly trapping Simba in a vast gorge, Scar signals his hyena minions, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, to trigger a wildebeest stampede. Although Mufasa saves Simba, the king is weakened, and unable {{to climb out of}} the gorge to safety. When Mufasa begs Scar for help, Scar instead throws his brother to his death below. Convincing Simba that he is to blame for Mufasa's death, Scar advises the prince to run away and never return, then orders the hyenas to pursue and kill him. With his brother murdered and his nephew presumed dead, Scar returns to Pride Rock and tells the pride that both father and son are <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> becoming king.|$|E
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up in 1993 based on the UN Security Council Resolution 827, indicted Gotovina, Čermak and Markač for war crimes, {{specifically}} for their roles in Operation Storm, citing their participation in a joint criminal enterprise (JCE) aimed at the permanent removal of Serbs from the ARSK-held part of Croatia. The ICTY charges specified that other participants in the JCE were Tuđman, Šušak, and Bobetko and Červenko, however all except Bobetko were <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> the first relevant ICTY indictment was issued in 2001. Bobetko was indicted by the ICTY, but died a year later, before he could be extradited for trial at the ICTY. The trial of Gotovina et al began in 2008, leading to the convictions of Gotovina and Markač and the acquittal of Čermak three years later. Gotovina and Markač were acquitted on appeal in November 2012. The ICTY concluded that Operation Storm was not aimed at ethnic persecution, as civilians had not been deliberately targeted. Two judges in the panel of five dissented from this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Detective Joe Salerno (Derek Russo), a {{very dear}} friend of Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), is found dead, after {{being run over}} by Sara Gonzales (Diane Guerrero).

5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|With Isabelle Ingaldsthorpe, John Neville {{had a son}} {{and five}} daughters. The eldest was George Neville, Duke of Bedford (c. 1461–1483). It appears that Montagu had wanted to marry George to Anne, heiress of the Duke of Exeter; however, she had married the Earl of Dorset by 1466. George {{eventually}} died without issue, having been stripped of his Dukedom in 1478. His first daughter was Anne, who married Sir William Stonor of Stonor in Pyrton, Oxfordshire (and was thus a descendant of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk). Elizabeth married firstly Thomas Scrope, 6th Baron Scrope of Masham, who was a dedicated Yorkist for his whole career, and secondly Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, while Margaret Neville married firstly Sir John Mortimer (who was <b>dead</b> <b>before</b> 12 November 1504), only son of Sir Hugh Mortimer and Eleanor Cornwall, secondly Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and thirdly Robert Downes, gentleman. Lucy married firstly Sir Thomas FitzWilliam of Aldwark, North Yorkshire, and secondly Sir Anthony Browne. Finally, Isabel, who married firstly Sir Thomas Huddleston of Millom, Cumberland, (the Huddlestons of Millom were an important regional family and old allies of the Nevilles) and secondly Sir William Smythe of Elford in Staffordshire. Neville's widow remarried, on 25 April 1472, as his second wife, Sir William Norreys of Yattendon.|$|E
