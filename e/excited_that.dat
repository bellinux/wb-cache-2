5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. <b>Excited</b> <b>that</b> both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E

25|$|Their {{match at}} the 2012 Wimbledon Championships {{was one of}} the most highly {{anticipated}} Wimbledon finals in the history of The Championships. Federer was in the midst of a twenty-nine month drought in Grand Slam titles, then the longest of his career since first winning Wimbledon in 2003. Meanwhile, Murray had become the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final since Bunny Austin in 1938. Many in the United Kingdom were <b>excited</b> <b>that</b> Murray could become the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win Wimbledon. Murray sent the British crowd into utopia by winning the first set (the first set he had ever won in four finals). Federer fought off four break points in the second set before employing consecutive drop volleys to win the set. The third set featured a 20-minute game at 2–2 where Federer eventually broke Murray and took command of the match. The Swiss superstar would go on to win the match in four sets. This was a historic win as it was Federer's seventh Wimbledon tying him for most ever with William Renshaw and Pete Sampras. It also was Federer's 17th major title which extended the all-time record of the most coveted achievement in the sport. The victory also saw Federer return to world No. 1 for the first time since June 2010, allowing him to break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at World no. 1.|$|E
