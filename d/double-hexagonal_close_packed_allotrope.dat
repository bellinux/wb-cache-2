40|$|Ferrihydrite is {{a natural}} iron {{hydroxide}} occurring mostly in surface waters. In the last 40 years, six different structures have been proposed for ferrihydrite, without reaching consensus in the scientific community. The contradictory debate around the nanostructure of ferrihydrite represents the principal motivation of the present thesis, i. e., to verify systematically all structure proposals instead of just the most accepted ones. We compare powder x-ray diffraction patterns recorded from synthetic samples of 2 -lines and 6 -lines ferrihydrite with the calculated ones (Debye sum) from the proposed structures. The comparisons show that all structure propositions are incorrect. Although, three of the six propositions suggest jointly that oxygen atoms form a <b>double-hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> structure in ferrihydrite and that the exact structure determination problem could be solved by finding the correct positions of the iron atoms inside the oxygen layers...|$|R
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{berkelium}} assumes {{its most}} stable α form {{which has a}} hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a <b>double-hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure {{similar to that of}} α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.|$|R

Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C).

The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} resistivity of praseodymium-cerium (Pr-Ce) and lanthanum-cerium (La-Ce) alloys {{has been studied}} in the temperature range 1. 3 - 1100 K and 0 - 900 C respectively. The present data have confirmed {{the existence of a}} conventional Kendo divergence at T = 0 K in <b>double-hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> Pr-Ce alloys. In addition to this, evidence has been found of structure at about 20 K and 90 K. This is tentatively ascribed to the presence of Kondo sidebands of the type discussed by Maranzana. These Kondo sidebands are related to the cerium crystalline electric field levels expected in the Pr-Ce alloys on the basis of Rainford's (1971) crystalline electric field parameters for pure praseodymium. Evidence has also been obtained, under certain conditions, for the existence of antiferromagnetic ordering in the alloys at around 26 K. In connection with the structural properties, the dhcp →← fee phase transition in the Pr-Ce alloys and the absence of this transition in pure praseodymium have been discussed on the basis of {{electrical resistivity}} and X-ray powder diffraetion data.

5000|$|Roger Burrows {{worked with}} Dr. Ensor Holiday, of Guy's Hospital, London, {{in the early}} 1970s, {{developing}} a set of geometric patterns called Altair Designs. Altair Designs were variations of a unique and unusual Islamic design constructed on an arrangement of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> of circles, with variation in circle sizes. The design variations {{were found to have}} unique visual properties and served to stimulate the visual imagination. Altair Designs were originally published by Random House as colouring books for both adults and children under the Altair Design name. Burrows began developing, in the late 1960s, a dynamic geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres of different sizes where spheres change size and move from one unique <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> arrangement to another, creating unique three-dimensional forms.

Burrows redrew all of the original Altair designs for Wooden Books published in 2009.
