25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as it is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E

Julie Rosato of Mania praises the art of Glass Wings, though she notes that the [...] "crammed pages {{made it hard to}} enjoy the character detail and almost impossible to appreciate the various emotional dynamics." [...] She criticizes the Tsubaki plotline as [...] "disjointed" [...] and the conflicts as [...] "un-relatable" [...] because of the [...] "fantastical-horror angle". She states that [...] "too much about this book moves too fast, and with too little emotional impact", leaving the reader without concern for the characters, and therefore unaffected by the stories' tragic ends. School Library Journals John Leighton states that [...] "the artwork is overdone with each figure too stylized and each article of clothing bejeweled to the max." [...] He concludes that Glass Wings [...] "has promise but never really takes off." [...] Wilma Jandoc and Jason S. Yadao, writing for Honolulu Star-Bulletin, noted it [...] "offers such a visual overload that it's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> track of what's happening" [...] and that it [...] "is difficult to discern the flow of action".

40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} the structures, stabilities and {{electronic}} properties of Si n Li (n= 1 - 10) clusters were {{carried out by the}} density functional theory (DFT).

The binding energies indicate that the stabilities of Si n Li clusters can be enhanced by adsorption of lithium atom. Additionally, lithium atom binding energies show that the interaction between lithium atom and silicon cluster increases as decreasing the cluster size, which is an important factor for the amorphization process upon lithiation of the silicon based anode materials for Li-ion batteries.

40|$|There is a {{fundamental}} logic underlying the idea of assessment that is surprisingly <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grasp but even <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> sight of when implementing an assessment program. That logic suggests that first you should clearly identify what {{you are trying to}} accomplish (goals/objectives). Second, you measure outcomes to determine the degree of success the program is having at achieving the objectives. Third, you examine the program process to try to identify the variables responsible for any identified weaknesses or noteworthy strengths and make indicated adjustments to the program. Finally, you collect follow-up data to see if the adjustments eliminated the weaknesses. Note that in this often cited but seldom followed assessment sequence, the examination of process variables follows the measurement of outcomes. Process variables derive their meaning from their relationship to known outcomes. Yet the tendency to focus on process variables as indicators of quality has a long history in assessment and program evaluation. This reliance on process requires one to assume a relationship between the process variable [...] - say percent of program faculty with doctoral level degrees [...] - and program outcomes [...] - say student scores on a standardized test. Such assumptions are rarely justified. However, since process variables are usually <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> measure, present less threat to program staff and are, after all, what faculty deal with on a day to day basis, this tenacious, though illogical, practice persists. Processes Do Not Equate to Outcome...|$|R
