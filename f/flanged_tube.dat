He {{had his own}} workshop where he designed and made many surgical instruments, {{with the aim of}} improving existing operative procedures. His inventions included: a <b>flanged</b> <b>tube</b> to overcome obstructions in the gullet, a steam cautery to sterilize and clean breaking-down tumours and ulcers on the skin, and a craniotome to open the skull in brain operations.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{documented}} {{that the presence of}} even a few air bubbles in water can signifi- cantly alter the propagation and scattering of sound. Air bubbles are both naturally and artificially generated in all marine environments, especially near the sea surface. The abil- ity to measure the acoustic propagation parameters of bubbly liquids in situ has long been a goal of the underwater acoustics community. One promising solution is a submersible, thick-walled, liquid-filled impedance tube. Recent water-filled impedance tube work was successful at characterizing low void fraction bubbly liquids in the laboratory [1]. This work details the modifications made to the existing impedance tube design to allow for submersed deployment in a controlled environment, such as a large tank or a test pond. As well as being submersible, the useable frequency range of the device is increased from 5 - 9 kHz to 1 - 16 kHz and it does not require any form of calibration. The opening of the new impedance tube is fitted with a large stainless steel flange to better define the boundary condition on the plane of the tube opening. The new device was validated against the classic theoretical result for the complex reflection coefficient of a tube opening fitted with an infinite flange. The complex reflection coefficient was then measured with a bubbly liquid (order 250 micron radius and 0. 1 - 0. 5 % void fraction) outside the tube opening. Results from the bubbly liquid experiments were inconsistent with <b>flanged</b> <b>tube</b> theory using current bubbly liquid models. The results were more closely matched to unflanged tube theory, suggesting that the high attenuation and phase speeds in the bubbly liquid made the tube opening appear as if it were radiating into free space.

40|$|In {{the physics}} lessons on waves and {{resonance}} phenomena {{in high school}} and college, we usually consider sound waves in a tube with open or closed ends ResnikHalliday.

40|$|Several {{factors have}} led to the current {{epidemic}} of surgery for glue ear in children, including the widespread introduction of audiometry; greater recognition of the presence of fluid in the middle ear by general practitioners; the availability of more otolaryngologists; and technical advances such as the availability of antibiotics to treat postoperative infections and of <b>flanged</b> tympanostomy <b>tubes</b> (grommets). The need of surgeons to fill the vacuum caused by the {{decline in the number of}} adenotonsillectomies, and the fact that a diagnosis of glue ear legitimises the continued use of these operations, may also have contributed to the increase. Finally, glue ear may provide parents with a medical explanation of their children's poor educational performance, as the term dyslexia did in the past. The high social and public costs of this operation demand a reappraisal of its increasing use...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{hypothesis}} that ventilation of emphysematous lungs would {{be enhanced by}} communication with the parenchyma through holes in the pleural surface was tested. Methods: Fresh human lungs were obtained from patients with emphysema undergoing lung transplantation. Control human lungs were obtained from organ donors whose lungs, for technical reasons, were not considered suitable for implantation. Lungs were ventilated through the bronchial tree or transpleurally via a small hole communicating with the underlying parenchyma over which a <b>flanged</b> silicone <b>tube</b> had been cemented {{to the surface of}} the lung (spiracle). Measurements included flow-volume-time curves during passive deflation via each pathway; volume of trapped gas recovered from lungs via spiracles when no additional gas was obtainable passively from the airways; and magnetic resonance imaging assessment of spatial distribution of hyperpolarised helium (3 He) administered through either the airways or spiracles. Results: In emphysematous lungs, passively expelled volumes at 20 s were 94 % greater through spiracles than via the airways. Following passive deflation from the airways, an average of 1. 07 litres of trapped gas volume was recoverable via spiracles. Regions were ventilated by spiracles that were less well ventilated via bronchi. Conclusions: Because of the extensive collateral ventilation present in emphysematous lungs, direc...|$|R
