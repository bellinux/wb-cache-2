5|$|On 11 September, the {{division}} {{returned to the}} line near Gouzeaucourt; the Germans had dug in along a ridge line from Épehy to Trescault intending to delay the British from reaching the <b>Hindenberg</b> Line. The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the Battle of Épehy was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, William Allison White earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing the gun. In a third action, White led a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt. The battle cleared the German outposts {{in front of the}} Hindenburg Line, preparing the way for future operations. On 20 September, {{the division}} was pulled off the line for a period of rest.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation and expansion. As {{a part of this}} process, the 9th Battalion provided a cadre of experienced personnel to the newly formed 49th Battalion. In March 1916, the battalion sailed to France as the AIF's infantry divisions were transferred to the Western Front. On arrival, the 9th Battalion deployed to the Somme, experiencing its first major action at Pozières in July 1916, where Private John Leak earned the Victoria Cross. Following this, the 9th Battalion moved to the [...] Ypres sector, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme where they manned the trenches throughout the winter.

50|$|He {{was born}} Basil George Cameron <b>Hindenberg</b> in Reading, Berkshire, England, {{the son of}} a German {{immigrant}} family. He took up the violin at age 8, and later studied for four years at the Berlin Hochschule. He began his violin career studying with Joseph Joachim and Leopold Auer, later joining the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1912, <b>Hindenberg</b> began conducting at the seaside resort of Torquay. In 1914, at the start of World War I, it was considered less than ideal in England to bear such a Germanic-sounding name as <b>Hindenberg,</b> so the family name was discreetly dropped and he adopted his third name, Cameron, as his professional surname. (Various sources have suggested that the name <b>Hindenberg</b> had initially been adopted because German-sounding conductors could find work more easily than English ones could. It has also been suggested that the name Cameron was his mother's maiden name. Both of these assertions are incorrect.) He led festivals of Wagner and of Richard Strauss with the Torquay orchestra, which brought him to prominence in the English musical scene.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hindenberg</b> was mentored by Christian Fürchtegott Gellert, {{a popular}} {{lecturer}} in Leipzig who introduced <b>Hindenberg</b> {{to a student}} named Schönborn. Schönborn's interest in mathematics influenced Hindenburg {{to go into the}} field as well. He obtained a master's degree from the University of Leipzig in 1771 and was made Privatdozent in the same year. Hindenberg's first published mathematical publication, Beschreibung einer ganz neuen art, nach einem bekannten Gesetze fortgehende Zahlen durch Abzahlen oder Abmessen bequem und sicher zu finden, originated as a project to extend then-existing prime tables up to 5 million. In the book, he mechanically realizes, independent of the work done by Felkel, the sieve of Eratosthenes, which he then proceeds with rules to both optimize and organize. The book also contained results in linear diophantine analysis, decimal periods, combinations, and gave combinatorial significance to the digits of numbers written in decimal notation.|$|E
5000|$|At the July 1932 elections, the Nazis {{became the}} largest {{party in the}} Reichstag. Hitler withdrew his support for Papen and demanded the chancellorship. <b>Hindenberg</b> refused. In return, the Nazis {{approached}} the Centre Party to sound out a coalition but no agreement was reached. Papen dissolved Parliament, and the Nazi vote declined in the November Election. <b>Hindenberg</b> appointed Schleicher as chancellor, whereupon the aggrieved Papen opened negotiations with Hitler, and came to an agreement. Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor on January 30, 1933, in a coalition arrangement between the Nazis and the Nationalist-Conservatives. Papen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinets, falsely believing he could [...] "tame" [...] Hitler. Initially, Papen did speak out against some Nazi excesses and only narrowly escaped death in the Night of the Long Knives, whereafter he ceased to openly criticize the Hitler government. German Catholics met the Nazi takeover with apprehension, as leading clergy had been warning against Nazism for years. A threatening though at first sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany commenced.|$|E

5000|$|The Marcher electors, vassals of the Holy Roman Empire, were since 1618 also ruling as Dukes of Prussia as vassals of Poland. After Prussia had regained its souzerainty from Poland in 1657, the dukes {{upgraded}} {{themselves to}} Prussian king in 1701. With kings ranking higher than electors {{the name of}} that foreign country and the royal title started being used even for the rulers' possessions within the Empire. In 1709 the Banzendorf church was officially downgraded to an affiliate of the Dierberg church. By a reform of the local jurisdiction Banzendorf became the seat of a local court (Schulzengericht) presided over by the Schulze. In 1748 and 1753 Banzendorf, like all agriculture in the area, suffered from misharvests with potatoes. Banzendorf's Schulze Ernst Christian Köhler, who had been granted the licence to develop and settle the new neighbouring village of <b>Hindenberg,</b> was sued for having brewed beer and sold it along with liqueurs between 1754 and 1759, which he would have only been allowed to do after having completed the settling of <b>Hindenberg.</b> The immediate liege lord of the Banzendorf peasants was the respective ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia.|$|E
50|$|During the pontificate of Pope Pius XI (1922-1939), the Weimar Republic transitioned into Nazi Germany.

50|$|The 15th Cavalry Division was disbanded {{in favor}} of fielding all Infantry divisions, and in April, 1918 Read took command of the 30th Infantry Division, which he led to France.

50|$|This {{coalition}} did {{not come}} about immediately: the Centre Party's Heinrich Brüning, Chancellor from 1930-32, was unable to reach terms with Hitler, and increasingly governed {{with the support of}} the President and Army over that of the parliament.

Papen was active in the resurgence of the Harzburg Front, and had fallen out with the Centre Party. He hoped, ultimately, to outmaneuver Hitler.|$|E
