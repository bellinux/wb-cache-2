5|$|Entering the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, manager Luke Sewell was {{reluctant}} to turn Zoldak into a starter, but eventually gave him the nod. His first two starts were both victories, {{one of which was}} a complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox, which gave <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for three of the Browns' first eight wins of the season. He pitched in 35 games over the season, 21 of them starts, and ended the year with a 3.43 ERA, a 911 record, and a career-high 51 strikeouts. Unlike the previous season, Zoldak was slow to start in 1947, not winning his first game until June 22 against the Washington Senators. He finished the season similar statistically to 1946: he played in 35 games and started 19, and had a record of 9-10 and a 3.47 ERA. During the offseason, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck offered $100,000 for Zoldak, but were turned down, and he remained on the Browns to begin the 1948 season. Zoldak was projected to be the team's opening day starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, who had planned for him; instead he was used in relief and Fred Sanford was named the starter the day of the game.|$|E

25|$|With {{victory at}} the Battle of Adwa and the Italian colonial army destroyed, Eritrea was Emperor Menelik’s for the taking but no order to occupy was given. It seems that Emperor Menelik II was wiser than the Europeans had given <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for. Realizing that the Italians would bring all their force to bear on his country if he attacked, he instead sought to restore the peace that had been broken by the Italians and their treaty {{manipulation}} seven years before. In signing the treaty, Menelik II again proved his adeptness at politics as he promised each nation something for what they gave and made sure each would benefit his country and not another nation. Subsequently, The Treaty of Addis Ababa was reached between the two nations. Italy was forced to recognize the absolute independence of Ethiopia. (See Article III of the Treaty of Addis Ababa).|$|E
25|$|On {{his second}} patrol (2–28 November 1942), Brandi {{was ordered to}} the Mediterranean Sea where he was placed {{under the command of}} the 29th U-boat Flotilla. His mission in the Mediterranean theater of {{operations}} was to help secure the supply routes for the Afrikakorps in North Africa. To get to his destination Brandi had to traverse the heavily guarded Strait of Gibraltar. Brandi made the passage on 8 November 1942 submerged. Nevertheless, U-617 was discovered by a British Short Sunderland bomber which dropped two depth charges, but missed. That day, British-American forces invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch (8–16 November 1942). At 11:27 on 21 November, Brandi attacked a strong British naval task force, firing a spread of four torpedoes at distance. Following the assault, U-617 came under attack. Over four hours, 80 depth charges were dropped on U-617. At 16:00 on 23 November, Brandi unsuccessfully attacked a cruiser before arriving in La Spezia on 28 November 1942. Although no ships were actually sunk that day, the Führer der Unterseeboote Italy (FdU—Leader of U-boat Operations) later credited Brandi with the sinking of one cruiser of French or American origin, and one destroyer. Additionally the FdU acknowledged that Brandi had torpedoed two freighters, their sinking was assumed. The FdU denied <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for having severely damaged a battleship.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that Ra.One resembled a concept that he had {{developed}} several years before. Patnaik appealed to the Bombay High Court to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit. The court, observing prima facie evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit [...] with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film. However, Patnaik challenged the court's decision and demanded that the producers give <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> and not cash. Sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film's story.|$|E
500|$|Heydrich's {{time in the}} SS was {{a mixture}} of rapid promotions, reserve {{commissions}} in the regular armed forces, and front-line combat service. During his 11 years with the SS Heydrich [...] "rose from the ranks" [...] and was appointed to every rank from private to full general. He was also a major in the Luftwaffe, flying nearly 100 combat missions until 22 July 1941, when his plane was hit by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. Heydrich made an emergency landing behind enemy lines. He evaded a Soviet patrol and contacted a forward German patrol. After this Hitler personally ordered Heydrich to return to Berlin to resume his SS duties. His service record also gives <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> as a Navy Reserve Lieutenant, although during World War II Heydrich had no contact with this military branch.|$|E

500|$|Bird's {{experiments}} with his cell were {{important for the}} new discipline of electrometallurgy. [...] An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes.

[...] So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. [...] Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. [...] Bird's experiments sometimes get <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. [...] In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind electrotyping. [...] However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. [...] Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.|$|E

500|$|From 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers {{selected}} Adams {{as their}} president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-inning games. When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led {{the rules and regulations}} committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' bases should be [...] apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the [...] "bound rule", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as outs. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in The New York Times; by 1993, researcher John Thorn had written about Adams' role.

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character."

500|$|History {{views the}} results of the [...] "Tuskegee Airmen Experiment" [...] as a {{tremendous}} success, in which Parrish played a significant role, and proved that blacks could perform well in both leadership and combat roles. Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on equality of treatment and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen. Parrish was commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946 and historians generally give <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for improving morale, living conditions, relations between blacks and whites, and relations with local citizens.|$|E
