40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with an intensive examination of an island arc and <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trench</b> and its associated interior basin. The area investigated was between 10 degrees - 25 degrees N. and 53 degrees - 70 degrees W. The 1955 work was conducted from the research vessels Atlantis and Caryn and the 1956 work from the research vessels Atlantis and Bear. The instrumentation for these cruises was {{much the same as}} that for other marine seismic refraction cruises. Both cruise ships, in this investigation, were equipped to record and shoot. Both vessels made frequent bathythermograph lowerings to provide a record of ocean temperature vs. depth from the ocean surface down to a depth of 900 ft.; this information was used to compute the velocity of propagation of the direct water wave. Except for the Cayman trough in the northwestern part, the deepest water found inside the island arc of the Caribbean is in the Venezuelan basin. In some places the depth exceeds 2, 500 fathoms and in others the depth is greater than 2, 900 fathoms. The average oceanic structure is 5 km. of water, 1 km. of low-velocity sediments, and 5 km. of crustal rocks (velocity about 6. 5 km. /sec.) overlying the mantle (velocity about 1. 8 km. /sec.). The crustal structure in the deepest part was found to be similar to the oceanic structure with significant differences. The high-velocity crustal rock is not included in a single layer with the same velocity throughout, but is so constituted that the lower part has a higher velocity than the upper part. The crustal materials are thicker in general than the normal oceanic crust and thicken appreciably out from the central portion of the basin. The lower velocity materials (1. 7 - 5. 5 km. /sec.) overlying the crust are thicker than in the Atlantic basin. The authors suggest that the entire area has been extensively intruded by a differentiate migrating upward from deep in the mantle, and that the raised portions were the areas where most of the material reached the surface. The <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trench</b> resulted from the expanded Caribbean crust having been overthrust onto the oceanic crust. This overthrust depressed the high-velocity layers on the oceanic side of the arc creating the <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trench</b> and the associated negative anomaly belt...|$|E

40|$|New {{geological}} and geophysical {{data on the}} Amirante Arc, which locates to {{the south}} of the Seychelles Islands, are presented. These data were obtained by Pacific Oceanological Institute during the 33 -rd cruise of R/V Professor Bogorov in 1990. The Amirante Arc represents a seamount chain, which has submeridional strike and total length about 400 km. To the west of the Amirante Arc there are a <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trench</b> and a back-arc basin, i. e. this area is characterized by structural elements associated with the subduction zone of Western Pacific type.

This gives an opportunity to distinguish a special type of oceanic structures, i. e. non-volcanic (amagmatic) ridges.

5000|$|The Philippine Sea is a {{marginal}} sea east and {{northeast of the}} Philippines occupying an estimated surface area of [...] It {{is located in the}} western part of the North Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by the Philippine archipelago (Luzon, Catanduanes, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao) on the southwest; Halmahera, Morotai, Palau, Yap, and Ulithi (of the Carolines) on the southeast; the Marianas, including Guam, Saipan, and Tinian, on the east; the Bonin and Iwo Jima on the northeast; the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyūshū on the north; the Ryukyu Islands on the northwest; and Taiwan in the west.The sea has a complex and diverse undersea relief. The floor is formed into a structural basin by a series of geologic faults and fracture zones. Island arcs, which are actually extended ridges protruding above the ocean surface due to plate tectonic activity in the area, enclose the Philippine Sea to the north, east and south. The Philippine archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, and the Marianas are examples.

40|$|The tectonic relief on {{the focal}} regions of great shallow {{earthquakes}} in the circum-Pacific belt {{and its surrounding}} regions is discussed {{in relation to the}} generation mechanism of great earthquakes. In Part I, relationship between the tectonic relief and the occurrence of the great ･earthquake (namely the great fracture) is discussed according to aftershock locations. The result shows that a great fracture suddenly occurs in a unit area or its complex which is bounded by structural discontinuities, such as faults, ridges and trenches. In a sequential occurrence of great earthquakes, a subsequent great fracture propagates from the margin of the adjacent fractured area. In Part II, the "tectonic features of the focal regions of the great shallow earthquakes are discussed in their broader aspects. According to the result, most great earthquakes occur in the tectonically limited regions, characterized mainly by topographical depression: About 64 percent of great earthquakes continuously occurred in ocean-facing slopes of <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trenches,</b> about 26 percent occurred in local depressions, such as troughs and ends of trenches, and some singular places in tectonic structures, and only about 8 percent occurred in other tectonic areas.

50|$|Geodesy, {{also called}} geodetics, {{deals with the}} {{measurement}} and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their gravitational fields and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is {{to a large extent}} the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of vulcanism, resisted by the Earth's gravity field. These principles {{can be applied to the}} solid surface of Earth (orogeny; Few mountains are higher than 10 km, few <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trenches</b> <b>deeper</b> than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, 15 km, would develop so much pressure at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become plastic, and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly 10 km in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, Olympus Mons, is 27 km high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth geoid is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features.

30|$|Next, slab {{dehydration}} and the isotopic fractionation {{of oxygen}} and hydrogen were calculated, {{based on the}} phase relation of the subducted materials. Although oceanic sediments initially contain 10 to 30  wt% H 2 O (Plank and Langmuir 1998), most of water is liberated, decreasing to 2 to 4  wt% by extensive compaction and dehydration of minerals at depths shallower than 30  km (You et al. 1996; Hyndman and Peacock 2003; Kasahara 2003). The sedimentary column currently delivered to <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>trenches</b> is typically 50 to 500 -m thick, and sediment 350 -m-thick subducts from the Nankai Trough (Plank and Langmuir 1998). These values are 1 / 100 to 1 / 10 thinner than the AOC thickness, limiting {{its impact on the}} water budget in subduction zones. Considering these factors, although oceanic sediments still contain 1 to 2  wt% of H 2 O at depths greater than 100  km, the AOC-derived fluids are thought to be a major source that supplies deep-seated fluids to the overlying mantle wedge and the arc crust over the slab depth ranging from 30 to 100  km (Iwamori 2007), including the Arima area (Figure  1). Therefore, to simplify the model, we considered only dehydration of AOC and its phase relations for dehydration reaction (Schmidt and Poli 1998). It should be noted, however, that several key elements/isotopes such as carbon and lead, which are particularly concentrated in sediments, may have significant impacts on the fluid compositions (e.g., Sano and Marty 1995; Aizawa et al. 1999; Nakamura et al. 2008), as will be subsequently discussed.|$|R
