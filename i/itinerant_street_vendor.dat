Albert Chanel was an <b>itinerant</b> <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> who peddled work clothes and undergarments, living a nomadic life, traveling to and from market towns. The family resided in rundown lodgings. In 1884, he married Jeanne Devolle, persuaded to do so by her family who had [...] "united, effectively, to pay Albert to marry her."At birth, Chanel's name was entered into the official registry as [...] "Chasnel". Jeanne was too unwell to attend the registration, and Albert was registered as [...] "travelling". With both parents absent, the infant's last name was misspelled, probably due to a clerical error.

40|$|Tourism {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economic activities in the city of Cusco, Peru. The expectations of its potentials for economic development are high. Cusco’s local government claims that tourism is and will continue to be beneficial to the economy of the city; and the city’s inhabitants expect tourism to increase their labour opportunities. Nevertheless, the job opportunities in the formal tourism industry are limited and often require financial investments, education or skill. To get their share of the tourist pie, many Cusqueños thus resort to informal economic activities and become self-employed. This book is about a specific group of these actors of the informal economy: the <b>itinerant</b> <b>street</b> <b>vendors.</b> The <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> in the centre of Cusco work in the margins of the tourism industry, and sell souvenirs to tourists. This book reveals some of the dynamics at play in the street vendors’ livelihood opportunities. It demonstrates how <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> can capitalize on tourism. The empirical material offered in this ethnographic study deals with street vendors’ vulnerability when making a living in tourism and will give the reader an idea of the impact a global economy can have on local populations of tourist destinations...|$|R

Yet the presence of such elements {{is contrary to the}} attempts to achieve harmony and perfection of 'ideal city', and they become 'out of place' elements that need to be rejected. This thesis is about the rejection of <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> as temporary elements in the city. The great increase of <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> in many countries has inevitably changed the visual image of the cities. Their presence has continuously become the subject of debates, whether they should be maintained or banished from urban areas.

This research explores the users' evaluation towards the presence of <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> in urban places in Jakarta, Indonesia through a preference approach.

The methods combine open-ended questionnaire with a standardised rating scale to elicit the users' responses towards slides of urban scenes with <b>street</b> <b>vendors.</b> The research found that users' evaluation towards the presence of <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> as 'out of place' elements is not absolute; the <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> are not always perceived negatively by the users.

40|$|Every day, the {{recurring}} scene {{of conflict between}} <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> and municipal authorities {{can be found in}} virtually every major city around the world. Through licensing, zoning, or relocating, municipal governments devise numerous laws and ordinances to control <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> in the urban environment. Unfortunately, aggressive regulatory approaches rarely can solve the problems at stake and <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> management remains a vexing conundrum for many local governments in the developing countries. This paper uses the Taiwanese city of Hsinchu to analyze the reasons why the Hsinchu municipal government was able to successfully relocate <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> into a thriving public market in one instance (the Zhu Lian market) while unable to replicate this success in another instance (the Guan Dong market). The review of literature illustrates that <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> relocating processes face three major barriers: (1) ill-conceived location; (2) bureaucratic conformity; and (3) customer base loss. In these two cases, the <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> shared similar geographical contexts and were both relocated in situ. However, only the ZL vendors managed to overcome other relocation barriers and create a successful market, the GD vendors failed. Field work was carried out in Hsinchu city Taiwan to find out the factors contributing to the success/failure of these two relocation processes. The conclusion shows <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> organizations play a crucial role during the relocation process. They bond <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> together and bridge diverse interests, establish their own social norms and etiquette. On the other hand, even though <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> organizations may serve an efficient solution to address the relocation puzzle, the paper also points out the potential pitfalls of relying on strong vendor organizations in managing <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> in the city.

40|$|The {{fight for}} space between city administrators and <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> working in city centers {{is one of}} the major controversies about street commerce. Trying to renew and upgrade their downtowns, city administrators of most urban areas have {{attempted}} to relocate <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> from central areas to peripheries, from the streets to indoor public markets. That attempt has almost always found fierce opposition among <b>street</b> <b>vendors,</b> who claim that entering into contact with the greatest number of pedestrians is the key to successful street vending. Most scholars studying <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> have not questioned such a proposition; on the contrary, they have somehow taken it for granted. Yet, a comparison of four <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> groups [...] two located in the most accessible areas and two in less accessible areas of downtown Mexico City [...] revels that <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> with a more limited access to customers can obtained better working conditions and economic results than others who are located in most accessible areas. The following factors explain the better results of the <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> located in the less accessible areas of downtown Mexico City. First, <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> located in the less accessible areas have easier access to storage space, more room for large stalls and are less likely to have their goods confiscated by the police. (cont.) These advantages provide them the possibility to increase the scale of their commerce. Second, the possibility to increase the scale of their commerce and their limited competition for space function as an incentive to expand their network of suppliers to low-cost intermediaries [...] in this specific case with intermediaries involved in smuggling [...] and to develop <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> organizations that support their product specialization. Having very low prices and working in specialized street markets, the <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> located in the less accessible areas of downtown Mexico City attract customers despite their location. In contrast, the <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> located in the most accessible areas because of their small-scale type of commerce and because they are located in areas where street vending is officially banned but unofficially tolerated they got involved in a competition for space that constrains their profits and lead the <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> to augment their number to gain political baking. If the city government will not support <b>street</b> <b>vendors</b> located in the most accessible areas [...] in particular, if it will not act to regulate competition for space of these <b>street</b> <b>vendor</b> groups [...] <b>street</b> trading of smuggled products will remain the best alternative for Mexico City <b>street</b> <b>vendors.</b> by Bruno Nazim Baroni.
