In physics, [...] "degenerate" [...] refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents two fermionic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, <b>degenerate</b> <b>plasma</b> expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.|$|E

The disease {{is caused by a}} defect {{in the structure of the}} type-IV collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} routes lead to {{the creation}} of multi [...] scale equilibrium structures in dense <b>degenerate</b> <b>plasmas,</b> often met in astrophysical conditions. By analyzing an e-p-i <b>plasma</b> consisting of <b>degenerate</b> electrons and positrons with a small contamination of mobile classical ions, we show {{the creation of a new}} macro scale L_macro (controlled by ion concentration). The temperature and degeneracy enhancement effective inertia of bulk e-p components also makes the effective skin depths larger (much larger) than the standard skin depth. The emergence of these intermediate and macro scales lends immense richness to the process of structure formation, and vastly increases the channels for energy transformations. The possible role played by this mechanism in explaining the existence of large-scale structures in astrophysical objects with <b>degenerate</b> <b>plasmas,</b> is examined.

It has been also found that properties of planar K-dV solitons are quite different from those of nonplanar K-dV solitons.

40|$|To analyze nonidealities {{inherent}} to <b>degenerate</b> <b>plasma,</b> a quantum collective approach is developed. Thermodynamic functions {{of a system}} of partially degenerate electrons and strongly coupled ions are derived from first principles. The model takes into account the energy eigenvalues of i) the thermal translational particle motions, ii) the random collective electron and ion motions, and iii) the static Coulomb interaction energy of the electrons and ions in their oscillatory equilibrium positions. These statistical thermodynamic calculations lead to simple analytical expressions for internal energy as well as an equation of state (EOS). A dispersion relation for the high frequency branch of the plasma oscillations is introduced {{to take into account the}} partial degeneracy character and thereby to quantify temperature finiteness effects on thermodynamic properties of a partially <b>degenerate</b> <b>plasma.</b> The present results are in good quantitative agreement with the existing models.

These two terms are characterized by different oscillation frequencies (for a given wave number), and, while the "conventional" term's amplitude decays exponentially with time, the new term is characterized by a slower, power-law decay of the oscillation amplitude and is therefore dominant at large times.

For strongly degenerate electrons we obtain, for the first time, an asymptotically exact analytical solution for the heat conductivity tensor in presence of a magnetic field. This solution has considerably more complicated dependence on the magnetic field than those in previous publications, and gives several times smaller relative value of a thermal conductivity across the magnetic field at ωτ≳ 0. 8.
