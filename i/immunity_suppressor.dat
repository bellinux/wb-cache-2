40|$|The {{interference}} by BCG in {{the induction}} and {{expression of a}} specific antitumoral immune reaction was studied in B 6 mice, using the in vivo Winn assay and also active immunization. T cells immunized against MCA-induced fibrosarcoma (MC B 6 - 1) transferred together with the tumour cells protected the syngeneic host against tumour take. Pretreatment of normal B 6 mice with moderate or high doses of BCG prevented {{the development of a}} protective immune response after immunization. Moreover, a single dose of 1 mg, or 2 doses of 0. 01 mg BCG, completely eliminated an established antitumour <b>immunity.</b> <b>Suppressor</b> cells are involved in the BCG-induced inhibitory effect; they interfered (1) with the expression of the antitumour response, since their addition to immune T cells in the Winn test resulted in decreased protection and (2) with the induction of the antitumour response, since injection of spleen cells from BCG-treated mice (BCG SpC) into normal mice before immunization inhibited the development of immunity. Treatment of BCG SpC with anti Thy 1. 2 and anti Lyt 1. 2 antibodies plus complement before injection into normal mice significantly decreased the suppressive activity, showing that the suppressor cells induced by BCG are T cells expressing the Lyt 1 + phenotype. The partial increase in protection obtained after IL- 2 administration to BCG-treated mice suggests that the suppressive action of BCG SpC on the IL- 2 producing capacity of helper T cells is only {{one of a number of}} possible mechanisms of T-cell-mediated suppression...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} innate {{immune system}} senses viral infection by recognizing viral signatures and activates potent antiviral responses. Besides the interferon (IFN) response, there is accumulating evidence that RNA silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) serves as an antiviral mechanism in mammalian cells. Mammalian viruses encode IFN antagonists to counteract the IFN response in infected cells. A number of IFN antagonists are also capable of blocking RNAi in infected cells and therefore serve as RNA-silencing suppressors. Virus replication in infected cells is restricted by these innate antiviral mechanisms, which may kick in earlier than the viral antagonistic or suppressor protein can accumulate. The yield of virus vaccines and viral gene delivery vectors produced in mammalian producer cells may therefore be suboptimal. To investigate whether blocking of the innate antiviral responses in mammalian cells leads to increased viral vector production, we expressed a number of <b>immunity</b> <b>suppressors</b> derived from plant and mammalian viruses in human cells. We measured that the yield of infectious human immunodeficiency virus- 1 particles produced in these cells was increased 5 - to 10 -fold. In addition, the production of lentiviral and adenoviral vector particles was increased 5 - to 10 -fold, whereas Sindbis virus particle production was increased approximately 100 -fold. These results can be employed for improving the production of viral gene transfer vectors and viral vaccine strain...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{surgical}} removal of the meth A fibrosarcoma from its semisyngeneic host fails to result in postexcision immunity to growth of a tumor implant unless the host already has acquired a mechanism of concomitant immunity to growth of an implant. Therefore, tumor excision does not cause immunity to be generated but preserves a mechanism of concomitant immunity that already exists and which otherwise would eventually undergo down-regulation {{under the influence of}} suppressor T cells. Removal of the tumor after it has grown large enough to cause the T cell-mediated suppression of concomitant immunity does not result in the reemergence of immunity. Instead, the host remains unable to generate concomitant immunity to a second tumor {{for a long period of}} time and retains, for at least 31 d, suppressor T cells able to passively transfer suppression to appropriate recipients. Like the suppressor T cells responsible for active suppression of concomitant <b>immunity,</b> the <b>suppressor</b> T cells responsible for "memory" suppression are of the Ly- 1 + 2 - phenotype. The results indicate that progressive tumor growth results in a state of immunological tolerance of tumor-specific, transplantation antigens that can persist in the apparent absence of tumor antigens...|$|R
40|$|Suppressor T {{cells have}} been shown to be much more {{radiosensitive}} than other lymphoïd cells, and we have tried to reduce tumor growth by low-dose irradiation. Syngeneic DBA/ 2 mice received whole-body irradiation (150 rads; 1 rad = 0. 01 J/kg) 6 days after P 815 tumor inoculation. Tumor growth is significantly reduced in mildly irradiated mice. We also attempted to reduce syngeneic tumor growth by raising <b>immunity</b> against <b>suppressor</b> T cells in two different systems. DBA/ 2 mice were immunized against splenic T cells collected after disappearance of cytotoxicity and then injected with P 815 tumor cells. These mice develop a very high primary cytotoxicity against P 815 cells. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were immunized against blastic suppressor T cells, before injection of T 2 tumor cells. Some of these mice reject the tumor and other develop smaller tumors than control mice. These results could be explained by the induction of antiidiotypic activity directed against the immunological receptors of suppressor T lymphocytes, because immunization with blastic suppressor T cells from mice bearing the T 2 tumor does not modify the growth of another tumor, T 10...|$|R
40|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{contribute to the}} progression of inflammatory-fibrotic lesions of atherosclerosis. Although platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -B has been investigated as a stimulant of smooth muscle cells in vascular diseases, its effects on the immune response during disease have not been evaluated in vivo. We used hematopoietic chimeras generated after lethal irradiation of ApoE−/− recipients to test the role of PDGF in atherosclerosis. Monocyte accumulation in early atherosclerotic lesions increased 1. 9 -fold in ApoE−/−/PDGF-B−/− chimeras. Lymphocytes from null chimeras showed a 1. 6 - to 2. 0 -fold {{increase in the number}} of activated CD 4 + T cells and a 2. 5 -fold elevation of interferon-γ-secreting CD 4 + T cells on ex vivo challenge with modified low-density lipoprotein. Splenocyte transcript levels were also altered with a twofold decrease in interleukin- 10 and 1. 7 - and 3. 0 -fold increases in interleukin- 18 and CCR 5, respectively. These cellular and molecular changes were consistent with a shift to a proinflammatory phenotype in null chimeras. Our data also demonstrated for the first time the presence of a recently discovered family of negative regulators of innate {{and adaptive}} <b>immunity,</b> the <b>suppressors</b> of cytokine signaling (SOCS), in developing atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, our studies identify two independent negative immune regulatory pathways—PDGF-B and SOCS—that may help limit lesion expansion...|$|R
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} {{is characterized}} by Th 2 -dominant immunity. Recently many intracellular molecules {{have been reported to}} regulate cytokine expression and T cell differentiation. GATA- 3 and T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) are transcription factors that {{play a critical role in}} the development of Th 2 and Th 1 <b>immunity,</b> respectively. <b>Suppressor</b> of cytokine signalling (SOCS) - 3 and SOCS- 5, are negative regulators of the cytokine signalling induced by IL- 12 and IL- 4, respectively. Txk is a transcription factor that activates IFN-γ gene directly. The present study was designed to identify intracellular molecules that are responsible for the pathogenesis and the imbalance of cytokines in atopic dermatitis. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells without any stimulation the levels of mRNA for GATA- 3 and SOCS- 3 were elevated, the levels of mRNA for Txk were depressed and the levels of mRNA for T-bet and SOCS- 5 were comparable in patients with atopic dermatitis as compared with healthy controls. In addition, successful therapy normalized levels of mRNA for GATA- 3 and Txk, although those for the others including IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 13 and IFN-γ did not change. Levels of Txk mRNA correlated with those of IFN-γ, while the mRNA levels of the other regulators did not correlate with those of any of the cytokines. These results suggest GATA- 3 and Txk might be involved in skin lesions, while SOCS- 3 might be associated with an imbalance of cytokines that is difficult to normalize in atopic dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Infection with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), a gammaretrovirus in the Retroviridae family, {{can result}} in {{immunosuppression}} and subsequent increased susceptibility to secondary infections. The effects of REV infection on expression of mRNA for cytokine genes in chickens have not been completely elucidated. In this study, using multiplex branched DNA (bDNA) technology, we identified molecular mediators that participated in the regulation of the immune response during REV infection in chickens. Cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression levels were evaluated in the {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). Expression levels of interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10, IL- 13 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α were significantly up-regulated while interferon (IFN) -α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 3, IL- 15, IL- 17 F, IL- 18 and colony-stimulating factor (CSF) - 1 were markedly decreased in PBMCs at all stages of infection. Compared with controls, REV infected chickens showed greater expression levels of IL- 8 in PBMCs 21 and 28 days post infection. In addition, REV regulates host <b>immunity</b> as a <b>suppressor</b> of T cell proliferative responses. The results in this study will help us to understand the host immune response to virus pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Cigarette smoking {{has reached}} {{epidemic}} proportions within many {{regions of the}} world and remains the highest risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Squamous cell lung cancer (SCC) is commonly detected in heavy smokers, where risk of developing lung cancer is not solely defined by tobacco consumption. Although therapies that target common driver mutations in adenocarcinomas are showing some promise, they are proving ineffective in smoking-related SCC. Since COPD is characterised by an excessive inflammatory and oxidative stress response, this review details how aberrant innate, adaptive and systemic inflammatory processes can contribute to lung cancer susceptibility in COPD. Activated leukocytes release increasing levels of proteases and free radicals as COPD progresses and tertiary lymphoid aggregates accumulate with increasing severity. Reactive oxygen species promote formation of reactive carbonyls that are not only tumorigenic through initiating DNA damage, but can directly alter the function of regulatory proteins involved in host <b>immunity</b> and tumor <b>suppressor</b> functions. Systemic inflammation is also markedly increased during infective exacerbations in COPD and the interplay between tumor-promoting Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and Interleukin- 17 A are discussed. SAA is also an endogenous allosteric modifier of the FPR 2 receptor expressed on immune and epithelial cells, and the therapeutic potential of targeting this receptor is proposed as a novel strategy for COPD-lung cancer overlap...|$|R
40|$|Immunization {{of adult}} BALB/c mice with 1 {{microgram}} cholera toxin (CT) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced both humoral (IgG and IgA) and cell-mediated (DTH) immunity. Although an immunopurified, formalinized, cholera toxoid (TD) in CFA was {{inferior to the}} native holotoxin at inducing antitoxin antibodies, both cholera-derived antigens were equally immunogenic for specific DTH. When mice were fed either 1 microgram CT or 5 microgram TD 1 week before immunization, the induction of DTH was inhibited but the development of specific antibody {{was the same as}} in sham-fed controls. A feed of 10 micrograms CT not only suppressed the induction of DTH but also enhanced the IgG antitoxin responses measured 1 week after immunization. A dose of TD (50 micrograms), with a similar cholera toxin B subunit content, also induced oral tolerance for DTH but had no effect on the subsequent development of humoral immunity. The smallest doses of CT or TD fed (0. 1 microgram and 0. 5 microgram, respectively) failed to affect the development of either limb of the systemic immune response. These results suggest that oral tolerance for DTH is not consequent upon the metabolic actions of CT but that stimulation of systemic antibodies after enteric administration may be. Pretreating mice with cyclophosphamide (Cy) (100 mg/kg) before feeding CT abrogated the induction of oral tolerance for DTH but had no effect on humoral <b>immunity,</b> suggesting that <b>suppressor</b> T cells may be responsible for the induction of oral tolerance in these animals...|$|R

INFLUENCE OF IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA ON THE FORMATION OF SYSTEMIC IMMUNITY IN CHILDREN N. V. Banadyha SHEI “Ternopil State Medical University by I. Ya. Horbachevsky, Ministry of Health of Ukraine”, Ternopil, Ukraine Abstract Purpose: to evaluate the functional status of the immune system in children of various age with diagnosed {{iron deficiency}} anemia. Patients and methods. The study involved 106 children under the age of 3 years with diagnosed {{iron deficiency anemia}} (IDA). Were analyzed thoroughly factors of development of sideropenic conditions and probable immunodeficient disease. Activity of systemic immune response development in children with anemia was monitored by indexes of cellular (T-, B-lymphocytes) and humoral immunity (Ig A, M, G). Results. In young children with IDA was founded significant reduction in the total number of T- lymphocytes (CD 3 +), CD 22 +, CD 16 +, CD 4 + and CD 8 +, compared with values of the control group, both as in the case of presence of an infectious inflammatory disease, and in the case of its absence. Also was diagnosed decreasing of absolute and relative amount of T- lymphocytes and their subpopulations, and that indicated to some extent of reduction of both helper and suppressor activity of cellular immunity. Analyzis of immunoglobulins values in the serum of patients with IDA without any concomitant acute infectious disease showed specific dysimmunoglobulinaemia, which was associated with significantly low levels of IgG, IgA, and normal values of Ig M. However, in the case of IDA, combined with acute respiratory disease, was tracked significant increasing in Ig A and Ig M values, with decreased level of IgG. Significant difference between level of immunoglobulin A (p < 0. 05) and M with the same indexes of the group of children without any acute disease indicates for the activation of the humoral response while presence of infectious pathology. Conclusions. In young children with IDA was founded significant reduction in the total number of T- lymphocytes and their subpopulations, and that indicated reduction of both helper and <b>suppressor</b> <b>immunity</b> activity, and can serve as proof of the violation in rates of physiological maturation and differentiation of the immune response. The last one is indicated by significant deficit of Ig G in children with IDA, which shows late immune start in patients with anemia, regardless of existing of some infectious disease or without it.
