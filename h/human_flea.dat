40|$|Plague, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Yersinia pestis, can spread through human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, {{little is known about}} the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14 - 19 th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that human ectoparasite vectors, such as <b>human</b> <b>fleas</b> (Pulex irritans) or body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), caused the rapidly spreading epidemics. Here we describe a novel compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346 - 1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

25|$|A 2012 {{report from}} the University of Bergen {{acknowledges}} that Y. pestis {{could have been the}} cause of the pandemic, but states that the epidemiology of the disease is different, most importantly the rapid spread and the lack of rats in Scandinavia and other parts of Northern Europe. R. rattus was present in Scandinavian cities and ports {{at the time of the}} Black Death but was not found in small, inland villages. Based on archaeological evidence from digs all over Norway, the black rat population was present in sea ports but remained static in the cold climate and would only have been sustained if ships continually brought black rats and that the rats would be unlikely to venture across open ground to remote villages. It argues that while healthy black rats are rarely seen, rats suffering from bubonic plague behave differently from healthy rats; where accounts from warmer climates mention rats falling from roofs and walls and piling high in the streets, Samuel Pepys, who described trifling observations and events of the London plague of 1665 in great detail, makes no mention of sick or dead rats, nor does Absalon Pederssøn in his diary, which contains detailed descriptions of a plague epidemic in Bergen in 1565.

40|$|Some 300 medieval texts {{containing}} {{descriptions of}} plague were examined to deter-mine the predominant {{mode of transmission}} of plague during epidemics in Europe in the 14 th and 15 th centuries. There are three major modes of transmission of plague, i. e., the rat flea, the <b>human</b> <b>flea,</b> and respiratory droplets. Each mode involves distinc-tive patterns of household infection, seasonality, clinical presentation, concomitant mortality among rodents, and risk from contact with infected persons. The patterns described in medieval texts are those of transmission by the <b>human</b> <b>flea.</b> In 1348 plague reentered European history after an absence of eight centuries. The epidemic of 1348 {{was among the most}} devastating ever re-corded, killing about one-third of the population of Europe. After 1348 the disease broke out every few years, often with savage effects. The mecha-nism by which the plague was spread has been assumed to have involved the black rat, Rattus rattus, and its flea, Xenopsylla cheopis [1, 2]. No satisfactory evidence has ever been put forward to support this contention. A minority opinion has proposed that pneumonic spread or transmis-sion by human fleas predominated in medieval Europe [3, 4]; again this idea was without much support. Each mode of transmission has unique charac-teristics. In the classical mode of plague transmis-sion, the black rat becomes infected with Yersinia pestis carried by X. cheopsis and quickly suc-cumbs. The rat flea leaves its dead host to attack a live animal, another rat if possible. The plague organism multiplies in the flea's digestive tract and blocks it. When the flea bites a new host, the pathogen is regurgitated into the victim. X. cheopis will bite humans only in the absence of its usual host. Humans are thus accidental hosts in an epizootic. This mode of transmission by the rat flea im-plies a negligible risk from contact with a single infected person in a household; human cases would tend to occur in spring and summer, when Please address requests for reprints to Dr. Stephen R.

40|$|Domestic fleas were {{collected}} in 12 villages in the western Usambara Mountains in Tanzania.

40|$|Today, in Tanzania Yersinia pestis {{apparently}} {{persists in}} sylvatic enzootic cycles, sometimes lasting for decades. Plague circulation remains undetected until an epizootic or an epidemic is observed. In 1982, Akiev wrote ‘‘The evidence available concerning plague in Africa {{indicates that the}} infection is enzootic throughout the continent and that under certain conditions cases of human plague might occur in any African country’’. This single sentence summarizes what we don’t know about plague. In fact, we still {{know very little about}} the ‘‘certain conditions’’ that favour long-term maintenance of plague in African foci. In Mbulu district for example, in northern Tanzania, a sudden plague outbreak in February 2007 reminded the Tanzanians that plague was still present, despite the fact that no plague cases had been reported since 1977. In the Lushoto district, the first recorded plague outbreak occurred in 1980. The outbreak began in a single village and rapidly spread to more than 50 villages. By 2004, 7, 603 cases had been reported from this region. There was great variation in the number of cases of plague among the villages. Although evidence of infection with Y. pestis has been observed in several wild rodent and flea species during epidemics, the actual reservoir in which the infection survives has not yet been identified. The ecology of plague and the source from which humans acquire infection are poorly understood. We compared the domestic and sylvatic ecology in villages having frequent plague outbreaks with those in villages where plague is relatively rare. In particular, we studied the prevalence of the infection in small mammals including their species composition and distribution, and the seasonal and spatial pattern of host-flea association. During this 4 years study we found no seropositive animals and no difference in sylvatic rodent and flea diversity between the two sets of villages. The reason for the differences in plague incidence between villages may not be the difference in species composition of either rodents or fleas, but rather difference in relative abundances of those rodent and flea species that possess ecological characteristics that facilitate transmission of the plague pathogen. Within affected villages, socio-cultural factors might be responsible for the observed differential plague incidence in females and different age groups recorded in the Lushoto hospital dataset. Interviews suggest that the risk of exposure to domestic fleas during daily activities is higher in children and women. Moreover, we found that Pulex irritans, the <b>human</b> <b>flea,</b> was the predominant flea species in houses and that P. irritans index was strongly positively correlated with plague frequency and with the logarithmically transformed plague incidence. These observations suggest that in Lushoto District, at the domestic level, human fleas {{may play a role in}} plague epidemiology in the domestic environment.
