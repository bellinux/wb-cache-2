25|$|In Ireland, he {{appeared}} on the first series of Tubridy Tonight, where <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a prop bookcase to inspect if the books were real. Upon reading one book, he found a photo of Mike Yarwood on one page, which he cut out and wore as a mask {{for a portion of}} the interview.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{arrived at}} Bordeaux on 14 June, {{and was given}} a new mission to go to London to discuss the {{potential}} evacuation to North Africa. He had a brief meeting with Admiral Darlan about the potential role of the French Navy. That evening, by coincidence, he dined in the same restaurant as Pétain: <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> shake his hand in silence, {{the last time they}} ever met. Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to Brittany, where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to Plymouth (he asked the skipper if {{he would be willing to}} carry on the war under British flag), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat Pasteur, with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.|$|E
25|$|Corgan, {{who grew}} {{much faster than}} his fellow students, was a strong athlete in {{elementary}} school. In {{addition to being a}} member of his Marquardt Middle School baseball team, he collected baseball cards (amassing over 10,000) and listened to every Chicago Cubs game. However, by the time he began attending Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream, Illinois, he had become only an average athlete. He decided to start playing guitar when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a friend's house and saw his friend's Flying V. Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used Les Paul knock-off. Corgan, Sr. steered his son stylistically, encouraging him to listen to Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix, but offered little other support, and the younger Corgan taught himself to play the instrument. His musical interests in his formative years included hard rock like Guts-era John Cale, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, and mainstream rock like Queen, Boston, ELO, Rush, and Cheap Trick. In high school, Corgan discovered alternative rock through Bauhaus and The Cure.|$|E

500|$|News of Fawkes's capture soon spread {{throughout}} London, including the Strand, where Christopher Wright, John Wright's brother, overheard the commotion. [...] He immediately went to Thomas, who {{was staying at}} the Duck and Drake inn. [...] As Fawkes had given his name as [...] "John Johnson", servant of Percy, {{it was for the}} latter that the government's first arrest warrant was issued. [...] Thomas guessed as much, and told Wright to go to Percy and [...] "bid him begone". [...] As the rest of those conspirators still in London fled the city, undaunted, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Westminster to try and discern what he could. [...] In author Alan Haynes's opinion, this demonstrated an impressive degree of trust in Fawkes's ability to confound his interrogators, but when Thomas heard for himself that the treason had been uncovered, he left for Huddington, stopping at his sister's house in Norbrook along the way.|$|E
2500|$|Teresa had {{received}} a protective order from a North Carolina court requiring that Syriani move out of their home and stay {{away from her and}} their four children. Around 11:20 p.m. on July 28, 1990, he drove to the house and found that Teresa was not home so he waited in the driveway. When she returned from work, he blocked her access with his van. After getting out of the van <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the car where, through an open window, he stabbed Teresa 28 times with a screwdriver, with their 10-year-old son, John, in the passenger seat. John tried to stop his father but was unable.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Bourbon Restoration, Amey {{was named}} a Chevalier of the Order of Saint-Louis in 1814 and {{appointed}} to command the 2nd Subdivision of the 2nd Military Division. On 4 March 1815, he attended a reception for Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême and his wife. A little over two weeks later <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Napoleon during the Hundred Days. For this decision he was pushed into retirement on 9 September 1815. He returned to his hometown, serving as mayor of Sélestat in 1820–1830 {{and a member of}} the district council in 1826–1830. He returned to the active list on 7 February 1831 and retired permanently from the army in 1833. He died on 16 November 1850 at Strasbourg.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, Adam {{stands alone}} in the gallery. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the TV and pushes [...] "Play" [...] as it shows {{when the two of}} them were in bed making love. He watches it over and over again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now hustle back, right off, and {{fetch the}} duke up here, {{and the new}} carpet-bags. And if <b>he's</b> <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> t'other side, <b>go</b> <b>over</b> there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Weeks later, Terry comes <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Roddy's {{and tells}} him that Debs is romantically {{involved}} with Dean. Roddy finally accepts that his romantic relationship with Debs is <b>over.</b> <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Debs', and she tells him about the baby.|$|R
2500|$|Firmus gained {{support for}} his revolt (372–375) from three of his {{brothers}} and from Mauri tribal allies that he through his family could summons to the struggle. Also attracted were the dissendent Donatist Christian churches, and anti-Roman, anti-taxation sentiment. Evidently Firmus styled himself King of Mauritania. Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the side of the}} rural dispossessed and championed their cause. Yet he was opposed by his younger brother Gildo, who remained aligned with Rome. The formidable Comes Theodosius (father of the future Emperor) led a Roman force to Africa against Firmus. The subsequent military campaign, wrote Ammianus, tore at social loyalties, [...] "disrupted the balance of power relationships in the region." [...] In the fighting that led to the defeat of Firmus, Gildo served the Romans under the Comes Theodosius.|$|E
2500|$|Bird's {{attention}} to detail was placed under scrutiny at the Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord's in 1980. Although the Saturday of this particular match had mostly pleasant sunshine, Bird and his fellow umpire, David Constant, refused to let play start because of the previous night's rain; parts of the outfield were still too waterlogged, according to the officials. Angry MCC members scuffled with Constant as he and the team captains returned to the Long Room after their fifth pitch inspection. The two captains, Ian Botham and Greg Chappell, had to intervene to protect Constant. Bird, however, {{was still on the}} pitch at the time according to his own recounting of the event in his book. When play finally started at 3:45pm, police had to escort the umpires through the Long Room and on to the field. [...] This was not the only occasion in which Bird had to stop play, despite current sunny conditions, because of previous bad weather: in the 1988 Test at Headingley against the West Indies, an overnight rainstorm caused a blocked drain to overflow with a somewhat delayed action: the pitch was fine but the bowler's run-up was slowly flooding from underneath, the water level was oozing up over Curtly Ambrose's bootlaces, and Bird's as well when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> investigate, and the umpires had to take the players off while the outfield was cleared of water.|$|E

6000|$|... "If that's the way <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> on <b>he</b> {{deserves to}} lose his wife's purest devotion," [...] said Mr Calhoun Kidd. [...] "But perhaps <b>he's</b> <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> make a row. In that case I reckon {{a man from the}} Western Sun will be on the spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turns and}} regards the girl sternly. Is she taking {{advantage}} of his being a lonely stranger, far from home and friends, <b>to</b> mock him? <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{what she calls the}} bed, and snatching off the top-most sack from the pile and holding it up, says: ...|$|R
50|$|Sandy Frink then arrives via helicopter, {{and turns}} out to be a billionaire who made his fortune from inventing a special shoe rubber. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> talk to Romy and Michele. Michele tells Sandy that he must be the most {{successful}} person in their class; Sandy responds that despite all the wealth and success he has, the one thing he doesn't have is her, and asks her to dance with him. Michele agrees, so long as Romy can dance with them too.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the {{telephone}} and spoke for a few moments. Then he laid down the receiver and returned.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the window, {{and came}} back {{directly}} with a little black paint-pot, with a brush in it.|$|E
60|$|He {{was quite}} right. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Liverpool, and {{was back in}} a {{fortnight}} with English clothes and a big salary.|$|E
50|$|Sheldon {{talks to}} Penny {{and he tells}} her that she and Leonard can always {{go back to being}} friends.

They decide to just be friends, however it is clear that neither really wants that and they quickly start kissing.|$|R
5000|$|Michael awakens in his room. He {{discovers that}} the whole {{experience}} was a fantasy. After a short tantrum, ranting at the game for his traumatic experiences, he excitedly realizes that Kyle is still alive and that nothing in the game happened in the real world. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Kimberly's and asks her out, which she replies with [...] "maybe" [...] before giving him a kiss.|$|R
5000|$|A cymbal-banging monkey toy {{also appears}} in the latest Wallace & Gromit short, A Matter of Loaf and Death. When Gromit <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Piella Bakewell's mansion, he sees what looks like his love interest, Fluffles in her box, whimpering with a blanket over her. But when <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> take the blanket off, Gromit discovers it's not Fluffles at all, Piella had tricked him by hiding a cymbal-banging monkey toy in Fluffles' bed to sound like her, whimpering.|$|R
60|$|Immediately after tea <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the church. It was choir-practice, and {{he wanted}} to try the tunes on his organ.|$|E
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{my house}} in his dog-cart with the retriever; {{and on the way}} I told him the story of Garm.|$|E

6000|$|... "That <b>he</b> must <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Lavington, and wouldn't be home till nightfall. I {{told him}} where he would find bread and cheese, and he took it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Why, the end {{is rather}} melancholy. Sir Anthony reforms, leaves off drinking, and takes to going to church everyday. He becomes a Puseyite, puts up a {{memorial}} window to the Baron, and reads the Tracts. At last <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Pope, walks about in nasty dirty clothes all full of vermin, and gives <b>over</b> his estate <b>to</b> Cardinal Wiseman.

60|$|The Colonel made {{no answer}} to this. Getting up, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the bell-cord {{at the door and}} pulled it. Jackson came in hurriedly.|$|E

5000|$|One day, Ivan Ivanovich (Ivanovich, {{as well as}} Nikiforovich, is a patronymic, not a surname) notices his friend's servant hanging {{some clothes}} out to dry {{as well as some}} {{military}} implements, especially a Turkish rifle that interests him. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Nikiforovich’s house and offers to trade it for a brown pig and two sacks of oats, but his friend is unwilling to part with it and calls Ivan Ivanovich a goose, which terribly offends him. After this, they begin to hate each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Larry Grant fixed that, and 'tisn't {{every day}} {{you can find a}} man like him. It 'most made me sick when I heard <b>he</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the rabble." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{black-and-white}} film {{opens with}} a close-up on Jimmy Porter performing on trumpet in a crowded, smoky jazz club (titles <b>over).</b> Having finished <b>to</b> a round of applause, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his friend Cliff, sitting at a front row table, but his friend waves him off in dumb-show, being more intent on winning the affections of a woman. (The real Chris Barber jazz band is visible in the background). Scenes of Jimmy walking home through the depressing streets of a Midlands industrial town (Derby) serve to give the film its overall visual context.|$|R
