40|$|We {{present the}} first missing mass {{spectrum}} of the unbound nucleus 10 He, measured at RIKEN using the <b>11</b> <b>Li(d,</b> 3 He) reaction at 50 A MeV. 10 He {{is believed to be}} a three-body 8 He+n+n resonance beyond the limit of nuclear binding. Our observation of a new decay branch, 6 He + 4 n, and of a puzzling reduction of the <b>11</b> <b>Li(d,</b> 3 He) 10 He cross section challenges this view. Moreover, our experiment shows a new trend {{in the evolution of the}} proton spectroscopic strength in Li isotopes deduced from the comparison of the (d, 3 He) cross sections on 7, 8, 9, 11 Li with theoretical predictions. We discuss new questions about physics beyond the limits of nuclear existence raised by these findings...|$|R

In this report we describe epilation using a ruby laser to treat ten patients (<b>11</b> <b>lids).</b> In six patients laser treatment was completely successful in achieving alopecia, in three patients the treatment was partly successful, and one patient was lost to follow up. In all cases ruby laser treatment was well tolerated, and there were no reported complications; thus, ruby laser treatment can be a viable and well-tolerated option for the relief of the symptoms of trichiasis...|$|R

40|$|Cheeger cut has {{recently}} been shown to provide excellent classification results for two classes. Whereas the classical Cheeger cut favors a 50 - 50 partition of the graph, we present here an asymmetric variant of the Cheeger cut which favors, for example, a 10 - 90 partition. This asymmetric Cheeger cut provides {{a powerful tool for}} unsupervised multi-class partitioning. We use it in recursive bipartitioning to detach one after the other each of the classes. This asymmetric recursive algorithm handles equally well any number of classes, as opposed to symmetric recursive bipartitioning which is naturally better suited for 2 m classes. We obtain an error classification rate of 2. 35 % and 4. 07 % for MNIST and USPS benchmark datasets respectively, drastically improving the <b>former</b> <b>11.</b> 7 % and 13 % error rate obtained in the literature with symmetric Cheeger cut bipartitioning algorithms. ...|$|R
