25|$|While {{navigating}} the Elbe about eight miles above Brunsbuttel {{she was given}} permission to proceed until Cuxhaven {{at the mouth of}} the North Sea. There was no pilot ship available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she attempted to proceed on her own along the usual channel. Tugboat men of the harbour tried to warn San Wilfridos master about the danger by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern.</b> However, at approximately four p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.|$|E

500|$|Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, ordered Task Force (TF) 12—Lexington, three heavy cruisers {{and five}} destroyers—to depart Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1941 to ferry 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers of VMSB-231 to {{reinforce}} the base at Midway Island. At this time she embarked 65 of her own aircraft, including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters. On the morning of 7 December, the Task Force was about [...] southeast of Midway when it received news of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. Several hours later, Rear Admiral John H. Newton, commander of the Task Force, received orders that cancelled the ferry mission and ordered him {{to search for the}} Japanese ships while rendezvousing with Vice Admiral Wilson Brown's ships [...] west of Niihau Island. Captain Frederick Sherman needed to maintain a continuous Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and recover the fuel-starved fighters which were on patrol. With the Marine aircraft aboard, Lexingtons flight deck was very congested and he decided to reverse the phase of the ship's electric propulsion motors and steam <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern</b> in order to launch a new CAP and then swap back to resume forward motion to recover his current CAP. This unorthodox action allowed him to maintain a continuous CAP and recover his aircraft without the lengthy delay caused by moving the aircraft on the flight deck from the bow to the stern and back to make space available for launch and recovery operations. Lexington launched several scout planes to search for the Japanese that day and remained at sea between Johnston Island and Hawaii, reacting to several false alerts, until she returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 December. Kimmel had wanted to keep the ships at sea for longer, but difficulties refueling at sea on 11 and 12 December meant that the task force was low on fuel and was forced to return to port.|$|E
500|$|Captain Richard F. J. Onslow {{relieved}} Captain Hutton on 25 May and Hermes {{continued her}} fruitless patrols. After returning from one such patrol on 29 June, {{the ship was}} ordered to leave harbour only nine hours after her arrival and to begin a blockade of Dakar as the Governor of French Senegal had declared the colony's allegiance to the Vichy French regime. On the night of 7/8 July, a boat from Hermes attempted to drop four depth charges underneath the Richelieu's stern {{in conjunction with a}} torpedo attack by the Swordfish of 814 Squadron. The boat was successful in reaching the French ship, but the depth charges failed to detonate. The torpedo attack was more successful as one of the battleship's propellers was damaged. French aircraft attacked the British forces several times in retaliation, but without success. While returning to Freetown after the attack, Hermes accidentally rammed the armed merchant cruiser HMS Corfu during a rainstorm in the dark on 10 July. The impact injured three of the carrier's crew, one of whom subsequently died of his injuries, but no one from Corfus crew was injured. The two ships were locked together so that Corfus crew could walk {{from one to the other}} when Captain Onslow ordered most of her crew to be evacuated onto Hermes. They were pulled apart by a combination of the carrier's turbines at <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern</b> and blowing of ballast tanks on board Corfu to lighten that ship forward. Hermes had crumpled the forward [...] of her bow, mostly above water, and was able to proceed to Freetown at , but Corfu had to be towed stern first to Freetown where she arrived three days later. The carrier joined a convoy to South Africa on 5 August and began repairs at Simonstown 12 days later. [...] The ship, incidentally, carried a large contingent of seconded South African personnel. The repairs were completed on 2 November and the ship arrived back at Freetown on 29 November after working up.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 March 1922, Versatile was {{steaming}} off Europa Point, Gibraltar, at 20 knots {{with other}} destroyers while British submarines practised attacks on them.

Versatile went to <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern</b> on her engines {{and put her}} helm over hard to port, but had not yet begun to answer her helm when she rammed H42 abaft the conning tower, almost slicing the submarine in half. H42 sank {{with the loss of}} all hands. An investigation found H42 at fault for surfacing where she did against instructions.|$|E

2500|$|Holloway {{operated}} his battleship {{with characteristic}} flair, recalled Rear Admiral Ralph Kirk James, {{who had been}} the maintenance officer responsible for repair work on damaged ships at Manus when Iowa arrived at that base to fix shafting problems on 25 December 1944. [...] "Jimmy Holloway was charging up the harbor with this big battleship, the biggest I'd seen, and I was getting more and more nervous." [...] Alarmed, James warned Holloway to reduce his speed before entering the drydock. [...] "'Oh no,' [...] said...He got the ship just about halfway into the dry dock when he ordered <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern.</b> The Iowa shook like a damned destroyer and stopped just where she was supposed to be." [...] Unfortunately, the backwash from the engine reversal swept away the drydock support blocks from underneath the ship, and James and his crew had to spend an extra three hours resetting the blocks before Iowa could dock. Afterward, James discovered a grey streak in his hair. [...] "I can tell you the moment it was born: when Holloway pulled his high-speed throttle-jockey stunt on me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finding {{that the}} {{propeller}} would now work, Captain Williamson gave orders for <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern.</b> As {{soon as the}} engines started there was more crashing of ice, the small stuff being ground down under the ship, and the ice of the pinnacle breaking off along the shrouds.

50|$|On 13 June 1917, McCulloch was {{steaming}} with 90 U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy personnel {{on board}} from San Pedro, California, to Mare Island Navy Yard, {{where she was}} to be fitted with larger guns for her wartime Navy service. She was proceeding cautiously in heavy fog about four nautical miles west-northwest of Point Conception, California, at 07:30 when her crew heard the fog signal of the Pacific Steamship Company passenger steamer Governor, which was southbound from San Francisco to San Pedro with 429 passengers and crew aboard. Governor′s crew also heard McCulloch′s fog signal, and Governor′s captain ordered <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern</b> and ordered Governor′s whistle to blow three times to indicate that her engines were at <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern.</b> McCulloch was off Governor′s port bow when Governor struck her on the starboard side just aft of the pilot house at 07:33, tearing a hole in McCulloch′s hull and seriously injuring one of McCulloch′s crewmen in his bunk. Governor, which suffered no casualties among her passengers and crew, took aboard all of McCulloch′s crew, and McCulloch sank 35 minutes after the collision three nautical miles northwest of Point Conception. Her injured crewman died on 16 June 1917 in a hospital in San Pedro.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, William Ward Burrows {{proceeded}} to Lunga Roads, off Kukum Point, Guadalcanal, and dropped anchor. She got underway for Tulagi Harbor that afternoon but ran hard aground on the southeast end of Sylvia Reef at 1750, only {{five minutes after}} entering the harbor channel. In {{an effort to get}} out of the predicament, William Ward Burrows rang down <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>astern</b> at 1752 and attempted to use her stern anchor as a kedge; but the ship refused to budge.

50|$|Two days later, her master, Capt. Jens G. Olsen, {{received}} the authorization to take George G. Henry south - {{provided that the}} escape be made at night. Thus, at sunset on 15 December, George G. Henry headed for the channel through the minefield that had been sown between Corregidor and the Bataan peninsula. She soon discovered, however, that the channel - supposedly lighted with three buoys - was dark. As she slowed, a strong current carried the tanker inexorably toward the deadly minefield. George G.

50|$|From Wellington to Cape Campbell {{the wind}} was a strong north westerly. At 3pm the wind swung round {{suddenly}} to a very strong south-easterly with heavy rain and fog.
