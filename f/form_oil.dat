5000|$|Kerogen (Greek κηρός [...] "wax" [...] and -gen, γένεση [...] "birth") is {{a mixture}} of organic {{chemical}} compounds that make up a portion of the organic matter in sedimentary rocks. It is insoluble in normal organic solvents because of the high molecular weight (upwards of 1,000 daltons or 1000 Da; 1Da= 1 atomic mass unit) of its component compounds. The soluble portion is known as bitumen. When heated to the right temperatures in the Earth's crust, (oil window c. 50-150 °C, gas window c. 150-200 °C, both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated) some types of kerogen release crude oil or natural gas, collectively known as hydrocarbons (fossil fuels). When such kerogens are present in high concentration in rocks such as shale, they form possible source rocks. Shales rich in kerogens that have not been heated to a warmer temperature to release their hydrocarbons may <b>form</b> <b>oil</b> shale deposits.|$|E

40|$|Within the German Collaborative Research Center 39 PT-PIESA {{the forming}} of micro {{cavities}} into aluminum sheets is one challenging task. During this forming process high forces and stresses occur {{which lead to}} a high tool wear. Hence, the actually applied cold forming process should be replaced by a warm forming process. This paper shows the tribological investigations for the warm forming process. Within the experiments the barrel compression test [1] is used to determine the friction conditions by varying the size of the cylindrically shaped samples of AlMg 4, 5 Mn 0, 7, the forming degree and the lubrication condition (dry, graphite, <b>forming</b> <b>oil).</b> The flat punches were made from hardened steel 1. 3343. The friction factor was calculated, and surface roughness was evaluated by 3 D-laser microscopy. The experiments show that the friction factor increases, especially at forming degrees below 1 and for small specimen size, compared to cold forming processes [2]. In addition to that, an influence of the lubrication condition onto the surface roughness was observed. For experiments conducted with graphite, the surface roughness is significantly higher than for samples, which were formed dryly or with <b>forming</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R
