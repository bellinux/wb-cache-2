5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the <b>decapping</b> complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E

2500|$|Removal of the primer, called <b>decapping,</b> in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and <b>decapping</b> them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] <b>Decapping</b> dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) chips, {{the amount}} of supply current per package pin is significantly more than in twodimensional (2 D) designs. Therefore, the power supply noise problem, already {{a major issue in}} 2 D, is even more severe in 3 D. CMOS decoupling capacitors (<b>decaps)</b> have been used effectively for controlling power grid noise in the past, but with technology scaling, they have grown increasingly leaky. As an alternative, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) <b>decaps,</b> with high capacitance densities and low leakage current densities, have been proposed. In this paper, we explore the tradeoffs between using MIM <b>decaps</b> and traditional CMOS <b>decaps,</b> and propose a congestion-aware 3 D power supply network optimization algorithm to optimize this tradeoff.

Decoupling capacitance (<b>decap)</b> addition is effective in reducing the power supply noise, thus making the supply network more robust in presence of large switching currents.
