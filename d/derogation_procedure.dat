40|$|In the post-September 11 world, {{debate about}} {{counter-terrorism}} is often characterised as an argument between ‘the realists’, who appreciate {{the need for}} tough new counter-terrorism laws, and ‘the out of touch’, who fail to take the terrorist threat seriously. John von Doussa QC argues that such characterisations are inaccurate and unproductive. There is no argument that terrorism is a gross violation of fundamental human rights. Only the misguided or the bad would suggest otherwise. We are locked in a dark and difficult struggle with {{those who seek to}} attack not just our lives, but our way of life. The government is right to take action to guard against the worst-case scenario. However, I also don’t believe anyone would seriously suggest that the threat of terrorism justifies the wholesale abandonment of the democratic rights and freedoms embedded in our legal system. The crucial challenge facing Australia, indeed all democratic nations, is how to effectively respond to the threat of terrorism without abandoning fundamental rights that are the hallmark of free and democratic societies. However, in the new 2 ̆ 7 age of terrorism 2 ̆ 7 there is a persistent and popular misconception that human rights are inflexible, esoteric principles that hamstring government efforts to respond to a new and unprecedented threat. This is simply not the case. Human rights law was forged in the wake of devastating periods of global conflict and clearly recognises the necessity of balancing the need to protect individual rights against the need to protect national security. In extraordinary circumstances, protecting national security may involve restricting fundamental rights. And human rights law already recognises this reality. If the gravity of the threat means that the Government has no other choice than to suspend or restrict certain rights then the government may be able to ‘derogate’ from some of its international human rights obligations. Fortunately, so far the Australian Government has not seen the need to invoke this <b>derogation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Rather, the government has consistently said that it recognises the need to balance counter-terrorism laws with human rights and that Australia’s counter-terrorism policies must embody the democratic values Australia seeks to protect. Striking the right balance is not an easy or mechanical task. In many cases it will depend on how the law is applied in the particular circumstances. In the last five years we have seen the introduction of a raft of counter-terrorism laws which expand the power of the executive to make decisions which may infringe people’s rights - often without corresponding checks and balances. I have always said that the government has both a right and a duty to introduce tough new counter-terrorism laws to respond to unprecedented new threats to our security. But I have also said that extraordinary new powers - like preventative detention orders, control orders and the power to proscribe terrorist organisations - need to be accompanied by adequate safeguards. Alas, too often new counter-terrorism powers have been proposed without properly considering the potential human rights implications. This is a very disappointing, because it overlooks the ability of simple safeguards - like merits review and judicial review - to guard against illegality or error, and to check that the exercise of the power is necessary and proportionate in the circumstances of the particular case. Some people might say ‘why worry about rights’, when terrorists show no regard for our rights? The answer is both principled and pragmatic - we must maintain the moral and ethical high ground. Terrorism is an ideologically and politically motivated assault on not just our lives, but our democratic rights and freedoms. Any strategy in countering extremism must promote and uphold the basic human rights and freedoms that make our way of life worth protecting. The question of how to balance individual human rights and collective security in the post-September 11 environment should be the subject of vigorous public debate. However, it is vital this debate move beyond the inaccurate and dangerous idea that we must choose between national security and human rights. Support for human rights is not a weakness in the fight against terrorism or a blindness to its evil. Human rights law enables us to respond to the dangers of the terrorism without losing sight of the very rights and freedoms that we seek to protect.

40|$|This {{evaluation}} of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores focuses on the success in accomplishing ecological, economic and social sustainability in population management {{during the period from}} 2007 to 2012, through objectives and actions in the implemented population management plans. The conclusions drawn in the evaluation are based on a logical framework which must in practice be seen as the logic behind the policy on large carnivores and associated development actions. Based on this framework, the evaluation highlighted the appropriateness, performance, efficiency and impact of the applied policy on large carnivores as well as the problems and threats of the current policy. The evaluation was performed for each species by examining the success of population management from the perspectives of ecological, economic and social sustainability. The investigation and consideration of conflicting objectives between various actors, with the view that the population management of large carnivores can be sustainably maintained, {{played a key role in}} the evaluation and, particularly, in the development proposals made. The investigation and consideration of the conflicts involved in the population management of large carnivores was in the focus of risk analysis group closely connected to the evaluation. The composition of this group varied by large carnivore species and the group deliberated over existing or potential future conflicts in the current policy on large carnivores as well as solutions for them. WOLVERINE As there is no valid population management plan in place for the wolverine, it was not possible to evaluate the success of measures taken in relation to the objectives set for them in the population management plan. However, where wolverines are concerned, a comparison was made in relation to the consultation with regional and national stakeholders that preceded the initial drafting of the population management plan. Existing research data and conflict points identified in the evaluation risk analysis also served as a point of reference. There is a long way to go towards achieving ecological, economic and social sustainability in the population management of wolverines. According to a minimum population estimate, growth in the wolverine population has been extremely moderate, and the wolverine population has been divided into two subpopulations: wolverines with habitats in the northern fells and those in the eastern forests. Specifying the size of the wolverine population is extremely challenging, and very little data has been gathered on the eastern forest wolverine. Roughly half of the wolverine population is found in the reindeer husbandry are, where it poses a great deal of economic problems. Indeed, the wolverine is the leading cause of damage to reindeer stock. Wolverine have been subjected to illegal killing and, without a population management plan or a special decree issued by the Ministry, it has not been possible to manage the wolverine population by means of a <b>derogation</b> <b>procedure.</b> There has been very little wolverine research conducted during the review period, with the primary focus being on damages to reindeer stock caused by wolverine. The lack and one-sidedness of information on wolverines have failed to meet the perceived needs of stakeholders. During the review period, damages caused by wolverine to livestock other than reindeer have been extremely minimal, primarily involving a few incidents of damage to sheep stock. On the whole, conflicts outside the reindeer husbandry area are rare, even though a nascent conflict between the wild forest reindeer and wolverines has been identified in the forest reindeer region. The biggest challenge facing wolverine population management is to put reindeer herders earning their livelihoods in regions of Fell Lapland with wolverine aggregations at the forefront of objectives and actions, thus committing them to the management of the wolverine population through rights and responsibilities. There should be a wide range of measures available, comprehensive and reliable methods for determining the population, an incentive-based damage compensation system, transplantations, derogations which are at least based on damages incurred but preferably also on population management, and other necessary financial incentives. LYNX The ecological strategic goal of lynx population management, i. e. the ecological sustainability of the lynx population, has been achieved through the application of existing population management measures. Within the reindeer husbandry area, the lynx population has shown a moderate proliferation and, in other areas of Finland, new habitats have formed together with strong, established lynx populations. At the same time, it has also been found that the ecological carrying capacity has not yet been reached. Growth in the lynx population has given rise to the use of special permits for population management, which have been allocated to achieve a more balanced distribution of regional lynx densities as well as to strengthen the economic and social sustainability of population management. Indeed, high lynx densities are precisely what cause conflicts from an economic and social sustainability standpoint. Damages to reindeer, sheep and hunting dogs as well as game taxation are substantial from an economic perspective. They also put a strain the ability of persons earning a livelihood and hunting to tolerate the presence of lynx. In the reindeer husbandry area, derogations for damages are granted for the specific purpose of preventing substantial economic damages. For many years, the touchstone of social sustainability in lynx population management has been the unreliability of the minimum population estimate for lynx. There have been challenges in determining the lynx population and an effort has been and is still being made in meeting these challenges in research and game management by developing a census method, investing in separate counts, and scaling population management derogations in order to cull regional population growth. Undoing the deep mistrust that has formed between this research and game management as well as the ‘field’ is a special challenge where all large carnivores are concerned. Unreliable lynx population estimates are also reflected in the questioning of the reliability of other large carnivore populations. A challenge in lynx population management is responding quickly to regional lynx problems. It is of the utmost importance to take the sense of insecurity and fear felt about the lynx into consideration, thus avoiding the risk of the lynx falling into disrepute as a pest. Instead, the status of the lynx as a valuable game animal should be promoted and preserved. The cornerstone of this approach is quota hunting. In recent years, population management derogations have served as an excellent tool for achieving economically and socially acceptable population management. BEAR The ecological sustainability of bear population management has been achieved by allowing the size of the bear population to grow within the dispersal zone in central parts of Finland and developing a population region in western parts of the country. Conversely, population management derogations have been used to address population growth in the reindeer husbandry area and the established population region in Eastern Finland. Finding a balance has been a challenge and, particularly in the dispersal zone, bear densities have been created. A local bear presence is revealed by the damage caused by bears. Bears are the biggest cause of damage to sheep stock and, of all the large carnivores, they are the only ones that cause damage to honeybees and crops. In order to improve the economic sustainability of bear population management, electrified fencing, among other things, has been erected to protect property. From a social sustainability standpoint, bears pose a challenge due to their large size and the sense of fear and insecurity this brings with it. The development of new surveying methods and, particularly, the SRVA (“official assistance in large game matters”) founded during the review period to provide official assistance in large game matters have contributed to the expulsion and killing of bears, especially those attempting to enter populated areas. Where bears are concerned, humans have a completely different concept of property than with other large carnivores. Bears are a major form of prey, and bear hunting has centuries-old traditions. Even today, bear hunting is based on derogations for population management, with derogations for damages being granted in very few cases. Bear hunting is also a team effort, with the use of hunting dogs adding a special nuance to the hunting experience. Regional and local bear ownership is evident in situations where there has been no desire to use all possible derogations for population management in a region with an established population. Responsibility is assumed for growth in the bear population, thus engendering a sense of regional ownership. Furthermore, suspected cases involving the illegal killing of bears are reported to the police with far greater frequency than the suspected illegal killing of other large carnivores. This might be an indication of the fact that the illegal killing of bear falls clearly outside the boundaries of what is considered the common good and there is no support for such activities. The challenge facing bear population management is to keep ecological, economic and social acceptance in balance, so that all these factors can be realised from a regional standpoint. This requires greater trust between research and game management as well as the ‘field’. However, there is positive development where bears are concerned, which is expected to continue into the future with the current array of actions in place. WOLF An unprecedented collapse in the ecological sustainability of the wolf population has been found. After the population management plan entered into effect, the wolf population for the entire country reached its peak in 2007, but has declined since then. The largest single collapse in the wolf population occurred in 2010, and the lowest population level was recorded in 2013, with a minimum population estimate of 120 individuals. This collapse in the wolf population has led to a situation whereby no derogations for population management have been granted for wolves – instead, all population management has been carried out through derogations for damages. The criteria for granting the derogations in question have been found to be challenging, with the capacity utilisation of granted derogations remaining low. Regulations on the killing of large carnivores provided for under the Police Act are applied in situations where human safety is threatened. This in itself has led to a situation where the value of wolves as prey animals has been taken away and the species is seen almost exclusively as a pest with which it is difficult to occupy the same area. In addition to ecological sustainability, the social sustainability of the wolf population has also collapsed. Local residents feel that they have no influence over managing their livelihoods or daily routines. The presence of wolves instils a sense of fear and insecurity. Wolves are the biggest cause of damages to hunting dogs, thus making hunting more difficult throughout Finland. This is seen as a problem of social acceptability. There is a deep mistrust between the field and research and game management. These differences have made the monitoring of the wolf population more difficult, also due to a failure to report follow-up observations and difficulty in tagging. The withholding of information on wolf observations also calls into question the minimum wolf population estimates. Questioning the position and knowledge of this research has created a situation in society where there is debate over who owns the correct information on wolves. Where wolf population management is concerned, there is great pressure to take active measures and make immediate adjustments. The biggest challenge facing future wolf population management is placing the rights and responsibilities of people living within wolf territories at the forefront of objectives and actions, committing them to the regional management of the wolf population through these objectives and actions. This requires complete transparency in all population management measures, from objectives to action. There should also be a wide range of measures in place, including comprehensive and reliable population management methods, population management derogations and substantial economic incentives. IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON LARGE CARNIVORES The objectives for the population management of large carnivores are set in accordance with the terms for achieving favourable conservation status, as stated in the Habitats Directive. This regulatory standard based on ecological sustainability sets the conditions for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, within which the objectives of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores together with actions taken are applied. Consequently, large carnivore management has been imposed in a top-down manner and has inevitably been lacking in terms of place-based policy. Ecological sustainability has not been based on a population-level approach, which would allow for a wider range of management measures to be taken. Local and regional views concerning the objectives and actions of the national policy on large carnivores have not influenced decision-making as desired. The multilateral conflict that arises around large carnivores is manifested in tensions between local communities, central government, rural and urban areas, laymen and researchers. The denial of national population management objectives and, on the other hand, increasing the level of mistrust between the field and the authorities and the field and researchers have made systematic population control impossible where wolves are concerned. A similar trend seems to be evolving with regard to the wolverine. The large carnivore actions taken have been called into question by citizens. People do not support large carnivore policy actions carried out by actors they do not trust. This can be seen in a lack of trust in the methods used in determining a population based on large carnivore observations and the process for granting derogations, compensations for damage and the adoption of preventive measures. Not only is the large carnivore data produced not trusted, it is also widely felt that local and regional views on the objectives of large carnivore population management are not reaching decision-makers. At worst, this mistrust culminates in the illegal killing of large carnivores, which is supported by a broad front. Using public law control measures, it is possible to more effectively discover illegal killing incidents and their perpetrators as well as impose harsher sentences on them. However, it is of the utmost importance to understand that the application of these enhanced measures will not influence the level of public support, which feels that illegal killing is justified. If the needs of people living in large carnivore regions are not met by public administration, they will be met by illegal actions taken in the field. The current array of actions will not achieve the set performance objectives or the large carnivore policy impact objectives unless the objectives behind these actions are changed. This change in objectives is seen as a way of gaining public approval and support for large carnivore policy measures. INTERDEPENDENCY OF ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS In large carnivore policy measures, equal consideration should be given to ecological, economic and social factors both in objectives and actions, stating the interdependency of these three perspectives. Large carnivore policy risks identified in risk analysis groups, which were used in support of this evaluation, showed a clear interdependency between the actions and processes that aim to achieve ecological, economic or social sustainability. The majority of the risks could be categorised as social risks, in addition to which some ecological and economic risks were found to have originated from a social risk phenomenon or, alternatively, could have posed social risks if the situation had remained unchanged. This demonstrates the clear social nature of the risks inherent in the current large carnivore policy, nearly half of which were considered probable and serious. The existing policy risks and problems highlighted in the evaluation have been set as objectives for the future large carnivore policy. When defining this future policy, the objective of ecological sustainability should not undermine the objective of social sustainability but should, instead, take into account the issue raised in this evaluation. According to this, exceeding the limits of social tolerance will lead to the failure of systematic population management based on an ecological objective. DEVELOPING THE OWNERSHIP OF LARGE CARNIVORES The current conservative, top-down approach to decision-making must be phased out. National, regional and local objectives and actions should be synchronised with one another. The primary goal of managing large carnivore populations must be to develop the psychological ownership of large carnivores, particularly at the local and regional level, but also at the national level. The psychological ownership of large carnivores is more effectively developed in situations where ownership involves a sense of community and responsibility. In developing psychological ownership, a sense of ownership is created through practical measures involving rights and responsibilities, thus affecting attitudes. As a natural resource, large carnivores should be considered property whose management carries with it both rights and responsibilities. Concrete responsibilities must be required and rights should be given regionally and locally, taking into account the differences specific to each species. All actions taken should be entirely transparent. Developing ownership requires trust through all structures and between actors. PLACE-BASED AND PROBLEM-BASED POPULATION MANAGEMENT When giving consideration to regional population management, regional diversity must be recognised and regional factors and needs must be taken into account. Conflicts involving large carnivores are local and depend not only on the presence of carnivores, but also on other game resources, livelihoods and infrastructure as well as cultural capital and traditions. Large carnivore policy actions should be targeted precisely, directly and quickly at local needs. Regional cooperation forums with the ability to respond quickly, along with regional or territorial population management plans, are considered key factors for problem-based solutions to large carnivore conflicts. Regional actions should stem from local needs and activate and involve local and/or regional stakeholders, depending on the species of large carnivore and the reason for the conflict. It is possible to integrate public funding and joint stakeholder volunteer work in population management actions...|$|E

40|$|Ben Saul {{assesses the}} federal government’s {{proposed}} counter-terrorism laws. THE July bombings in London again exposed {{the vulnerability of}} liberal democracies to terrorism, and quite properly motivated political leaders to reconsider Australia’s security. Appropriate proposals Some of the proposals are appropriate responses to the terrorist threat facing Australia. Strong laws against terrorist financing are required by both international treaty law and mandatory resolutions of the UN Security Council. Similarly, strong offences against aviation security are required by international treaties, although Australia has long had federal offences in this area. Giving Federal Police the power to stop, search and question a person where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting their involvement in terrorism is unobjectionable, as long as legislation does not permit blanket searches unconnected to evidence or suspicion. Measures such as deterring unattended baggage, better screening of citizenship applications, and increased use of closed circuit television may also be justified. However, these measures may face practical difficulties of implementation: people may naturally or inadvertently leave baggage unattended (and should not be penalised as a result); and CCTV historically has {{had the effect of}} shifting criminal conduct off-camera, often making it harder to police. Inappropriate proposals In contrast, it seems difficult to justify very intrusive preventative detention measures, control orders, notices to produce, extended time limits on ASIO warrants, stop, search and question powers, and higher penalties for giving false or misleading information to ASIO. These proposals are considered in detail below. Other proposals are still too vague to meaningfully comment on - how exactly will federal terrorism offences be ‘clarified’? The Australian definition of terrorism is already very broad compared with the European Union definition, and attempts to broaden it further cannot be supported, particularly since it triggers exceptional powers. The comparative legal context A striking feature of the legislative proposals announced by the prime minister {{is the extent to which}} they borrow ideas from other countries, particularly the UK and the US. While there is nothing wrong with learning from others, there is a danger in selectively transplanting laws from legal systems which are very different from our own. While Australia inherited British common law, the last decade saw an increasingly wide divergence between Australian and British law. Since the adoption of the UK Human Rights Act in 1998, human rights principles now permeate British law in ways unknown in Australia, not least in controlling excessive responses to terrorism. The British courts can independently supervise the impact of terrorism laws on the rights and freedoms of people in Britain - whether citizens or foreigners. For example, in 2004 the House of Lords found that the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists was unjustifiably discriminatory because it targeted only foreigners (A v Home Secretary). Human rights law does not prevent effective responses to terrorism, since it allows rights to be limited or suspended if necessary to protect other social values, including security. Indeed, the UK courts have accepted the government’s view that terrorism is a serious threat which may justify temporarily suspending some human rights (A v Home Secretary). At the same time, human rights law does ensure that governments are held to account for restrictions they place on rights, so that they do not abuse their power under the guise of protecting security. It provides a principled framework for evaluating terrorism laws, ensuring they are strictly necessary and proportionate to the threat. In the absence of similar rights protections in Australia, parliament should proceed carefully before agreeing to further terrorism laws. Preventative detention Australia has already given ASIO wide powers to question and detain for up to seven days people who are not even terrorist suspects, while the Federal Police may hold terrorist suspects for an extended period of 24 hours. In this light, it is difficult to see how the power of preventative detention is necessary, unless the intention is to indiscriminately detain whole groups of people (such as Muslims) in the absence of reasonable suspicion or evidence of terrorism. ASIO has seldom used its existing powers - detaining no one in the last year, and questioning only three suspects (according to its annual report). Further, the terrorism threat level in Australia has been constantly set at ‘medium’ since 2001, which, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Committee, means only that a terrorism attack ‘could’ occur. Terrorism ‘could’ have occurred in Australia ever since the rise of modern terrorism in the 1960 s, yet never before have such exceptional powers been considered necessary. The proposals for federal preventative detention for 48 hours in a ‘terrorism situation’, and preventative detention for up to fourteen days in the states and territories, are seriously flawed. The government claims that they are based on UK legislation, but that seriously misrepresents the British position. Police in the UK can detain terrorist suspects for up to fourteen days in exceptional cases, but they have no power of preventative detention in a more general ‘terrorist situation’, and certainly no power to detain non-suspects. Control orders If the proposed control orders are to be based on the British law adopted in 2005, that is a cause for concern. The British law only permits the courts to review a (non-derogating) control order if it is ‘obviously flawed’, signalling that the courts are expected to defer to the government’s judgment, greatly limiting independent judicial supervision. In addition, the types of restrictions that can be placed on a person under British law are very extensive. At the same time, British law distinguishes between control orders that suspend human rights and those that do not, with greater judicial protections attaching to the former. In contrast, Australia lacks a human rights framework (including independent external supervision by the European Court of Human Rights), so it is unlikely that our law would be as sophisticated. Australia risks depriving individuals of their liberty without such measures conforming to the <b>derogation</b> <b>procedures</b> of human rights law in emergencies. Moreover, there is little evidence that Australia faces the kind of ‘public emergency threatening the life of the nation’ which would justify suspending rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Extending ASIO warrants Tripling the length of ASIO search warrants from 28 days to three months, and mail warrants from 90 days to six months, cannot be justified. Reasonably short time limits on warrants are designed to ensure that warrants are not abused by the authorities to conduct fishing expeditions over extended periods, where there is little evidence of criminal activity. Notices to produce Allowing the Federal Police to issue notices to produce information that may assist with the investigation of terrorism ‘and other serious offences’ goes far beyond police powers in the UK, where provisions are limited to the sharing of information between government agencies. The Australian proposal would extend to private groups or companies, as well as institutions such as libraries. One student at Monash University already received an unwelcome visit from ASIO officers merely for borrowing a library book about terrorism for research purposes. In this context, the wider ‘sneak and peek’ powers under the US PATRIOT Act, allowing secret searches for information, have been widely criticised. One problem is that such powers have been justified as necessary to combat terrorism, yet have been used to gather evidence about ordinary crime. This intentional overreach is evident in the Australian proposal for notices to produce, which aim to assist in investigating ‘other serious offences’. Thus exceptional powers are being manipulated for use against ordinary crime, which would otherwise be considered an impermissible intrusion on privacy and liberty. Citizenship provisions Extending the waiting period for citizenship by twelve months to three years is not, of itself, problematic, since many countries require longer periods of residency. However, characterising this proposal as a counter-terrorism measure casts unwarranted suspicion on foreigners as somehow linked to terrorism, and conflicts with Australia’s immigration aims of encouraging migrants to become citizens. Fortunately, the government has not followed up on suggestions to allow persons involved in terrorism to be stripped of their Australian citizenship. Nor has it proposed, as in the UK, that foreign terrorist suspects be deported even where they are at risk of return to a place of torture - in plain violation of international law. It has also rejected the rather ridiculous proposal to ban headscarves in schools. When this was done in France a few years ago, it soon backfired as Catholic nuns in schools found themselves required to remove their habits. Incitement to violence and advocacy of terrorism The proposal to replace the crime of sedition with a new offence of inciting violence against the community (and Australia’s armed forces) is drawn from the Gibbs Review of federal criminal law in 1991. Yet, the prime minister’s proposal tells only part of the story. The Gibbs Review recommended modernising many archaic security offences (such as treason and treachery), and the prime minister has cherry-picked part of those recommendations and taken them out of context - which had little to do with terrorism. In fact, the UK Law Commission had earlier rejected an incitement offence, as proposed by Gibbs, as unnecessary. Australia already has strong anti-vilification laws which protect groups in the community against hate speech and violence based on race, religion and so on. If the law is to criminalise support for Australia’s enemies, or incitement to violence against Australian forces, it must tread very carefully. How will Australia’s ‘enemies’ be identified? By executive certificate, to which courts must defer, or by proscription of groups? Consider the invasion of Iraq in 2003, widely regarded as unlawful under international law. A country that has been invaded is entitled to use lawful force in self-defence, and Iraqi combatants cannot be criminalised for defending their country under humanitarian law (unless they commit war crimes). Why then should Australians be criminalised for condemning unlawful violence by the Australian government, and for upholding the law of the United Nations Charter? The proposed new offence is linked to a proposal to ban groups for ‘advocating’ terrorism. Both the incitement offence and banning these groups risk criminalising legitimate expressions of political opinion, fair media comment, and academic views. The criminal law already allows the prosecution of incitement to crime, and it is a hasty and imprudent overreaction to extend the law further through these vague proposals, especially if they are aim to criminalise general statements of support for terrorism, rather than specific incitements to crime. There is also a danger that criminalising the expression of support for terrorism will force such beliefs underground. Rather than exposing them to public debate, which allows erroneous or misconceived ideas to be corrected, criminalisation risks aggravating the grievances underlying terrorism, and thus increasing, rather than reducing, the likelihood of terrorism. No sunset clause Underscoring all of the recent proposals is a further deficiency - the lack of a sunset clause. The proposals are silent on whether they are intended to be temporary emergency powers to confront specific terrorist threats, or permanent laws which can be deployed over the coming decades, regardless of the changing nature of the terrorist threat. The purpose of placing time limits on terrorism powers is to ensure that exceptional intrusions on personal liberty are strictly necessary to counter the particular terrorist threat faced, and do not exceed that threat. Powers can always be renewed before they expire if the threat still justifies the response. Conclusion The prime minister claims that the proposals reflect ‘world’s best practice’. If the government is really committed to pursuing ‘world’s best practice’, then it has every reason to adopt a national bill of rights - as in the UK. An Australian Human Rights Act would ensure that there is independent judicial scrutiny of counter-terrorism laws, to help ensure that rights and security do not tip dangerously out of balance. • Ben Saul is director of the Bill of Rights project at the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, University of New South Wale...|$|R
