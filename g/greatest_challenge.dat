5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Ape Escape lasted approximately two-and-a-half years. Shortly after the development team began conceiving {{the design and}} concept for Ape Escape, they attended a meeting regarding the {{development of}} the DualShock. Intrigued by the potential of the controller, the team implemented its use in Ape Escape, making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay. Conceptualizing the controls for the controller's analog sticks was the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> for the team, and the controls underwent great testing prior to finalization.|$|E

5|$|The {{short film}} {{was made with}} the support of Nomura Real Estate Group for its , a home living {{exposition}} at the Tokyo International Forum. According to Shinkai, the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> in the project was to keep the animation both short and entertaining while also covering the two main themes: family bonds and the future. Hirano's narration, which provided character background and insight into their personalities, helped Shinkai structure the film.|$|E
5|$|Two Rivers is {{the final}} {{checkpoint}} in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks. The <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, {{many of which have}} similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E

5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

25|$|On {{the western}} side of Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October, 1961. The central section {{presented}} the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge,</b> as an embankment was built to create grade-separations. In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened.|$|E
25|$|Montreal's <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> {{happened}} {{two days}} later when they played a single-elimination game against the Toronto Professional HC.

However, the Wanderers prevailed, 6–4, with two late goals by Ernie Johnson and Bruce Stuart.|$|E

25|$|The Armenian {{camp and}} {{resistance}} faces its <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> from within, when criminal elements among the Ottoman Army deserters—- whom Bagradian allowed {{to help in}} Musa Dagh's offense—- go on a rampage. As Ter Haigasun prepares to celebrate a mass to ask for God’s help, the deserters set the altar on fire and the resulting conflagration destroys much of the Town Enclosure, before the uprising is suppressed by Bagradian’s men.|$|E
25|$|However, the paratroopers faced their <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> {{when they}} were fired upon {{by a number of}} ZPU-2 14.5mm multi-barrel {{anti-aircraft}} guns used in the ground role. This brought both companies to a complete halt, as they were unable to move under the accurate, and close, fire of the guns, and the Buccaneer on CAS duty could not conduct a strike on the guns for fear of hitting the paratroopers close by.|$|E

25|$|He {{states that}} he is fully {{convinced}} that the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> is not technology in itself, is not security and integrity of data, is not the decluttering of information, but the quantum leap in culture required at all echelons. Generals must learn to do and stick to their job of strategists and planners, leaving tactics where they belong; platoon commanders must learn to take their own growing share of responsibility to conduct actions that concur with the intent indicated by generals, without minute by minute directions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> facing Bowell {{as prime}} {{minister}} was the Manitoba Schools Question. The Conservative Party was bitterly divided {{on how to handle}} the Manitoba Schools Question, and as a result, on January 4, 1896, seven cabinet ministers resigned, demanding the return of Tupper. As a result, Bowell and Aberdeen were forced to invite Tupper to join the 6th Canadian Ministry and on January 15 Tupper became Secretary of State for Canada, with the understanding that he would become prime minister following the dissolution of the 7th Canadian Parliament.|$|E

For this campaign, however, King Louis entrusted command of the theatre to the duc de Luxembourg, who, on 1 July, fought his tactical masterpiece at the Battle of Fleurus.|$|E
