40|$|Inventory {{is one of}} {{the most}} visible and {{tangible}} aspects of doing business. Raw materials, <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>process</b> and finished goods all represent various forms of inventory.

These stocks represent a large portion of the business investment and must be well managed in order to maximize profits.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} combine a wage-cost markup pricing (and income distribution) model {{with the work}} of Hyman Minsky on the effects of financial variables on aggregate demand. Specifically, an attempt is made to integrate the wage-cost markup pricing theory with Minsky 2 Ì 7 s financial instability hypothesis to develop a coherent model of what Keynes referred to as 2 Ì 2... a sudden collapse in the marginal efficiency of capital. 2 Ì 2 (Keynes, 1936, p. 315). ^ This dissertation employs the system dynamics method of simulation modeling due to J. Forrester. The model offered makes use of the structural components which have been incorporated {{in a number of other}} (often large-scale) models of national and world economies (N. Forrester; N. Mass). The difference between this dissertation and previous similar projects lies in the emphasis on financial variables. Nathaniel Mass, for example, disputes the notion of capital investment as a causal factor in short cycles since the lags involved in the investment process are too long, in his judgment, to be involved in 4 - 6 year fluctuations. However, this involves two dubious assumptions: (a) This implies a questionable distinction between inventories and <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>process</b> on the one hand and plant and equipment on the other (see Ayres); (b) It ignores the dual nature of investment, which creates income via the multiplier in the short run but also increases capacity in the long run (see Hicks). The current model will analyze the behavior of monetary flows in terms of their relations with monetary levels such as wages, debt and prices. ^ The simulation experiments will examine the stability of the economic system with respect to random shocks. Additional runs will provide evidence regarding the effects of various policy regimes on systemic stability. ...|$|E

Competition faced by a company not only from local and national competitors, but also include competitors from abroad. Therefore, companies must constantly strives to improve its product quality at an affordable price. Companies need to conduct quality control programs to achieve quality products that comply with the criteria established. By doing the quality control activities are expected to reduce the existence of failed products, which indirectly can reduce production costs. One way to direct quality control program is to analyze the cost of quality. Quality costs consist of prevention cost, appraisal, internal failure costs and external failure costs. With this quality cost analysis of the company should manage its quality control activities, especially those who are preventing the occurrence of product failure. If the cost is reduced without degrading the quality of the product quality, the cost of more efficient production. This is because the cost of quality is part of the cost of production. The author conducted research at PT. Perkebunan Nusantara VIII, a processing company tea, for the year 2009. The method used was descriptive-analytical method, whereas for data collection used interviews, observations, and documentation that supported the study of literature as a reference. Based on a study author and supported by literature study, the authors drew the conclusion that all this time on PT.

The usual caveats apply and the information provided here should be used with caution asthe scenarios presented in this report were simulated by means of comparative static techniquesand lack the dynamics and sectoral inter-linkages of more sophisticated and complex modellingtools. However, they serve the purpose of presenting different reconstruction scenarios andfinancial gaps which are built upon different assumptions and levels of government expenditureand public debt. The report does not aim at providing a full-fledged assessment of the totaldamage and losses of the catastrophe since the primary information is not yet available and theemergency, rescue and search activities are still under way. For the past thirty five years, ECLAC has cooperated with governments in Latin Americaand around the world in assessing âwith the methodology developed by ECLAC itselfâ thesocio-economic incidence of climate and other extreme events that result in catastrophes. One ofthe main findings and characteristics common to all natural events is that damage estimatescalculated shortly after the disaster tend to be significantly overestimated as opposed tocalculations which follow a thorough methodology based on consistency-stock-flow analysistechniques and a sectoral inductive bottom-up-approach. In principle, one can identify several sources of loss from natural events. For the purposesof this report and {{on the basis of the}} evaluation criteria established by ECLAC, we distinguishbetween direct damage, defined as damage to assets that are impaired, immobilized or destroyedand to stocks, including final goods, <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>process,</b> raw materials, inputs and spare parts; andlosses (sometimes referred to as indirect damage) defined as a disruption of economic activitywhich may lead to loss of income or production, a curtailment of the flow of goods and servicesthat cease to be produced or provided from the moment a disaster occurs and potentially until therehabilitation and reconstruction process has been completed. A number of empirical studies and evaluations conducted by ECLAC as well as otherresearch and academic institutions on the impact of natural disasters distinguish between shorttermand medium-term impacts. The most common finding of these studies is an immediatecontraction in output and a worsening of external and fiscal balances as well as an increase inpoverty and short-term spikes in price levels. The final impacts are ultimately country-specificand depend on the economy's structural conditions and more decisively on the economic policymix undertaken to tackle the short-term effects of the disaster and the medium-term challenges ofthe rehabilitation and reconstruction process. This report is divided into five sections. The introduction is followed by Section 2, presentsthe general description of the earthquake. Section 3 summarizes the potential macroeconomicimpacts of the disaster along with alternative reconstruction scenarios.
