5|$|Burne-Jones <b>exerted</b> a {{considerable}} influence on French painting. He was also highly influential among French symbolist painters, from 1889. His work inspired poetry by Swinburne– Swinburne's 1866 Poems & Ballads {{is dedicated to}} Burne-Jones.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force <b>exerted</b> by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force <b>exerted</b> by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E
50|$|It is very important, as Cain explains, {{for police}} {{officers}} to experience relationships with their colleagues. The relationship tends {{to look like the}} following - experienced police officers <b>exert</b> power over the recruits, experienced officers tend to <b>exert</b> power over the cadets, senior officers tend to <b>exert</b> over experienced officers and the government <b>exerts</b> power over the senior officials.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever {{one body}} <b>exerts</b> a force F onto a second body,(in some cases, which is {{standing}} still) the second body <b>exerts</b> the force −F {{on the first}} body. F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense. So, the body which <b>exerts</b> F will go backwards.|$|R
50|$|While Rohmert's law {{applies to}} maximum force, the inverse is true as well; the less force one {{is asked to}} <b>exert,</b> the longer one {{will be able to}} <b>exert</b> that force before their muscles become fatigued. If one is asked to <b>exert</b> zero force, they can {{theoretically}} hold the position indefinitely.|$|R
5|$|Du Noüy ring method: The {{traditional}} {{method used}} to measure surface or interfacial tension. Wetting properties of the surface or interface have little influence on this measuring technique. Maximum pull <b>exerted</b> on the ring by the surface is measured.|$|E

5|$|According to Michel Beluet, {{the former}} {{director}} of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure <b>exerted</b> on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe. Palmer cited Raël, who claimed that more than 60% of the Raëlian Movement's members do not tithe. Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.|$|E
5|$|Alabama was {{admitted}} to the Union on December 14, 1819. It seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, and was {{a founding member of the}} Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the American Civil War, Alabama during Reconstruction was part of the Third Military District, which <b>exerted</b> some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} amino acids on the gel {{formation}} of white croaker myofibrils by heating was investigated. Amino acids were classified into four groups by {{their effect on}} the gel formation: (1) amino acids <b>exerting</b> marked increased effect on gel formation such as Cys, (2) those <b>exerting</b> moderate increased effect such as Arg-free base and Trp, (3) those <b>exerting</b> slight effect such as Cit, His and Gly, (4) those <b>exerting</b> no effect such as Na-Asp and Ala. These results suggested that the sulfhydryl groups and hydrophobic bonding of myofibrillar protein participated in gel formation of myofibrils by heating...|$|R

5|$|As a human institution, Byzantium {{under the}} Komnenoi {{played a key}} role in the history of the Crusades in the Holy Land, while also exerting {{enormous}} cultural and political influence in Europe, the Near East, and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The Komnenian emperors, particularly John and Manuel, <b>exerted</b> great influence over the Crusader states of Outremer, whilst Alexios I {{played a key role}} in the course of the First Crusade, which he helped bring about.|$|E
5|$|Divorce was legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987. The church opposed it, {{but it had}} huge popular support that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. The church opposed Alfonsín after that point. The church successfully <b>exerted</b> pressure to prevent the abolition of religious education. In line with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, the Church criticized what it perceived as an increase in drugs, terrorism, abortion and pornography.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, List {{became a}} {{well-known}} figure among the nationalist and völkisch subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing {{the work of}} many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated through the List Society, influenced later völkisch {{groups such as the}} Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden, and through those <b>exerted</b> an influence on both the burgeoning Nazi Party and the SS. After World War II his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and Heathen practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.|$|E

50|$|An airfoil generates lift by <b>exerting</b> a {{downward}} {{force on the}} air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must <b>exert</b> an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.|$|R
50|$|These age self-stereotypes {{continue}} to be predominantly negative and <b>exert</b> negative influences on cognitive and physical health.

5|$|During the French Mandate {{and under}} the {{parliamentary}} régime in Syria, there were reserved seats for the various religious communities, like in Lebanon, including for Armenians. This system is unofficially still living. Even when they didn't take part as such in elections, Armenian parties such as Dashnak <b>exerted</b> an influence on them.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is <b>exerted</b> by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure <b>exerted</b> when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effects}} of the {{determinants}} of intersectoral labor mobility and the effect of intersectoral labor mobility on deforestation in Ghana over the period 1970 – 2008. A cointegration and error correction modeling approach is employed. The empirical results show that labor mobility from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector <b>exerts</b> negative effects on deforestation in Ghana in the long run and short run. Relative agricultural income <b>exerts</b> a significant negative effect on intersectoral labor mobility in the long run. Deforestation is influenced positively by population pressure, the price of fertilizer and rainfall,whereas access to irrigation infrastructure <b>exerts</b> a negative effect in the long run. In the short run, real producer prices of cocoa and maize <b>exert</b> significant positive effects on deforestation whereas access to irrigation infrastructure <b>exerts</b> a negative significant effect.

5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure <b>exerted</b> by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Offa had significant influence {{in the early years}} of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland. The overlordship of the southern English which had been <b>exerted</b> by Æthelbald appears to have collapsed during the civil strife over the succession, and it is not until 764, when evidence emerges of Offa's influence in Kent, that Mercian power can be seen expanding again.|$|E
5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack {{balance and}} {{acceleration}} sensors {{and rely on}} their eyes to tell them which way is up. Arthropods' proprioceptors, sensors that report the force <b>exerted</b> by muscles {{and the degree of}} bending in the body and joints, are well understood. On the other hand, little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have.|$|E
5000|$|Third law: When a first body <b>exerts</b> a force F1 on {{a second}} body, the second body {{simultaneously}} <b>exerts</b> a force F2 = &minus;F1 on the first body. This means that F1 and F2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.|$|R
