5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E

500|$|One {{holdover}} {{from the}} latter {{stages of the}} Magic Tour was the [...] "Build Me a House" [...] stage rap, now located in [...] "Working on a Dream". Springsteen would say: [...] "We're not just here to rock the house tonight. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> house....

50|$|One {{fundamental}} question about action selection {{is whether it}} is really a problem at all for an agent, or whether it is just a description of an emergent property of an intelligent agent's behavior. However, if we consider how we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> intelligent agent, then it becomes apparent there must be some mechanism for action selection. This mechanism may be highly distributed (as in the case of distributed organisms such as social insect colonies or slime mold) or it may be a special-purpose module.|$|R
500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day {{and told me he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> studio," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with the Daily Mail.

500|$|The {{decoding}} of the extraterrestrial message, {{with its}} architectural {{drawings of the}} machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, {{using a combination of}} model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that [...] "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable." [...] He continued that [...] "it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real." [...] The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the [...] "Time Displacement Device" [...] in [...] in a scene that did not make the final cut.|$|E
500|$|Responsible for the film's {{production}} design was Rick Heinrichs, who Burton {{intended to use}} on Superman Lives. While the production crew was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> substantial number of sets, the decision was taken early on that to fulfill Burton's vision best would necessitate shooting Sleepy Hollow in a totally controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios. The {{production design}} was influenced [...] by Burton's love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked {{as a result of}} being filmed primarily on sound stages. Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture, German Expressionism, Dr. Seuss illustrations, and Hammer's Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. One sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the [...] "Forest to Field" [...] set, for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field. This stage was then transformed into, variously, a graveyard, a corn field, a field of harvested wheat, a churchyard, and a snowy battlefield. In addition, a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank.|$|E

5000|$|Interest in Kammerer revived in 1971 {{with the}} {{publication}} of Arthur Koestler's book The Case of the Midwife Toad. Koestler thoughr that Kammerer's experiments on the midwife toad may have been tampered with by a Nazi sympathizer at the University of Vienna. Certainly, as Koestler writes, [...] "the Hakenkreuzler, the swastika-wearers, as the Austrian Nazis of the early days were called, were growing in power. One center of ferment was the University of Vienna where, on the traditional Saturday morning student parades, bloody battles were fought. Kammerer was known by his public lectures and newspaper articles as an ardent pacifist and Socialist; it was also known that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> institute in Soviet Russia. An act of sabotage in the laboratory would have been… in keeping with the climate of those days." ...|$|R

50|$|Angered, Vinnie calls Chase {{for a job}} behind Rex's back, {{which is}} {{stealing}} from Forrest Blackwell. Chase learns from Moe that Blackwell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> apartment complex/shopping mall in Bluebell National Park, but a discovery of a rare squirrel had shut down the project, to which Blackwell vowed <b>to</b> never <b>build</b> anything again. Chase sneaks into Blackwell's mansion, evading Blackwell's sentinels and returning to Vinnie's ice cream parlor, only to find it overrun by Rex's thugs and Vinnie locked in the freezer in retaliation for doing something against Rex's orders.

A scramble of things bought at La Grange, without reference to size or style. And to hear these creatures talk, why, you'd think they were Astors or Rothschilds. Think of that little one with the curls--I don't believe he is over seventeen, for all his baby moustache--says he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> assembly hall for us to give a dance in next month; and apologizes the next breath {{to tell us that}} there isn't any milk to be had nearer than La Grange, and we must do without it, and use syrup in our tea to-morrow." ...|$|R

2500|$|On March 2, 1984 NFL owners {{voted to}} give Irsay {{permission}} {{to move his}} franchise {{to the city of}} his choosing. Irsay continued discussions with several cities hungry for an NFL franchise (New York City, Phoenix, Arizona, Indianapolis, Indiana, Birmingham, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee) eventually narrowing the list of cities to two, Phoenix and Indianapolis. In January 1984, Baltimore's mayor Schaefer stated, [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new stadium. We do not have the bonding capacity. We don't have the voters or taxpayer who can support a $60 million stadium. One-third of the people in Baltimore pay taxes. Unless private enterprise builds it, we won't build it." [...] The Phoenix Metropolitan Sports Foundation, headed by real estate developer Eddie Lynch, along with Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt and other top Arizona officials, had secretly met with Irsay early in January 1984. Preliminary talks seemed promising. Phoenix was offering a below market rate $15 million loan and rent-free use of the 71,000 seat Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University. (Sun Devil Stadium would later serve as the home to the Arizona Cardinals from 1988 to 2005 after the team moved there from St. Louis, Missouri; that team has since moved into University of Phoenix Stadium within that market.) A second meeting was scheduled between Irsay and the Phoenix group. But when word of a second scheduled meeting leaked out and was reported by the media on the Friday before the Super Bowl, Irsay canceled. Meanwhile, Indianapolis and local real estate developer Robert Welch, were lobbying the NFL to bring an expansion team to the city, with Welch as team owner. Welch also had personal discussions with New Orleans Saints owner John Mecom about buying the team and moving it to Indianapolis.|$|E

50|$|Fabi {{returned}} with Porsche Motorsports in 1990 to drive their #4 Foster's/Quaker State March 90P-Porsche Indy V8. Prior {{to the start}} of the season Porsche was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> all carbon fibre chassis with their constructor March Engineering. In January Porsche's competitors voted against the use of the car and as a result Porsche had to use the year-old March 89P chassis.

A new March 90P was used at the Indianapolis 500 and Fabi started twenty-third but retired in eighteenth due to transmission problems after 162 laps. Fabi would later qualify on pole position for the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Denver.He led one lap but crashed after seven laps and finished twenty-seventh. Fabi achieved a best finish of third at the Marlboro Grand Prix at the Meadowlands at Meadowlands Sports Complex, and ended the season fourteenth in points.

40|$|In our {{day to day}} life, {{there is}} a basic need of {{identifying}} peoples who are living around us. After we get the information about someone, his profile will be created in our mind automatically. And this profile describes the person. In practical, retrieving someone’s information and creating his profile is very time consuming workout. It {{takes a lot of}} time and resource as well. Generally that information is spreaded in many different sources such as number of social sites (like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter, etc), blogs, other related web sites and intranets. So, my solution is to develop a system to searching for the desired person and creating his profile and update it automatically with zero human intervene. This system searches for the information related to the desired person throughout the various sources like social web sites (like Facebook, MySpace and Twitter etc), blogs and intranets, and creating a profile based on them and update it timely. the system profiles the person creating his own unique profile. This profile represents each person that involved with the faculty, describing all of the information related to him. So, in this project profiling a human plays a greater role. So, throughout this project I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> agent based system for human profiling...|$|R
