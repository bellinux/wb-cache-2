50|$|Cells {{that form}} the {{boundaries}} of the rhombomere bulges proliferate much faster than those in the middle. It is very difficult for cells to cross from one rhombomere to another, so cells tend to stay within one rhombomere. Each rhombomere eventually gives rise to one or more vestibular neuron types. However, it is not necessarily dependent on segmentation. The motor nerves form depending on rhombomeric patterns, but each nerve can come from either one rhombomere or a pair of rhombomeres that are neighbors. Furthermore, the correct development of the various pharyngeal arches is believed to depend on interactions with specific rhombomeres. With these mechanisms, neural crest cells, for instance, from each rhombomere give rise to different ganglia, or clusters of neurons. Many of these rhombomeres have been mapped to an extent in species other than human. For example, r2 has been shown to give rise to the trigeminal ganglion, while r4 has been shown to give rise to the geniculate <b>gangion</b> as well as spiral and Scarpa's ganglia. r5 and r6 gives rise to the abducens nerve, and the lower part of r6 and the upper part of r7 gives rise to the petrosal ganglion. Finally, the border of r7 that is not in contact with r6 gives rise to the jugular/nodose ganglia. These mappings, however, cannot be applied cross species.|$|E

50|$|Longline {{fishing is}} a {{commercial}} fishing technique. It uses a long line, called the main line, with baited hooks attached at intervals {{by means of}} branch lines called snoods (or <b>gangions).</b> A snood is a short length of line, attached to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set {{by means of an}} anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. Longliners commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{mortality}} of sharks {{in a commercial}} longline fishery in Australia. To examine the rate and biological, environmental and technological factors contributing to at-vessel mortality, four setlines with 120 <b>gangions</b> possessing ‘hook timers’ were deployed daily (for 7 h and 14 h) using conventional gears from two commercial fishing vessels during 2013. A total of 689 animals across 22 species and including 18 elasmobranchs were landed. For the five species (Carcharhinus spp.), and one genus (Sphyrna spp) where there were sufficient numbers for analysis, generalised linear mixed models showed that species and the elapsed time spent on the line after hooking were the strongest predictors of at-vessel mortality, with spinner (Carcharhinus brevipinna), blacktip (C. limbatus) and hammerhead (Sphyrna spp) sharks exhibiting the highest death rates. The variables which best explained mortality, included: (i) sex of the caught sharks, and the interaction between species with (ii) capture depth, and (iii) the elapsed time spent on the line after hooking. For the subset of dusky (C. obscurus) and sandbar (C. plumbeus) sharks examined for physiological status {{at the point of}} capture, very few of the 13 chosen blood analytes varied significantly. Given the observed high mortality rates and stress associated with the time spent on the line after capture, operational changes to reduce these adverse impacts should be considered. Even simple changes such as shorter soak times could considerably mitigate these impacts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experiment}} {{was done to}} quantify species-specific variation in temporal hooking rates from demersal longlines targeting various carcharhinids off south eastern Australia, {{with a view to}} reducing the incidental catches of protected species, including the scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini, great hammerhead Sphyrna mokarran and grey nurse Carcharias taurus. The longline comprised a 9600 m mainline, separated into four sections (termed lines) each with 120 <b>gangions</b> (20 m apart) rigged with hook timers and 16 / 0 circle hooks baited with either sea mullet Mugil cephalus or eastern Australian salmon Arripis trutta. The mainline was deployed on each of 17 nights (between 19 : 30 and 23 : 30  h), with two lines retrieved after 7 and 14  h respectively. From a total of 8160 hooks, 246 timers were activated without hooking fish. Twenty-two species comprising 684 individuals were caught, including 52 S. lewini, 12 C. taurus, 11 S. mokarran and 1 loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Several environmental factors, including water temperature, moon phase and depth had mostly homogeneous, positive effects on catches. The only identified variables that might be used to considerably reduce the catches of Sphyrna were soak time and/or diurnal gear retrieval, with most individuals hooked during daylight. Simply mandating shorter deployments and within nocturnal retrieval might limit exploitation, especially among juveniles (< 150 cm total length). For the studied fishery to approach sustainability, future research is required to investigate other gear modifications for improving size and species selectivity, and/or operational procedures for mitigating discard and escape mortalities...|$|R
40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} {{provide the}} world with a healthy source of protein than can have minimal environmental impacts if harvested sustainably. Negative environmental impacts of capture fisheries include; overexploitation, modification of food webs, mortality of nontarget species, habitat alteration and biodiversity loss. A mitigation technique often used to reduce ecological impacts of fishing without compromising commercial catches is gear modification. This thesis explores modification of two gear types; shrimp trawl and turbot longline. Modifications were made to shrimp trawl footgear to reduce habitat alteration and to turbot longline gear to reduce Greenland shark bycatch. Testing of modified with traditional gears demonstrated that the modified gears with reduced ecological impacts did not negatively affect commercial catches. The 200 lb monofilament <b>gangion</b> is recommended for commercial testing by turbot longline fishers in Cumberland Sound; however the aligned shrimp trawl requires further modifications due to unexpected increases in turbot bycatch compared to the traditional trawl...|$|E
40|$|Hemangioma of {{the facial}} nerve may occur more {{frequently}} than previously recognized. This benign vascular tumor most often arises {{in the area of the}} geniculate ganglion, although the reason for this site of predilection is not known. Using silicon injection and cross-sectional vessel counts, we recently demonstrated the presence of a geniculate capillary plexus (GCP) in the cat. The present study was designed to identify a similar GCP in man, if present, and to relate if to the site of predilection of hemangioma {{of the facial}} nerve. Twenty-five human facial nerves were studied in horizontally sectioned temporal bones. A clinical case of hemangioma arising at the geniculate ganglion is presented. The human geniculate ganglion has a very rich capillary plexus in contrast to the poor intrinsic vasculature of the adjacent labyrinthine segment and nioderate vasculature of the tympanic segment {{of the facial nerve}}. We hypothesize that the GCP is the origin of most hemangiomas of facial nerve. The anatomic distinctness of the geniculate <b>gangion</b> and GCP from the facial nerve may allow removal of these tumors with preservation of motor function in certain cases...|$|E

Selectivity {{studies were carried out}} with three hook sizes in the first two cases: Mustad round-bent Quality 2369 hooks, numbers 15, 13, and 11, baited with a standardsized razor-shell Ensis siliqua (Linnaeus, 1758). Four hook sizes (numbers 10, 9, 7, and 5) of Stell round-bent, eyed hooks were used in the semi-pelagic long-line {{selectivity}} study, baited with a half of a standard-sized sardine. Some factors affecting catch composition and catch rates of the small hook long-lines were also evaluated: bait, <b>gangion</b> length, setting time, fishing ground, and depth. Species diversity was relatively high, with 40, 36 and 27 species, respectively, in the three studies. However, the catches were dominated by a limited number of species. Catch rates (number of fish per 100 hooks) were variable (20 %), with a general decrease in catch rate with increasing hook size in all the studies. In general, the catch size distributions for the different hook sizes for each species were highly overlapping, with little or no evidence of differences in size selectivity. Hooks caught a wide size-range for each species, with few or no illegal-sized fish, in most cases. Some implications of these results for the management of multi-species, multi-gear fisheries are discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Fisheries are {{increasingly}} adopting ecosystem approaches to better manage impacts on non-target species. Although deliberate dumping of plastics at sea is banned, not all fisheries legislation prohibits discarding of gear (hooks and line) in offal, and compliance is often unknown. Analysis of a 16 year dataset collected at South Georgia {{indicated that the}} amount of gear found in association with wandering albatrosses was an order of magnitude greater than in any other species, reflecting their wider foraging range and larger gape. Unlike other taxa, most gear associated with grey-headed albatrosses was from squid and not longline fisheries, and mistaken for natural prey rather than the result of direct interaction. Observed rates of foul-hooking (entanglement during line-hauling) were much higher in giant petrels and wandering albatrosses than black-browed albatrosses, and no grey-headed albatross was affected. The index of wandering albatross gear abundance showed two peaks, the most recent corresponding with a substantial {{increase in the number of}} multifilament snoods (<b>gangions),</b> Suggesting that the widespread adoption of a new longline system (Chilean mixed) may have been responsible. Although all identified gear was demersal, given the widespread use of similar hooks, little could be assigned to a specific fishery. Stomach content analysis suggested that 1300 - 2048 items of gear are currently consumed per annum by the wandering albatross population. Many hooks are completely digested by chicks, long-term effects of which are entirely unknown. We suggest a number of management approaches for addressing the problem of gear discarding, and guidelines for monitoring schemes elsewhere. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Instructive {{biomaterials}} {{capable of}} controlling the behaviour of the cells are particularly interesting scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Novel biomaterials are particularly important in societies with rapidly aging populations, where demand for organ/tissue donations is greater than their supply. Herein we describe the preparation of electrically conductive silk film-based nerve tissue scaffolds that are manufactured using all aqueous processing. Aqueous solutions of Bombyx mori silk were cast on flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates with micrometer-scale grooves on their surfaces, allowed to dry, and annealed to impart β-sheets to the silk which assures that the materials are stable for further processing in water. The silk films were rendered conductive by generating an interpenetrating network of polypyrrole and polystyrenesulfonate in the silk matrix. Films were incubated in an aqueous solution of pyrrole (monomer), polystyrenesulfonate (dopant) and iron chloride (initiator), after which they were thoroughly washed to remove low molecular weight components (monomers, initiators, and oligomers) and dried, yielding conductive films with sheet resistances of 124 ± 23 kΩ square- 1. The micrometer-scale grooves that are present {{on the surface of}} the films are analogous to the natural topography in the extracellular matrix of various tissues (bone, muscle, nerve, skin) to which cells respond. Dorsal Root <b>Gangions</b> (DRGs) adhere to the films and the grooves in the surface of the films instruct the aligned growth of processes extending from the DRGs. Such materials potentially enable the electrical stimulation of cells cultured on them, and future in vitro studies will focus on understanding the interplay between electrical and topographical cues on the behaviour of cells cultured on them...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the actual}} fishing depths of pelagic {{longline}} gear {{has long been}} a goal of fisheries science, largely for the standardization of fishing effort through the use of habitat‐oriented modeling. Early efforts to record these depths used large temperature‐depth recorders (TDRs) along the mainline, but more recent work with improved (smaller) technology has resulted in the deployment of hundreds of microTDRs on the gangions themselves to determine actual hook depths. The use of baited hooks on these gangions resulted in the occasional catch of a fish on a <b>gangion</b> equipped with a microTDR. These records are therefore useless from a gear behavior modeling perspective and have been previously disregarded. The collection of several hundred new and old microTDR records of caught pelagic fishes now allows some insight into actual post‐hooking fish behavior. A total of 490 records were examined from microTDR research by the senior author between 2003 and 2009, spanning 17 teleost and 13 elasmobranch species. Extracted data included time, temperature, and depth at hooking and death, and these were then matched with individual fish data, such as length. Analyses show a broad range of survival time on the hook, even within species. Hook location (internal versus external) and individual fish size were variable effects to the length of post‐hooking survival. For individuals that survived for multiple hours on the hook, three general patterns of movement were seen: surface association, constant vertical movement, and repeated vertical movement. Post‐hooking behavior patterns were consistent for some species (e. g., manta ray Manta sp.), but not others (e. g., swordfish Xiphias gladius). Not surprisingly, the two most commonly used estimators of hook depths consistently overestimated the hooking depths for most species, suggesting that subsequent population analyses based on these estimated depths may be suspect. These data indicate that the present hook depth predictor equations may not provide sufficient information to extrapolate individual species’ habitat utilization and, by extension, a strong rationale for their use in pelagic longline fishing gear standardization efforts...|$|E
40|$|Glutamate is {{the major}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. We propose three new roles for this neurotransmitter in the developing nervous system. First, we show that glutamate or the metabotropic class I agonist, DHPG (S- 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenyl glycine), acting through the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR 1), can reduce axonal responses to multiple repellents in vitro. Specifically, we show that signaling though mGluR 1 reduces the effectiveness of Slit- 2 on retinal <b>gangion</b> cell (RGC) axons, Semaphorin 3 A on dorsal root ganglion axons and Semaphorin 3 C on sympathetic chain ganglia axons. This effect is mediated by a pertussis toxin sensitive activation of protein kinase A and the subsequent inactivation of Rho. In addition, we find that activation of mGluR 1 promotes increased survival of dissociated embryonic RGCs cultured in minimal medium. Together, these data show that signaling through Class I mGluRs modulate axonal responses to guidance cues and can provide trophic support to developing neurons. ^ Recently, signaling molecules originally identified as guidance cues {{have been shown to}} participate in synapse formation in the developing nervous system. We hypothesized that glutamate could be released from pre-synaptic endings and help align potential post-synaptic partners by overcoming inhibition due to repellent cues in the environment. We find that inhibiting class I mGluRs in cultured hippocampal neurons disrupts the co-localization of the pre- and post-synaptic elements, synapsin- 1 and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD- 95). The disruption caused by antagonists of class I mGluRs exceeds that of other classes of glutamatergic antagonists. Treatment with a class I mGluR agonist over four hours also reduces the alignment of these synaptic markers, partly by inducing the formation of PSD- 95 clusters. This effect requires elevation of cAMP levels, is protein synthesis dependent and requires PKA activation. These data suggest that class I mGluRs {{play an important role in}} the formation or initial maintenance of the earliest excitatory synaptic contacts between neurons. ^ We have thus identified glutamate, signaling through class I mGluRs, as a candidate modulatory guidance cue, a potential trophic factor, and an important signal participating in the proper alignment of pre-and post-synaptic elements. ...|$|E
40|$|TRPM 3 is {{a highly}} conserved melastatin-like {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) gene with direct orthologs in all chordates and close homologs in all bilateral animals. So far, {{little is known about}} its biological role, activation mechanism, expression pattern and the functional role of its domains. The aim of this work was to clone a cDNA of mouse TRPM 3, to express it in in vitro overexpression models and evaluate its function, to raise antisera against TRPM 3 in order to determine its cellular expression profile in the mouse and, finally, to obtain a knock-out allele in the mouse in order to assess its biological role. 1. In this work, we cloned two cDNAs of mTRPM 3, both starting with the unique starting exon we had identifed in a 5 -RACE study. One variant is 1337 amino acids long and has a shorter C-terminal domain than the other, which has 1719 amino acid residues. Both splice variants are readily expressable in HEK- 293 cells. Plasma membrane localization was greatly augmented by stable inducible expression in differentiated, polarized MDCK cells, where mTRPM 31719 resided in the basolateral compartment. When overexpressed in HEK- 293 cells, TRPM 3 was unresponsive to hypo- or hyperosmolar stimuli, D-erythro-sphingosine and protocols used to elicit store-operated calcium entry. Instead, we observed a robust constitutive calcium entry through TRPM 3, which was seen with both splice variants and abolished by point mutations in the pore domain. 2. We confirmed by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and co-immunoprecipitation that TRPM 3, like other TRP channels, forms multimeric channel complexes. The C-terminus of TRPM 3 was found to attach to the plasma membrane through a palmitoylation of a dual-cysteine motif, a modification that quantitatively affected calcium entry through TRPM 3. In a systematic yeast two hybrid screen of a kidney library against the C-terminus of TRPM 3, we identified a number of candidate interaction partners of TRPM 3, including alpha-B crystallin and protein kinase inhibitor gamma (PKIG). 3. We investigated the TRPM 3 expression pattern by a combination of Northern blots, Western blots and lacZ stainings in a mouse model based on the GeneTrap approach. We found TRPM 3 to be mainly enriched in eye and brain tissues, but, unlike human TRPM 3, very low levels in kidney. Using lacZ staining of cryostat sections, TRPM 3 was detected mainly in sensory tissues like the bipolar and <b>gangion</b> cell layers of the eye, the embryonic ear bubble and dorsal root ganglia. In the brain, a considerable enrichment of TRPM 3 gene activity was seen, among others, in various neuron populations of the hippocampus formation (dentate gyrus, CA 1, CA 3), the Purkinje cells layer, and the neocortex. Thus, TRPM 3 is mainly expressed in cells of ectodermal origin. 4. We characterized a mouse model in which TRPM 3 had been targeted by a gene trap insertion. We confirmed the gene trap insertion by means of PCR, we confirmed the absence of the protein in eye tissues by means of a Western blot using a newly made peptide rabbit antiserum, and we isogenized the genetical background for skin coloration markers using Mendelian crosses. A basic study of TRPM 3 s phenotype showed the absence of morphological and overall behavioural defects and complete viability of the mutant. Further assays addressing the visual abilities of the TRPM 3 -/- mouse showed no signs of blindness. In summary, we cloned cDNAs of TRPM 3, expressed them in vitro and found that TRPM 3 is calcium-permeable and constitutively active. TRPM 3 is palmitoylated on its C-terminus and interacts with a variety of proteins we identified by a yeast two hybrid approach, many of them novel in this regard. TRPM 3 is highly enriched in sensory and central nervous tissues. The TRPM 3 -/- mouse is viable without any major neurological or sensory defect as far as tested. Further investigation on tissues which will have to address the specific function of TRPM 3 where it is enriched...|$|E
