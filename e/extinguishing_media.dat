5000|$|Most airport fire {{appliances}} {{are equipped}} with a roof-mounted high volume 'monitor' or 'nozzle' which can shoot fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> huge distances.

50|$|Fires {{caused by}} {{ethylene}} oxide are <b>extinguished</b> by traditional <b>media,</b> including foam, carbon dioxide or water. Suppression {{of this activity}} {{can be done by}} blanketing with an inert gas until total pressure reaches non explosive range. Extinguishing of burning ethylene oxide is complicated by that it can continue burning in an inert atmosphere and in water solutions. Fire suppression is reached only upon dilution with water above 22:1.|$|R
50|$|Wall mounted {{cigarette}} receptacles {{are manufactured}} {{in a variety}} of shapes, sizes and butt disposal methods. Units with all-metal construction allow disposing of cigarette butts into a container with no other <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> required. Some receptacles utilize a separate butt container for clean-out, while one-piece models simply dump used butts.|$|E
5000|$|Many free {{standing}} cigarette receptacles utilize an oxygen restricting design that extinguishes still burning butts. These style receptacles are usually made of molded plastic, polyethylene and fiberglass, with metal inner liners and metal pails to gather disposed butts. [...] Due to their oxygen depriving design, no additional <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> is generally required. Cigarette butts are deposited {{through a small}} opening and drop down a long neck into the collection chamber. The collection chamber typically houses the removable pail. Other {{free standing}} receptacles, such as those made of pre-cast concrete and stone aggregate materials, rely on water, sand or gravel placed in the collection bin to assist in extinguishing disposed butts. Butt removal and clean-out is accomplished through a door in the receptacle's base, or, the base and top separate to allow access to disposed butts.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{was aimed}} at study {{of the effect of}} various gaseous <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> in an {{environment}} of increased temperature on the paper and its properties. Paper samples were exposed to elevated temperature in air, CO 2 gas and gas mixtures of N 2 :Ar (1 : 1). The impact of conditions on the mechanical, chemical and optical properties of paper has been studied after exposure of the paper by <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> under elevated temperature. The change of properties was determined immediately after exposure of samples under simultaneous conditions of fire, further one was determined for samples exposed to conditions of dry and wet aging. As a reference sample was used crude paper. Values of elasticity modulus, strength tensile, tearing resistance, the work needed for break tension, the total color difference and pH of samples have been determined. The results showed that every external influence causes at least some change in mechanical, optical and chemical properties such as increased temperature, the effect of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> or ageing of paper. The gas mixture N 2 :Ar (1 : 1) had the smallest influence on the sample paper, which was worked. Thus this gas mixture could be the best choice for the application in archive environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{limitations}} of water mist in {{acting as a}} total flooding agent are discussed in this paper. The paper focuses on water mist consisting of droplets 1 - 100 &mu;m in diameter. Water mists are very efficient as an <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> if they {{are present in the}} flame. There are, however, several problems associated with introducing the water mist into the flame: the spray reaches only a short distance; small water droplets have a very short lifetime; droplets coagulate into larger droplets; large droplets hit obstacles such as walls and therefore have difficulties in being dispersed throughout the protected volume...|$|E
40|$|Cleanliness is the {{priority}} property {{of an active}} fire-extinguishing agent for protection of expensive electronic equipment and high value materials. Halon 1301 was considered the most suitable clean agent to ensure industrial fire safety because it leaves no residue and allows {{a high level of}} extinction efficiency and human safety, as with many other <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media.</b> However, over 15 years ago, several studies showed that this agent damages the atmospheric ozone layer and causes global warming. As law has ruled out halon agents, a variety of clean fire suppression alternatives has surfaced over the past decade, but none of these has become the 'perfect' halon substitute. In this paper the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach is proposed as a tool to select the best halon alternative for fire protection. A hierarchical structure comprising 19 criteria is reported here to illustrate the performance and characteristics of several halon alternatives in order to define the most suitable agent for different fire risk situations. analytical hierarchy process; AHP; active fire protection; halon alternatives; clean agents; alternatives selection; fire safety; ozone damage; fire risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{dispersed}} phase that accompanies enclosure fires, for example, soot, ash, sprinkler droplets and extinguishing powder, could exert a {{significant influence on}} {{the dynamics of the}} background fluid. In this thesis, the results of a numerical study into the effects of this {{dispersed phase}} on the flow in a fire compartment are presented. A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solver, with appropriate approximations for low Mach number flows and mathematical sub-models for two­phase flows, has been developed in order to simulate fire induced convective motions in planar compartments. The description of the dispersed particulate is based on a two­continuum approach, whereby the dispersed phase and the gaseous phase are assumed to be two mutually interacting and penetrating continua. In this thesis, two 'passive' models and an 'active' model of the dispersed phase are considered. In the passive models the particulate acts as a tracer only and has no hydrodynamical influence on the gas phase. The second passive model differs from the first in that the production of gases in the fire compartment, for example arising from combustion or propellant gases due to extinguishment of the fire, is taken into account. This second passive model more accurately predicts the growth of pressure in a sealed fire compartment for weak fires. As the volume fraction of the particulate increases the spatial-temporal hydrodynamic influence exerted on the gaseous flow by the dispersed phase becomes significant and, under certain conditions, a passive representation is insufficient. An active one­temperature and one-velocity model is proposed which is appropriate for the description of a hydrodynamically active particulate with an instantaneous velocity and thermal relaxation time. In this thesis, computational fluid dynamics is used as a tool in order to characterise the applicability of the passive models and the active model. The ability of the passive models to accurately predict the growth of pressure in a compartment for 'surface' fires, for example smouldering combustion and weak fires, is investigated. The active model is used to study the hydrodynamics of powder <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> in a compartment with an open doorway...|$|E
