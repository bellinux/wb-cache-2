5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot <b>her.</b> <b>If</b> her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
