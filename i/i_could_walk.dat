2500|$|Outhwaite {{has been}} asked {{numerous}} times {{about the possibility of}} Mel returning to EastEnders since her departure. At various stages she replied [...] "never say never" [...] when asked if she would return but also insisted the time was not right. Although she has always refused to rule out the possibility of a future return, in 2010 she pondered that a return would be unlikely as the character did not have links in the current cast, and that she had never been asked back anyway, stating: [...] "People always ask me, but I've never been asked! It looks like I'm turning it down on a yearly basis, but I'm not. They've never asked me! So they don't want me back for one and I don't have any family left on the show. There's nobody on the Square she knows, I don't even think any of Mel's friends are still in it ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> down the market and be an extra, I suppose! [...] I don't know how Mel would return because there's no-one there for her to return to. She doesn't really know anyone apart from Ian Beale and Phil Mitchell.

[...] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as [...] "a bundle of {{verbally}} ferocious energy. Frankly, whenever he's in the scene, he shoplifts this movie from Cusack." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised Cusack's performance, writing that he was [...] "a master at projecting easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an astonishing naturalness and fluency that you're almost unaware of them." [...] USA Today did not give the film a positive review: [...] "Let's be kind and just say High Fidelity doesn't quite belong beside Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sure Thing in Cusack's greatest hits collection. It's not that he isn't good. More like miscast."

If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture." ...|$|E
