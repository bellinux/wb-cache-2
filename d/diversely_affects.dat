40|$|The current {{competition}} {{regime that}} characterizes international science is often {{presented as a}} quest for excellence. It <b>diversely</b> <b>affects</b> research in Latin America and research in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. This article asks how this competition regime may orient the direction of research in Latin America, and to whose advantage. It is argued that, by relating excellence to quality differently, a research policy that seeks to improve the level of science in Latin America while preserving the possibility of solving problems relevant to the region can be designed. Competition, it is also argued, certainly has its place in science, but not as a general management tool, especially {{if the goal is}} to improve overall quality of science in Latin America. Scientific competition is largely managed through journals and their reputation. Therefore, designing a science policy for Latin America (and for any ‘peripheral’ region of the world) requires paying special attention to the mechanisms underpinning the production, circulation and consumption of scientific journals. So-called ‘international’ or ‘core’ journals are of particular interest as local, national, or even regional journals must struggle to find their place in this peculiar publishing eco-system...|$|E

An appropriate exchange rate of ADP/ATP is crucial for chaperone-dependent protein folding processes. Among Hsp 70 client proteins are steroid receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the androgen receptor (AR). BAG- 1 <b>diversely</b> <b>affects</b> steroid receptor activity, while to date the influence of HspBP 1 on steroid receptor function is mostly unknown. Here, we compared the influence of HspBP 1 and BAG- 1 M on Hsp 70 -mediated steroid receptor folding complexes and steroid receptor activity. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated preferential binding of Hsp 40 and the steroid receptors to BAG- 1 M as compared to HspBP 1. Furthermore, Hsp 70 binding to the ligand-binding domain of GR was reduced {{in the presence of}} HspBP 1 but not in the presence of BAG- 1 M as shown by pull-down assays. Reporter gene experiments revealed an inhibitory effect on GR, MR, and AR at a wide range of HspBP 1 protein levels and at hormone concentrations at or approaching saturation.

40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} cytoprotective {{capacity}} of Hsp 27 under various cellular stresses, {{we compared the}} effects of heating and energy deprivation on its distribution and isoform composition. Cultured endothelial cells from human aorta or umbilical vein were subjected to heat shock (45 °C) and ATP-depleting metabolic stress (CCCP or rotenone in a glucose-free medium). Both exposures led to the translocation of Hsp 27 into the Triton X- 100 -insoluble cellular fraction, whereas the immunofluorescent Hsp 27 pattern was characteristic for each stress employed. Heating (5 – 30 min) caused unexpected association of Hsp 27 with thick bundles of actin microfilaments (stress fibers). ATP depletion within 30 – 120 min resulted in the appearance of Hsp 27 -containing compact granules in the nucleus. The insolubilization and relocalization of Hsp 27 were reversible in both cases. The stress-induced shifts in the Hsp 27 isoform spectrum indicate an increase in phosphorylation of Hsp 27 in heat-shocked cells and its dephosphorylation in ATP-depleted cells. We suggest that these stresses <b>diversely</b> <b>affect</b> the phosphorylation status of endothelial Hsp 27, thus altering its localization, supramolecular organization and functional activity toward actin...|$|R

40|$|Background: In forest {{ecosystems}} with phosphorus (P) deficiency, {{the impact of}} atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on nutritional traits related to P uptake and P use potentially determines plant growth and vegetation productivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two N deposition simulations were combined with three soil P conditions (homogeneous P deficiency with evenly low P; heterogeneous P deficiency with low subsoil P and high topsoil P; high P) using four full-sib families of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana). Under homogeneous P deficiency, N had a low effect on growth due to higher N:P ratios, whereas N-sensitive genotypes had lower N:P ratios and greater N sensitivity. The N effect increased under higher P conditions due to increased P concentration and balanced N:P ratios. An N:P threshold of 12. 0 – 15. 0 was detected, and growth was increased by N with an N:P ratio ≤ 12. 0 and increased by P with an N:P ratio ≥ 15. 0. Under homogeneous P deficiency, increased P use efficiency by N deposition improved growth. Under heterogeneous P deficiency, a greater P deficiency under N deposition due to increased N:P ratios induced greater adaptive responses to low P (root acid phosphatase secretion and topsoil root proliferation) and improved P acquisition and growth.

Effects on thrombin generation (TG) and thromboelastometry (TEM) parameters were assessed. Modifications in platelet adhesive, aggregating and procoagulant activities were evaluated in studies with blood circulating through damaged vascular surfaces, at a shear rate of 600 s 21. The potential of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs; 50 IU/kg), activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs; 75 IU/kg), or activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa; 270 mg/kg), at reversing the antihemostatic actions of apixaban, were investigated.

We captured dung beetles in a Peruvian rainforest with 299 dung-baited pitfall traps to characterize the dung beetle community. Seed burial occurrence and depth were assessed by marking, in situ, 551 dispersed seeds in faeces placed in a cage. We observed a significant effect of the amount of dung, season, time of defecation, and habitat on the number of individuals and species of dung beetles, as well as on seed burial occurrence and depth, while the type of faeces only significantly influenced the number and the size of dung beetles. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of seed length, shape, and mass neither on seed burial occurrence, nor on burial depth.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{some key}} impacts of public sector neoliberalisation and austerity measures for everyday geographies of childhood and youth in England. The paper develops three claims, {{with reference to}} qualitative research conducted at a youth group in 2007, 2009 and 2013. First, I outline a range {{of ways in which}} long-run processes of public sector neoliberalisation, and more abrupt cuts to public sector expenditure ‘in the current climate’ of austerity politics, have substantially transformed geographies of childhood and youth in many minority world contexts. However, I argue that extant research on these transformations has tended to reproduce some rather partial understandings of impacts of service withdrawal, which I critique via a reading of recent geographical work on anticipatory politics. Second, I evidence how political-economic contexts of neoliberalisation and austerity have constituted a particular atmosphere and sense of the future, tangibly affecting everyday relationships, spaces and the efficacy of service provision at the case study youth group. In particular, I emphasise the significance of anticipated futures, noting that the anticipation of funding cuts is having manifold everyday, lived consequences that are arguably more wide-ranging, intractable and troubling than the impacts of funding cuts themselves. Third, in particular, I argue that spaces of anticipated funding cuts and service withdrawal are frequently characterised by an intensification of anxieties about, and hopes for, young people's futures. I note that young people are <b>diversely</b> <b>affected</b> by, and engaged in, the circulation of these anxieties and hopes – but also recognise that young people's geographies go on, and sometimes offer hopeful ways on, ‘in the current climate’...|$|R
40|$|To {{probe the}} role of {{individual}} disulfide bonds in the folding kinetics of hen lysozyme, the variants with two mutations, C 30 A,C 115 A, C 64 A,C 80 A, and C 76 A,C 94 A, were constructed. The corresponding proteins, each lacking one disulfide bond, were produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and solubilized, purified, and renatured/oxidized using original protocols. Their enzymatic, spectral, and hydrodynamic characteristics confirmed that their conformations were {{very similar to that}} of native wild-type (WT) lysozyme. Stopped-flow studies on the renaturation of these guanidine-unfolded proteins with their three disulfides intact showed that, for the three variants, the native far-UV ellipticity was regained in a burst phase within the 4 -ms instrument dead-time. The transient overshoots of far-UV ellipticity and tryptophan fluorescence that follow the burst phase, as well as the kinetics of transient 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding, were <b>diversely</b> <b>affected</b> depending on the variant. Together with previous reports on the folding kinetics of WT lysozyme carboxymethylated on cysteines 6 and 127, detailed analysis of the kinetics showed that (1) none of the disulfide bonds were indispensable for the rapid formation (< 4 ms) of the native-like secondary structure; (2) the two intra-α-domain disulfides (C 6 -C 127 and C 30 -C 115) must be simultaneously present to generate the trapped intermediate responsible for the slow folding population observed in WT lysozyme; and (3) the intra-β-domain (C 64 -C 80) and the inter-αβ-domains (C 76 -C 94) disulfides do not affect the kinetics of formation of the trapped intermediate but are involved in its stability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Identification of {{differentially}} expressed genes is {{a typical}} objective when analyzing gene expression data. Recently, Bayesian hierarchical models have become increasingly popular to solve this type of problems. These models show good performance in accommodating noise, variability and low replication of microarray data. However, the correlation between different fluorescent signals measured from a gene spot is ignored, which can <b>diversely</b> <b>affect</b> the data analysis step. In fact, the intensities of the two signals are significantly correlated across samples. The larger the log-transformed intensities are, the smaller the correlation is. Results Motivated by the complicated error relations in microarray data, we propose a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian framework for data analysis in the replicated microarray experiments. Gene expression data are modelled by a multivariate normal distribution, parameterized by the corresponding mean vectors and covariance matrixes with a conjugate prior distribution. Within the Bayesian framework, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is also developed to infer the gene expression patterns. Simulation {{studies show that the}} proposed approach presents better operating characteristics and lower false discovery rate (FDR) than existing methods, especially when the correlation coefficient is large. The approach is illustrated with two examples of microarray analysis. The proposed method successfully detects significant genes closely related to the experimental states, which are verified by the biological information. Conclusions The multivariate Bayesian model, compatible with the dependence between mean and variance in the univariate Bayesian model, relaxes the constant coefficient of variation assumption between measurements by adding a covariance structure. This model improves the identification of differentially expressed genes significantly since the Bayesian model fit well with the microarray data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of various classes of clinically relevant antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations on virulence gene expression and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. Findings LacZ promoter fusions of genes related to staphylococcal virulence were used to monitor the effects of antibiotics on gene expression in a disc diffusion assay. The selected genes were hla and spa encoding α-hemolysin and Protein A, respectively and RNAIII, the effector molecule of the agr quorum sensing system. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, we monitored the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on the ability of S. aureus to form biofilm in a microtiter plate assay. The results show that sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations diversely modulate expression of RNAIII, hla and spa. Consistently, expression of all three genes were repressed by aminoglycosides and induced by fluoroquinolones and penicillins. In contrast, the β-lactam sub-group cephalosporins enhanced expression of RNAIII and hla but <b>diversely</b> <b>affected</b> expression of spa. The compounds cefalotin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ceftazidime and cefixine were found to up-regulate spa, while down-regulation was observed for cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefepime. Interestingly, biofilm assays demonstrated that the spa -inducing cefalotin resulted in less biofilm formation compared to the spa -repressing cefotaxime. Conclusions We find that independently of the cephalosporin generation, cephalosporins oppositely regulate spa expression and biofilm formation. Repression of spa expression correlates with the presence of a distinct methyloxime group while induction correlates with an acidic substituted oxime group. As cephalosporines target the cell wall penicillin binding proteins we speculate that subtle differences in this interaction fine-tunes spa expression independently of agr. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{predictive}} {{factors of}} outcome after ossiculoplasty using a standard ossicular prosthesis system. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 140 ossiculoplasties, {{performed by the}} same senior surgeon, with titanium prostheses. SETTINGS: Academic hospital and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: All patients undergoing ossiculoplasty with Spiggle and Theis or Kurz titanium total and partial prostheses. Documented, postoperative follow-up had to be provided. A total of 129 patients (140 ears; 53 men and 76 women) were evaluated. INTERVENTIONS: These included ossiculoplasties using 75 Spiggle and Theis prostheses (30 partial and 45 total) and 65 Kurz prostheses (35 partial and 30 total). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps and the changes in mean hearing loss were analyzed using a four-frequency (500, 1, 000, 2, 000, and 3, 000 Hz) pure tone average. Success rate was defined as postoperative air-bone gap within 20 dB. A {{one-way analysis of variance}} was used to analyze group differences. A multivariate statistical analysis was then undertaken to define the significant factors. RESULTS: There were no statistical difference between the Spiggle and Theis and the Kurz prostheses. Multivariate statistical analysis has identified the predictive value of {{the presence or absence of}} the malleus handle and the mucosal status of the middle ear in the prognosis of ossiculoplasties. CONCLUSION: Anatomical and technical factors <b>diversely</b> <b>affect</b> the functional outcome of tympano-ossiculoplasties. A better knowledge of their predictive value will enable accurate, preoperative, individual assessment when counseling patients with regard to the success of any proposed intervention. The use of these factors will also permit precise matching of future series to allow accurate comparisons...|$|R
40|$|Aging is {{characterized}} by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state called “inflammaging”. Mitochondria are the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which trigger the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. We are interested in studying the age-related modifications of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which can be affected by the lifelong exposure to ROS and are responsible of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, increasing evidences show that telomere shortening, naturally occurring with aging, is involved in mtDNA damage processes and thus in the pathogenesis of age-related disorders. Thus the primary aim of this thesis was the analysis of mtDNA copy number, deletion level and integrity in different-age human biopsies from liver, vastus lateralis skeletal muscle of healthy subjects and patients with limited mobility of lower limbs (LMLL), as well as adipose tissue. The telomere length and the expression of nuclear genes related to mitobiogenesis, fusion and fission, mitophagy, mitochondrial protein quality control system, hypoxia, production and protection from ROS were also evaluated. In liver the decrease in mtDNA integrity with age is accompanied with an increase in mtDNA copy number, suggesting the existence of a “compensatory mechanism” able to maintain the functionality of this organ. Different is the case of vastus lateralis muscle, where any “compensatory pathway” is activated and mtDNA integrity and copy number decrease with age, both in healthy subjects and in patients. Interestingly, mtDNA rearrangements do not incur in adipose tissue with advancing age. Finally, in all tissues a marked gender difference appears, suggesting that aging and also gender <b>diversely</b> <b>affect</b> mtDNA rearrangements and telomere length in the three human tissues considered, likely depending on their different metabolic needs and inflammatory status...|$|R
40|$|The current {{pattern of}} {{industrial}} development in Arab settlements in Israel represents, above all, adaptation to restructuring processes operating throughout the Israeli economy. The result {{may be viewed}} as a form of peripheral industrialization of small plants specializing in less-advanced industrial production. The peripheralization process and the fact that Israeli Arab industry has remained marginal to the national economy should be understood {{in the context of the}} structural conditions in which Arab entrepreneurship is embedded. The impact of three forces is stressed: government policy, large corporations, and the internal sociocultural properties peculiar to the Arab population in Israel. The resulting form of industrialization is based on restructuring processes formatted as a number of distinctive development stages, which must be understood within the wider framework of Israel's economic restructuring. The dominant form of capitalist production affected the transformation of the Israeli Arab economy at each period, from state management to corporate dominance, and currently succeeded by a new accumulation regime affected by globalization processes. Furthermore, majority - minority relations affected it with each pole embedded in its own ethnic milieu. These majority - minority relations, supported by a selective government policy, have since been superseded by the relations conducted between the Jewish-dominated core and the Israeli-Arab-subordinated periphery. The result of this process has <b>diversely</b> <b>affected</b> both economic poles, and continues to influence the form of Arab industrialization, branch selection, and rate of plant openings. Furthermore, the result is a failure by Arab entrepreneurs to penetrate the more privileged sectors of the national economy, partly because of the failure of the Israeli political and economic elite to respond to Arab efforts at expansion into the larger economy. ...|$|R
