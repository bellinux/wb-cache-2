Sera were tested by ELISAs for antibody to candidal mannan and a major cytoplasmic antigen. Twenty episodes of induction chemotherapy were accompanied by invasive <b>candidiasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin,</b> esophagus, or deeper organs. Levels of antibody to mannan rose more than 2. 75 times normal activity in nine of these episodes and were already above this level in all sera in two episodes. Levels of antibody to mannan exceeded 2. 75 times normal in {{only two of the}} remaining episodes in which invasive candidiasis was not observed. An eightfold in-crease in antibody to mannan occurred at some point in five of the 20 episodes compli-cated by invasive candidiasis but in only one of the remaining 80 episodes.

40|$|Introduction. Autoimmune polyglandular {{syndrome}} type 1 (APS- 1) {{is a type}} of polyendocrinopathy, inherited in an {{autosomal recessive}} manner. Beside the classic triad <b>of</b> symptoms (<b>candidiasis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>skin</b> and mucous membranes, hypoparathyroidism and Addison’s disease), other skin and systemic diseases may be present. Objective. To present a patient with history of APS- 1, in whom in addition to the classic triad of symptoms vitiligo, alopecia, and dental enamel hypoplasia and nail dystrophy were observed. Case report. A 43 -year-old patient, with a history of APS- 1 syndrome, was admitted to the hospital because <b>of</b> exacerbation <b>of</b> <b>candidiasis</b> <b>of</b> the mucous membranes of the mouth. Additionally, dystrophy of the nails and the dental enamel, generalized alopecia and extensive vitiligo were observed. Due to antifungal treatment partial clinical improvement was achieved.

Poly(I. C), a potent inducer of interferons (IFNs) in vivo, enhanced the susceptibility of CB- 17 SCID mice to acute systemic candidiasis and to systemic <b>candidiasis</b> <b>of</b> endogenous origin, as demonstrated by increased numbers of viable Candida albicans in internal organs after poly(I.

In vivo depletion of natural killer cells from SCID mice did not significantly enhance their susceptibility to systemic candidiasis or abrogate poly(I. C) -enhanced susceptibility. In vivo and in vitro, treatment with poly(I. C) impaired the candidacidal and phagocytic activity of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages from SCID mice. Antibody to IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-beta alone interfered with the ability of poly(I. C) to impair the candidacidal activity of macrophages from SCID mice in vitro. These data suggest that poly(I.

All patients had histologically proven IBD and no prior surgery for IBD. Loop ileostomy (n = 4), end colostomy (n = 1), ileocecal resection (n = 26) and (procto) colectomy (n = 13) were performed.

40|$|Objective: Candidiasis {{caused by}} Candida species has been {{reported}} worldwide in humans. In a study conducted in 1998 with samples of vaginal discharges of outpatients and prostitutes in İstanbul, a prevelance <b>of</b> <b>candidiasis</b> <b>of</b> 30. 3 % and 11. 4 %, respectively was found. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the changes in the rate <b>of</b> <b>candidiasis</b> in prostitutes and outpatients during the past ten years. Method: Vaginal discharge samples of 207 patients with suspected trichomoniasis vaginitis were examined. The samples were obtained from 93 prostitutes admitted to the Hospital <b>of</b> <b>Skin</b> and Venereal Diseases and from 114 outpatients admitted to Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Outpatient Clinic. Smears prepared from the samples were examined under a microscope by Gram staining. Additionally, Candida culture tests were performed by inoculating a fluid and a solid Sabouraud medium. Results: Candida was identified in 31 (14. 9 %) of the 207 samples of vaginal discharges examined, while yeast cells were detected in 25 of them (80. 7 %) by Gram staining. Twenty-one (67. 7 %) of the Candidaidentified, belonged to the species Candida albicans,five (16. 1 %) were Candida krusei, two (6. 5 %) Candidatropicalis and three (9. 7 %) Candida spp [...] Candida wasreported in 10 (10. 8 %) of the 93 prostitutes, and in 21 (18. 4 %) of outpatients.

40|$|Abstract—Biothermomechanics <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> {{tissue is}} highly interdisciplinary, {{involving}} bioheat transfer, burn damage, biomechanics and physiology. Characterization of the thermomechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue is <b>of</b> great importance and {{can contribute to}} a variety of medical applications. However, few quantitative studies have been conducted on the temperature dependent mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue. This paper reports the tensile and compressive behaviours <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue under different temperatures and discusses the effect of temperature and corresponding dermal collagen denaturation on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue. The results show that temperature has great influence on both the tensile and compressive properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue, but the mechanisms are different. The variation <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tensile properties is caused by the thermal denaturation <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> collagen with increasing temperature, while the variation <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> compressive behaviour <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue is maybe due to the hydration change with thermal denaturation.

Methods and results. 120 patients with acne were examined. In 100 <b>of</b> them concomitant <b>skin</b> malasseziosis was set in the form of pityriasis rosea, kerosis, comedones, folliculitis, seborrhea, multicolored zoster, with some features, as well as <b>candidiasis.</b> Methods <b>of</b> the research – bacterioscopic, bacteriological, study <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> oiliness and moisture, skin pH, the level of Ca ++, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. In patients with acne significant shifts in the composition of water-lipid mantle, increased oiliness and decreased moisture <b>of</b> <b>skin,</b> pH changes with a shift to the alkaline side were revealed, the most pronounced – in acne patients with Candida infection. The content of Ca ++ in the organism, as well as parathyroid hormone and calcitonin was increased and also the most indicative it was in patients with acne and concomitant Candida infection.

The alimentary tracts of all six genotypes of germfree mice were quickly colonized after exposure to yeast-phase C. albicans. Only bg/bg nu/nu mice showed obvious morbidity and mortality after mucosal colonization with C. albicans. Histopathology of C. albicans-colonized immunocompetent (nu/+, bg/+) and singly immunodeficient (nu/nu, bg/bg, bg/bg nu/+) mice showed minimal to moderate mucosal infections, whereas doubly immunodeficient (bg/bg nu/nu) mice showed extensive yeast and hyphal infection of the palate, tongue, esophagus, and stomach. A progressive systemic infection in C. albicans-colonized mice occurred only in bg/bg nu/nu mice 12 to 16 weeks after colonization and mucosal infection. Thus, it appears that a combination of defective cell-mediated immunity and phagocytic cell defects (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and/or macrophages) predisposed mice to severe mucosal and systemic <b>candidiasis</b> <b>of</b> endogenous origin.
