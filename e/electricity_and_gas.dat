The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006, when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters.

In recent years, Indian cities have continued to liberalise, but excessive and burdensome business regulations remain a problem in some cities, like Kochi and Kolkata.|$|E

Among these is the Trans-National Industrial <b>Electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gas</b> Company, an energy conglomerate founded in 2010 that unites five major Somali companies from the trade, finance, security and telecommunications sectors. Other firms based in the city include Hormuud Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in southern and central Somalia. Telcom is another telecommunications service provider that is centered in the capital. The local Somali Energy Company specializes in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to residents and businesses within its service area in Banaadir. Villa and Mansion Architects, an international architectural firm founded by the Somali-British architect Alexander Yusuf, likewise has its regional offices in Mogadishu. Additionally, the International Bank of Somalia, which opened downtown in 2014, offers Islamic finance and international banking services via a swift code system. The Islamic Insurance Company (First Takaful and Re-Takaful Insurance Company) was concurrently established, and is the city's first full service insurance firm in many years. The Central Bank of Somalia, the national monetary authority, also has its headquarters in Mogadishu.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or <b>electricity,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was simply not enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} integrated robust model coordinates the day-ahead scheduling of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> systems while considering {{power system}} uncertainties <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> system operation cost. Couplings between <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> systems are rigorously formulated via the coordinated operation of gas-fired units and PtG facilities.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{a coordinated}} {{operation}} model of energy system which integrates <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> infrastructures is formulated. The model includes constraints for both <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> transmission networks. Then, a three-stage robust optimization algorithm {{is presented to}} solve the defender-attacker-defender problem of the integrated energy system when contingencies occur. The constraints and operational features of natural <b>gas</b> system <b>and</b> the coupling of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> networks make it more complicated to settle the plans for both attackers and defenders. In the first stage, as defender, the integrated energy system must make plans for network enhancement to minimize {{the damage caused by}} unpredictable attacks. In the second stage, attackers will attack vulnerable components of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> networks to cause maximum damage to the entire energy system. In the last stage, defender responds to the results of disruptions, which is formulated as optimal energy flow of integrated <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> system. As some of the constraints of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> transmission networks are nonlinear, Taylor series expansion algorithm is applied to realize the linearization. Then, the proposed three-stage robust optimization problem is reformulated into a two-stage optimization problem by the application of duality theory. The two-stage problem can be solved as an MILP by decomposition algorithms.|$|R

25|$|CFLs are {{extremely}} cost-effective in commercial buildings when used to replace incandescent lamps. Using average U.S. commercial <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> rates for 2006, a 2008 article found that replacing each 75 W incandescent lamp with a CFL resulted in yearly savings of $22 in energy usage, reduced HVAC cost, and reduced labour to change lamps. The incremental capital investment of $2 per fixture is typically paid back in about one month. Savings are greater and payback periods shorter in regions with higher electric rates and, {{to a lesser}} extent, also in regions with higher than U.S. average cooling requirements. However, frequent on-off cycling (turning on and off) of CFLs greatly reduces their lifespan.|$|E

25|$|By law all {{urban areas}} in Colombia are {{classified}} {{in one of}} six socio-economic strata, which are {{used to determine the}} level of tariffs for electricity, water and other services. According to that system, consumers living in areas considered as poor - and consumers using low amounts of electricity - receive electricity and natural gas at subsidized tariffs. These cross-subsidies are almost entirely (approximately 98 percent) financed by consumers living in areas considered as being relatively affluent and who use more electricity. The cross-subsidies cover about 25 percent of the <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> bill of low-income consumers. A special fund that covers the remaining amount not covered by consumers provided US$21.8 million in 2005. On average, 7.5 million people a month benefited from this fund.

500|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> {{companies}} rely on weather forecasts {{to anticipate}} demand, {{which can be}} strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating (heating degree day) or cooling (cooling degree day).

In winter, severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as people turn up their heating. Similarly, in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather. By anticipating a surge in demand, utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases, or in some circumstances, supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts.|$|E
