5|$|<b>Her</b> <b>political</b> {{observations}} are clearly written {{from her own}} Tory viewpoint. However, her {{detailed description of the}} rivalry for power between the Tories and Liberals which took place between 1822 and 1830 {{is one of the most}} authoritative accounts of this struggle.|$|E
5|$|Failing {{to gather}} enough {{support for a}} floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats {{controlled}} both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that <b>her</b> <b>political</b> inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44percent in April 1994 and 35percent by September 1994.|$|E

5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for <b>her</b> <b>political</b> activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E
5|$|Outside <b>her</b> <b>political</b> duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, {{accepted}} the honorary {{presidency of the}} Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague Edith Summerskill, a physician who wrote the anti-boxing tract The Ignoble Art, and campaigned for the sport's abolition.|$|E
5|$|Paulus began <b>her</b> <b>political</b> {{career by}} winning {{election}} to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1970. Elected as a Republican, she represented Salem and Marion County in District 11. She won re-election in 1972 and 1974 to additional two-year terms in the House with her district changing to District 31, serving through the 1975 special legislative session. Paulus was then elected as Oregon's first female Secretary of State in 1976, {{the first time a}} woman won election to a statewide office in Oregon.|$|E
50|$|Before {{writing her}} first novel, Shakib was a music {{journalist}} and a radio presenter. She also interviewed many musicians for television, including Miles Davis, Mick Jagger and Tina Turner. She often offered <b>her</b> own <b>political</b> observation and commentary during these interviews {{which led to}} <b>her</b> current <b>political</b> television shows for a young audience.|$|R

But I remember to have heard that the <b>Herring</b> <b>political</b> ring, which elected our Board of Education, proposed John Dyer for the position of school superintendent--and the Board promptly gave him the appointment." ...|$|R
5|$|Solis was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid; when that fell short, Barack Obama aggressively sought her support, as part of strengthening his appeal to Hispanic voters. She supported Clinton's effort to establish a U.S. Public Service Academy and was a co-sponsor of a House bill to create one. Solis did not become wealthy from <b>her</b> <b>political</b> career; by 2008, she and her husband's main assets consisted of retirement funds and his auto shop, valued at under $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain <b>her</b> <b>political</b> control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with many}} others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917. She saw {{communism}} as {{the shape of the}} future, and when the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members. For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of <b>her</b> <b>political</b> activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested <b>her</b> <b>political</b> intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. <b>Her</b> <b>political</b> views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Before Stanton narrowed <b>her</b> <b>political</b> focus almost {{exclusively}} to women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|Bondfield's brother Frank had {{established}} himself in London some years earlier as a printer and trades unionist, and in 1894, having saved £5, {{she decided to}} join him. She found London shopworking conditions no better than in Brighton, but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became {{an active member of}} the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings. <b>Her</b> <b>political</b> and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP).|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{several of}} the {{children}} were approaching the age to attend university and the family sought to move somewhere of a more congenial educational climate than Spain. That September, they moved to the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel near Brussels, where they were closer to several members of their family. Zita continued <b>her</b> <b>political</b> lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family, even sounding out links with Mussolini's Italy. There was even a possibility of a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times. These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. As exiles, the Habsburg family took the lead in resisting the Nazis in Austria, but this foundered because of opposition between monarchists and socialists.|$|E
5|$|Cher {{has won a}} Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival Award, and {{a special}} CFDA Fashion Award, among several other honors. She has sold 100 million records {{worldwide}} to date, {{becoming one of the}} best-selling music artists in history. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a Billboard chart in each decade from the 1960s to the 2010s. Outside of her music and acting, she is noted for <b>her</b> <b>political</b> views, philanthropic endeavors, and social activism, including LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS prevention.|$|E

She released <b>her</b> <b>political</b> memoir, My Story, in September 2014. She has been {{on the board of the}} mental health organisation beyondblue since December 2014 and its chair since July 2017, and was made an honorary fellow of Aberystwyth University in June 2015. Gillard has also served as the chairwoman of the Global Partnership for Education since February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by <b>her</b> <b>political</b> action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{reassessment}} of James {{in the past}} two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least {{for as long as the}} royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that <b>her</b> <b>political</b> interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E
