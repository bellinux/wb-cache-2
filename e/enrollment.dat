40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} incentive payment programs in eliciting, estimating, and predicting landowners’ conservation <b>enrollments.</b> Using both program participation {{and the amount of}} land enrolled, we develop two econometric approaches for predicting <b>enrollments.</b> The first is a multivariate censored regression model that handles zero <b>enrollments</b> and heterogeneity in the opportunity cost of <b>enrollments</b> by combining an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of <b>enrollments</b> with alternative-specific correlation and random parameters. The second is a beta-binomial model, which recognizes that in practice elicited <b>enrollments</b> are essentially integer valued. We apply these approaches to Finland, where the protection of private nonindustrial forests is an important environmental policy problem.

The beta-binomial model also facilitates policy predictions and simulations, which we use to illustrate the framework. protection, endangered, voluntary, incentive, tobit, beta-binomial, stated preferences...|$|R
