5000|$|The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) {{specifies}} that {{engineering controls}} are preferential when reducing the noise levels at the source. The use of hearing protective devices {{is considered an}} [...] "interim protective measure" [...] while engineering controls are developed. The goal of these controls is to reduce ambient steady-state noise levels to 85 dBA regardless of TWA exposure and to reduce impulse noise levels to below 140 dBP. The DOD requires that personnel be entered into a hearing conservation program when continuous snd <b>intermittent</b> <b>noise</b> levels ale grs {{greater than or equal}} to 85 dBA TWA, when impulse SPL are at or in excess of 140 dBP, or when the personnel is exposed to ultrasonic frequencies. The DOD integrates all sound levels between 80 dBA to a minimum of 130 dBA when determining an individual or representative noise dose. When used, hearing protectors must be capable of attenuating worker noise exposure below 85 dBA TWA. Hearing protection is required to be carried by personnel who work in designated noise areas, such as those exposed to gunfire or ordnance tests and Service musicians. The DOD defines a significant threshold shift as a 10 dB average decrease in hearing thresholds at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz in either ear, with no age corrections. It is further specified that a shift in 15 dB at 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hz is an early warning sign for an STS; follow-up retraining is required in this case. (DOD Instruction 6055.12).|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to compare disturbance of reading by noises from various sources. Fourteen real noises were selected in one experiment, which were two isolated bursts of sound energy, two quasi-steady impulsive noises, three fluctuating <b>noises,</b> three <b>intermittent</b> <b>noises,</b> two noises from mixed noise sources, one steady noise and the other noise. These noises except for the mixed noises are typical ones classified in ISO 2204 according to level fluctuation. In another experiment, fourteen simulated pink noises were used and their sound levels fluctuated {{in the same way}} as those of real noises. Leq of these noises were equal to about 70 dB(A) and their duration were six minutes. It was found that high disturbance was caused by noises which greatly fluctuated, that is, more contained high sound level even in equal Leq. These noises are an aircraft noise, a complex noise which contained aircraft noise and their simulated pink noises. There was high correlation between disturbance and percentile levels like L 1, or L 5 of experimental noises both in real noise and particularly in pink noise. These support the dB(A) peak concept proposed by Rylander et al. It is therefore suggested that unified noise index should contain this finding. In addition, a tentative noise index which could evaluate noises from various sourced was shown. The concept of Flindell's pressure Leq was extended and applied to this index. Using this index, it is possible that findings of other researches are reasonably accounted for...|$|R

But the evaluation method of rapidly fluctuating noise, for example, impulsive or <b>intermittent</b> <b>noise,</b> is not yet established.

The relation between PSE and fluctuation factors was investigated to obtain fundamental data to evaluate general non-steady noises on noisiness.

Using this model, neurochemical changes, that were maximal at 3 - 5 days and subsiding by day 10, were observed unilaterally in the insular cortex and amygdala. The amygdalar neurochemical changes {{may be related to}} the stroke-induced cardiovascular disturbances, since the amygdala is critical in mediating the cardiovascular responses to stress. We examined the cardiovascular responses to intermittent and continuous noise and air-jet stimulation in male Wistar rats on days 2 - 10 after right-sided MCAO or sham MCAO. Compared to the sham MCAO rats, <b>intermittent</b> <b>noise</b> elicited significant tachycardiac responses on days 5 and 7 after stroke. Air-jet stimulation also elicited a significant tachycardic response on day 5, whereas continuous noise produced significant tachycardiac and pressor responses at days 5 and 7, respectively, in the MCAO rats compared to the control rats. Analyses on the heart rate variability using fast Fourier transformation revealed significant increases in the normalized mid-frequency spectral power on day 7 for <b>intermittent</b> <b>noise</b> and air-jet stimulation, suggesting increases in the sympathetic activity.

In general, the spectra can be fit to a power law, 1 /fα, although in the p-type and undoped samples deviations from a strict power law occur. For n-type and p-type samples, the noise magnitude increases with temperature by approximately a factor of 5 from 295 to 450 K. The slope parameter, α, also increases with temperature in the p-type samples from near unity to 1. 4 but not in the n-type sample where it remains near 1. 05 independent of temperature. The undoped sample could be measured only over a limited range of elevated temperatures, but α does trend larger. The undoped and lightly doped material have similar noise levels but larger p-type doping reduces the noise by two orders of magnitude.
