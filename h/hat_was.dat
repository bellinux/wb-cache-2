It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E

The album met with mixed reviews from critics; some felt that the album represented an artistic misstep for Yankovic, whereas others enjoyed its skewering of early 2000s popular culture. The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200. The album also peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Comedy Albums chart, making it the first of Yankovic's records to earn a position on said chart.|$|E
5|$|Chester J. Lampwick created Itchy for the now-lost silent cartoon Manhattan Madness, {{in which}} the mouse brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt, in 1919 (the year of the first Felix the Cat cartoon). However, the {{character}} was later stolen by Roger Meyers. Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928, titled That Happy Cat. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his <b>hat,</b> <b>was</b> a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together, Steamboat Itchy, a violent parody of Disney's Steamboat Willie. Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a World War II-era radio series, at least two films — Pinitchio and Scratchtasia (parodies of Pinocchio and Fantasia), and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.|$|E

Typically it was made of velvet or felt. Mary Brooks Picken noted that the <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> generally small in its original incarnation, often with the brim turned up on one or both sides, with what were generally ostrich feathers as a trim.

50|$|After {{the desired}} colors are obtained, the caña flecha strips are {{woven into the}} braids {{that are used to}} form the sombrero. This can take many days, {{depending}} on the desired quality. The olma, or central part of the top of the <b>hat,</b> <b>is</b> {{the first part of the}} <b>hat</b> to <b>be</b> woven. The crown of the hat and later the wings are made. Once the manual part of constructing the <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> finished, the <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> completed by using a foot-driven sewing machine to sew the hat together.|$|R

25|$|Through the 1570s, a {{soft fabric}} {{hat with a}} {{gathered}} crown was worn.

Later, a conical felt hat with a rounded crown called a capotain or copotain became fashionable. These became very tall {{toward the end of}} century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or feather, and were worn indoors and out.|$|E
25|$|The new outfit {{included}} a full-length burgundy overcoat and wide-brimmed fedora, a matching blazer (worn under the overcoat) and trousers, and a vest worn over a specially-made white dress shirt.

Tzesar is a film director who was imprisoned before he could finish his first feature film.

His somewhat higher class background assures him food parcels.|$|E
5000|$|Wearing <b>hats</b> <b>is</b> also {{a part of}} {{traditional}} Manchu culture, and Manchu people wear hats in all ages and seasons in contrast to the Han Chinese culture of [...] "Starting to wear hats at 20 year-old" [...] (二十始冠), [...] Manchu <b>hats</b> <b>are</b> either formal or casual, formal hats being made in two different styles, straw for spring and summer, and fur for fall and winter.
