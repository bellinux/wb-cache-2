5000|$|<b>Epalrestat</b> is a {{carboxylic}} acid derivative and a noncompetitive and reversible aldose reductase inhibitor {{used for the}} treatment of diabetic neuropathy, {{which is one of the}} most common long-term complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. It reduces the accumulation of intracellular sorbitol which is believed to be the cause of diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy [...] It is well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse effects being gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, as well as increases in certain liver enzymes.Chemically, <b>epalrestat</b> is unusual in that it is a drug that contains a rhodanine group.Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in the polyol pathway whose enhanced activity is the basis of diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) target this enzyme. Out of the many ARIs developed, ranirestat and fidarestat are in the trial stage.

50|$|The {{treatment}} for galactosemic cataract {{is no different}} from general galactosemia treatment. In fact, galactosemic cataract {{is one of the few}} symptoms that is actually reversible. Infants should be immediately removed from a galactose diet when symptoms present, and the cataract should disappear and visibility should return to normal. Aldose reductase inhibitors, such as sorbinil, have also proven promising in preventing and reversing galactosemic cataracts. AR inhibitors hinder aldose reductase from synthesizing galactitol in the lens, and thus restricts the osmotic swelling of the lens fibers. Other AR inhibitors include the acetic acid compounds zopolrestat, tolrestat, alrestatin, and <b>epalrestat.</b> Many of these compounds have not been successful in clinical trials due to adverse pharmokinetic properties, inadequate efficacy and efficiency, and toxic side effects. Testing on such drug-treatments continues in order to determine potential long-term complications, and for a more detailed mechanism of how AR inhibitors prevent and reverse the galactosemic cataract.|$|E
5000|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is recognized}} as {{a leading cause of}} new cases of blindness, and is associated with increased risk for painful neuropathy, heart disease and kidney failure. Many theories have been advanced to explain mechanisms leading to diabetic complications, including stimulation of glucose metabolism by the polyol pathway. Additionally, the enzyme is located in the eye (cornea, retina, lens), kidney, and the myelin sheath-tissues that are often involved in diabetic complications. [...] Under normal glycemic conditions, {{only a small fraction of}} glucose is metabolized through the polyol pathway, as the majority is phosphorylated by hexokinase, and the resulting product, glucose-6-phosphate, is utilized as a substrate for glycolysis or pentose phosphate metabolism. However, in response to the chronic hyperglycemia found in diabetics, glucose flux through the polyol pathway is significantly increased. Up to 33% of total glucose utilization in some tissues can be through the polyol pathway.Glucose concentrations are often elevated in diabetics and aldose reductase has long been believed to be responsible for diabetic complications involving a number of organs. Many aldose reductase inhibitors have been developed as drug candidates but virtually all have failed although some such as <b>epalrestat</b> are commercially available in several countries. Additional reductase inhibitors such as ranirestat, ponalrestat, rinalrestat, risarestat, sorbinil, and berberine are currently in clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the effect of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) on the activation of the polyol pathway and on diabetic neuropathy has not been fully established.

After 6 months of <b>epalrestat</b> administration, erythrocyte sorbitol levels did not decrease in patients as a whole. However, a decrease in erythrocyte sorbitol levels during <b>epalrestat</b> administration was significantly correlated with baseline erythrocyte sorbitol levels (ρ=-. 47, P<. 01) : The higher the level at baseline, the greater the decrease after <b>epalrestat</b> treatment.

40|$|Rhodanines, thiazolidine- 2, 4 -diones and pseudothiohydantoins {{have become}} a very {{interesting}} class of heterocyclic compounds since the introduction of various glitazones and <b>epalrestat</b> into clinical use {{for the treatment of}} type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications, respectively. Chemical modifications of these heterocycles constantly result in compounds with a widespectrum of pharmacological activities. 5 -Arylidenerhodanines are frequently identified as potent hits in high throughput screening against various prokaryotic and eukaryotic targets. Synthesis of substituted rhodanines, based on high throughput screening hits, often leads to potent andselective modulators of targeted enzymes or receptors, which exert their pharmacological activities through different mechanisms of action. Due to various possibilities of chemical derivatization of the rhodanine ring, rhodanine-based compounds will probably remain a privileged scaffold in drug discovery. We have therefore reviewed their biological activities, mechanism of action, structure activity relationship and selectivity against other targets...|$|E
40|$|New {{drugs for}} the {{inhibition}} of the enzyme aldose reductase are in development {{and they have}} to be screened before being considered for preclinical and clinical evaluation. The current study deals with the evaluation of the cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of flavonoids using in silico docking studies. In this perspective, flavonoids like bergapten, buceracidin-B, dorsilurin-F, communin-A, and coumestrol were selected. <b>Epalrestat,</b> a known aldose reductase inhibitor was used as the standard. Docking results showed that all the selected flavonoids showed binding energy ranging between - 7. 91 kcal/mol to - 5. 08 kcal/mol when compared with that of the standard (- 5. 59 kcal/mol). Intermolecular energy (- 9. 11 kcal/mol to - 8. 66 kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (1. 58 µM to 187. 37 µM) of the ligands also coincide with the binding energy. Communin-A contributed better aldose reductase inhibitory activity because of its structural parameters...|$|E
40|$|Aldose reductase reduces glucose to sorbitol. It plays a {{key role}} in many of the {{complications}} arising from diabetes. Thus, aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) have been identified as promising therapeutic agents for treating such complications of diabetes, as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cataracts. In this paper, a virtual screening protocol applied to a library of compounds in house has been utilized to discover novel ARIs. IC 50 &# 039;s were determined for 15 hits that inhibited ALR 2 to greater than 50 % at 50 uM, and ten of these have an IC 50 of 10 uM or less, corresponding to a rather substantial hit rate of 14 % at this level. The specificity of these compounds relative to their cross-reactivity with human ALR 1 was also assessed by inhibition assays. This resulted in identification of novel inhibitors with IC 50 &# 039;s comparable to the commercially available drug, <b>epalrestat,</b> and greater than an order of magnitude better selectivity...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the aldose reductase inhibitory activity of flavonoids using in silico docking studies. In this perspective, flavonoids like biochanin, butein, esculatin, fisetin and herbacetin were selected. <b>Epalrestat,</b> a known aldose reductase inhibitor was used as the standard. In silico docking studies were carried out using AutoDock 4. 2, based on the Lamarckian genetic algorithm principle. The results showed that all the selected flavonoids showed binding energy ranging between - 9. 33 kcal/mol to - 7. 23 kcal/mol when compared with that of the standard (- 8. 73 kcal/mol). Inhibition constant (144. 13 µM to 4. 98 µM) and intermolecular energy (- 11. 42 kcal/mol to - 7. 83 kcal/mol) of the flavonoids also coincide with the binding energy. All the selected flavonoids contributed aldose reductase inhibitory activity because of its structural properties.

40|$|Diabetic {{neuropathy}} (DN) is a {{group of}} multifactorial disorder in diabetic patients, which affects neuronal function of the whole body and is accompanied by nephropathy and angiopathy. Its prevalence increases with duration of diabetes and hyperglycaemia which can induce oxidative stress resulting in activation of multiple pathways which can damage the neurons alone or in combination. Symptoms of DN are prominent early in type 2 than in type 1. Neuropathic pain which can occur continuously only in 20 - 30 % of the patients, otherwise pain was not reported. The drugs available for DN were not able to cure the disease but provide only symptomatic relief and were also associated with major side effects. Current therapy provided in this review alleviates the symptoms in clinical trials and thus will be recommended in order to stop the progression of disease. Despite the recent understanding regarding the pathogenesis of disease, till date only two drugs were approved by FDA for DN, α-lipoic acid is available in several countries and <b>epalrestat</b> in Japan, which is also associated with side effects but they are tolerable...|$|E

Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 20 (19), 5630 - 5633. IMPF: 02. 66 Sponsorship: Czech Science Foundation 525 / 08 /H 060; Institutional Research Project MZE 0002701404 We {{report the}} structure?activity relationship {{of a series}} of coumarins as aldose reductase 2 (ALR 2) inhibitors and their suppressive effect on the accumulation of galactitol in the rat lens. We evaluated their ALR 2 selectivity profile against sorbitol dehydrogenase and aldehyde reductase (ALR 1). Our study revealed that substitutions in the C 7 OH group enhanced the potency toward ALR 2, while the C 6 OH group interferes with ALR 1 inhibition activity. Having the phenyl moiety at C 4 leads to improved potency and improved selectivity. A molecular docking study suggested that 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 4 -phenylcoumarin (15) binds to ALR 2 in a different manner from <b>epalrestat.</b> Furthermore, compound 15 clearly suppressed galactitol accumulation in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|Hyperglycemia in {{diabetic}} patients {{results in}} a diverse range of complications such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular diseases. The role of aldose reductase (AR), the key enzyme in the polyol pathway, in these complications is well established. Due to notable side-effects of several drugs, phytochemicals as an alternative has gained considerable importance {{for the treatment of}} several ailments. In order to evaluate the inhibitory effects of dietary spices on AR, a collection of phytochemicals were identified from Zingiber officinale (ginger), Curcuma longa (turmeric) Allium sativum (garlic) and Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek). Molecular docking was performed for lead identification and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic behaviour of these protein-ligand interactions. Gingerenones A, B and C, lariciresinol, quercetin and calebin A from these spices exhibited high docking score, binding affinity and sustained protein-ligand interactions. Rescoring of protein ligand interactions at the end of MD simulations produced binding scores that were better than the initially docked conformations. Docking results, ligand interactions and ADMET properties of these molecules were significantly better than commercially available AR inhibitors like <b>epalrestat,</b> sorbinil and ranirestat. Thus, these natural molecules could be potent AR inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) {{injury is}} a {{critical}} condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Studies show that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can protect the intestine from I/R injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this event have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, 2 -DE combined with MALDI-MS was employed to analyze intestinal mucosa proteomes of rat subjected to I/R injury in the absence or presence of IPC pretreatment. The protein content of 16 proteins in the intestinal mucosa changed more than 1. 5 -fold following intestinal I/R. These proteins were, respectively, involved in the cellular processes of energy metabolism, anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis. One of these proteins, aldose reductase (AR), removes reactive oxygen species. In support of the 2 -DE results, the mRNA and protein expressions of AR were significantly downregulated upon I/R injury and enhanced by IPC as confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Further study showed that AR-selective inhibitor <b>epalrestat</b> totally turned over the protective effect of IPC, indicating that IPC confers protection against intestinal I/R injury primarily by increasing intestinal AR expression. The finding that AR may play a key in intestinal ischemic protection might offer evidences to foster {{the development of new}} therapies against intestinal I/R injury. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} ranirestat, a new aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI), on diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rats. Methods. The animals were divided into six groups, normal Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 8), untreated SDT rats (n= 9), ranirestat-treated SDT rats (0. 1, 1. 0, and 10 [*]mg/kg/day, n= 7,  8, and   6, resp.), and epalrestat-treated SDT rats (100 [*]mg/kg/day, n= 7). Treated rats received oral ranirestat or <b>epalrestat</b> once daily for 40 weeks after the onset of diabetes. After the eyes were enucleated, the retinal thickness and the area of stained glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured. Results. The retinas in the untreated group were significantly thicker {{than those in the}} normal and ranirestat-treated (0. 1, 1. 0, and 10 [*]mg/kg/day) groups. The immunostained area of GFAP in the untreated group was significantly larger than that in the normal and ranirestat-treated (1. 0 and 10 [*]mg/kg/day) groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} the untreated group and epalrestat-treated group in the retinal thickness and the area of stained GFAP. Conclusion. Ranirestat reduced the retinal thickness and the area of stained GFAP in SDT rats and might suppress DR and have a neuroprotective effect on diabetic retinas...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{significant}} need for new antibiotics due to the rise in drug resistance. Drugs such as methicillin and vancomycin target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, but methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) have now arisen and are of major concern. Inhibitors acting on new targets in cell wall biosynthesis are thus of particular interest since they might also restore sensitivity to existing drugs, and the cis-prenyl transferase undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS), essential for lipid I, lipid II, and thus, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is one such target. We used 12 UPPS crystal structures to validate virtual screening models and then assayed 100 virtual hits (from 450, 000 compounds) against UPPS from S. aureus and Escherichia coli. The most promising inhibitors (IC 50 ∼ 2 μM, Ki ∼ 300 nM) had activity against MRSA, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, and a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. with MIC or IC 50 values in the 0. 25 − 4 μg/mL range. Moreover, one compound (1), a rhodanine with close structural similarity to the commercial diabetes drug <b>epalrestat,</b> exhibited good activity {{as well as a}} fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0. 1 with methicillin against the community-acquired MRSA USA 300 strain, indicating strong synergism...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epalrestat</b> (EPS), {{approved}} in Japan, {{is the only}} aldose reductase inhibitor that is currently available {{for the treatment of}} diabetic neuropathy. Here we report that EPS at near-plasma concentration increases the intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH), which is important for protection against oxidative injury, through transcription regulation. Treatment of Schwann cells with EPS caused a dramatic increase in intracellular GSH levels. EPS increased the mRNA levels of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), the enzyme catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step in de novo GSH synthesis. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is a key transcription factor that plays a central role in regulating the expression of γ-GCS. ELISA revealed that EPS increased nuclear Nrf 2 levels. Knockdown of Nrf 2 by siRNA suppressed the EPS-induced GSH biosynthesis. Furthermore, pretreatment with EPS reduced the cytotoxicity induced by H 2 O 2, tert-butylhydroperoxide, 2, 2 '-azobis (2 -amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, and menadione, indicating that EPS plays a role in protecting against oxidative stress. This is the first study to show that EPS induces GSH biosynthesis via the activation of Nrf 2. We suggest that EPS has new beneficial properties that may prevent the development and progression of disorders caused by oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{encephalopathy}} (DE) {{is often}} a complication in patients with Alzheimer’s disease due to high blood sugar induced by diabetic mellitus. Ergothioneine (EGT) and hispidin (HIP) are antioxidants present in Phellinus linteus. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a toxic precursor of advanced glycated end products (AGEs), is responsible for protein glycation. We investigated whether a combination EGT and HIP (EGT[*]+[*]HIP) protects against MGO-induced neuronal cell damage. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells were preincubated with EGT (2 [*]μM), HIP (2 [*]μM), or EGT[*]+[*]HIP, then challenged with MGO under high-glucose condition (30 [*]μM MGO[*]+[*] 30 [*]mM glucose; GLU[*]+[*]MGO) for 24 – 96 [*]h. GLU[*]+[*]MGO markedly increased protein carbonyls and reactive oxygen species in PC 12 cells; both of these levels were strongly reduced by EGT or HIP with effects {{comparable to those of}} 100 [*]nM aminoguanidine (an AGE inhibitor) but stronger than those of 10 [*]μM <b>epalrestat</b> (an aldose reductase inhibitor). GLU[*]+[*]MGO significantly increased the levels of AGE and AGE receptor (RAGE) protein expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) in the cytosol, but treatment with EGT, HIP, or EGT[*]+[*]HIP significantly attenuated these levels. These results suggest that EGT and HIP protect against hyperglycemic damage in PC 12 cells by inhibiting the NF-κB transcription pathway through antioxidant activities...|$|E
