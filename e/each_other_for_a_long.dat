5|$|Series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean as a child. He also began {{developing}} his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these two interests would not overlap with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time—the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, receiving a major in marine biology and a minor in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Draza is Zoran Lazarevic's {{right-hand}} man and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Michael Benyaer in Uncharted 2 and by Fred Tatasciore in Uncharted 3. Lt. Draza is first seen with Lazarevic, {{when they first}} meet Nate face to face. Lazarevic gives him the Phurba from Nate. Later, when Chloe is taken to the train by Flynn, Nate tries to save her, but runs into Draza, {{who is in charge}} of the train. The two fight until Drake knocks Draza and takes back the Phurba. Draza wakes up and tries to strangle Drake, but is shot dead from behind by Chloe. According to some articles, Draza and Lazarevic have known <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. He uses an M4 carbine (a misnamed Colt Model 723) as his main weapon.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups of bats {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats, debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E

25|$|Richard was not {{personally}} {{responsible for the death}} of his wife's first husband, Edward of Westminster (the son of Henry VI), nor that of her father, Richard Neville (the Earl of Warwick). They were killed in the battles of Tewkesbury and Barnet, respectively, which restored Edward IV to the throne. Although only eighteen years old, Richard took part in both battles, but no contemporary records indicate him as being involved directly in either death. Richard was also not {{responsible for the death of}} Henry VI, who was probably murdered on the orders of Edward IV. Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, had known <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before they married, having spent much of their childhood in the same household. Henry VI's widow, Queen Margaret, would not have been seen at court since the much earlier Battle of Towton, which won the throne for Edward IV for the first time; she became Edward IV's prisoner until she returned to France. Richard was not responsible for the death of his elder brother, George (Duke of Clarence), who was executed by Edward IV for treason after he had rebelled against him. Richard was in the North of England when Edward IV died; this was five years after the execution of Clarence – and after a long period of peace.|$|E

Henry commented that [...] "from {{the very first}} day they met, my son and she got on as well together as if they had known <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time". On 4 April 1558, Mary signed a secret agreement bequeathing Scotland and her claim to England to the French crown if she died without issue. Twenty days later, she married the Dauphin at Notre Dame de Paris, and he became king consort of Scotland.|$|E

500|$|Gatiss {{noted that}} the Daleks belonged in World War II, as their mission to destroy {{everything}} {{that was not a}} Dalek was a very Nazi concept. In fact, Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks who had grown up during World War II, consciously based the Daleks on the Nazis. Smith also drew a parallel between Churchill and the Doctor, as both of them were very intelligent and also had known <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. A scene cut from the final episode explained how the two had known each other for a while. Gatiss included one of Churchill's favourite expressions [...] "Keep buggering on" [...] (abbreviated KBO) into the script, which he was [...] "delighted" [...] to do. Ian McNeice, who portrayed Churchill, previously played the villain Zeus in the Eighth Doctor Big Finish audio play Immortal Beloved in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The Brothers of Destruction began a {{feud with}} KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark), who {{were brought to}} WWF by Stevie Richards (indicating that he wanted revenge on the Brothers of Destruction, {{especially}} Undertaker {{for what happened to}} him on the April 26, 2001 episode of SmackDown!, when they faced him in a 4-on-1 handicap match, causing the Right to Censor stable [...] to disband). On September 17 episode of Raw is War, Kane and Undertaker lost the WWF tag titles to The Dudley Boyz after KroniK interfered. At Unforgiven, they successfully defended their titles against KroniK before losing them to Booker T and Test on the following episode of SmackDown!. They continued on as a team representing the WWF side through onto the end of the Alliance Invasion angle, including their participation at InVasion and Survivor Series after which The Undertaker immediately turned heel once more and the two did not interact with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while.|$|E
2500|$|Leung's father saw an {{advertisement}} for a Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire casting call, and suggested she should try out. She waited four hours {{in line for a}} five-minute audition, despite feeling she had little likelihood of obtaining the role, Two weeks later, she was called back for a workshop and was cast as Cho Chang, beating out over 3,000 other girls for the part. In retrospect, she stated {{in an interview with the}} Daily Record that her Scottish accent probably gave her an advantage in the casting, as the casting director asked the girls who attended the audition, [...] "Is there anyone here from Scotland?", to which only Leung raised her hand. In a 2011 interview, Leung said her fondest memory of the Harry Potter experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her. [...] "It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn't seen <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long time," [...] Leung said. In an effort to heavily promote Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Warner Bros. sent Leung to China in the film's second week of release, which was unusual for a market not used to frequent celebrity visits.|$|E

He added that the pair bring out the best in each other and [...] "work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". Fox commented that the pair would make good parents but have [...] "a lot of growing up to do themselves", before adding that she hoped Nancy and Darren would stay together for a long time" [...] as she enjoyed the pairing. On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said she has [...] "really calmed Darren down. He's totally in love with her". He added that the pair share a [...] "tempestuous relationship, even if it's also very sweet". On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said: [...] "He's besotted with her. He feels she's good for him and that he almost doesn't deserve her. He feels like a bit of a failure and Nancy is this strong woman who's organised and everything Darren isn't". Dawson felt that Nancy is the love of Darren's life and that she had helped Darren mature. Dawson said that Darren and Nancy have [...] "know <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time" [...] and that they [...] "work well together".|$|E

I was present at his {{interview}} with Don Carlos. I must say that Gould is rather a cold man. He had to keep a tight hand on his feelings, dealing with thieves and rascals, in constant danger of ruin for himself and wife for so many years, that it had become a second nature.

Finding this out and apparently not wishing to disturb Tommy, he gave up the occupation, and after one or two attempts, for his tongue and lips still seemed to be stiff, addressed us in some sonorous and musical language, unlike any that we had ever heard. We shook our heads. Then by an afterthought I said [...] "Good day" [...] to him {{in the language of the}} Orofenans. He puzzled over the word as though it were more or less familiar to him, and when I repeated it, gave it back to me with a difference indeed, but in a way which convinced us that he quite understood what I meant. The conversation went no further at the moment because just then some memory seemed to strike him.|$|E

60|$|I {{have two}} reasons for saying these things. One is, that {{those of you who}} have no {{opportunity}} to travel, may be more contented to remain at home, and not imagine that those of your friends who go abroad, necessarily pass their time so much more happily than you do. The other reason is, that when you do travel, either in our own country or in foreign lands, you should be more reasonable and considerate, and pay more regard to the wishes and feelings of others, than travellers usually do. Most of the disquietudes and heart-burnings which arise to mar the happiness of parties travelling, come from the selfishness of our hearts, which seems, in some way or other, to bring itself out more into view when we are on a long journey together than at any other time. In the ordinary intercourse of life, this selfishness is covered and concealed by the veil of politeness prescribed by the forms and usages of society. This veil is, however, very thin, and it soon disappears entirely, in the familiar intercourse which is necessarily produced by the incidents and adventures of a journey. In being daily and hourly with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, people appear just as they really are; and unless they are really reasonable, considerate, and just towards one another, they are sure sooner or later to disagree.|$|E
60|$|He had lowered at last his fascinated glance; she too {{was looking}} down, and {{standing}} thus before {{each other in}} the glaring light, between the four bare walls, they seemed brought out from the confused immensity of the Eastern borders to be exposed cruelly to the observation of my Western eyes. And I observed them. There was nothing else to do. My existence seemed so utterly forgotten by these two that I dared not now make a movement. And I thought to myself that, of course, they had to come together, the sister and the friend of that dead man. The ideas, the hopes, the aspirations, the cause of Freedom, expressed in their common affection for Victor Haldin, the moral victim of autocracy,--all this must draw them to each other fatally. Her very ignorance and his loneliness to which he had alluded so strangely must work to that end. And, indeed, I saw that the work was done already. Of course. It was manifest that they must have been thinking of <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before they met. She had the letter from that beloved brother kindling her imagination by the severe praise attached to that one name; and for him to see that exceptional girl was enough. The only cause for surprise was his gloomy aloofness before her clearly expressed welcome. But he was young, and however austere and devoted to his revolutionary ideals, he was not blind. The period of reserve was over; he was coming forward in his own way. I could not mistake the significance of this late visit, for in {{what he had to say}} there was nothing urgent. The true cause dawned upon me: he had discovered that he needed her and she was moved by the same feeling. It was the second time that I saw them together, and I knew that next time they met I would not be there, either remembered or forgotten. I would have virtually ceased to exist for both these young people.|$|E
