40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{a disease}} caused by increased permeability of retinal vessels. Its incidence and prevalence have been increasing due to urbanization, greater life expectancy and the habits of modern life. Its onset is insidious and it may lead to blindness in 75 % of individuals who have been diabetic for more than 20 years. The aim here was to evaluate the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions relating to diabetic retinopathy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Review of systematic reviews, conducted at Cochrane Brazil. METHODS: We included Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions relating to diabetic retinopathy. Two researchers evaluated the inclusion criteria, summarized the reviews and presented the results narratively. RESULTS: Ten reviews met the inclusion criteria. They showed some evidence of benefits from: (a) photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy; (b) strict glucose and pressure control for postponing the onset of retinopathy; (c) antiangiogenic <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> macular <b>edema</b> (high-quality evidence); (d) anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (very low to low-quality evidence); and (e) intravitreal injection or surgical implantation for treating persistent or refractory macular edema. However, blood pressure control {{seems to have no}} benefit after the onset of retinopathy. CONCLUSION: Only a few options are likely to be effective for treating diabetic retinopathy. These include photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Strict glucose and pressure control seem to postpone the onset of retinopathy. <b>For</b> macular <b>edema,</b> antiangiogenic <b>drugs,</b> intravitreal injection and surgical implantation seem to have some benefit...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the pre-emptive use of a cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{inhibitor}} with a well established steroidal anti-inflammatory <b>drug</b> <b>for</b> pain and <b>edema</b> relief following periodontal surgery for crown lengthening. Thirty patients requiring periodontal surgery were randomly assigned to receive one of the following medications: selective COX- 2 inhibitor or steroidal antiinflammatory drug, 60 min before the surgical procedure. To examine patient anxiety, a Corah's dental anxiety scale was applied before surgery. Using a visual analog scale, the extent of pain/discomfort during the trans-operative period and immediately after the surgery was measured. Additionally, intensity of pain/discomfort and edema were examined 4, 8, 12 and 24 h postoperatively. With regard to anxiety, no statistical differences between the groups were observed (p> 0. 05). With respect to the extent of pain/discomfort during the trans-operative, immediate and late postoperative period, data demonstrated no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the COX- 2 inhibitor and steroidal groups. With regard to edema, intragroup analysis did not reveal any statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) during the 24 h following surgery in either group.

40|$|It is {{controversial}} whether {{the administration of}} anti-vascular endothelial growth factor <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> diabetic macular <b>edema</b> (DME) affects intraocular inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we measured cytokine concentration in aqueous humor before and after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR). The aim was to determine changes in cytokine concentration and their effects on DME reduction. Twelve patients (13 eyes) with DME received two IVR (0. 5 mg) with a 1 month interval, {{and a total of}} 26 aqueous humor samples were obtained. Macular thickness was measured with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) using thickness-map mode with an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) 9 -zone grid that was divided into two zones: a central circle with a diameter of 1 mm (zone 1); and an outer circle with a diameter of 6 mm (zone 2). The concentration of eotaxin- 1 in aqueous humor samples decreased significantly after IVR. Baseline cytokine concentration was associated with IVR-induced DME reduction. In zone 1, higher baseline concentration of interferon-induced protein (IP) - 10, and in zone 2, higher baseline concentration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IP- 10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α; and lower baseline concentration of eotaxin- 1, interleukin (IL) - 5, and IL- 8 were associated with improved DME. Cytokine changes were associated with IVR-induced DME reduction. In zone 1, lower concentration of IP- 10 compared to baseline or higher concentration of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) -α, and in zone 2, lower concentration of IL- 5 compared to baseline, IL- 8, and IP- 10 or higher concentration of eotaxin- 1 and MIP- 1 β were associated with improved DME. These findings suggest that ranibizumab affects the concentration of cytokines in aqueous humor.

40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} debilitating disorders of microvasculature of the retina and one of the leading causes of vision loss among the working class worldwide. At present, intravitreal anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids) and anti-angiogenesis (anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) agents are being used as wide options for the pharmacotherapy of DR and diabetic macular edema (DME). Anti-inflammatory agents (Triamcinolone acetonide and other agents) have shown evidence-based clinical benefits in various randomized clinical trials for the treatment of DR and DME, and also shown improvement in best corrected visual acuity. However, direct intravitreal injections are associated with serious side-effects like cataract and elevation of Intra Ocular Pressure. Despite this, corticosteroid therapy has been effective for DR and DME, therefore current focus is on the development of novel intravitreal steroid delivery devices that release a small quantity over a prolonged period of time. In addition to corticosteroids, anti-angiogenic agents are found to be effective for the treatment of DR and DME. The most popular target of these agents is the subfamily of proteins known as VEGF, whose over-expression is believed to play a role in numerous diseases including DR and Age-related Macular Degeneration. Intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin®) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are gaining popularity as a clinical adjunct to panretinal photocoagulation in patients with proliferative DR. Moreover, Lucentis has been recently approved by the United States Food and <b>Drug</b> Administration <b>for</b> macular <b>edema</b> following retinal vein occlusion. Further, systemic agents (specially, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and anti-hypertensive agents) have shown beneficial results in reducing the progression of DR. In conclusion, it can be stated that for the present scenario systematic use of available pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to laser photocoagulation, which is gold standard therapy, can be a useful tool in the prevention of vision loss from DR and related disorders. This article summarizes the up-to-date developments in the pharmacotherapy of DR.

Treatment of cerebral tumors remains a clinical challenge that is complicated by ineffective tumor ablation techniques as well as accompanying side effects, such as peritumoral ederria. Dexamethasone is an effective <b>drug</b> <b>for</b> treating brain <b>edema,</b> but its mechanism and breadth of effects are not fully understood. Paclitaxel has been demonstrated as an effective cytotoxic compound against a number of cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme. However, the effects of co-treatment with a chemotherapeutic and corticosteroid at the cellular level have not been fully explored. This is in part because optical imaging modalities have only recently been developed that provide a spatial resolution high enough to characterize the metabolic dynamics of individual cells. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether differences in glucose uptake can be used to distinguish metabolically active human glioblastoma cells in culture, for the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of paclitaxel treatment with and without concomitant dexamethasone administration. Fluorescently labeled deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG (2 -[N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) amino]- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose) contrast in vitro is quantified by measuring the rate of mean fluorescence intensity change in cells treated with 2 -NBDG using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Our results show that human U 87 glioblastoma cells treated concomitantly with paclitaxel and dexamethasone display a much higher rate of 2 -NBDG uptake than when treated with either drug alone. Statistically significant differences were observed across treatment groups, even when changes were measured at the single cell level. The methodologies presented in this study are applicable to myriad disease conditions in which glucose metabolism is altered. We demonstrate that 2 -NBDG uptake can serve as a rapid technique for surveying cellular response to chemotherapeutic treatments...|$|R

40|$|Koushik TripathyDepartment of Vitreoretina and Uvea, ICARE Eye Hospital & Postgraduate Institute, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaThe author {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Browning et al. 1 The author humbly wants to discuss a few facts. 1. The article 1 discusses grading of retinal ischemia based on optical coherence tomography features in central retinal venous occlusion. As coexisting central retinal arterial occlusion or cilioretinal arterial occlusion may also cause inner retinal hyper-reflectivity, exclusion of such cases is an important consideration before implicating central retinal venous occlusion for the ischemia. Extensive intraretinal hemorrhages are other important hindrances to {{the evaluation of the}} perfusion status of the retina using both fluorescein angiogram and optical coherence tomography. 2. It would be interesting to know the gonioscopic findings, especially neovascularization of the anterior chamber angle if it was performed at presentation and during the follow-ups. 3. The manuscript documented that the incidence of anterior segment neovascularization at 1 year was 8. 9 % in severe ischemia group. 1 The incidence of anterior segment neovascularization in perfused groups was higher (15. 4 % and 17. 6 % for mild and moderate ischemia, respectively). Although the sample size was low, such findings are contrary to the literature 2 and require further discussion.  Authors&# 39; replyDavid J Browning, Omar S Punjabi, Chong LeeDepartment of Ophthalmology, Charlotte Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Associates, P. A., Charlotte, NC, USA We thank Dr Tripathy for his interest in our article and would respond to his above-mentioned points. 1. We agree that excluding eyes with cilioretinal artery and central retinal artery occlusions is necessary to be able to attribute inner retinal reflectivity changes to central retinal vein occlusion. Cilioretinal artery occlusion is associated with a band of ischemic retinal whitening and central retinal artery occlusion more generalized posterior-pole ischemic whitening. Neither was present in any of our patients. The changes in inner retinal reflectivity were present without visible whitening. The confounding effects of intraretinal hemorrhage were recognized and accounted for as found in the following sentence in “Methods” section: “When there was concomitant intraretinal hemorrhage, the grading was done based on a zone without intraretinal hemorrhage if one was present, but if intraretinal hemorrhage was confluent, the inner retina was hyperreflective and delineation of layers was obscured by the hemorrhage, such cases were graded as severe ischemia”. 2. This was a retrospective study drawn from two retina specialists (DJB and OSP). There was no standardization about when gonioscopy was performed. Therefore, the development of anterior segment neovascularization (ASNV) may have been underestimated relative to a figure derived from a systematic prospective study in which gonioscopy would be uniformly performed before pupillary dilation. 3. The incidence of ASNV recorded in Table 2 of the manuscript was confounded by the frequent injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> macular <b>edema</b> in all three groups. As we wrote in the “Discussion” section: “The frequent injection of anti-VEGF drugs not only treated the macular edema but also probably masked any underlying associations of ASNV and NVG with baseline ischemia”.
