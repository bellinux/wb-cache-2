5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the Anglican {{authorities}} officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes. Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, {{and was one of the}} first High Church Anglicans to write his own. In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year.|$|E
5|$|During summer {{holidays}} {{with his family}} in Dublin he met {{and fell in love with}} Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of his cousins and a member of the Plymouth Brethren. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Menem {{became the}} first head of state of Argentina to make a {{diplomatic}} visit to Israel. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> mediate between Israel and Syria in their negotiations over the Golan Heights.

5|$|In April 2011, {{the pier}} {{was sold to}} a Blackpool family firm, Sedgwick's, the owners of {{amusement}} arcades and the big wheel on Blackpool's Central Pier. Peter Sedgwick explained that <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> his wife on North Pier forty years ago, and promised to buy it for her one day. He said {{that he wants to}} restore the Victorian heritage of the pier and re-instate the pier's tram. An admission charge of fifty pence to access the board-walk section of the pier was abolished by the Sedgwicks.|$|E

5|$|Mary soon {{experienced}} financial troubles, illnesses, and loneliness. In 1528, {{her aunt}} Margaret {{suggested that she}} should marry King James V of Scotland.

In 1530 Charles again suggested that she should remarry; <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> arrange a marriage to Frederick of Bavaria, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.|$|E

A few weeks later, he proposed a moratorium on the development of nuclear and space weapons during the period of negotiations, and in July, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> ban nuclear testing. Reagan rejected the proposals.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{lived with}} {{anthropologist}} Sheila Miyoshi Jager {{while he was}} a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.

5|$|Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov {{financial}} security, which {{encouraged him}} {{to settle down and}} to start a family. In December 1871 <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> Nadezhda Purgold, with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E

5|$|During 2005, the British Museum {{presented}} Egypt with a full-sized {{replica of}} the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, close to {{the site where the}} stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. These requests were refused.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E

5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Himmler was a main {{architect}} of the Holocaust, using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. The Nazis wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted {{with the principles of}} selective breeding, which <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of the}} war.|$|E
