Bruce Cannon, a sound effects editor for [...] "Thriller", said that, [...] "Things like the lightning {{may have come from}} old Hollywood movies – we'll never know which movies – but the best sound-effects editors do go out in the desert and find a coyote, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that was a real howl." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

Hazmi continued, [...] "As a father, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that the two of}} them are still alive and unhurt, and will come back home in the near future when the truth is uncovered and the real culprits are found." ...|$|E

2500|$|Damage is {{unequivocally}} {{my favorite}} {{album of the}} year so far, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that a lot of people}} who hear these songs at the right moment in their lives are going to share that sentiment. Maybe the connection will come on some late and sweltering summer night, and a teenage kid will be climbing into his car with heartbreak on his mind and nothing left to say.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in June 2011, Kember revealed that Jason Pierce and himself had not had contact since 1990 or 1991. Kember stated, [...] "Well, I've {{been in touch with}} him, but he's never gotten back in touch with me. I sent my best wishes and stuff, but nothing back. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that isn't going to change, after all this time". He added that although he would be interested in a Spacemen 3 reunion in principle, he thought the realistic chances of it occurring were [...] "zilch".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2012 it was {{announced}} that Sondheim would collaborate on a new musical with David Ives, and he had [...] "about 20–30 minutes of the musical completed". The show, tentatively called All Together Now, was assumed to follow the format of Merrily We Roll Along. Sondheim described the project as [...] "two people and what goes into their relationship... We'll write for a couple of months, then have a workshop. It seemed experimental and fresh 20 years ago. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> it may not be experimental and fresh any more". On October 11, 2014, it was confirmed the Sondheim and Ives' musical would be based on two Luis Buñuel films (The Exterminating Angel and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie) and would reportedly open (in previews) at the Public Theater in 2017, under the working title Bunuel.|$|E
5000|$|... "Alone with God on this {{occasion}} I pledged my life and service anew to go where He wanted me and to serve Him with all my soul. My last earthly support had slipped away, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that mother's God would see me through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "an impulse. I {{can call}} it by no other name. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> taken <b>a</b> train that leaves New York at noon; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> this morning, which seemed almost like a presentiment, that I might be of some use to you." ...|$|R
60|$|And then I got {{a sample}} of Mulligan Jacobs.

2500|$|A {{week after}} the engagement, the {{proposed}} Anglo-Russo alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to Scotland, {{so that she could}} meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in Cologne, instead. The Queen called it [...] "simply impertinent" [...] that [...] "I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be ready to run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess." [...] Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar’s offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria Alexandrovna looked forward happily to her marriage: [...] "How happy I am to belong to him. I feel that my love for him is growing daily. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of peace and inexpressible happiness and a boundless impatience to be altogether his own." ...|$|E
2500|$|A three-person defence {{team was}} hired by the Pakistani embassy to {{supplement}} her two existing public defenders, but Siddiqui refused to co-operate with them. She tried to dismiss her lawyers {{on the grounds that they}} were Jewish. She said the case against her was a Jewish conspiracy, demanded that no Jews be allowed on the jury, and that all prospective jurors be DNA-tested and excluded from the jury at her trial [...] "if they have a Zionist or Israeli background." [...] She stated [...] "... they are all mad at me ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> everyone here is them—subject to genetic testing. They should be excluded, if you want to be fair." [...] In regard to her comments, [...] Siddiqui's legal team stated that her incarceration had damaged her mind.While at Federal Medical Center, Carswell, she wrote a letter to the warden to give to President Obama, asserting, [...] "Study the history of the Jews. They have always back-stabbed everyone who has taken pity on them and made the `fatal` error of giving them shelter. ... and it is this cruel, ungrateful back-stabbing of the Jews that has caused them to be mercilessly expelled from wherever they gain strength. This why `holocausts` keep happening to them repeatedly! If they would only learn to be grateful and change their behavior!! ..." [...] She later claimed she was not against all [...] "Israeli Americans".|$|E
2500|$|Lead single [...] "Just a Little While" [...] {{quickly became}} the most added and played song on pop formats, {{increasing}} nearly five-hundred percent in airplay and garnering [...] "sizeable" [...] downloads. It received positive reception, however, its performance massively shifted when the blacklist was commenced; virtually disappearing from airplay. The boycott drew attention from critics when providing commentary on the album. [...] Langston Wertz Jr. of The Charlotte Observer commented the incident made Jackson the [...] "most [...] female artists of all time" [...] in the media, adding [...] "radio wouldn't play it and MTV wouldn't play her videos for [...] "I Want You" [...] and [...] "All Nite," [...] two songs that would've been out-of-the-park hits at any other point in Jackson's career." [...] Billboard noted [...] "The three singles it spawned were blacklisted by pop radio—they were also the albums biggest highlights—the electronic guitar studded [...] "Just a Little While," [...] Motown-influenced [...] "I Want You" [...] and the funky, heavily dance orientated [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)." [...] Allan Raible of ABC News expressed [...] "had the Super Bowl incident not happened, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> the rock-edged [...] "Just a Little While" [...] and the Kanye West assisted [...] "Strawberry Bounce" [...] {{would have been enough}} to make the album more of a success." [...] Additionally, Doug Rule of The Metro Weekly revealed [...] "the best tracks on Damita Jo are likely to be barred from commercial airtime" [...] due to the blacklist, adding [...] "in the case of first single [...] "Just A Little While," [...] never really get past go" [...] as a result.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> the <b>feeling</b> for <b>a</b> moment that, {{notwithstanding}} the crowded room and Louis' attitude of polite attention, {{my life was}} in danger.

6000|$|... "What! are you drawing {{it all out}} again?" [...] {{he asked}} in surprise. Then I {{realized}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written fifty-six instead of six.

60|$|In {{the height}} of the gusts, in my high position, where the seas did not break, I found myself {{compelled}} to cling tightly to the rail to escape being blown away.

2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Kernan. [...] "That's why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for them. It's some {{of those}} secular priests, ignorant, bumptious----" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that, through them, he {{was trying}} to force remembrance of himself upon me.

It came to me as a physical relief when a spasm of pain caused him to turn his eyes away from me.|$|R

5000|$|In autumn 1960, Mann {{joined the}} University of Stuttgart {{in the higher}} {{position}} of professor in ordinary for Political Science. It {{soon became clear that}} he felt unsatisfied with the machinery at the universities: [...] "In those years <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of immense, but fruitless effort without getting any echo. This led to a depression that made me resign the professorship in 1963".|$|R
60|$|Above {{all other}} considerations, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> {{perhaps it was}} a mistaken one,--that my powers grew in {{proportion}} as I went Eastward. In West Salem I was merely an amateur gardener, living a life which approached the vegetable,--so far as external action went. In Chicago I was a perversity, a man of mis-directed energy. In New York I was, at least respected as a writer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that he {{understood}} me, not intellectually, but emotionally. What a companion he might have been!... Moreton and Biddy moved me less.

6000|$|... "I'll wait," [...] thought Mr. Quack, [...] "until that thing, {{whatever}} it is, {{comes out of}} those Black Shadows into the moonlight. Somehow <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that we are in}} no danger." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} imagine, at the time, what was ailing me, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of some {{impending}} and deadly illness.

At times I heard the swish-swish of grass being shoved aside, and once the patter of feet across a patch of stony ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Adam; [...] "you're not accountable.

60|$|The morning {{came and}} went, but my wish and {{intention}} still remained; {{and so in}} the full tide of noon, with the sun in all its fiery force, I {{set out for the}} old church of St. Sava.
