5|$|After {{the communists}} {{took over the}} {{short-lived}} First Republic of Armenia and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the Armenian diaspora had settled. With the large <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon {{and to a lesser}} extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states including the USA, where another large <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Armenians settled.|$|E
5|$|During Witt's tenure, Dayton {{experienced}} an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Jewish immigration, {{and the original}} German-Jewish constituency of the congregation became more diverse. Family membership reached 500 by 1945.|$|E
5|$|In late July each year, the Bristol Harbour Festival is held, {{resulting}} in an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> boats, including tall ships, Royal Navy vessels and lifeboats.|$|E

5|$|After the French {{victory at}} the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, Bourcier was placed {{in charge of the}} several {{thousands}} of horses confiscated from the Prussians. This <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> horses improved the capacity of the French cavalry, as Joachim Murats 11,000-strong cavalry reserve demonstrated later at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the Cuban Revolution, led by Fidel Castro in 1959, almost all of Cuba's 15,000 Jews went into exile. The {{majority}} of them fled to Miami, Florida; however, Puerto Rico also received a large <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Jewish emigres from Cuba.|$|E
40|$|<b>Influxes</b> <b>of</b> {{potassium}} and {{amino acids}} were measured in suspensions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) under resting conditions and after various phagocytic stimuli. Both ouabain-sensitive (or pump) and ouabain-insensitive (or leak) <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> K were determined. In 5 mM external K, mean total K influx was 0. 69 nmol/ 10 e cells × min, of which 52 % was ouabain-sensitive. Ouabain binding was irreversible, and, as in erythrocytes, was inhibited by K. At external concentrations of 0. 1 raM, <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> lysine and leucine were entirely carriermediated, with means of 0. 021 nmol/l 08 cells x min, and 0. 019 nmol/l 0 s cells × min, respectively. After incubation of PMNs with zymosan or latex particles, the K pump was reduced more than 60 %, whereas amino acid influxes were inhibited only by 30 %. PMNs were also exposed to cytochalasin B before challenge by particles: the drug prevented phagocytosis but not surface binding of zymosan, {{nor did it}} influence transport of K or amino acids. After pretreatment of PMNs with cytochalasin B, interaction of zymosan with their surface resulted in the sam...|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} in which there were large <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrants}} from Europe to the United States and United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, the given names and surnames of many immigrants were changed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century, discoveries of gold at a number of {{locations}} in Western Australia caused large <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> prospectors from overseas and interstate, and classic gold rushes. [...] Significant finds included: ...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the railway, Cheadle Hulme was a rural and {{agricultural}} cluster of hamlets. The railway brought a huge <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> people to the area, and provided opportunities for residents to work in places such as Manchester. Cheadle Hulme gradually grew to become a large suburb of over 29,000people thanks to the railway.|$|E

5|$|Following the invasion, Portuguese {{commercial}} interests were {{taken over by}} Indonesians. The border with West Timor was opened resulting in an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> West Timorese farmers, and in January 1989 the territory was open to private investment.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1974, around 370,000 {{communist}} {{troops were}} in South Vietnam, augmented by ever increasing <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> military hardware. In mid-December, the communists attacked Phước Long, and quickly gained the upper hand, besieging the city.|$|R
25|$|An {{estimated}} over 670,000 Rohingya {{refugees from}} Myanmar live {{in refugee camps}} in Cox's Bazar District in the southeast. The region has received <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> Rohingya refugees during Burmese military crackdowns in 1978, 1991, 2012 and 2016.|$|R

5|$|Foram dissolution: Foraminifera tests {{appear to}} be more eroded during H3 and H6 (Gwiazda et al., 1996). That may {{indicate}} an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> nutrient-rich, hence corrosive, Antarctic Bottom Water by a reconfiguration of oceanic circulation patterns.|$|E
5|$|Fragrance may {{refer to}} the sweet taste of the harbour's fresh water estuarine <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> the Pearl River or to the incense from {{factories}} lining the coast of northern Kowloon. The incense was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before Hong Kong developed Victoria Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, California {{experienced}} a huge <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> migrants, increasing its population by 55%. Party registration in 1950 was 58.4% Democratic and 37.1% Republican. However, other than Downey, most major California officeholders were Republican, including Governor Earl Warren (who was seeking {{a third term}} in 1950) and Senator William Knowland.|$|E
50|$|In February 2010, {{the attacks}} against Assyrians in Mosul forced 4,300 Assyrians {{to flee to}} the Nineveh plains where there is an Assyrian-majority population. From 2012, it also began {{receiving}} <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> Assyrians from Syria owing to the civil war there.|$|R
50|$|There are an {{estimated}} 300,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who live in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar District in southeastern Bangladesh. The southeastern region has received <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> Rohingya refugees during Burmese military crackdowns in 1978, 1991, 2012 and 2016.|$|R
50|$|Large <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> low-density meltwater from Lake Agassiz and {{deglaciation}} in North America {{are thought}} to have led to a shifting of deep water formation and subsidence in the extreme North Atlantic and caused the climate period in Europe known as the Younger Dryas.|$|R
5|$|Minehead {{has one of}} the UK's three {{remaining}} Butlins holiday camps, {{and tourism}} {{has been a part of}} Minehead's economy since Victorian times.

5|$|Most of the {{residents}} in Lam Tin are Chinese, but due to an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Japanese immigrants during the 1990s, people of Japanese descent have become common in Lam Tin, particularly in Sceneway Garden and Laguna City, which now features a Japanese kindergarten.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} radiotracer {{experiments}} {{were employed to}} quantitatively compare the biokinetics of uptake from the dissolved phase (influx rates), uptake from {{the various types of}} food source (assimilation efficiency), and loss (efflux) of Ag between Potamocorbula amurensis and Macoma balthica. Simultaneously, <b>influx</b> rates <b>of</b> dissolved Cd in both clams were determined to compare with those of Ag. Effects <b>of</b> salinity on <b>influx</b> rates were evaluated in these 2 euryhaline species, as were effects <b>of</b> clam size. <b>Influx</b> rate <b>of</b> Ag and Cd (μg g- 1 [dry wt. ] d- 1) increased linearly with metal concentrations. <b>Influx</b> rates <b>of</b> Ag in both clams were 3 to 4 times those <b>of</b> Cd.

50|$|During {{the time}} in which there were large <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrants}} from Europe to the United States and United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, the names of many immigrants were changed either by immigration officials (as demonstrated in The Godfather Part II) or personal choice.|$|R
50|$|From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French {{immigration}} {{supplemented by}} <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> Africans, Chinese, Malays, and Indians gave the island its ethnic mix.

5|$|The Debian {{project has}} an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> {{applicants}} wishing to become developers.

5|$|The atoll is {{populated}} by {{several species of}} birds, fish and reptiles. In the lagoon, sparse living coral still can be found; the dominant species is Montipora bilaminata (family Acroporidae).
