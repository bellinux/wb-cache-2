Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II.

5|$|In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was {{appointed}} president, becoming Argentina's fifth president in two weeks.

Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy <b>growing</b> <b>by</b> over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011.

5|$|In recent years, {{the city}} has {{experienced}} steady population growth, and has been faced {{with the issue of}} accommodating more residents. In 2006, after <b>growing</b> <b>by</b> 4,000citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000people by2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{demand for}} boric acid has led {{a number of}} {{producers}} to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned Eti Mine Works opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006.

The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice {{the thrust of the}} Comet 1's Ghosts.

In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after <b>growing</b> <b>by</b> 5.8% in 2007 due to the global financial crisis.

Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E

Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized.
