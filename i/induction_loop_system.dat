50|$|On 30 January 1999, W963 rebranded {{itself as}} RaW and on 30 September 1999, the station began {{broadcasting}} on 1251 kHz AM, discarding the then obsolete <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> {{was installed}} in the Lawns (a hall of residence at Hull University) as a third year project by engineering students. By 1983 the system was fully operational. To cut costs, the students used Coca-Cola bottles as insulation. As a result, by 1993, the loop induction system was no longer functional. In 1994, the engineering team carried out a comprehensive survey {{of the system and}} were able to partially restore it to several of the Lawns halls, as well as fitting a new transmitter to Ferens Hall. The <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> was abandoned in 1997 after the award of the LPAM licence.|$|E

40|$|In {{schools for}} the hard-of-hearing where {{adjacent}} classrooms are equipped with non-carrier <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>systems,</b> {{it is necessary to}} realize a geometric discrimination between the classroomfields. One approach to reaching the required 24 dB per meter rolloff at the boundaries is the orthogonal field principle reported first in 1965 by de Boer, Bosman and Joosten (ref. 2, 3, 4). In this paper a method is described and results are given for an heuristic development of this principle in the case of classrooms about 8 m in length with permissible roll-off ranges of 2 m. It is shown that it is also possible to discriminate in a vertical direction if a secondary field at the ceiling is used. The heuristic approach achieves very good results in this case and overcomes the mathematical difficulties arising when the field is calculated analytically...|$|R

50|$|URB 963, {{launched}} on 16 May 1973. It {{was one of}} the first University radio stations built in the UK to broadcast on Medium Wave on an <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> across the campus. The station was built and designed by students Jonathon White (Electrical Engineering) and Stephen Ainger (Physics) and launched by BBC Radio 1's Annie Nightingale and Pete Bradey. The first anniversary was hosted by the BBC Radio 1 Roadshow with Alan Freeman (DJ) in the Students' Union. In 1994 and 2003, URB also broadcast under short-term Restricted Service Licences across the city of Bath on the FM band. In 1995, Torch FM 106.2 used URB studios and presenters to provide a citywide radio service for the European Youth Olympics in Bath.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{simulation of}} class E inverter based induction heater system using simulink. DC is converted into high frequency AC using class E inverter. This high frequency AC {{is used for}} <b>induction</b> heating. Closed <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> are modeled and they are simulated using Mat lab Simulink. The results of closed <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> are presented. The proposed amplifier with two series-parallel resonant load networks will allow sinusoidal output voltage to be achieved by associating with {{the positive and negative}} quasi-sinusoidal waveforms. The complementarily activated configuration will provide continuous high-ripple-frequency inputcurrent waveforms; this approach significantly reduces electromagnetic interference and requires very little filtering. With the symmetry of the push-pull Class-E Circuit, there is the additional benefit that the even harmonics are suppressed at the load, and thus there are fewer harmonic distortions...|$|R
5000|$|IEC 60118-4 (formerly Britain's BS 6083 part 4, {{also known}} as EN 60118-4) is now the main {{specification}} for international use. [...] This {{is based on the}} principle that the long term average of the field strength at a typical listening location must be 100mA/m, +- 3dB. To determine this long term average requires a measurement over 60 seconds or more. The standard therefore sets a more pragmatic requirement for determining the short term peaks of the signal. Short term peaks need to be 12dB (x4) higher than the long term average, {{based on the fact that}} peaks of speech are approximately 12dB higher than the long term average level of speech. Therefore an <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> or AFILS must be capable of delivering field strength peaks of 400mA/m +- 3dB (280 to 560mA/m). Peaks must be measured using fast RMS measurement (125ms averaging time).|$|E
5000|$|This {{original}} {{system was}} on its last legs by 1982. The Student's Union accordingly paid for a full new installation of a new [...] "active" [...] <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system,</b> with power for loop amplifiers supplied down the coax along which came the RF supply. This was built over the summer of 1982 as the first installation by Wireless Workshop - a company formed by students from University Radio Falmer {{who at the time}} only built transmitters for university radio in the UK. At the time the chance was taken to switch to 999 kHz AM, the new UK standard. There was a separate coax supply to each tower, with a loop every three floors. There were active amplifiers under the North Towers causeway. This new system worked very well until 1990, when a blown fuse in a power amp under the causeway resulted in Tawney and William Morris being off air for 9 months. Considerable ingenuity by engineers in reaching the fuse - in the sub-basement and abandoned boiler rooms under Tawney - eventually resulted in a fix. The opportunity was taken in 1990 to add induction loops to the Wolfson Court hall of residence, which had previously only received some radiation from Keynes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method to {{estimate}} the macroscopic volume delay function (VDF) from the point speed-flow measures. Contrary to typical VDF estimation methods it allows estimating speeds also for hypercritical traffic conditions, when both speeds and flow drop due to congestion (high density of traffic flow). We employ the well-known hydrodynamic relation of fundamental diagram to derive the so-called quasi-density from measured time-mean speeds and flows. This allows formulating the VDF estimation problem with a speed being monotonically decreasing function of quasi-density with a shape resembling the typical VDF like BPR. This way {{we can use the}} actually observed speeds and propose the macroscopic VDF realistically reproducing actual speeds also for hypercritical conditions. The proposed method is illustrated with half-year measurements from the <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> in city of Warsaw, which measured traffic flows and instantaneous speeds of over 5 million vehicles. Although the proposed method does not overcome the fundamental limitations of static macroscopic traffic models, which cannot represent dynamic traffic phenomena like queue, spillback, wave propagation, capacity drop, and so forth, we managed to improve the VDF goodness-of-fit from R 2 of 27 % to 72 % most importantly also for hypercritical conditions. Thanks to this traffic congestion in macroscopic traffic models can be reproduced more realistically in line with empirical observations...|$|E
40|$|Sub-surface or through-the-earth {{communication}} using {{electromagnetic fields}} - and specifically magnetic induction equipment - {{plays a key}} role in search and rescue systems used in the mining industry and, increasingly, by cavers and pot-holers. Similar equipment is used for radio-location, sub-surface surveying and geophysical measurements. The use of fast desktop computers allows a mathematical model of the propagation to be investigated in detail, demonstrating the preferred orientation of the antennas and the existence of an optimum frequency that is dependent on depth and other parameters. Computer simulations demonstrate a reduction in accuracy of radiolocation at skin depth distances, and methods of correcting this inaccuracy are introduced. The transmitter and receiver antennas for portable <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> are usually aircored loops or magnetic-cored solenoids, tuned to resonance. However, the preferred antenna often depends on the intended use of the communication system, with untuned antennas having an advantage in some situations. The use of toroid (anapole) structures and rotating magnets as transmitters is discussed briefly. A figure of merit - the specific aperture - is introduced as an aid to antenna design. Internal (amplifier) noise can be reduced by noise-matching, although special account has to be taken of the inductive antenna. Internal noise is often swamped by external (atmospheric) noise, for which several mitigation strategies are discussed. Differing up-link and down-link noise performance may dictate different antennas. External noise is frequently characterised by the atmospheric noise temperature ratio, but data derived using the standard electric field antenna cannot be applied to a study of magnetic noise. The design of a wide-band low-frequency channel sounder is described, with which it is intended to perform a detailed channel evaluation using a binary sounding sequence. A simple method of calculating the inverse of such a sequence is introduced, for which cross-correlation with the inverse sequence at the receiver results in a system identification signal that is used to maintain synchronism with the transmitter. The extreme wideband nature of the system results in a low efficiency, which is countered by using signal-averaging techniques at the receiver. Preliminary results are reported, in which the sounder was used to capture background noise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous bone-anchored {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an {{important}} rehabilitation alternative for patients who have conductive or mixed hearing loss. However, these devices use a percutaneous and bone-anchored implant that has some drawbacks reported. A transcutaneous bone conduction implant system (BCI) is proposed {{as an alternative to}} the percutaneous system because it leaves the skin intact. The BCI transmits the signal to a permanently implanted transducer with an <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> through the intact skin. The aim of this study was to compare the electroacoustic performance of the BAHA Classic- 300 with a full-scale BCI on a cadaver head in a sound field. The BCI comprised the audio processor of the vibrant sound bridge connected to a balanced vibration transducer (balanced electromagnetic separation transducer). METHODS: Implants with snap abutments were placed in the parietal bone (Classic- 300) and 15 -mm deep in the temporal bone (BCI). The vibration responses at the ipsilateral and contralateral cochlear promontories were measured with a laser Doppler vibrometer, with the beam aimed through the ear canal. RESULTS: Results show that the BCI produces approximately 5 dB higher maximum output level and has a slightly lower distortion than the Classic- 300 at the ipsilateral promontorium at speech frequencies. At the contralateral promontorium, the maximum output level was considerably lower for the BCI than for the Classic- 300 except in the 1 - 2 kHz range, where it was similar. CONCLUSION: Present results support the proposal that a BCI system can be a realistic alternative to a BAHA...|$|E
