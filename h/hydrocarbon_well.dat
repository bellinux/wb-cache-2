50|$|For both low {{and high}} volume {{hydraulic}} fracturing stimulation of a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well,</b> a high-pressure fluid (usually water) containing chemical additives and a proppant is injected into a wellbore to create an extensive system of small cracks in the deep-rock formations. These cracks provide the pathway for: natural gas, (including shale gas, tight gas and coalbed methane); petroleum, (including shale or tight oil); to flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure {{is removed from the}} well, the small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppant hold the fractures open when the pressure is released.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well</b> is {{hydraulically}} fractured, this is {{done through}} a production packer (seal), through the drill pipe or tubing.

The rest of the well casing will not experience any increase in pressure due to the sealing of the packer. The surface casings do not experience the great pressures experienced at the production zone. This means the stresses on a surface casing are no greater than on a normal oil or gas well. Smaller diameter pipes can sustain much larger pressures than large diameter pipes.|$|E

Alternative power sources are sought that could be deployed in these harsh environments to replace or supplement standard power sources currently in use. To this end, four investigations were performed to support the design of such a device. In the first investigation base assumptions used in the preliminary design of an electromagnetic energy harvester were shown to be in doubt, implying that the expected power output would not meet initial projections. In the second investigation a parametric study was performed to understand how high uncertainty variables affect the natural frequency and damping ratio of a producing <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well.</b> In the third investigation a structural housing was designed to satisfy American Petroleum Institute load cases. Using finite element models and standard tube/casing geometries, design pressures were iterated until a permissible housing design was achieved. This preliminary design provided estimates of the radial width and volume in which energy harvesting and storage elements may be situated. In the last investigation two software programs were developed to estimate the energy that might be harvested from user specified harvester configurations. The programs are dependent on user input production tube accelerations; this permits well operators to use well-specific vibrational data as inputs to generate well-specific energy output estimates.

40|$|Over {{significant}} {{areas of}} the UK and western Europe, anthropogenic alteration of the subsurface by mining of coal has occurred beneath highly populated areas which are now considering a multiplicity of â€˜low carbonâ€™ unconventional energy resources including shale gas and oil, coal bed methane, geothermal energy and energy storage. To enable decision making on the 3 D planning, licensing and extraction of these resources requires reduced uncertainty around complex geology and hydrogeological and geomechanical processes. An exemplar from the Carboniferous of central Scotland, UK, illustrates how, in areas lacking <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well</b> production data and 3 D seismic surveys, legacy coal mine plans and associated boreholes provide valuable data {{that can be used}} to reduce the uncertainty around geometry and faulting of subsurface energy resources. However, legacy coal mines also limit unconventional resource volumes since mines and associated shafts alter the stress and hydrogeochemical state of the subsurface, commonly forming pathways to the surface. To reduce the risk of subsurface connections between energy resources, an example of an adapted methodology is described for shale gas/oil resource estimation to include a vertical separation or â€˜stand-offâ€™ zone between the deepest mine workings, to ensure the hydraulic fracturing required for shale resource production would not intersect legacy coal mines. Whilst the size of such separation zones requires further work, developing the concept of 3 D spatial separation and planning is key to utilising the crowded subsurface energy system, whilst mitigating against resource sterilisation and environmental impacts, and could play a role in positively informing public and policy debate. ...|$|E

These methane gas hydrates are deemed important as a future energy resource, and several companies and countries are looking at the effective exploitation of the resource for methane gas supply. If safe economic exploitation could be achieved the world will have an energy resource that would be able to support the demands for century's to come. The chemistry, physics and geological setting of the natural hydrates make them difficult to exploit using convention <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well</b> engineering techniques. The major nations of the world such as the United States of America, Japan, Canada, France and Germany are investing heavily in research and development {{to gain a better understanding}} of the gas hydrate energy source.

40|$|The {{technology}} of hydraulic fracturing for <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well</b> stimulation is not new, but only fairly recently {{has become a}} very common and widespread technique, especially in North America, due to technological advances that have allowed extracting natural gas from so-called unconventional reservoirs (tight sands, coal beds and shale formations). The conjunction of techniques such as directional drilling, high volume fracturing, micro-seismic monitoring, etc. {{with the development of}} multi-well pads has been especially successful in the last years in their application to shales, making gas production from shales technically and economically feasible. In Europe, the potential application of this technology has led to both great worries and high expectations: worries regarding the alleged magnitude of the environmental impact, and expectations about production of indigenous hydrocarbons. Other types of formation stimulation exist that do not make use of water-based fluids (for instance, explosive fracturing, dynamic loading, etc.), or that make use of fluids other than water. These are currently not extensively applied due to performance considerations. As for any other industrial activity, the deployment of high-volume hydraulic fracturing could potentially entail some risks to the environment. Among the concerns raised are high usage of water, methane infiltration in aquifers, aquifer contamination, extended surface footprint, induced local seismicity, etc. New technologies could help addressing these concerns (for instance by using non-toxic chemicals, by reducing or eliminating altogether the usage of water, by considerably reducing the surface footprint of a well, etc.). This report is an update of the original study carried out in 2013 (2013). It reviews the latest trends in hydraulic fracturing and alternative fracturing technologies, by searching the open literature, patent databases and commercial websites (mainly in the English language).

40|$|Properly {{designed}} {{cement slurry}} and good cement job are crucial factors for integrity during a wellâ€˜s life cycle. For this, cement {{must be able}} to prevent migration of formation fluids, support the well construction and withstand high pressure and temperature. A survey on the Norwegian continental shelf showed that 11 % of well integrity issues were due to cement related problems [1]. Another integrity survey in Pennsylvania showed that 2. 41 % of over 3, 500 wells had casing or cementing related failures in 2011 and 2012 [2]. It has been reported that the primary reasons for gas leakage in a well are casing and cementing integrity issues [3]. This shows that the conventional cement has problems and to prevent future integrity problems the cement technology must be improved. Drilling a geothermal well is in many way similar to drilling a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well.</b> The main differences are the high temperature, generally from 160 Â°C to above 300 Â°C, the presence of highly corrosive gasses and often highly fractured formation [4]. This harsh environment demands even more need for cement with improved properties to withstand the geothermal environment. In this thesis, new cement slurry additives have been studied and tested. G class Portland cement was mixed with various additives and exposed to temperature cycling to study its ability to withstand high temperature. Then the cement was tested for leakage, bond strength, compressive strength and resilience. The experiments showed the following results: â€¢	The addition of acid treated silicone rubber to cement increased its compressive strength, resilience and bond strength with steel pipe by 26 %, 34 % and 1, 435 %, respectively. Also, it decreased the average leakage after number of temperature cycles by 30 %. â€¢	The addition of acid treated silicone debris to cement increased its compressive strength, resilience and bond strength with steel pipe by 63 %, 107 % and 727 %, respectively. â€¢	The addition of acid treated silicone rubber along with other additives to cement increased its compressive strength, resilience and bond strength with steel pipe by 29 %, 72 % and 1, 738 %, respectively.

40|$|The blowout {{preventer}} system is acting the secondary safety barrier in a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well,</b> where the drilling mud column {{is defined as}} the primary safety barrier. However, in pratical industry, there is a new demand for improved methods of assessing the reliability and availability of {{blowout preventer}} systems. The objective of this master thesis is to propose the relatively new method for reliability and availability assessment based on Bayesian Network, focusing on the comparsion between the various blowout preventers stack and the influence of the external information in the case study. The thesis starting with introduction of safety critical system including the basic terminology for reliability and availability assessment. The relevant standards regarding oil and gas industry are also introduced. The brief review about the blowout preventer is presented next. The basic structure of blowout preventer and the three main subsystems are identified and introduced. The classification of possible failure and desired functions of main components are reported. Finally, the brief research review about the previous reliability assessment method of subsea blowout preventer is presented, pointing out some potential weakness of the traditional methods, which indicating the Bayesian Network is the one possible solution when new requirement of reliability and availability is demanded. Then the introduction of Bayesian Network is mainly investigated for those who are not very familiar with this method. The possible allocation of Bayesian Network in reliability assessment and the comparsion between Bayesian Network model and the traditional method are mainly discussed. Then in the end of this chapter, there are two examples to show how the traditional method used in the assessment of blowout preventer can be transferred into Bayesian Network model without losing any details, in addtion, the advanced modeling powers regarding introduction of probabilistic gates, multiple states for variables and updating information when scanerio is known are revealed in both examples. Finally the case study about reliability and availability assessment of different blowout preventers is created. There are mainly three different type of blowout preventer stacks withing different degrees of performing the desired functions under the most demanding situations. The Bayesian Network model is able to perform such assessment effectively and one addtional information is taken into account since the contribution of the wellbore pressure has significant implications on the blowout preventer's ability to seal around or seal off the wellbore. Finally, the conclusion and discussion are provided. The main conclusion are summarized as three key findings. First, Bayesian Network is proven to carry out the reliability and availability assessment when there is the new requirement in pratical situations, especially for updating the information when the test data is available during the operation. Second, Bayesian Network based reliability and availability assessment is possible for applying in the large scale model since it can handle probabilistic gates and multiple states of components, where the traditional method such as Fault Tree Analysis {{may not be able to}} deal with such challenges. Third, according to the analysis results of the case study, the blowout preventer equipped with the Deepwater Horizon type of stack is considered as the most reliable one in the most demanding situation, if the correct repair strategy is applied. In addition, this kind of blowout preventer is relatively very stable under the high wellbore pressure condition even though withing lower redundancy of the pipe ram subsystem, due to inclusion of casing shear ram which improves the shearing ability significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} the Deepwater Horizon {{drilling}} rig's blowout preventer has been pointed to {{as one of the}} main causes of the Macondo accident on April 10 th 2010. The blowout preventer system is one the most important safety barriers in a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>well.</b> The accident has created a demand for improved methods of assessing the reliability of blowout preventer systems. The objective of this master thesis is to propose improvements to current reliability assessment methods for complex safety critical systems such as the blowout preventer. The report begins by describing the blowout preventer system. It is a system consisting of two main subsea parts containing the annular and ram blowout preventer valves which are used to seal off a well {{in the event of a}} subsea well kick. These annular and ram type preventers are governed by an electro-hydraulic control system which is operated by human interaction from control panels located on the rig floor. A functional analysis of the blowout preventer system is presented next. Essential functions are defined, and performance criteria for these functions identified. An approach to classification of blowout preventer functions is also presented, before the report moves on to the analysis of four main operational situations to which the blowout preventer is exposed, and whose characteristics have implications for the system's ability to act as a safety barrier. The pros and cons of different widely used blowout preventer system configurations is also discussed. Three main types of configurations are mentioned in the report; the modern configuration, traditional configuration and the Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer system configuration. A literature survey which documents previous blowout preventer reliability studies performed by Per Holand on behalf of SINTEF is presented. An evaluation of validity of the operational assumptions which have been made in these previous studies is also provided, such as such as assumptions regarding operational situations, failure input data, and several important assumptions regarding testing of blowout preventer systems. Regulations and guidelines which are relevant to blowout preventer reliability are also described here. The report further discusses how the blowout preventer may fail, and which types of failures modes are considered critical from a safety perspective. Some theoretic principles behind common cause failures are presented, along with a description of how common cause failures should be included in reliability assessments of safety critical systems through an approach called the PDS approach. This is followed by a discussion of possible sources for common cause failures in the blowout preventer system. As a suggestion towards how reliability assessments of blowout preventers can be improved, and some of the identified challenges solved, a reliability quantification method is presented. The method is based on post-processing of minimal cut sets from a fault tree analysis of the blowout preventer system, and produces more conservative and accurate approximations of the reliability than those produced through conventonal methods. The method is also capable of taking into account common cause failures. The results from the calculations are presented and discussed. An event tree which illustrates the effect from an escalated well control situation on the blowout preventer's ability to act as a safety barrier is also presented, along with a discussion of how blowout preventer reliability could possibly be more appropriately assessed through event tree analysis. Finally, the conclusions from the thesis are provided. The main conclusions are that the approach based on fault trees and post-processing of minimal cut sets can certainly be used to improve the quality of blowout preventer reliability estimates, and also provides a sound platform for including common cause failures in the analysis. Another key finding is that the fault tree, which is a "static model", poorly illustrates the criticality of "preventer-specific" components in escalated well control situations, since the unavailablility of certain functions due to operational conditions has little or no implication of the reliability estimates produced. In contrast, the criticality of common control system components is certainly emphasised by the fault tree model. The author suggests that quantificaiton of blowout preventer systems through fault tree analysis should be supplemented by event tree analysis to better evaluate the effect from escalation of the well control situation. Furthermore, the author recommends that a test coverage factor should be included when calculating the safety unavailability of components exclusive to shearing rams, since these cannot be fully function tested through conventional, non-destructive blowout preventer tests. It is also recommended that the industry investigate the accuracy with which the location of tool joints in the wellbore annulus can be determined through current methods. Improper spacing of tool joints is critical in a well control situation where the shear rams must be activated. </p...|$|E
