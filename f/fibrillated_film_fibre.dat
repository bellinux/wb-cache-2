40|$|Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) {{allows the}} {{determination}} of pollutants in aqueous solution by the adsorption of analytes onto stationary-phase coated fused-silica fibres followed by thermal desorption in the injection system of a capillary column gas chromatograph. This technique has been fully automated using a Varian 8100 autosampler and 3400 gas chromatograph fitted with a nitrogen-phosphorus flame thermionic detector. Fibres coated with 7 -μm and 100 -μm film thicknesses were {{used to evaluate the}} adsorption and desorption of four s-triazines. The resulting gas chromatographic peaks desorbed from the fibres were shown to be comparable to those obtained with direct manual injection. The 7 -μm fibre, designed for the analysis of semi-volatile analytes was used to investigate the effect of desorption temperature and on-column focusing temperatures on peak response. The desorption temperature was found to be non-critical and an optimum focusing temperature of 40 °C was used throughout the analysis. Evaluation of the 100 -μm <b>film</b> <b>fibre</b> demonstrated its potential to adsorb greater quantities of analyte from solution and this study established that an adsorption time of 15 min gave an equilibrium distribution of the solutes between the stationary and liquid phases. With the thicker <b>film</b> <b>fibre</b> it was noted that the effectiveness of the desorption process was reduced at temperatures below 140 °C. The linear dynamic range of the technique was evaluated over three orders of magnitude.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) forming process on radiofrequency ammonia plasma surface-treated PET flat <b>films</b> and <b>fibres</b> obtained by melt blowing. Ammonia plasma treatment allowed for the incorporation of amino functionalities on both the <b>film</b> and <b>fibre</b> surfaces, with higher values observed at very short treatment times. This plasma treatment also induced polymer chain scissions which were observed as the formation of hydrophilic nodules that coalesced together and were loosely bound to the underlying polymeric materials. These plasma-induced surface damages were notably more important on the melt-blown PET fibres. Consequently, maximisation of the surface amino groups with minimal polymer chain breaking was achieved using very short plasma treatment times (typically 1 s).

50|$|In {{the last}} century, {{polymers}} became a base material {{in everyday life}} for products like plastics, rubbers, <b>films,</b> <b>fibres</b> or paints. This huge demand has forced to extend their reliability and maximum lifetime, and a new design class of polymeric materials {{that are able to}} restore their functionality after damage or fatigue was envisaged. These polymer materials can be divided into two different groups based on the approach to the self-healing mechanism: intrinsic or extrinsic.Autonomous self-healing polymers follow a three-step process very similar to that of a biological response. In the event of damage, the first response is triggering or actuation, which happens almost immediately after damage is sustained. The second response is transport of materials to the effected area, which also happens very quickly. The third response is the chemical repair process. This process differs {{depending on the type of}} healing mechanism that is in place (e.g., polymerization, entanglement, reversible cross-linking). These self-healing materials can be classified in three different ways: capsule based, vascular, and intrinsic. While similar in some ways, these three ways differ in the ways that response is hidden or prevented until actual damage is sustained.|$|R
40|$|Despite much research, {{there are}} very few {{commercial}} prolamin bio-plastics. The major reason, apart from their high cost, is that they have inferior functional properties compared to synthetic polymer plastics. This is because the prolamins are complex, each consisting of several classes and sub-classes and the functional properties of their bio-plastics are greatly affected by water. Prolamin bio-plastics are produced by protein aggregation from a solvent or by thermoplastic processing. Recent research indicates that protein aggregation occurs by polypeptide self-assembly into nanostructures. Protein secondary structure in terms of α- helical and β-sheet structure seems to play a key, but incompletely understood role in assembly. Also, there is inadequate knowledge as to how these nanostructures further assemble and organize into the various forms of prolamin bio-plastics such as <b>films,</b> <b>fibres,</b> microparticles and scaffolds. Some improvements in bio-plastic functionality have been made by better prolamin solvation, plasticization, physical and chemical cross-linking, derivatization and blending with other polymers. The most promising area of commercialization is the biomedical field where the relative hydrophilicity, compatibility and biodegradability of particularly zein and kafirin are advantageous. With regard to biomedical applications, “supramolecular design” of prolamin bio-plastics through control over interand intramolecular weak interactions and SS/SH interchange between and within polypeptides appears to have considerable potential.

Based on the multiple cracking {{concept of the}} existing theory, analytical expressions are developed to describe the tensile stress-strain behaviour of a fibre-cement hybrid composite consisting of three components, i. e. two reinforcing fibres with different moduli, strengths and strains to failure and a common cement binder. The model predicts that the tensile stress-strain curve of the hybrid composites consists of five stages, instead of three stages of the existing models for individual fibre cements, and relates the tensile behaviour of each stage to the component properties of the components and the test system parameters. A description is given of the physical and mechanical properties of four types of reinforcing fibres used in the study.

The theoretical presentation based on flow through porous media, which is rather useful as applied to liquid filtration, is developed around a nonwovens or engineered fabrics orientation. In addition, for aerosol filtration, the author has presented in detail “single fiber theory” developed for the filtration of particles from an air stream.
