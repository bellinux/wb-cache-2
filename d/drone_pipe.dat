5000|$|The hulusi (traditional: 葫蘆絲; simplified: 葫芦丝; pinyin: húlúsī) or cucurbit flute {{is a free}} reed wind {{instrument}} from China and the Shan State. It is held vertically and has three bamboo pipes which pass through a gourd wind chest; the center pipe has finger holes and the outer two are typically drone pipes. It {{is not uncommon for}} a hulusi to have only one <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> while the second outer pipe is merely ornamental. The <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> has a finger hole, which allows it to be stopped. Advanced configurations have keyed finger holes similar to a clarinet or oboe, which can greatly extend the range of the hulusi to several octaves.|$|E
50|$|An English maker, William Bainbridge, {{in around}} 1810 {{patented}} a double flageolet {{which consisted of}} two English flageolets joined together so that the player could harmonise the tunes that he played. He also produced a triple flageolet which added a third, <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> which was fingered {{in a similar way}} to an ocarina.|$|E
50|$|The arghūl is {{primarily}} an Egyptian instrument, having a melody pipe with {{five to seven}} holes and a longer <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> without holes. It occurs in several sizes. In one specimen the melody and drone pipes are about 80 and 240 centimetres long, respectively, though the drone has removable sections to alter its pitch.|$|E

50|$|The pivtoradentsivka (Півтораденцівка) is {{translated}} as {{one and a}} half dentsivkas. It consists of two dentsivkas joined together into one instrument. Only one of the pipes has fingerholes. The other acts as a drone. The <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> in a pivtoradentsivka is usually shorter than the playing pipe. The instrument has the same fingering as the standard dentsivka.|$|E
5000|$|The arghul is a double-pipe, single-reed woodwind {{instrument}} {{that consists of}} two tubes: a melody pipe with between five and seven holes and a longer drone (Arabic ardiyya, [...] "ground") pipe. Its tone {{is similar to that}} of a clarinet, although a bit more reed-like. Unlike the similar mijwiz, the arghul has fingering holes on only one of the instrument's pipes (the melody pipe), and the <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> has a detachable length that allows the player to alter the pitch of the drone.|$|E
5000|$|The Bladder pipe (German: Platerspiel or Blaterpfeife) is {{a medieval}} {{simplified}} bagpipe, consisting of an insufflation tube (blow pipe), a bladder (bag) and a chanter; sounded by a double reed, which is fitted into a reed {{seat at the}} top of the chanter. The reed, inside the inflated bladder, is sounded continuously, and cannot be tongued. Some bladder pipes were made with a single <b>drone</b> <b>pipe,</b> and reproductions are similar to a loud, continuous crumhorn. The chanter has an outside tenon, at the top, near the reed, which fits into a socket or stock, which is then tied into the bladder.|$|E
50|$|The term pijpzak {{refers to}} a type of two-droned Flemish bagpipe, as portrayed in the artwork of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and many others. The {{instrument}} is held rather {{in front of the}} player than under the arm, as can be seen on the painting on top of this article. The two <b>drone</b> <b>pipes,</b> which have single reeds and are typically a fifth apart, are in the same stock and face directly up or slightly forward, depending on the individual position of the piper. The chanter has a conical pierce and a double reed.|$|R

50|$|The gaida of Bulgaria {{is worthy}} of its own subsection. In Bulgaria the gaida {{has been a long}} symbol of the country and its heritage, {{and is one of the}} more {{well-known}} instruments of the country. The gaida most widely used is the Thracian gaida. There is in the Rhodope mountains the deep-sounding kaba gaida. In the north, common of Dubrudzha and the Vlachs there is the dzhura gaida. Also in the Stranzha region near the border with Turkey there is the Stranzha gaida. The bag itself is made of a goat skin turned inside out, and most often the rims of the different parts of the instrument - chanter and <b>drone</b> <b>pipe</b> - have a piece of horn on it.|$|E
50|$|Drone is {{also the}} term for {{the part of a}} musical {{instrument}} intended to produce the drone effect's sustained pitch, generally without the ongoing attention of the player. Different melodic Indian instruments (e.g. the sitar, the sarod, the sarangi and the rudra veena) contain a drone. For example, the sitar features three or four resonating drone strings, and Indian notes (sargam) are practiced to a drone. Bagpipes (like the Great Highland Bagpipe and the Zampogna) feature a number of <b>drone</b> <b>pipes,</b> giving the instruments their characteristic sounds. A hurdy-gurdy has one or more drone strings. The fifth string on a five-string banjo is a drone string with a separate tuning peg that places the end of the string five frets down the neck of the instrument; this string is usually tuned to the same note as that which the first string produces when played at the fifth fret, and the drone string is seldom fretted. The bass strings of the Slovenian drone zither also freely resonate as a drone. The Welsh Crwth also features two drone strings.|$|R
50|$|Dudmaisis {{are made}} of sheep, ox, goat or dogskin or of sheep’s stomach. A blowing tube is {{attached}} to the top. On one side of the bag is a pipe with fingerholes, on the other side are one or two <b>drone</b> <b>pipes</b> without fingerholes, which play at a single tone. The mouthpieces of the pipes, which have reeds made of goose quill or cane, are usually inside the bag. On the outside end are attached bent horn-shaped tips made of apple or pine wood. The bagpipes are mentioned in written sources beginning in the 16th century. It was known throughout the territory of Lithuania, but {{by the middle of the}} 20th century it survived only near the eastern borders of Lithuania. It was played at celebrations, weddings, taverns, and markets. The bagpipes were often accompanied by fiddles, clarinets, cimbolai, basetle and drums.

5000|$|Original {{title of}} [...] "Sergeant Piper" [...] {{was changed to}} [...] "Pipe Major" [...] via Army Order 139 of 1928, change to date from 31 July 1928. On St. Patrick's Day 1991, the Queen Mother {{presented}} the regiment with its first-ever pipe banner.

50|$|A Pipe banner - rather {{similar to}} a Banner, but of a size to fit on the longest <b>drone</b> of the <b>pipes</b> (usually 45 cm) and richly {{decorated}} with gold fringing, tassles and the like. The pipe banner for a Chief {{who is also a}} Peer or a Feudal Baron should have a rounded end extending beyond the length, and any other Chief a split rounded end. A feudal baron is authorised two pipers.|$|R
50|$|The Cameron Lake Celtic is {{a legend}} {{passed down from}} some of the earlier {{settlers}} on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario at Cameron Lake. It is said that the Cameron Lake Celtic was the Captain of a steamer that was lost to the rocks of the tip of the Bruce Peninsula in the 1800s. After losing his ship and crew to the torturous waters of the area, The Celtic ended up on the shores of small inland Lake (Cameron) with only his bagpipes. It is said The Celtic was the only survivor since he was able to use his bagpipes as a flotation device. Injured and alone The Celtic would <b>drone</b> his <b>pipes</b> across the Lake at dusk to summon help. Sadly a few short weeks later The Celtic eventually died here. Accounts of bagpipe music droning across Cameron Lake at dusk are still reported today.|$|R
50|$|While Graham mixed {{this with}} a swathe of Indian, African, American, Celtic and modern and {{traditional}} American influences, Carthy in particular used the tuning in order to replicate the <b>drone</b> of uilleann <b>pipes,</b> hurdy-gurdy or the fiddle found in British medieval and folk music, played by the thumb on the two lowest strings. The style was further developed by Jansch, who brought a more forceful style of picking and, indirectly, influences from Jazz and Ragtime, leading particularly to more complex baselines. Renbourn built on all these trends and was the artist whose repertoire was most influenced by medieval music.|$|R
60|$|Midway of the {{staircase}} he heard the <b>droning</b> of <b>pipes.</b> There was dancing in the drawing-room {{to the music of}} the gorgeous piper who had marshaled them to dinner. He was not sorry, as he had no inclination to talk, and the one confidence he had anticipated with Mrs. MacSpadden {{was out of the question}} now. He had no right to reveal his later discovery. He lingered a few moments in the hall. The buzzing of the piper's drones gave him that impression of confused and blindly aggressive intoxication which he had often before noticed in this barbaric instrument, and had always seemed to him as the origin of its martial inspiration. From this he was startled by voices and steps in the gallery he had just quitted, but which came from the opposite direction to his room. It was Kilcraithie and Mrs. MacSpadden. As she caught sight of him, he fancied she turned slightly and aggressively pale, with a certain hardening of her mischievous eyes. Nevertheless, she descended {{the staircase}} more deliberately than her companion, who brushed past him with an embarrassed self-consciousness, quite in advance of her. She lingered for an instant.|$|R
50|$|The regiment's {{pipes and}} drums wear the MacDuff Ancient Tartan and {{doublets}} of piper green with white facings. Their feather bonnets carry a red, {{white and blue}} hackle denoting the colours of the Royal Corps of Transport. To denote their fully combatant status, pipers and drummers are armed with the Highland Dirk, with senior ranks carrying the Sqian Dubh (Black Knife) which is worn in their hose. The pipe major carries a banner affixed to the <b>drone</b> of his <b>pipes,</b> bearing the device - or cypher - of the regimental honorary colonel. The baldrik, worn by the drum major, is a ceremonial item which originates in the drummer's sash in which drummers used to carry their drumsticks. A pair of miniature silver drumsticks is still fitted to the baldrik.|$|R
5000|$|Sicily is home {{to several}} {{different}} types of folk music instruments, many of which {{can also be found}} in other parts of Southern Italy. The Sicilian ciaramedda is a type of Italian Zampogna (Bagpipe) that has two equal length chanters and from two to three <b>drones.</b> All the <b>pipes</b> use single cane reeds made from Arundo donax. Also made out of Arundo donax is a small end-blown flute called a friscaletto or friscalettu. The jaw harp, known in Sicilian as [...] "marranzanu" [...] is heavily associated with Sicilian folk music. Since its invention in the early 19th century the Organetto, a diatonic folk accordion is also prevalent in traditional Sicilian music. Percussion instruments include tambourines and other frame drums as well as the [...] "cupa cupa", a unique-sounding friction drum.|$|R
25|$|Accounts are {{conflicting}} {{regarding the}} exact {{form of the}} Hungarian bagpipe. Cocks describes it as similar to the Bulgarian one which has a chanter and a bass drone but no tenor drone. Baines (pp. 77-79) gives Hungary {{as one of the}} countries possessing the duda, which has this construction, also a Hungarian bagpipe with a diple (i.e., twin-bore) chanter, one bore of which gives a variable <b>drone,</b> the bag <b>pipe</b> having a bass drone in addition. Robert Bright in Travels through Lower Hungary(1818), quoted by Flood (p. 79), describes the Hungarian bagpipe as having two drones and a chanter of square section (in other worlds the Dudelsack). Fraser (p. 243) has a picture of a Hungarian bagpipe with one chanter and one drone of medium length, probably a bass drone. It seems possible that all these forms of the instrument may be in use.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to their}} own records, on 12 November 1988, the Lincolnshire Heritage Trust (now renamed Heritage Trust of Lincolnshire) {{commissioned}} pipemaker John Addison of South Somercotes to undertake research into historic bagpipes in Lincolnshire {{and to create a}} set of Lincolnshire pipes based on that research. [...] John Addison was a maker of Northumbrian smallpipes, Irish pipes, Musettes de Cour, Border and Lowland pipes and Northumbrian Half Longs. [...] Addison was well aware of the high degree of conjecture that anyone recreating a bagpipe, of the type once seen in Lincolnshire, would have to employ. In 1984, John Addison wrote about the carving in Branston Church: [...] "This powerful but primitive motif gives at least some information; it shows a bagpipe with one chanter (melody pipe) which is probably conical, one drone with a bell end, and it is mouth blown". [...] Addison goes on to say [...] "This description also covers pipes which would undoubtedly have been seen in a large part of Eastern Europe, most of Western Europe and some of North Africa and can be still seen in some of these places today". [...] Addison reached the conclusion, from his research on the possible existence of a regional bagpipe for Lincolnshire, that the closest relative of such a pipe was the Spanish gaita gallega, which he believed to be the most straightforward form of the bagpipe existing in Europe. [...] Addison based his new pipes on three carvings: a pew end carving in All Saints' Church, Branston; an oak ceiling boss in the cloister of Lincoln Cathedral and a stone carving taken from Moorby Church before it was demolished in November 1982. [...] All three depictions appear to have a conical chanter and a single bass <b>drone.</b> The <b>pipes</b> made by Addison strongly physically resemble the Spanish gaita.|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: The Spire of St. Giles’s] There is a silly {{story of}} a {{subterranean}} passage between the Castle and Holyrood, and a bold Highland piper who volunteered to explore its windings. He made his entrance by the upper end, playing a strathspey; the curious footed it after him down the street, following his descent {{by the sound of}} the chanter from below; until all of a sudden, about the level of St. Giles’s, the music came abruptly to an end, and the people in the street stood at fault with hands uplifted. Whether he was choked with gases, or perished in a quag, or was removed bodily by the Evil One, remains a point of doubt; but the piper has never again been seen or heard of from that day to this. Perhaps he wandered down into the land of Thomas the Rhymer, and some day, when it is least expected, may take a thought to revisit the sunlit upper world. That will be a strange moment for the cabmen on the stance besides St. Giles’s, when they hear the <b>drone</b> of his <b>pipes</b> reascending from the bowels of the earth below their horses’ feet.|$|R
