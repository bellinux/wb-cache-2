If therefore, for example, my friend should take it into his head to commend a man, for having been an instrument of great good to a nation, when in truth that very person had brought that same nation under great difficulties, to say no more; such ill-chosen flattery would be of no use or moment, nor add the least credit to the person so commended. Or if he should take that occasion to revive any false and groundless calumny upon other men, or another party of men; such an instance of impotent but inveterate malice, would make him still appear more vile and contemptible. The reason of all which <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was neither just, proper, nor real, and therefore must needs want the force of true eloquence, which consists in nothing else but in well representing things as they really are. I advise therefore my friend, before he praises any more of his heroes, to learn the common rules of writing; and particularly to read over and over a certain chapter in Aristotle's first book of Rhetoric, where are given very proper and necessary directions, for praising {{a man who has}} done nothing that he ought to be praised for." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{outline of}} the play is, I suppose, by this time {{sufficiently}} well known. It has two main philosophic motives. The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls the life-force (the old infidels called it Nature, which seems a neater word, and nobody knows the meaning of either of them) desires above all things to make suitable marriages, to produce a purer and prouder race, or eventually to produce a Superman. The second is that in this effecting of racial marriages the woman is a more conscious agent than the man. In short, that woman disposes {{a long time before}} man proposes. In this play, therefore, woman is made the pursuer and man the pursued. It cannot be denied, I think, that in this matter Shaw is handicapped by his habitual hardness of touch, by his lack of sympathy with the romance of which he writes, and to a certain extent even by his own integrity and right conscience. Whether the man hunts the woman or the woman the man, at least it should be a splendid pagan hunt; but Shaw is not a sporting man. Nor is he a pagan, but a Puritan. He cannot recover the impartiality of paganism which allowed Diana to propose to Endymion without thinking any the worse of her. The result is that while he makes Anne, the woman who marries his hero, a really powerful and convincing woman, he can only do it by making her a highly objectionable woman. She is a liar and a bully, not from sudden fear or excruciating dilemma; she is a liar and a bully in grain; she has no truth or magnanimity in her. The more we know that she is real, the more we know that she is vile. In short, Bernard Shaw is still haunted with his old impotence of the unromantic writer; he cannot imagine the main motives of human life from the inside. We are convinced successfully that Anne wishes to marry Tanner, but in the very process we lose all power of conceiving why Tanner should ever consent to marry Anne. A writer with a more romantic strain in him might have imagined a woman choosing her lover without shamelessness and magnetising him without fraud. Even if the first movement were feminine, it need hardly be a movement like this. In truth, of course, the two sexes have their two methods of attraction, and in some of the happiest cases they are almost simultaneous. But even on the most cynical showing they need not be mixed up. It is one thing to say that the mousetrap is not there by accident. It is another to say (in the face of ocular experience) that the mousetrap runs after the mouse.|$|E

5000|$|Writing Degree Zero {{is divided}} into two parts, with a {{stand-alone}} introduction. Part One contains four short essays, in which Barthes distinguishes the concept of a 'writing' from that of a 'style' or 'language'. In Part Two, Barthes examines various modes of modern writing and criticises French socialist realist writers {{on the grounds that they}} typically employ conventional literary tropes that are at odds with their expressed revolutionary convictions. Barthes quotes a passage from the communist novelist Roger Garaudy and comments: [...] "We see that nothing here is given without metaphor, for it must be laboriously borne home to the reader that 'it is well written' (that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is consuming is Literature)." [...] Against what he describes as 'the well-behaved writing of revolutionaries', Barthes praises the work of writers who 'create a colourless writing, freed from all bondage to a pre-ordained state of language'. Barthes credits Albert Camus with the initiation of this 'transparent form of speech', specifically Camus' 1942 novel The Stranger. However, Barthes also praises the novelist and poet Raymond Queneau for allowing the patterns of spoken speech in his fiction to 'contaminate all the parts of the written discourse', as against Jean-Paul Sartre, in whose novels only the spoken dialogue resembled spoken language, with the result that naturalness of the dialogue in Sartre's novels resembled 'arias, so to speak, surrounded by long recitatives in an entirely conventional mode of writing.' Barthes ends the book on a literally Utopian note: [...] "Feeling permanently guilty of its own solitute, it writing is none the less an imagination eagerly desiring a felicity bonheur of words, it hastens towards a dreamed-of language whose freshness, by a kind of ideal anticipation, might portray the perfection of some Adamic world where language would no longer be alienated." ...|$|E
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} Newman's {{interpretation of the}} music of J.S. Bach brought disdain from many musicians. His chosen tempos are generally extremely fast, and he often takes liberties with rhythm and ornamentation. Newman's {{argument in favor of}} his tempo <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls the [...] "traditional" [...] approach to Bach began 100 years after Bach's death and is misguided by a mystique and reverence for the composer that results in performances which are slow, rhythmically restrained and without the vivification of ornamentation. In contrast, Newman's recordings of Bach have been considered [...] "exciting" [...] by some who are skeptical of the validity of his interpretations. [...] In Newman's scholarly text, Bach and the Baroque, published in 1985 and revised in 1995, Newman supports his performance of Baroque music with a thorough analysis based on contemporary 17th and 18th century sources. Newman discusses how alterations to the written music - rhythmic variations such as rubato and notes inégale as well as improvised ornamentation - were common in Bach's time and that fast movements were played faster than has been traditionally accepted. Scholarly opposition to Newman's approach was led by Frederick Neumann who had long-held that notes inégal were limited primarily to French performance practice and that Bach, who traveled relatively little, would not have been exposed to this technique. In reviewing Newman's Bach and the Baroque in 1987 Neumann was at first somewhat gracious calling Newman [...] "...a splendid keyboard performer who can dazzle his audiences with brilliant virtuosic feats. He can, and often does, play faster than perhaps any of his colleagues, and shows occasionally other signs of eccentricity." [...] However he takes Newman to task for [...] "careless scholarship" [...] citing misuse of terms such as tactus and misinterpretation of Bach's notation. But his strongest objection is to Newman's defense of the use of notes inégal in the performance of Bach. Most of Neumann's complaints question the validity of Newman's sources.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the most}} recent mystical {{theology}} scholarship - a discipline that has found new energy and influence. This is examined {{through the lens of}} Wittgenstein's philosophy. The 'return of religion' {{since the beginning of the}} century has created a renewed interest in spirituality and mysticism. This book is intended as a guide to the most recent scholarship regarding mystical theology. The author takes as his starting point the philosophical writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Using these writings he crafts a tool to interpret the Western mystical tradition beginning with the works of Dionysius the Areopagite in the High Middle Ages and moving through such figures as Osuna, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and Jean Gerson. His central argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> terms the theologia mystica is an ancient method for effecting transformation of the heart in the individual and as such is ripe for return as an object of serious academic study...|$|E

40|$|Cultures and worldviews are inscribed {{by means}} of ‘writing’, or what Derrida calls ‘the {{perdurable}} inscription of a sign’ (Of Grammatology). A sign is the union between signifier and signified. The signifier may be natural (clouds indicate {{that it is going}} to rain) or artificial. All cultures are made up of relations that stay at the level of signs, that is, everything that belongs to culture is empirical and conventional. In this regard, both Aboriginal and Western culture remain at the same level. Moreover, both cultures produce objectivity {{by means of}} contrast and experimentation, in the design of a sharp object, for example an arrow or a knife. In Ancient Greece, Havelock contends that the invention of writing dramatically increased the possibilities of objective thought (The Muse Learns To Write), but it also created a logic of binaries that transcended the objectivity of science and transpired into the ideology behind colonialism. In this context, the role of writing is analyzed in David Malouf’s Remembering Babylon. How does writing affect Gemmy all throughout the book? Already in the first Chapter, the teacher and the minister of the colony analyze Gemmy ‘in writing’. Gemmy knows what writing is but hasn’t learnt its ‘trick’: he does not know how to read or write. All he can see <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> tells about his life, all his pain and suffering, is translated into marks and magic squiggles on the paper: only the spirit of the story he tells is captured. But little by little, the cognitive effects of writing get hold of Gemmy, until he starts to understand his life within the framework of the logic of binaries and identity upon which all reflective thought and science rest. All in all, this deconstructive reading can be seen as a critique of Europe’s modern idea of the autonomy of reason, in the name of a heteronymous rationality in the form of writing...|$|E
