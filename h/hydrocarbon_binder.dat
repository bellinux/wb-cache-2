40|$|The {{addition}} of metal particles, like Aluminum or Boron, to typically used <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>binder</b> {{is an interesting}} topic for advanced propulsion system like air breathing ramjet engines, ducted rockets and so on; in fact {{this is due to}} higher gravimetric and volumetric combustion heat capacity of metal additive in comparision with conventional solid fluids. T main purpose of the present research is to investigate the general structure and topoloy of the multiphase diffusion flame of Aluminum particles embedded in a Hydrogen jet within an hot air environment, concerning the ramjet relevant conditions match air inlet temperature...|$|E
40|$|Model {{formulations}} of RDX and a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>binder</b> were studied by various methods {{to investigate the}} effect of addnl. polymeric fuel on the burning mechanism. The fuel reduces the burning rate at higher pressures and the pressure exponent. Extinguished burning surfaces show that the RDX is depleted at the surface. Emission spectra in the UV/VIS are dominated by OH, NH and CN similar {{to the case of}} pure RDX. However, the OH decreases at higher distances from the surface obviously consumed by decompn. products of the fuel. At high pressures (> 2 MPa) soot emits strong continuous radiation. The temps. obtained from the OH bands at 306 nm range from 2800 - 3000 K which is close to the adiabatic flame temp. The temps. evaluated from the continuous radiation are considerably lower indicating radiation cooling...|$|E

In this paper, we present and analyze the experimental results of the investigation of the ignition and combustion of mixtures based on a <b>hydrocarbon</b> and active <b>binder</b> with inorganic oxidants and energy-intensive fillers...|$|R
40|$|The {{plateau burning}} {{behavior}} of composite solid propellants consisting of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and <b>hydrocarbon</b> (HC) <b>binder</b> with a bimodal AP parti-cle size distribution (coarse and fine) is examined. The focus is the weak pressure {{dependence of the}} propellant burn rate (i. e., a plateau) in an intermediate range of about 2. 7 - 6. 9 MPa (~ 400 - 1000 psi). The relationship between the appearance of this mid-pressure plateau for a composite propellant and self-extinction during the burning of the corresponding fine AP/binder matrix (i. e., the propellant formulation without the coarse AP particles) is experimentally examined through the study of a compositional array of propellants, sandwiches (two-dimensional propellants) and matrixes. The burn...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{evaluation}} of evaporation rate of {{volatile organic compounds}} from soil beds during processing is presented. For the experiment, soil samples were prepared with the same amounts of benzene and stabilized using a mixture of CEMI 42. 5 R cement and fly ash from pit-coal combustion. Solidification of soils contaminated with BTEX <b>hydrocarbons</b> using hydraulic <b>binders</b> involves a risk of releasing vapours of these compounds during homogenization of waste with stabilizing mixture introduced and its dilution with water. The primary purposes of the research were: analysis of benzene volume emitted from soil during stabilization/solidification process and characterization of factors that may negatively {{affect the quality of}} measurements/the course of stabilization process. Analysis of benzene emission intensity during the process was based on concentration (C 6 H 6) values, recorded with flame-ionization detector above the surface of reacting mixture. At the same time, gaseous contaminants emitted during waste stabilization were passed through pipes filled with activated carbon (SCK, Anasorb CSC). Benzene vapours adsorbed on activated carbon were subjected to analysis using gas chromatograph Varian 450 -GC. Evaporation characteristics of benzene during processing contaminated soils revealed the stages creating the highest danger to workers’ health, as well as a need for actions connected with modification of technological line...|$|R
40|$|Reduction {{of small}} charges of uranium tetrafluoride with {{magnesium}} {{proved to be}} successful. By hand-tamping of UF/sub 4 / [...] Mg blend, tap densities ranglng between 3. 1 and 3. 4 g/cc were obtained. The reduction yields for these densities ranged from 72. 79 to 93. 71 %. In the case of machinecompacted UF 4 [...] Mg blend having tap densities from 3. 58 to 3. 68 g/cc, reduction yields were higher, ranging between 91. 45 and 97. 2 %. Machine-compacted blends gave much more uniform temperature distribution curves during the preheating period, {{as a result of}} higher tap densities. The best yields were obtained by firing a machine- compacted blend containing 5 % Mg excess at a furnace temperature of 650 deg C, giving an average crude metal yield of 96. 3 %. However, the high carbon content of 174 ppm in the crude uranium biscuits obtained by compacts reduction, as a result of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>binder</b> presence, appeared to be a disadvantage. Attempts were also made to demonstrate the initiation of the reduction reaction at temperatures lower than 500 deg C by taking x-ray-diffraction patterns of the samples of the UF 4 [...] Mg charges heated up to various temperatures.

40|$|In today’s era, {{solid waste}} {{management}} is the thrust area. Out of this various waste materials, plastic waste, tyre waste and municipal solid waste are of great concern. On the other side, the road traffic is increasing. The traffic intensity isalso increasing. The load bearing capacities of the road are to be increased. Our present work is helping {{to take care of}} both these aspects. Plastic waste, consisting of carry bags, cups, thermocoles, etc. {{can be used as a}} coating over aggregate and this coated stone can be used for road construction. Secondly the waste tires are powdered and the powder is blended with bitumen and this blend is used along with plastic coated aggregate. The mix polymer coated aggregate and tyre modified bitumen have shown higher strength. Use of this mix for road construction helps to use both plastics waste and tyre waste. Stone aggregate is coated with the molten waste plastics. The coating of plastics reduces the porosity, absorption of moisture and improves soundness. The polymer coated aggregate bitumen mix forms better material for flexible pavement construction as the mix shows higher Marshall Stability value and suitable Marshall Coefficient. Moreover the polymer coated aggregate helps to use Crumb rubber modified bitumen resulting in better result.

40|$|Composite {{propellants}} {{are composed}} of a solid oxidizer that is mixed into a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>binder</b> that when polymerized results in a solid mass capable of selfsustained combustion after ignition. Plateau propellants exhibit burning rate curves that do not follow the typical linear relationship between burning rate and pressure when plotted on a log-log scale, {{and because of this}} deviation their burning behavior is classified as anomalous burning. It is not unusual for solid-particle additives to be added to propellants in order to enhance burning rate or other properties. However, the effect of nano-size solid additives in these propellants is not fully understood or agreed upon within the research community. The current project set out to explore what possible variables were creating this result and to explore new additives. This thesis contains a literature review chronicling the last half-century of research to better understand the mechanisms that govern anomalous burning and to shed light on current research into plateau and related propellants. In addition to the review, a series of experiments investigating the use of nanoscale TiO 2 -based additives in AP-HTPB composite propellants was performed. The baseline propellant consisted of either 70 % or 80 % monomodal AP (223 ?m) and 30 % or 20 % binder composed of IPDI-cured HTPB with Tepanol. Propellants? burning rates were tested using a strand bomb between 500 and 2500 psi (34. 0 - 170. 1 atm). Analysis of the burning rate data shows that the crystal phase and synthesis method of the TiO 2 additive are influential to plateau tailoring and to the apparent effectiveness of the additive in altering the burning rate of the composite propellant. Some of the discrepancy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of TiO 2 as a tailoring additive may be due to differences in how the additive was produced. Doping the TiO 2 with small amounts of metallic elements (Al, Fe, or Gd) showed additional effects on the burning rate that depend on the doping material and the amount of the dopant...|$|E
40|$|Counterflow {{diffusion}} flames are {{studied for}} various fuels flowing against decomposition products from solid ammonium perchlorate (AP) pellets {{in order to}} obtain fundamental understanding of composite propellant flame structure and chemistry. We illustrate this approach through a combined experimental and numerical study of a fuel mixture consisting of C 2 H 4 CO + H 2, and C 2 H 2 + C 2 H 4 flowing against solid AP. For these particular AP-fuel systems, the resulting flame zone simulates the various flame structures that are ex+ to exist between reaction products from Ap crystals and a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>binder.</b> As in all our experimental studies, quantitative species and temperature profiles have been measured between the fuel exit and AP surface. Species measured included CN, NH, NO, OH, N 2, CO 2, CO, H 2, CO, HCl, and H 2 O. Temperature was measured using a thermocouple at the exit, spontaneous Raman scattering measurements throughout the flame, OH rotational population distributions, and NO vibrational population distributions. The burning rate of AP was also measured as a function of strain rate, given by the separation distance between the AP surface and the gaseous hydrocarbon fuel tube exit plane. This distance was nominally set at 5 mm, although studies have been performed for variations in separation distance. The measured 12 scalars are compared with predictions from a detailed gas-phase kinetics model consisting of 86 species and 531 reactions. Model predictions are found to be in good agreement with experiment and illustrate the type of kinetic features that may be expected to occur in propellants when AP particle size distributions are varied. Furthermore, the results constitute the continued development of a necessary database and validation of a comprehensive model for studying more complex AP-solid fuel systems in microgravity. Exploratory studies have also been performed with liquid and solid fuels at normal gravity. Because of melting (and hence dripping) and deep thermal wave penetration into the liquid, these experiments were found feasible, but not used for obtaining quantitative data. Microgravity experiments are needed to eliminate the dripping and boiling phenomena of these systems at normal gravity. Microgravity tests in the NASA Glenn 2. 2 second drop tower were performed (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of performing propellant experiments using the NASA Glenn microgravity facilities, (2) to develop the operational procedures for safe handing of the energetic materials and disposal of their toxic combustion by-products and (3) to obtain initial measurements of the AP burning rate and flame structure under microgravity conditions. Experiments were conducted on the CH 4 /AP system previously studied at normal gravity using a modified design of the counterflow burner and a NASA Glenn Pig Rig, i. e., one of the existing drop rigs for general-purpose usage. In these experiments, the AP burning rate was measured directly with a linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) and video imaging of the flame structure was recorded ignition was achieved by hot wires stretched across the AP surfaces. Initial drop tower combustion data show that with the same burner separation distance and flow conditions of the normal gravity experiments, the AP burning rate is approximately a factor of two lower. This difference is likely a result of radiation effects, but further tests with longer test times need to be conducted to verify that steady state conditions were achieved under microgravity conditions...|$|E
