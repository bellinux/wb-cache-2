The announcer of the football game Homer is listening to at church is based on Keith Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Interpretive {{programs}} and services for national parks were pioneered in Yosemite by Harold C. Bryant and Loye Holmes Miller in 1920. Ansel F. Hall became the first park naturalist in 1921 and served in that role for two years. Hall's <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> park museums act as public contact centers for interpretive programs became a model followed by other national parks in the United States and internationally. Yosemite Museum, the first permanent museum in the National Park System, was completed in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jean Grey sacrifice herself {{at the end and}} to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{experimented with}} {{numerous}} robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers {{to form the}} final cast. Bay acknowledged {{that most of the}} Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.|$|E

5|$|The area {{in which}} the Flanders family's beach house is located in is based on the Cape Cod peninsula. Many of the writers of The Simpsons spent time on Cape Cod so they decided to model the new {{locations}} on it. The animators looked at Cape Cod photographs to get inspiration for the episode, and one of the show's background designers, Lance Wilder, grew up in that area. The beach house is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire, to which the writers had visited many times. They played several board games when they were there, which gave them the <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to the Simpson family play the Mystery Date board game in the episode. Silverman said that the episode was difficult to animate and direct because it had so many new and detailed backgrounds and completely different locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Writer Darin Morgan had {{pieces of}} the script for a long time, drawing {{inspiration}} from research he had done on hypnosis and a book on government coverups and UFOs that theorized that UFOs are a phenomenon that manipulate space and time, but are not piloted by aliens. Morgan had {{the idea for the}} teaser in mind before becoming a staff member on the show. The narrative style was influenced by a casting session Morgan witnessed where an actor auditioning sounded like Truman Capote. From this he came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a writer covering the case. Capote died in 1984, and second choice Rip Taylor was unavailable, so the role of Jose Chung ended up going to Charles Nelson Reilly. Jesse Ventura was cast as one of the men in black, while the other, which Morgan had originally wanted Johnny Cash for, went to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. The role of Lord Kinbote went to stuntman Tony Morelli.|$|E

After Allegiant shut down operations in 2013, there has been no major commercial airline service out of Gary Airport.|$|R
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1958, in the situationist manifesto, Debord {{described}} official {{culture as a}} [...] "rigged game", where conservative powers forbid subversive <b>ideas</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> direct access <b>to</b> the public discourse.

With O'Neill being the new leader of Stargate Command (SGC), Lt. Col. Samantha Carter has assumed O'Neill's old position {{as leader of the}} SG-1 unit. The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the episode focus on General O'Neill solving various problems at his new job came from the writers' wondering what the general of the SGC does while his teams are on missions.|$|E
500|$|Gandzasar became home to Armenia's first {{completed}} Haysmavurk (Synaxarion), {{a calendar}} {{collection of short}} lives of saints and accounts of important religious events. The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new, better organized Haysmavurk came from Hasan-Jalal himself, who then placed his request with Father Israel (Ter-Israel), a disciple of an important Armenian medieval philosopher and Artsakh native known as Vanakan Vardapet. The Haysmavurk was further developed by Kirakos Gandzaketsi. Ever since, the Haysmavurk ordered by Hasan-Jalal became known as [...] "Synaxarion of Ter-Israel;" [...] it was mass printed in Constantinople in 1834.|$|E
500|$|Lost Luggage was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo, a video game studio based in Richardson, Texas, which targeted the game at people who traveled regularly, believing {{that they would like}} its content. At the time of Lost Luggages development, the company employed five people. The game was conceived by programmer Ed Salvo. He had been at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and was waiting at the carousel for his luggage to arrive. Later, Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the carousel [...] "spewing unmentionables." ...|$|E

500|$|Waylon Smithers {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in this episode, although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". In his first visual appearance, he was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made an African American by Györgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be [...] "Mr. Burns' white sycophant", and the staff thought it [...] "would be a bad <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a black subservient character" [...] and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Smithers' skin tone was later explained as an [...] "extreme tan".|$|E

The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during [...] "A.A.R.M." [...] did the writers feel it was the right time. In addition, the episode contained several scenes that were purposely staged to be reminiscent of past episodes of the series, with scenes mimicking unique shots in both the third season installment [...] "Gay Witch Hunt" [...] and the sixth season episode [...] "The Delivery".|$|E
500|$|Many {{observed}} that Burton {{was more interested}} in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime. Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred's last day of employment at Wayne Manor," [...] Hamm said.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{evidence}} {{is among the}} central concerns of epistemology broadly construed.

500|$|Jules Kmetzko {{designed}} the portraits of Dwight and Mose, {{as well as}} Dwight's propaganda picture. He had previously created Pam's watercolor of Dunder Mifflin that hung on the walls. All of the dances moves were choreographed by Mary Ann Kellogg, who had choreographed many of the series' dance-heavy episodes. The obstacle course in the warehouse was crafted by Rogers and Forrester, with input from the show's art department. Wilson also helped, since he eventually {{was the one who}} ran through it; it was his <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the course terminate on a raised palette of boxes. Originally, the course was supposed to be in the park lot, but Rogers moved it, feeling that the warehouse was [...] "more organic" [...] and that the heat would have been detrimental to the finished product. The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during [...] "A.A.R.M." [...] did the writers feel it was the right time. The card and envelope was the same one used for [...] "Christmas Party" [...] almost seven years prior. In fact, the card contained a genuine message that Krasinksi wrote for Fischer. Rogers admitted that the Pam and Jim video was inspired by a number of fan videos that exist on the internet. The reason that [...] "Open Your Eyes" [...] by Snow Patrol plays over the video is that Claire Scanlon, the series editor, felt that it was similar in style to [...] "Sing" [...] by Travis, which played in the second season episode [...] "The Client".|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{originally}} {{pitched the}} episode to Toby Whithouse {{for the previous}} series {{with the idea of}} a hotel with shifting rooms. However, as production continued, Moffat thought that there were too many instances in which the characters were running through corridors in that series, so Whithouse wrote [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] instead and [...] "The God Complex" [...] was pushed to the next series. The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a Minotaur be the monster came from Whithouse's love for Greek mythology. Whithouse was more pleased with [...] "The God Complex" [...] than [...] "School Reunion" [...] and [...] "The Vampires of Venice", his previous Doctor Who scripts, as the tone was darker which he was [...] "more comfortable" [...] writing.|$|E

The <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the crew on the back cover was Duane Allman's idea, as all involved viewed them the [...] "unsung heroes" [...] in the operation.
