We designed a choice-based conjoint experiment to examine the relative importance of four criteria in the subcontractor selection process of main contractors from Singapore: price, technical <b>know-how,</b> <b>quality,</b> and cooperation. Although main contractors adopt a multicriteria selection process and perceive all four criteria to be important for their choice decision, the actual choice situation reveals that price is still by far the most important selection criterion, followed by quality, cooperation, and technical know-how. Main contractors are not willing to compromise on price but accept a lower performance of a known subcontractor on the remaining criteria...|$|E

Various actors have encouraged this activity to improve local livelihoods, environmental sustainability and industrial wood supply. These efforts have been generally successful, but they are often undertaken without technical assistance. Since farmers often lack technical capacity and management <b>know-how,</b> the <b>quality</b> and quantity of products may not be optimal.

40|$|Dynamic {{nature of}} global {{business}} makes {{it necessary for}} supply chains to be adaptable to changes. Also, complexities of the working environment and increasing competition in different industries have led to unstableness of the competitiveness factors. Creating and maintaining competitiveness need capabilities which create value for costumers based on the organization capacities. In the present study, a model of supply chain resilience is presented for competitiveness in Iranian automotive companies. It is expected that by its application, automobile firms not only have an effective method for controlling incidents, but also get to competitiveness. For this purpose, first by extensive review of the literature, a preliminary conceptual framework was extracted for supply chain resilience {{in order to create}} competitiveness. Then, using experts' views (Delphi method), interview, and doing the survey, the research model was formed and finalized based on the conditions of Iranian automobile industry. Results of the study showed that Iranian automobile firms can create the required flexibility for encountering the most important vulnerabilities of the firms by creating or improving capabilities like flexibility in sourcing, efficiency, security, flexibility in fulfillment, adaptability, and collaboration, and then using these opportunities they create competitiveness. The vulnerabilities of the firms include things like exchange and price fluctuations, international sanctions, weakness in <b>know-how,</b> low <b>quality</b> of the products, and weak services...|$|R

The efficient use of the ERP system relies heavily on the <b>know-how,</b> experience and <b>quality</b> of the users. Since the knowledge of operating ERP system is difficult to be acquired, shared and diffused among the users, it takes {{time and money to}} train well-experienced users. As a result, this paper presents a framework of Knowledge-based Simulation System for Enterprise Resources Planning named KBSimERP.

40|$|In France, {{researchers}} {{and public policy}} makers are calling for the agroecological transition of livestock. This transition is facing technical, economic, social, and cultural obstacles. Whereas technical obstacles are extensively studied, other categories remain little studied despite their potential role in agroecological transition of livestock. This article aims to analyze the livestock cultural and territorial vitality (dis) services perceived by local actors on two distinct French territories and to understand how these services could act as levers for theagroecological transition of livestock. To do so, we interviewed 45 local actors from the livestock sector and localrural development in two French territories: Aubrac (24) and Pays de Rennes (21). We conducted inductive content analyses to draw on interviewees’ perceptions and link the cultural and territorial vitality services identified to the agroecological transition of livestock. Our work revealed 20 cultural and territorial vitality services that can be organized into 11 categories (7 categories of cultural services and 4 categories of territorial vitality services). Among the 11 cultural services, cultural landscapes linked to livestock and gastronomy heritage were the most cited. Among the nine territorial vitality services, the contribution to social bonds on the territories wasthe most cited. Here, we showed {{for the first time}} that the prioritization of cultural and territorial vitality services were different between the territories studied. Emblematic cow breed, food <b>know-how,</b> and <b>quality</b> products were more important in Aubrac, whereas territorial vitality services such as on-farm jobs and social bonds linked to livestock were more cited in the Pays de Rennes. Such methodological approach allowed us to highlight and prioritize the different cultural and vitality services, which need to be supported by public policyand translated into action...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{important}} new service management strategy: the operations capabilities-service quality-performance (C-SQ-P) triad. In {{order to understand}} what generic operations capabilities influence the strategic behavior of high performing service firms, we explore three related questions: What generic operations capabilities are among the strategic determinants of service quality? Does service quality affect market performance? How is market conduct related to the C-SQ-P triad? These questions are investigated using a stylized capabilities-based model of service quality that simultaneously assesses their impact upon a firm's market performance. Several insights emerge from our research: a) generic operations capabilities affect service quality and performance, although not all relationships are direct; b) service <b>quality</b> <b>know-how</b> and innovations can be directly observed and imitated; c) the effects of technological leadership and market acuity on service quality are moderated by the absorptive capacity of employees to recognize and exploit their potential, and hence, investments in people are critical to success; d) market conduct influences the generic capabilities of the firm more than market performance, ceteris paribus; and e) total factor productivity and service quality are negatively correlated. operations strategy, capabilities-based competition, absorptive capacity, resource based view, competitive advantage, service management performance...|$|R
40|$|Production frontiers and {{inefficiency}} determinants {{are estimated}} by using stochastic models. Textile manufacturing is {{considered for a}} sample of eight developing countries encompassing about one thousand firms. We find that the most influential individual inefficiency determinants relate to in-house organization. Both access to financing and infrastructural services (e. g. power supply, modern information technologies [...] .) also matter. Information about determinants is then regrouped into three broad categories (e. g. managerial organization, economic environment, institutions) by using principal component analyses. Results do not reject the hypothesis that managerial <b>know-how</b> and the <b>quality</b> of institutions {{are the most important}} determinants. The impact of the external economic environment is of less importance although statistically significant. Sector-based simulations are then proposed in order to assess productivity gains which would occur if firms had the opportunity to evolve in most favorable environments within the sample. Domestic and international production contexts are considered, respectively. When referring to domestic benchmarks, the contribution of in-house organization prevails as the main source of gains for the eight countries. The role of institutions proves dominant for Egypt and India when focusing on international simulations. textile;firms;Technical efficiency;organizational know-how;productivity;institutions;external economic environment;one step stochastic frontier method...|$|R
30|$|In the end, SFSCs {{seem to be}} able, in the Trentino context, to {{reinforce}} {{the link between the}} mountains and the city. Indeed, it seems that consumer attitudes toward these practices are already very positive, thanks to their strong territorial identity. It follows that, rather than the farms responding to the needs of consumers as mostly happens elsewhere, in Trentino it is the consumers who satisfy the needs of the farms, for the sake of this bond. As we have seen, what farms need is mainly to protect their specific features and to communicate them to the market. Indeed, most of these farms could not be economically sustainable if they operated on the mainstream market, thus one of the few options they have is {{to take advantage of the}} uniqueness of their products, which are special both in terms of tangible (taste, traditional recipes, etc.) and intangible <b>qualities</b> (<b>know-how</b> of the farmer, relation to the local identity, etc.) to carve out a niche in the market. On the other hand, these consumers are inherently more aware of these needs, as a result of a lifestyle that makes them more attached to their identity and origins, as well as proud of their territory and the products that it can provide.|$|R

This paper attempts to exploit the situation where participants' collaborative outcomes require a specific and serious <b>know-how</b> analysis on <b>quality</b> issues for their proper achievement before it could confer a set of sustainable competitive liabilities rather than their equivalent competitive advantages. Naturalistic and interpretive research approaches towards using TC usability heuristics are initially adopted, which forms a backdrop of this study. We then validate the business theories by exploring a set of particular phenomenon as they are manifested to re-evaluate the business consequences and outcomes. We conclude this paper with the identification of organizational business prerequisites {{through the development of}} Collaborative Space of Opportunities Matrix (CSOM) from process perspective. It is demonstrated that these matrices would assist the participants of a TC business system to drill down quickly to discover underlying causes of changing conditions in business environments. The results of our study would also yield information that may be useful for guiding future research in this emerging field.

Experience shows that due to the high costs or the unavailability of missions, experimenting on life support systems in manned missions and traditionally large satellites has become very difficult for research institutes and virtually impossible for SME’s. Pico- and small satellites could fill the gap for performing necessary experiments, if tests can be automated, controlled and monitored from earth in a cost-effective way. Ample initiatives to provide easy access to space and multi-orbiting of pico-satellites, ensure the participation of research and educational institutes which can take an important role in vital biological research and in the spread of this innovative <b>know-how.</b> The intrinsic <b>qualities</b> of CubeSats, relatively cheap, easy orbiting, fast development, makes it an excellent research instrument, complementary to experiments on-board the ISS.

40|$|The thesis {{studied the}} {{development}} and implementation of the conceptual Continuous Improvement Teamworking (CIT) Model for strategic performance improvement in retail banking operations. The investigation using of a dominant qualitative to a Less-dominant quantitative approach as a mixed-method strategy revealed the importance of the CIT Model realised through the CTIO (Concern-Task-Interaction-Outcome) Problem-Solving Cycle. The CTIO Cycle is a variant form of the traditional Deming-Shewhart PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) Cycle. With deregulation through financial reforms (FSRA Act) banking organizations are facing increased competition in the retail banking supply chain. There has been a new form and type of hybrid teamworking approach with banking organizations becoming virtual enterprises with sophistication of the financial management system and technological know how. With virtual meetings and interactive electronic communication people at work above their normal routine face-to-face teamworking activities are also having meetings, communication and sharing of information through a modernized Continuous Improvement Teamworking Approach using traditional teamworking, virtual team working (e-teamwork) and continuous improvement. In the mixed-method strategy used, the participant observation performed for 12 months in the retail banking operations confirmed the model. The two case studies implemented the CTIO Cycle with team members in two retail banking operations justified its problem-solving methodology to achieve strategic performance improvement of two key performance measures (sales referrals and customer satisfaction). The model tested in the two retail banking operations yielded desired and significant improvement. The 29 face-to-face interviews with managers using content analysis evaluated the validity of the model, and eventually the personal survey (149 questionnaires) with staff confirmed the reliability of the model. By doing the dominant qualitative research first, many hidden details and crucial parameters of the CIT Model were properly discovered by the researcher being closer to the scene. This would not have been successfully achieved if a quantitative methodology was firstly used. The findings provide insight into the triangulation of the knowledge domains of Continuous Improvement, teamworking and virtual teamworking from an integrated retail supply chain management perspective. The CIT Model is becoming increasingly important due to severe competition, economic down turn, increasing wave of technological <b>know-how</b> and <b>quality</b> information system. Considering the negative aspects of virtual teamworking, face-to-face teamworking is still being used with virtual interaction media. The research confirmed that teamworking in a modern service environment requires the use of both face-to-face and virtual interactions to deliver strategic productive performance of their retail supply chain. Thus, this study contributed for more than 29 papers with the Best Refereed Paper Award by the PhD Candidate at the Association of Qualitative Research (AQR) International Biennual Conference and two other awards from industry. This research is important to senior managers and first-line managers in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of teamwork as well as the overall operational activities of their businesses facing increasing competition, economic downturn, paradigm shift to e-Human Resources Management, e-quality management, e-Supply Chain Management, demanding customers for information system quality, and widespread waves of technology-driven innovations in information and communication technologies (ICT) in the retail banking supply chain...|$|R
40|$|According to {{research}} {{done by the}} International Water Management Institute (IWMI), one-third of the world?s population will face absolute water scarcity by the year 2025. Among the worst hit will be regions in Asia, the Middle-East and Sub-Saharan Africa, {{home to some of}} the largest concentrations of rural poverty in the world. Policymakers, researchers, NGOs, and farmers are pursuing various technical, institutional and policy interventions to meet this challenge. Micro-irrigation technologies, commonly in use in water scarce areas of developed countries, constitute one such intervention with the ability to use water more efficiently in irrigated agriculture. These technologies can improve productivity; raise incomes through crop yields and outputs; and enhance food security of households. Numerous studies have established the gains from micro-irrigation adoption and several government and non-government organizations are engaged in actively promoting the technologies. In India, micro-irrigation technologies have been marketed for more than three decades. The main vehicle of government policies to promote micro-irrigation systems are product subsidies?in certain cases up to 90 percent. However, there has been a lukewarm response to such initiatives from farmers, especially smallholders. This can be attributed to several causes: lack of access to groundwater, lack of cash, crop specificity of the available micro-irrigation technologies, lack of <b>know-how,</b> poor product <b>quality</b> and absence of adequate credit facilities (Narayanamoorthy 1996). Studies show that despite active promotion, the appeal of these technologies has remained confined to ?gentlemen farmers??wealthier farmers who produce commercial crops (Shah and Keller 2002). Despite these constraints, in certain pockets of India, these technologies have become a popular choice among farmers. It is notable that, in some of these cases, the technologies have been adopted in the absence of government subsidies. However, IWMI?s work shows that in general special efforts are required to market cost appropriate technologies to the poor and smallholder farmers. Drip irrigation is often promoted for reasons that do not match with the farmers? main concerns. While the government promotes drips as longterm investments for water saving and sustainable agriculture, the farmers look for more immediate and assured benefits, such as lower costs and increased incomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to introduce the emerging non-contacting spray coating process and {{compare it to the}} existing coating techniques. Particular emphasis was given to the details of the spraying process of paper coating colour and the base paper requirements set by the new coating method. Spraying technology itself is nothing new, but the atomisation process of paper coating colour is quite unknown to the paper industry. The differences between the rheology of painting and coating colours make it very difficult to utilise the existing information from spray painting research. Based on the trials, some basic conclusion can be made:The {{results of this study suggest}} that the Brookfield viscosity of spray coating colour should be as low as possible, presently a 50 mPas level is regarded as an optimum. For the paper quality and coater runnability, the solids level should be as high as possible. However, the graininess of coated paper surface and the nozzle wear limits the maximum solids level to 60 % at the moment. Most likelydue to the low solids and low viscosity of the coating colour the low shear Brookfield viscosity correlates very well with the paper and spray fan qualities. High shear viscosity is also important, but yet less significant than the low shear viscosity. Droplet size should be minimized and besides keeping the brrokfield viscosity low that can be helped by using a surfactant or dispersing agent in the coating colour formula. Increasing the spraying pressure in the nozzle can also reduce the droplet size. The small droplet size also improves the coating coverage, since there is hardly any levelling taking place after the impact with the base paper. Because of the lack of shear forces after the application, the pigment particles do not orientate along the paper surface. Therefore the study indicates that based on the present <b>know-how,</b> no <b>quality</b> improvements can be obtained by the use of platy type of pigments. The other disadvantage of them is the rapid deterioration of the nozzle lifetime. Further research in both coating colour rheology and nozzle design may change this in the future, but so far only round shape pigments, like typically calcium carbonate is, can be used with spray coating. The low water retention characteristics of spray coating, enhanced by the low solids and low viscosity, challenge the base paper absorption properties. Filler level has to be low not to increase the number of small pores, which have a great influence on the absorption properties of the base paper. Hydrophobic sizing reduces this absorption and prevents binder migration efficiently. High surface roughness and especially poor formation of the base paper deteriorate thespray coated paper properties. However, pre-calendering of the base paper does not contribute anything to the finished paper quality, at least at the coating colour solids level below 60 %. When targeting a standard offset LWC grade, spraycoating produces similar quality to film coating, but yet blade coating being on a slightly better level. However, because of the savings in both investment and production costs, spray coating may have an excellent future ahead. The porousnature of the spray coated surface offers an optimum substrate for the coldset printing industry to utilise the potential of high quality papers in their business...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{a factory}} is a challenge, {{as it has}} to be {{intended}} as a workplace, as well as a symbolic representation of the company and its referential markets. The issue was to create a building capable of letting a large stock coexist with offices and a showroom. The aim was to express Midj’s build <b>quality,</b> <b>know-how</b> and technology, without risking hasty experimentations or too much "formalist" solutions that would have been unfit for the brand. The shape of the volume was dated, as well as its layout and construction system. The idea was to make the company's activity "transparent", with furnishing visible through floor-to-ceiling windows throughout the day. The entrance stairs and elevator are contained in a red vertical volume, which has been separated {{from the rest of the}} building by a pool of water. A walkway suspended on the water leads to the main entry. The constructive system is very simple: two prefabricated elements, a concrete frame and a curtain wall, that have been set close together. However, the image that results is sophisticated and far from a simple beaux art "dressing". It is rather the excavation of a monolith that makes inner meanings emerge. The work does not deny its essence and function. It is an industrial building whose container seeks a congruent symbiosis with the content. It is therefore as solid as a granite, like the idea of industry should be. It's simple and rational; here the “less is more” concept fully emerges in a skilful game of rhythms, solids and voids, and random textures that dynamically punctuates the fronts. The dark grey colour lightens the masses and emphasizes the light emerging from the windows on top, enlightening the presence of the red staircase body in the middle. The openings bring green and open spaces inside, reinterpreting the modernist theme of the roof garden, recreating the concept of "quality of work" developed by Wright and Canali. Led lights - which are placed according to the "random" geometry of blades drawn on fronts - enhance dynamism, as well as turn the company into an urban landmark. Showrooms and offices have been designed by Oximoro Architetti as a single open space punctuated by cylindrical islands that can be moved and/or set up easily.
