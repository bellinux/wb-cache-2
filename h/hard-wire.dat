50|$|Coupling is {{also the}} {{transfer}} of electrical energy from one circuit segment to another. For example, energy is transferred from a power source to an electrical load by means of conductive coupling, which may be either resistive or <b>hard-wire.</b> An AC potential may be transferred from one circuit segment to another having a DC potential by use of a capacitor. Electrical energy may be transferred from one circuit segment to another segment with different impedance by use of a transformer. This is known as impedance matching. These are examples of electrostatic and electrodynamic inductive coupling.|$|E
5000|$|Recording of {{the album}} {{proved to be a}} trying task for the band and producer, David Rubinson. The band needed to <b>hard-wire</b> the {{components}} together, and the synthesizers, mixed on eight-track, were layered on to one oscillator at a time. Moskowitz, in particular, sang through a ring modulator and electric filtering which created a unique, eerie effect specific to the era. Every instrument, including the percussion playing, was electronically altered through amplifiers. The LP, The United States of America, was released in 1968 and charted at number 181 on the Billboard 200, but was still cited as a disappointment. It became relatively well known in the UK through the inclusion of one track, [...] "I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife For You, Sugar", on a popular budget sampler album, The Rock Machine Turns You On.|$|E

5000|$|From 25 December 2005 {{the line}} was closed for {{completion}} of the conversion to seven cars, including signalling alterations and software modification to the platform-edge doors. The original plan was to <b>hard-wire</b> two cars together so that the onboard computer would [...] "see" [...] them as one car, but this proved unnecessary. Since the stock was designed as six-car sets {{with the ability to}} add a seventh car, platforms were already long enough for seven-car trains and platform-edge doors had been built with space for a seventh car. The line was scheduled to close for five days, but the work was completed ahead of schedule and the line reopened two days early. The new car is a trailer car in the [...] "odd" [...] unit, with design designation [...] "G".

5000|$|According to Unterberger, [...] "the {{very fact}} that the {{equipment}} was so primitive... lent a spontaneous resonance and warmth that has rarely been achieved by subsequent synthesizer technology." [...] Producer David Rubinson commented:The ring modulator and the volt-control oscillators and voltage control filters [...] - [...] they didn't come in a set, like they did in a Moog. You had to build each one [...] - [...] which they did [...] - [...] and actually <b>hard-wire</b> them together. It was an eight-track album. So all that synthesized stuff was painstakingly layered in, sound by sound, one oscillator at a time. Now you may get a bank of oscillators and you can run six, eight, twelve {{of them in a}} row, and make all kinds of wonderful waves, shapes, and it can be very complicated. But at that time, it was not possible. It had one oscillator, one ring modulator, one voltage control filter [...] - [...] that's it. It looked funny. It was like aluminum boxes, little knobs sticking out, and patch cords. And it was very exciting to me, because it was a marriage of a lot of what was happening in what people called classical music at the time. When people think about what Steve Reich was doing then, and Terry Riley was doing then, and what Joe Byrd was doing then, it was very, very similar in different areas.|$|E

40|$|The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850 is a {{standard}} that allows communication integration of systems built from multivendor power protection relays. The standard describes the rules for integration of control, measurement, and protection functions within a power system network at the substation control levels. The standard was created {{with the idea of}} eliminating wiring in the substation and facilitating the communication between different relay vendors. This study implemented IEC 61850 standard in a Permissive Overreach Transfer Trip (POTT) scheme to protect a 166 mile, 230 kV transmission line using Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging in the laboratory. Two multivendor digital line protection relays were placed {{at each end of the}} line to protect the transmission line via the POTT communication scheme. Faults were simulated at different points on the line using two modern relay test sets. A comparison of the POTT with IEC 61850 communication and a classic communication method, <b>hard-wire,</b> is made to determine the performance of the POTT with IEC 61850. It is observed that the maximum and minimum time delay between fault occurrence and the POTT operation with IEC 61850 communication is around 1. 72 cycles (28. 67 ms) and 1. 50 cycles (25 ms), respectively, under laboratory conditions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} TEMPT, {{a technology}} mapping algorithm aimed at exploring FPGA architectures with hardwired connections. Such FPGA architectures {{may be important}} because hard-wired connections are much faster and smaller than the programmable connections between basic logic blocks that they replace.

40|$|AbstractAn {{intensely}} debated issue concerning visual-experience-dependent neural plasticity {{is whether}} experience is required only to maintain function or whether information from experience is used actively, relieving {{the necessity to}} <b>hard-wire</b> all connections and allowing adaptive adjustments. Here, an active role for experience is demonstrated in circuits for color vision. Chromatic experience was altered using colored filters. Over days there was a shift in color perception, {{as measured by the}} wavelength of unique yellow, which persisted 1 â 2 weeks after the filters were discontinued. Moreover, color-deficient adults were shown to have altered weightings of inputs to chromatic channels, demonstrating a large neural adjustment to their inherited photopigment defect. Thus, a neural normalization mechanism for color perception, determined by visual experience, operates to compensate for large genetic differences in retinal architecture and for changes in chromatic environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the short}} time Web Services have been around, a lot of {{development}} tools became available to create and deploy web services. However, typical approaches for the integration of web services require the client applications to <b>hard-wire</b> their references. To improve maintainability and achieve high flexibility in the integration of services we proposed in previous work an intermediate abstraction layer, called Web Services Management Layer (WSML). The WSML allows decoupling services from the application, selecting services depending on specific criteria and monitoring and managing additional service concerns. In this paper we extend that work and present {{the results of a}} case study where we implemented the service redirection mechanism extended with a local and global cache. We show how dynamic AOP, and in particularly the JAsCo language, is ideally suited to implement the core functionality of the WSML. 1...|$|E
40|$|An ongoing {{trend is}} to develop new {{mechanisms}} for composing software modules that resemble the relations between corresponding problem-domain entities and thus enable a natural decomposition of software for {{an increasing number of}} problem domains. However, we have observed that today's programming languages <b>hard-wire</b> a fixed set of composition mechanisms, usually in terms of keywords. To overcome this limitation, we have proposed the Co-op approach enabling developers to implement an open-ended number of composition mechanisms as first-class citizens. Extending our previous prototype which focused on the composition of behavior, this paper reports on our prototype Co-op/II which facilitates implementing composition mechanisms for data access. We show that our approach is sufficient to realize several styles, e. g., of sharing data between sub classes, of controlling visibility, and of behavioral modifiers like synchronization of data access, converting or persisting data...|$|E
40|$|Current Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) {{are roughly}} three times slower and ten times less dense than Mask Programmed Gate Arrays (MPGAs) {{in the same}} VLSI technology. This speed and density {{difference}} arises {{mainly because of the}} slow and large programmable connections between FPGA logic blocks. One way to improve the speed and density of an FPGA is to substitute fast and small fixed metal connections, which we call <b>hard-wired</b> connections, between some of the primitive gates or basic blocks of an FPGA.

This dissertation describes algorithms for mapping basic block circuits to HLB circuits optimized for speed or area. HLB mapping is done in two steps: First, a covering algorithm generates a set of HLB fragments to implement the input circuit. Second the covering fragments are packed together to minimize the number of HLBs in the final HLB netlist. We prove that the fragment covering algorithm, when optimizing delay, generates an HLB netlist with minimal number of programmable connections along critical paths.
