50|$|Previous {{buildings}} that formerly housed students include Alexander Hall, Banks Hall, Buchanan Hall, Collins Hall, Drew Hall, L. O. Evans Hall, Fuller Hall, Holley Hall, and Suarez Hall. Suarez Hall was already closed in 1996.

5|$|The line {{currently}} has 33 operating stations. Only three stations or platforms <b>have</b> <b>closed,</b> the two stations on the Royal National Park Branch (the main station, which closed in 1991, and the {{platform for the}} Scout's Camp, which closed in 1947), and the station on the Woronora Cemetery branch, which also closed in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{production}} {{with the}} ISP {{is more expensive}} than with electrolytic zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> in recent years. However, ISP furnaces {{have the advantage of}} being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants.|$|E
5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would <b>have</b> <b>closed,</b> and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E

5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} still being built, such as the first botanical garden in Oman, which {{will be one of}} the largest gardens in the world. Once completed, it will house the first {{large-scale}} cloud forest in a huge glasshouse. Development of botanical gardens in China over recent years has been a remarkable, including the Hainan Botanical Garden of Tropical Economic Plants South China Botanical Garden at Guangzhou, the Xishuangbanna Botanical Garden of Tropical Plants and the Xiamen Botanic Garden, but in developed countries, many <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> for lack of financial support, this being especially true of botanical gardens attached to universities.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these <b>have</b> <b>closed.</b> This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November, the U.S. troops {{continued}} with {{their attempt to}} encircle Shōji's forces. On the west of Gavaga Creek, 1/7 and 2/164 extended their positions inland along the creek while 2/7 and other 164th troops took positions {{on the east side}} of Shōji's positions. The Americans began to compress the pocket while subjecting it to constant bombardment by artillery, mortars, and aircraft. A gap, however, existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines, which 2/164 was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>closed.</b> Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape the pocket.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} {{a letter of}} resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E
5|$|Some closed station {{buildings}} are still standing, converted {{for other uses}} or abandoned, while others have been demolished and their sites redeveloped. A number of stations, while still open, <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> platforms or sections, such as the Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross. The interiors and platforms of a few closed stations are among parts of the London Underground available for filming purposes, such as those at Aldwych.|$|E
5|$|When Daniels was elected, {{he stated}} his number one {{priority}} was job creation. To achieve that goal, he created the public-private Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), became chairman of its board, and ordered it to “act {{at the speed of}} business, not the speed of government,” to attract new jobs. During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during the previous two years combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 new jobs and invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy. By the end of the administration, IEDC claimed to <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> on almost 1,500 deals to create a projected 169,000 new jobs since 2005.|$|E

5|$|When {{the station}} opened, the {{majority}} of the coal burned was from local collieries in Yorkshire, including Kellingley Colliery, Prince of Wales, Ackton Hall, Sharlston Colliery, Fryston Colliery, Askern Colliery and Bentley Colliery. Following the miners' strike in the mid-1980s, by 2006, all but Kellingley <b>have</b> <b>closed.</b> (Kellingley closed at the end of 2015.) UK Coal had a five-year contract to supply coal, which ended at the end of 2009, from Kellingley, Maltby and, until its closure in 2007, Rossington. Coal was also brought from Harworth Colliery until it was mothballed, and was supplied by Daw Mill in Warwickshire.|$|E
5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops <b>have</b> <b>closed.</b> The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Thảo's main partner Phát headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base — the country's {{military}} headquarters — {{to capture}} {{it with an}} assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops. At the time, most of the senior officers had been in meetings with American officials at Tan Son Nhut {{since the start of the}} morning, and Khánh left at 12:30. The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> the gate so Khánh would be held up, but left them open. Some of the other senior officers in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{although}} new {{courts have}} been opened in various locations, {{there has been}} a {{reduction in the number of}} locations where a county court is held. In all, 80 towns and cities in Wales have held county courts since 1847; 60 <b>have</b> <b>closed</b> and, as of 2012, 20 county courts in Wales are still open. The most recent opening of a county court took place in Caerphilly in 1965, although this closed in 2000. The first county court to close was Fishguard, in 1856. The latest county courts to close in Wales were Aberdare and Pontypool in 2011. Newbridge was the location of a county court for the shortest period– for only five months in 1856. Blaenavon is the only town in Wales to have a county court close and then reopen, both events taking place in 1938.|$|E
