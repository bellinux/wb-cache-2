The research conducted in this thesis explored methods of enhancing the sensitivity of an n-type metal-oxide material (indium tin oxide, ITO) to a volatile organic compound (VOC) through changes in both device and testing characteristics. Two methods of testing prototype sensors were developed which consisted of short and long-term exposure to ethanol at different temperatures and concentrations. Maximum sensitivity at 2000 ppm was achieved in devices with thin, annealed metal-oxide layers with a high temperature of operation; this sensitivity measurement was achieved using a prolonged exposure test with 100 -nm of annealed ITO at an operating temperature of 360 °C and yielded a sensitivity of 32. 5 %.

The electrode was inserted through the round window for a distance of 5 - 6 mm into the scala tympani of the cat. Brainstem evoked responses and those from the round window were recorded when stimulating with square biphasic current pulses (0. 1 msec/phase). Since there was usually less than 10 - 20 dB hearing loss in the implanted ear, {{it was possible to}} selectively mask components of these responses with high-pass filtered noise. The noise masked the response component arising from fibres in the cochlear region corresponding to the noise band. Responses were recorded in the presence of noise with different cut-off frequencies F 1, F 2 therefore yielded a response band-limited to the region f 1 - 2.

40|$|Langmuir probe {{diagnostic}} systems presently employed on Alcator C-Mod {{and elsewhere}} generally {{suffer from a}} severe limitation: unless multiple electrode or high-frequency bias techniques are employed, these systems can not resolve the rapid changes in plasma electron temperature, floating potential and ion saturation current {{that are associated with}} plasma turbulence. Moreover, no existing system can provide real-time output of these three parameters using a single electrode. To remedy this limitation, an advanced, high-bandwidth Langmuir probe system has been constructed for Alcator C-Mod using state-of-the-art design tools and components. The system produces a fast-switched, three-state probe bias waveform and employs a new method for outputting plasma conditions in real-time, a 'Mirror Langmuir Probe' (MLP), which utilizes high-bandwidth bipolar transistors to <b>electrically</b> <b>simulate</b> a Langmuir probe's response. Detailed information on the design, construction and performance of this new diagnostic is described in this thesis, representing the first proof-of-principle demonstration of the MLP technique. The MLP system was found to meet all the performance goals set forth {{at the beginning of the}} project: real-time output of electron temperature, floating potential and ion saturation current, ability to track changes in plasma parameters within a ~ 1 [mu]s timescale, while utilizing only a single Langmuir electrode. The system was tested using an 'electronic Langmuir probe' and also using an actual Langmuir probe in Alcator C-Mod. In both cases, the system accurately locked onto changing plasma conditions (< ~ 5 % error in outputted parameters), with the exception of some severe transient events found in C-Mod plasmas (ELMs), which challenged the system's accuracy.

40|$|Limited {{research}} has been done on exoskeletons to enable faster movements of the lower extremities. An exoskeleton’s mechanism can actually hinder agility by adding weight, inertia and friction to the legs; compensating inertia through control is particularly difficult due to instability issues.

We present a control method that produces an approximate compensation of an exoskeleton’s inertia. The aim is making the natural frequency of the exoskeleton-assisted leg larger than that of the unaided leg.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} of lower-limb {{exoskeleton}} control {{aimed at improving}} the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton’s mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural frequency of leg swing, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain <b>simulates</b> negative <b>inertia</b> in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, {{in the context of}} a computer-based task resembling a race. In the exoskeleton’s baseline state, the frequency of leg swing and the mean angular velocity were consistently reduced. The addition of inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency and increase their selected angular velocity. The work performed by the exoskeleton was evidenced by catch trials in the protocol. Index Terms—Admittance control, exoskeleton, rehabilitation robotics. I...|$|R

In this frame the CIRCE pool facility has been refurbished to host a suitable test section able to thermal-hydraulically simulate the primary system of a HLM cooled pool reactor. In particular a fuel pin bundle simulator (FPS) has been installed in the CIRCE pool. It has been conceived with a thermal power of about 1 MW and a linear power up to 25 kW/m, relevant values for a LMFR. It consist of 37 fuel pins (<b>electrically</b> <b>simulated)</b> placed on a hexagonal lattice. The LBE, heated by the FPS, flows up through the riser, reaching the Heat Exchanger (HX) inlet though a gas separator placed in the tank upper zone. The primary fluid circulation occurs employing a gas lift system which injects Argon from a nozzle connected to the riser entrance, enhancing the LBE flow. The heat exchanger represents the heat sink of the system and it is designed to have a thermal duty of about 800 kW; it consists of 91 double-wall bayonet tubes (with helium gap) fed by low pressure boiling water. Finally the decay heat removal system (DHR), designed to remove 40 kW and uncoupled from the main flow path. It consists of a bayonet element in which the air is injected from the top, flows downward through the inner tube and then flows upward through the annular region, where heat is removed from primary LBE side. The bayonet element is placed into a suitable shell thermally insulated from the external pool. LBE enters into the shell from the top and flows downwards in a counter flow heat exchanger configuration. The experimental campaign was designed to study the PLOHS+LOF accident, with decay heat removed by the DHR-system. This paper reports the experimental data as well as a preliminary analysis and discussion of the results, focusing on the most relevant tests of the campaign, namely Test IV Temperatures along the three sections of the FPS were reported and the Nusselt number in the FPS sub-channels was investigated. Moreover, the void fraction in the riser was computed and the riser inlet and outlet average temperatures were discussed. Concerning the HX, temperature measurements in the sub-channels were presented, as well as temperatures at the inlet and outlet sections. For the DHR-system, temperatures at the entrance and exit section were analyzed both for the primary lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) circuit and for the secondary air side, estimating the thermal power removed by DHR under the formulated accidental scenario. Finally system codes thermal hydraulics analyses performed adopting the RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3 are presented. A comparison with the data obtained from preliminary experimental tests is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{modeling}} {{scheme is}} proposed and {{tested for the}} analysis of waveguide-based quasioptical systems. The system is partitioned into blocks, each block is characterized by its Generalized Scattering Matrix (GSM) which in turn are cascaded to obtain the model of the complete system. Blocks with active devices are accounted for in the GSM by means of circuit ports. The calculated and measured results for a Ka-band double layer patch array is presented. A good agreement between theory and measurement is obtained. I. Introduction Quasi-optical power combining systems have recently received considerable attention [1]-[5]. Conceptually they are low loss systems and hence high e#ciencies should be achievable. To obtain the optimum performance e#cient modeling tools are essential. However, commercial microwave simulators are unable to <b>simulate</b> <b>electrically</b> large systems, as shown in Fig. 1 with oversized waveguide that can accommodate many propagating modes. Fig. 1. A multilayer structure in me [...] ...|$|R
