25|$|It is {{difficult}} to visualize {{the shape of a}} band as a function of wavevector, as it would require a plot in four-dimensional space, E vs. kx, ky, kz. In scientific literature it is common to see band structure plots which show the values of E'n(k) for values of k along straight lines connecting symmetry points, often labelled Δ, Λ, Σ, or , , and , respectively. Another method for visualizing band structure is to plot a constant-energy <b>isosurface</b> in wavevector space, showing all of the states with energy equal to a particular value. The <b>isosurface</b> of states with energy equal to the Fermi level is known as the Fermi surface.|$|E
25|$|While in the {{stratosphere}} (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present {{in much of the}} rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the hydrologic cycle as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic Ocean. Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic. Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb tritiated water (HTO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes: a) precipitation, b) vapor exchange, and c) river runoff – these processes make HTO a great tracer for time-scales up to a few decades. Using the data from these processes for 1981, the 1TU <b>isosurface</b> lies between 500 and 1,000meters deep in the subtropical regions and then extends to 1,500–2,000meters south of the Gulf Stream due to recirculation and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, the <b>isosurface</b> deepens and reaches the floor of the abyssal plain which {{is directly related to the}} ventilation of the ocean floor over 10 to 20 year time-scales.|$|E
25|$|The use of spheres {{is often}} for convenience, being limited both by {{graphics}} libraries and the additional effort required to compute complete electronic density or other space-filling quantities. It is now relatively common to see images of surfaces {{that have been}} colored to show quantities such as electrostatic potential. Common surfaces in molecular visualization include solvent-accessible ("Lee-Richards") surfaces, solvent-excluded ("Connolly") surfaces, and isosurfaces. The <b>isosurface</b> in Fig. 5 appears to show the electrostatic potential, with blue colors being negative and red/yellow (near the metal) positive (there is no absolute convention of coloring, and red/positive, blue/negative are often reversed). Opaque isosurfaces do not allow the atoms {{to be seen and}} identified and {{it is not easy to}} deduce them. Because of this, isosurfaces are often drawn with a degree of transparency.|$|E
40|$|Integration of scalar and vector {{visualization}} {{has been}} an interesting topic. This paper presents a technique to appropriately select and display multiple streamlines while overlaying with <b>isosurfaces,</b> aiming an integrated scalar and vector field visualization. The technique visualizes a scalar field by multiple semitransparent <b>isosurfaces,</b> and a vector field by multiple streamlines, while the technique adequately selects the streamlines considering reduction of cluttering among the <b>isosurfaces</b> and streamlines. The technique first selects and renders <b>isosurfaces,</b> and then generates large number of streamlines from randomly selected seed points. The technique evaluates each of the streamlines according to their shapes on a 2 D display space, distances to critical points of the given vector fields, and occlusion by <b>isosurfaces.</b> It then selects the specified number of highly evaluated streamlines. As a result, we can visualize both scalar and vector fields {{as a set of}} view-independently selected <b>isosurfaces</b> and view-dependently selected streamlines. Comment: TopoInVis 201...|$|R
40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis three-dimensional {{scalar data}} is visualized using <b>isosurfaces.</b> The given data is {{the output of}} simulations of T cells in the lymph nodes. Some of these cells produce a biochemical substance of which the concentration distribution is of interest. Peculiarities of the given data are that the values range over several orders of magnitude and that the domain has holes. This leads to holes in the <b>isosurfaces.</b> Difficulties when using <b>isosurfaces</b> are the fact that <b>isosurfaces</b> can be hidden by others and that the resulting image representations {{can be hard to}} interpret. These problems are solved by using varying transparencies for different isovalues. The quality of visualizations using <b>isosurfaces</b> also highly depends on the choice and number of the isovalues. In order to choose those <b>isosurfaces</b> that represent important features of the data, topological information is computed. For this purpose, an algorithm originally applied to grayscale images of CT scans is modified to use it on the scalar data. The algorithm computes the Morse complex of the data, which can then be utilized to determine the persistent homology classes and corresponding Betti numbers. All the extracted information is used to gain an improved visualization using <b>isosurfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} {{a system for}} interactively rendering <b>isosurfaces</b> of tetrahedral finite-element scalar fields using coherent ray tracing techniques on the CPU. By employing state-of-the art methods in polygonal ray tracing, namely aggressive packet/frustum traversal of a bounding volume hierarchy, we can accomodate large and time-varying unstructured volume data. In conjunction with this efficiency structure, we introduce a novel technique for intersecting ray packets with tetrahedral primitives. Ray tracing is flexible, allowing for dynamic changes in isovalue and time step, visualization of multiple <b>isosurfaces,</b> shadows, and depth-peeling transparency effects. The resulting system offers the intuitive simplicity of <b>isosurfacing,</b> guaranteed-correct visual results, and ultimately a scalable, dynamic and consistently interactive solution for visualizing unstructured volumes.

40|$|In many {{applications}} surfaces containing {{a large number}} of primitives occur. Geometry compression reduces storage space and transmission time for such models. A special case is given by polygonal <b>isosurfaces</b> generated from gridded volume data. However, most current state-of-the-art geometry compression systems do not capitalize on the structure that is characteristic of such <b>isosurfaces,</b> namely that the surfaces are defined by a set of vertices on edges of the grid.
