5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (<b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Her),</b> began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E

500|$|After the child's birth, Shelley {{wrote to}} Byron [...] "of the {{exquisite}} symmetry" [...] {{and beauty of}} [...] "a little being whom we ... call Alba, or the Dawn." [...] He asked Byron what his plans were for the child. Later, Shelley acknowledged the child's presence was becoming something of an embarrassment. Byron asked his half-sister Augusta Leigh to take Allegra into her household, but Leigh refused. Hostile to Clairmont and initially sceptical that he had fathered her daughter, Byron agreed to take custody of Allegra {{under the condition that}} her mother have only limited contact with her. Shelley warned Clairmont that this might not, after all, be the best plan for Allegra, but Clairmont hoped that her daughter would be more financially comfortable and would have a better chance at a good life if she lived with her father. [...] "I have sent you my child because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> too well to keep her," [...] she wrote to Byron.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was missing}} for a {{performance}} one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the tête-à-tête with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained {{that he could not}} go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: [...] "I don't give a shit, you're going onstage and I don't care if you do it naked." [...] A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck. (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants). Fascher's brother, Fred, sang lead vocals with the group on [...] "Be Bop A Lula", while he sang with them on [...] "Hallelujah <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Her</b> So", and his alliance with the Beatles continued, as he later went to work at the Star-Club.|$|E

500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her {{childhood}} crush, has housemaid's knee, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: [...] "I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord Jesus– I would like very much to be a Saviour to Collins– <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>her,</b> and I want to be hurt like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her– carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim [...] "you were made for a martyr!"– Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn. They call on her to intercede with God for them, and finally possess her. It is with their collective voice that she demands of God, [...] "Give us also the right to our existence".|$|E

[...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he just might have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?... In a world with hotshots like Lady Gaga, legends like U2, and even Jay-Z and Kanye West's The Throne bodying stages worldwide, is Beyoncé best performer on earth?".|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} general acclaim from critics. On {{the night}} of the video's premiere, Rap-Up complimented Beyoncé on starting a [...] "dance revolution", her [...] "heavily-choreographed visuals" [...] and [...] "menagerie of wild animals, outrageous fashion, and epic dance sequences". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyoncé comes off like [...] "barely sentient" [...] but added that she remains cohesive and rational as a human being in real life. He further wrote: [...] "Her reserve of crazy is far from bottomless, and she seems to save it all for her music videos, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> for that [...] awesome in distressingly fragmented ways." [...] Gina Serpe of E! Online wrote that [...] "for anyone still laboring under the illusion that Beyoncé does not mean business, well, just watch this video. Described by B herself as 'futuristic', 'electronic' and 'African', the 29-year-old fused all that and more into a still remarkably cohesive music video." [...] CBS News wrote the [...] "smoking hot video [...] blowing up on the web". The Huffington Post wrote that Beyoncé largely brings back the elements that made [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"'s video a hit, citing women's empowerment and a brand new dance. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post complimented Beyoncé's wardrobe and dancing in the video, and wrote that the choreography ensures the lyrics, [...] "my persuasion can build a nation".|$|E

500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>her.</b> Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
500|$|Leave Home has various lyrical themes {{throughout}} its track list. The opening song, [...] "Glad to See You Go", is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee's then-girlfriend Connie, who {{was well known}} in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks with a beer bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee's girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: [...] "Dee [...] and I came up with the song 'Glad to See You Go,' about Connie's leaving." [...] In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment" [...] utilizes Joey's singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a [...] "sing-along mental-illness ode." [...] The next song, [...] "I Remember You" [...] was said by author Greil Marcus to be all about the moment where [...] "Joey's voice turns the single word [...] "you" [...] into pure poetry." [...] "Oh, Oh, <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Her</b> So" [...] pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda machine.|$|E
500|$|Before {{going on}} tour with her Harajuku Lovers Tour (2005), Stefani {{revealed}} {{that she was}} going to release a second album in 2006, stating: [...] "I have a bunch of leftover tracks from making 'Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'. And two months ago, Pharrell called me up, he was like, 'Come down to Miami and write some more songs!' And I'm like, 'OK!' I went down there and wrote four songs and played three of them tonight. They're really fresh". In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz and he said to be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> background for music. She likes a lot of Caribbean sounds with hard beats". They worked on [...] "Now That You Got It", which was selected to be the fourth single from The Sweet Escape (2006). For the single version, Stefani enlisted Damian Marley, son of Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley, giving the single a [...] "reggae" [...] feel to it. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States, on August 26, 2007, while in the United Kingdom, it was released on October 15, 2007. Two remixes were included on the CD single, both featuring Marley. The [...] "remix" [...] version uses the same instrumentation as the original single, but has a more reggae-infused rendition and an added verse sung by Marley; the [...] "" [...] version features the song's original beat mixed with the remix version.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement. However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated {{the decision to}} leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist." [...] She also said, [...] "we all came out {{at the same time and}} it really doesn't matter... I think there's room for everybody... There's Bey, there's Ciara putting something out and [...] GaGa putting something out, but, because we started out together, people are going to say things like that.

500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E
