50|$|Throughout the centuries, Elburgh {{remained}} a fishing and farming center {{until the end}} of World War II. Unlike many other Dutch towns, Elburg had refused to use city funds to build a railroad station in 1863. Because the land owners were asking unreasonably high prices for the right of way over their property, the track line Utrecht-Amersfoort-Zwolle bypassed Elburg. As a consequence, Elburg became less attractive for manufacturers compared with neighboring places like Harderwijk. In addition, the closing off of the Zuiderzee in 1932 meant an end to the fishing industry of Elburg, since the former salt water bay gradually became a <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> Therefore, since 1956, the city concluded that only tourism would be the most viable sector for the local economy. Because of its favourable position both {{on the edge of the}} canal and near the Veluwemeer, tourists have made it a popular tourist destination. Each year many visit to see the largely unchanged medieval town, especially during the 'Midweekfeesten' (mid-week feasts), 'Botterdagen' (Botter days - a botter is a type of flat-bottomed fishing boat) and 'Kerst in de Vesting' (Christmas in the Fortress), which attract more than 30,000 visitors each year.|$|E
50|$|The Riviera Maya is {{completely}} {{within the state}} of Quintana Roo on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The terrain is flat and covered by low tropical jungle. The geology is high purity carbonates down {{to a depth of}} 0.5 - 1.5 km below the surface. Mean annual rainfall is 1.5 m per year and the efficient infiltration results in the complete absence of any surface rivers. As is common in karst, underground river networks have formed by dissolution, and these have been explored and mapped by cave diving through sinkhole collapses locally called cenotes. The whole of the Yucatán Peninsula is underlain by a density stratified coastal aquifer system with a lens shaped <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> floating on top of intruding saline water. The formation of caves (speleogenesis) within this coastal carbonate aquifer is principally associated with carbonate dissolution at the fresh-saline water contact within the aquifer. By 2008, the Quintana Roo Speleological Society (QRSS) reported more than 700 km of flooded cave passages within the limits of the Riviera Maya including the two longest underwater cave systems in the world of Sac Actun and Ox Bel Ha. These groundwater resources, accessed via the thousands of cenotes throughout the landscape, once supported the Maya civilizations and today remain the only natural sources of potable water in the area.|$|E

In addition, to determine the general pattern of geographical distribution, frequency of cyanobacteria occurrence, and cyanotoxins production, the published data from 238 <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in Poland were reviewed. On {{the basis of these}} collected results, we concluded that Planktothrix, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis and Dolichospermum were dominant. The general pattern in geographical distribution of the identified cyanobacterial genera was typical of other eutrophic waters in Europe. The production of cyanotoxins was revealed in 18 (86 %) of the 21 samples analyzed in the present work and in 74 (75 %) of the 98 total <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> for which the presence of toxins had been examined. Among the 24 detected microcystin variants, [Asp 3]MC-RR was most common.

40|$|Damage to the {{concrete}} surface can be observed at the waterline of hydraulic structures in <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in cold climates. Gradual deterioration of {{the concrete}} surface leads to exposure of coarse aggregate. Superficial damage at the waterline is commonly assumed {{to be caused by}} drifting ice floes. However, deterioration of concrete at the waterline may also involve leaching and frost action. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate if leaching of calcium compounds changes the surface properties of concrete in such an extent that the scaling resistance is reduced. Specimens with water to cement ratio 0. 62 and 0. 54 were submerged in deionised water at + 20 °C and pH 4 ± 0. 1 in order to accelerate leaching of calcium compounds. The scaling resistance of concrete was assessed according to the Swedish test method SS 13 72 44. The results show that the scaling resistance of concrete is reduced if calcium compounds have been leached out from the surface. The results also show that the longer the time of leaching, the greater the reduction in scaling resistance. Superficial damage at the waterline of hydraulic structures in <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in cold climates is most likely caused by interaction between leaching, frost action and abrasion...|$|R
