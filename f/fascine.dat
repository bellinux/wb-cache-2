5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of <b>fascine,</b> which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fascines.</b> Three {{types of}} {{remotely}} released large <b>fascines</b> (brushwood, wooden and a canvas bag stuffed with straw) for trench crossing were {{developed for the}} T-26 and the ST-26 in 1937-1939. These <b>fascines</b> made possible the crossing of trenches and antitank ditches 3.5 m wide and 1.2 m deep. Only ten sets of wooden <b>fascines</b> were produced. The <b>fascines</b> somewhat restricted the field of fire of the main gun.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) pre-positioned <b>fascines</b> made {{of metal}} pipes across the Khalkha River (between Japanese held Manchuria and Mongolia, the USSR's protectorate,) {{in advance of}} the IJA's 1939 foray into Mongolia. The use of hollow pipes had been {{predicated}} on their ability to allow water flow; the pipes were secured such that they were awash, and the river's unimpeded flow initially hid the <b>fascines</b> from Soviet reconnaissance aircraft. While these <b>fascines</b> were designed for stealth rather than combat deployment and were not deployed via armoured vehicles, the use of hollow pipes as <b>fascines</b> was a significant step forward.|$|R

Furious fighting, too, there was, by seamen and landsmen; not ill done, considering circumstances.|$|E

60|$|The king, however, found that, {{in spite}} of the {{measures}} Sarsfield had taken, two of the guns remained uninjured by the explosion.

40|$|International audienceFor several years, an {{increase}} of muddy floods frequency (and associated damages) is noticed in the Alsacian region (NE of France). In 2008, the regional authority ("Conseil Général") with the collaboration of the Chamber of Agriculture decided to set up, directly on farmlands, micro-structures called “fascines” (faggots of brushwood). These little protection systems allow to decrease the muddy floods velocity and to capture the sediments that are transported decreasing by this way the vulnerabilty in risk prone areas located downstream the catchment. These protections present two advantages: they are very easy and cheap to set up. In the region, we can list 400 <b>fascines,</b> step up in 21 municipalities exposed to the muddy floods risk. This study focuses on farmers' perception of these <b>fascines</b> {{in order to understand}} their potential acceptability of this kind of mitigation measure and to highly the main issues linked to the democratisation of these protective measures in the whole risk prone areas. The methodology used is a questionnaires (N= 37) held among farmers in 5 municipalities exposed to muddy floods risk. The main results show that the <b>fascines</b> are perceived as a restrictive tool: the most of the farmers mentioned that their maintenance is more important than for other mitigation measures such as hedges, non inversion tillages, grass strips, [...] also proposed in the questionnaire. Moreover the "real" efficiency of the <b>fascines</b> against the muddy floods propagation is questioned by the farmers as well as their integration in the landscape. Among others, these results allow to highly the main restraints in the development of such mitigation measures and have been directly used by the Chamber of Agriculture in order to improve their information campaigns among the farmers to improve the use of the <b>fascines</b> in risk mitigation polices and risk prone areas planning...|$|R
