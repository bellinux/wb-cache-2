5|$|A common {{preference}} is {{to include the}} modern borough of Tower Hamlets, and the former parish and borough of Shoreditch (this includes Hoxton and Haggerston {{and is now the}} southern part of the modern London Borough of Hackney).

5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind.|$|E

There were 99 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Palatinate, 32 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Rheinhessen, and 23 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Württemberg.

In addition, Brett had left the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by Geoffrey Perkins.|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the past.|$|E

5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished {{more than they}} <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E

Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included guitarist Jones; his neighbor, drummer Danny Carey; and bassist Paul D'Amour, who would later be replaced by Justin Chancellor.|$|E

On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow.|$|E
5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose {{hatred of}} the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact raised his own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, {{to the rank of}} magister militum, the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded.

Total cultivated land reached 49000 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 1989 but dropped dramatically between 2000 and 2003 to 500 <b>ha.</b> <b>In</b> 2003 several companies realized the potential growth of this crop in Romania and the cultivated surface started to rise from year to year to 1200 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2004 to 5600 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2006 and to 12900 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2009.|$|R
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E

The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod Taylor was sacked twice, and Stanford got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E

At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included {{the foundation of a}} Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E
