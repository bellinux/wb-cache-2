5000|$|A simple {{instrument}} {{can detect}} {{the presence and}} measure the total magnetic signal of a sample, however the challenge of developing an effective MIA is to separate naturally occurring magnetic background (noise) from the weak magnetically labeled target (signal). Various approaches and devices have been employed to achieve a meaningful signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for bio-sensing applications: giant magneto-resistive sensors and spin valves, piezo-resistive cantilevers, <b>inductive</b> <b>sensors,</b> superconducting quantum interference devices, anisotropic magneto-resistive rings, and miniature Hall sensors. But improving SNR often requires a complex instrument to provide repeated scanning and extrapolation through data processing, or precise alignment of target and sensor of miniature and matching size.Beyond this requirement, MIA that exploits the non-linear magnetic properties of magnetic labels [...] can effectively use the intrinsic ability of a magnetic field to pass through plastic, water, nitrocellulose, and other materials, thus allowing for true volumetric measurements in various immunoassay formats. Unlike conventional methods that measure the susceptibility of superparamagnetic materials, a MIA based on non-linear magnetization eliminates the impact of linear dia- or paramagnetic materials such as sample matrix, consumable plastics and/or nitrocellulose. Although the intrinsic magnetism of these materials is very weak, with typical susceptibility values of -10âˆ’5 (dia) or +10âˆ’3 (para), when one is investigating very small quantities of superparamagnetic materials, such as nanograms per test, the background signal generated by ancillary materials cannot be ignored. In MIA based on non-linear magnetic properties of magnetic labels the beads are exposed to an alternating magnetic field at two frequencies, f1 and f2. In the presence of non-linear materials such as superparamagnetic labels, a signal can be recorded at combinatorial frequencies, for example, at f = f1 Â± 2Ã—f2. This signal is exactly proportional {{to the amount of}} magnetic material inside the reading coil.|$|E
