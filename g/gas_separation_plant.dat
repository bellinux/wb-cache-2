Based on the study’s findings, ideally the countercurrentconfiguration exhibits a slightly higher separative performance in comparison to the radial crossflow,while both being superior to the cocurrent. It is also found that flow with the most effective separativeperformance is not always the most economical. Under circumstances of excessive permeation, it canlead to extra membrane area, auxiliary equipment power and hydrocarbon lost that increase the gasprocessing cost. Therefore, a tradeoff must be determined among these parameters to determine theoptimal flow configuration for efficient CO 2 removal under different operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a steady state simulation {{model of a}} multistage crude oil production plant. The unstable reservoir fluid is separated into crude oil and gas in a three stage <b>gas</b> oil <b>separation</b> <b>plant.</b> Peng Robinson Equation of State and successive substitution is used to model the separators. The liquid output for the third stage separators is stable crude oil and the crude oil is sold on the international market. The gas liberated in the separators is compressed by centrifugal compressors and injected into the reservoir. Several methods for modelling centrifugal compressors are discussed. The discussion concludes that Dimensionless Parameters is the best suited method for this case and this method is therefore used. The plant studied has three separation stages at decreasing pressure and the standard control method is to use fixed separator pressure. This is not optimal and brute force optimization is used to find the optimal pressure set-points. Adaptive pressure set-points will improve product separation and therefore increase the profit. The profit is calculated as the income from crude oil sale minus the energy cost. Using this new method, the optimum separator pressures for Snorre A are determined. As a result, the profit is increased with 0. 17, 0. 11 and 0. 07 present for three different inlet conditions. For one year this small increase in profit gives an extra two million dollars in income.

40|$|Throughout a {{very long}} piping network crude oil in Saudi Arabia is sent to Gas Oil <b>Separation</b> <b>Plant</b> called GOSP. The main {{objectives}} of the GOSP are: - Separation of the associated gas through pressure drop in two series stages one to 120 psig {{and the other to}} 50 psig. - Separation of water by gravity separators called High Pressure Production Trap (HPPT), Dehydrator, Desalter and Water Oil Separator (WOSEP). - Reducing salt concentration to less than 10 PTB utilizing wash water and demulsifier. During the desalting process, the challenge is to overcome the existence of an emulsion layer at the interface between oil and water. In petroleum industry normally emulsions encountered are some kind of water droplets dispersed in a continuous phase of oil. In crude oil emulsions, emulsifying agents are present at the oil-water interface, hindering this coalescence process. Such agents include scale and clay particles, added chemicals or indigenous crude oil components like asphaltenes, resins, waxes and naphthenic acids. Many techniques made available to <b>gas</b> oil <b>separation</b> <b>plant</b> operators to minimize the effect of tight emulsions. These techniques include injection of demulsifier, increasing oil temperature, gravity separation in large vessels with high retention time as well as electrostatic voltage.

The objective {{of this study is to}} design an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on data set to cover wide operating range of all parameters effecting demulsifier dosage. This network will be used to work as a control black box inside the controller in which all effecting parameters are inputs and the demulsifier dosage is the controller output. Testing this control scheme showed an effective reduction in demulsifier consumption rate compared to the existing linear method. Results also, showed that the existing control strategy is highly conservative to prevent the salt from exceeding the limit. The generated function from the ANN was used also to optimize the amount of fresh water added to wash the salty crude oil.
