40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} past, {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) {{have shown the}} ability to learn and capture non-linear static or dynamic behaviour among variables based on the given set of data. Since the knowledge of internal procedure is not necessary, the modelling can take place with minimum previous knowledge about the process through proper training of the network. In the present study, 12 ANN based models were proposed to predict the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentrations of wastewater generated from the effluent treatment plant of a petrochemical industry. By employing the standard back error propagation (BEP) algorithm, the network was trained with 103 data points for water quality indices such as Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Phenol concentration, Ammoniacal Nitrogen (AMN), Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and <b>Kjeldahl’s</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> (KJN) to predict BOD and COD. After appropriate training, the network was tested with a separate test data and the best model was chosen based on the sum square error (training) and percentage average relative error (% ARE for testing).

40|$|A {{biologic}} pretreatment {{technology of}} mixed tanneries wastewater, suitable for sulphate-rich industrial wastewaters, has been studied, {{in order to}} eliminate chemical precipitation and improve removal efficiency of the relevant pollutants. It couples an anaerobic reactor with an aerobic sulphide oxidant (ASO) step, where H 2 S 2 is partially oxidized to elemental sulphur, and includes a recirculation system. The proposed solution provided Methanogenic Archae (MA) and Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) coexistence and controlled inhibition by partial oxidation of hydrogen sulphide [...] The removal effiency of the anaerobic reactor was quite dependent on temperature and hydaulic retention time (HRT). COD removal varied between 32 - 68 % and sulphate removal (20 - 60 %), referred to the mixture of the industrial effluent diluted with 50 % of recirculation, at an Organic Load (OL) ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 kg CODM³ d⁻¹ and HRT from 1 to 5 days. The entire biologic pretreatment (AHF+ASO) resulted much more efficient and COD removal increased to 64 - 82 % being less dependent on temperature variations. This process removed also a significant part (85 %) of Chromium (Cr⁺³), by sorption into the biologic sludge. This two step biologic pretreatment, ensured better removal of relevant parameters than conventional chemical precipitation, avoided addition of chemical products, minimized excess sludge production, and also removed hydrogen sukphide and sulphate, resulting in a favorable alternative solution.

These methods were compared using routine samples in the animal nutrition laboratory (concentrates, forages, excreta and duodenal content). NO 3 -N covariate interfered on total N determination according to the procedure used. A significant correlation for crude protein (CP) content was observed between methods used for each group: grass silage component, Kjeldahl-N = 1. 1661 + 0. 9216 Dumas-N (R 2 = 0. 99); energy feeds, Kjeldahl-N = 0. 6376 + 0. 9445 Dumas-N (R 2 = 0. 72) and protein feeds, Kjeldahl-N = 6. 5638 + 0. 8615 Dumas-N (R 2 = 0. 97). Means for total N contents from components, adjusted by covariance, were not different (P> 0. 05) between both methods. Considering that the standard deviation for N content obtained by the two methods stayed within the intervals observed in the literature, corroborated by the fact that Dumas combustion procedure using the analyzer LECO-FP 528 LC is not harmful to the environment it was concluded, that this method can replace with advantages the Kjeldahl procedure in routine animal nutrition N analyzes.

Species of fish, oligochaetes, algae, stone fly, midge, and cadesfly 			were identified and discussed. It was investigated that during 			winter the river seems to be quite polluted.

The applications of ASM 1, ASM 2, 			ASM 2 d, ASM 3, ASM 3 _ 2 N, ASM 3 bio-P model etc. are also studied. The 			whitebox modeling techniques in this area are more significant. The 			importance of black-box models under special conditions where 			white-box models are not able to predict accurate results are also 			investigated. It was also found that use of hybrid, linearization 			and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in wastewater treatment 			modeling can be more useful for process optimization and control. 			White-box modeling techniques in wastewater treatment modeling are 			most reliable for better understanding of the whole mechanism.

It was also concluded during the 			investigation that hybrid modeling methodologies can be more 			supportive for process optimization and supervisory control. 			Low flow conditions in river along with high rate of contaminants 			are also damaging the ground water quality in the study area. During 			the study collected data from different departments, field sampling 			and field visits clearly narrate that hygienic conditions of Ravi 			River are becoming worst day by day. These conditions can only be 			improved by proper wastewater treatment plans, environmental 			management and powerful environmental legislation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} it was {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} two systems of swine wastewater treatment consisting of two-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, with and without post-treatment in sequencing batch reactor (SBR), fed continuously, with aerobic phase. The UASB reactors {{in the first stage}} had 908 L in the sets I and II, and in the second stage 350 and 188 L, respectively. In the set II the post-treatment was performed in a SBR of 3, 000 L. The hydraulic detention times in the anaerobic treatment systems were 100, 75 and 58 h in the set I; 87, 65 and 51 h in the set II; and 240 and 180 h in the SBR. The volumetric organic load applied in the first stage UASB reactors ranged from 6. 9 to 12. 6 g total COD (L d) - 1 in the set I and 7. 5 to 9. 8 g total COD (L d) - 1 in the set II. The average removal efficiencies of total COD, total phosphorus (Ptotal), and <b>Kjeldahl</b> and organic <b>nitrogen</b> (KN and Norg) in the anaerobic treatment systems were similar and reached maximum values of 97 %, 64 %, 68 %, and 98 %. In the SBR, the removal efficiencies of total COD and thermotolerant coliforms were up to 62 and 92 % resulting, respectively, in effluent concentrations of 135 mg L-...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this environmental research was to validate specifications indicated by manufacturers on their fertilizer products. Selected fertilizers types were sampled from five major fertilizer importing companies in Ghana for macronutrient analysis to determine the fertilizer quality. Five analytical techniques including Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA), flame photometry, <b>Kjeldahl</b> method for <b>nitrogen</b> analysis and UV-visible spectroscopy were employed to achieve this objective. Two reference materials (IAEA Soil- 7 and SRM 1646 a Estuarine Sediment) were used to validate the quantitative method employed in the INAA. There was generally good agreements (98 % and above) between the measured values and the certified values for the primary macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (N, P and K). However, same could not be said for secondary macronutrients calcium, magnesium and sulphur (Ca, Mg and S). The secondary macronutrient values measured were compared to standard values from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) in cases where they were not certified by the manufacturer. Most of the manufacturers' claims for primary macronutrients were valid. However, most of them fell short of the requirements for secondary macronutrient concentration. There is therefore {{the need for a}} good quality control system to undertake periodic quality monitoring of the chemical compositions of fertilizers imported into the country since they may directly or indirectly have impacts on the environment...|$|R
