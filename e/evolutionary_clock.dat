Materials and Methods: In the current study, a modified inter simple sequence repeat-polymerase chain reaction (MISSR-PCR) system was developed via several rounds of optimisation. Comparison study was then conducted between MISSR-PCR and three other methods, including enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences-based PCR (ERIC-PCR), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and 16 S rRNA <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock,</b> for the detection and genetic tracing of Vibrio cholerae isolated from seafood in China. Result: The {{results indicated that the}} MISSR-PCR system could generate the highest polymorphic fingerprinting map in a single round PCR and showed the best discriminatory ability for Vibrio cholerae genotyping by clearly separating toxigenic/nontoxigenic strains, local/foreign strains, and O 1 /O 139 /non-O 1 /non-O 139 serogroup strains, comparing to ERIC-PCR, RAPD and 16 S rRNA <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock.</b> Moreover, the MISSR-PCR is superior to previously described traditional simple sequence repeat based PCR method on genotyping by more clearly separating different clusters.

40|$|Abstract. This {{series of}} papers is {{intended}} to evaluate astrocladistics in reconstructing phylogenies of galaxies. The objective of this second paper is to formalize the concept of galaxy formation and to identify the processes of diversification. We show that galaxy diversity {{can be expected to}} organize itself in a hierarchy. In order to better understand the role of mergers, we have selected a sample of 43 galaxies from the GALICS database built from simulations with a hybrid model for galaxy formation studies. These simulated galaxies, described by 119 characters and considered as representing still undefined classes, have experienced different numbers of merger events during evolution. Our cladistic analysis yields a robust tree that proves the existence of a hierarchy. Mergers, like interactions (not taken into account in the GALICS simulations), are probably a strong driver for galaxy diversification.

Furthermore, some of the methods can be applied even when the outgroup is unknown. Using computer simulations, these methods were compared with the likelihood ratio test and the relative rate test. The results indicate that the powers of the present methods {{are similar to those of}} the likelihood ratio test and the relative rate test, in spite of the fact that the latter two tests assume that the pattern of substitution rates follows a certain model and that the substitution rate is the same among different sites, while such assumptions are not necessary to apply the present methods.

40|$|From {{comparisons}} of homologous DNA sequences for many different genes, {{it was shown}} that the silent positions of protein-encoding regions and introns evolve at high and remarkably similar rates for different genes. In addition, both silent positions and introns behave like clocks; they accumulated base substitutions at approximately constant rates with respect to geological time. The rates of evolution were estimated to be 5. 5 X 10 (- 9), 3. 7 X 10 (- 9), and 5. 3 X 10 (- 9) per site per year for silent positions, short introns (less than approximately equal to 300 base pairs), and long introns (more than approximately equal to 500 base pairs), respectively. Contrary to expectation from the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clocks,</b> DNA sequence comparison between pHLA 12. 4 (a cloned HLA sequence) of man and Ld together with other H- 2 genes of mouse, the class I genes of the major histocompatibility complex, revealed a surprisingly small amount of base substitution for both the introns and the silent positions; the degree of divergence is only about 60 % of that of standard genes in the same species comparison. Furthermore, several segmental homologies have been observed between the class I genes of mouse, suggesting the frequent occurrence of gene conversion or double unequal crossing-over in evolution. Interrelations between the extreme polymorphism of the class I genes, the low evolutionary drift of the introns and the silent positions, and the frequent gene conversion or unequal crossing-over within the mouse genes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Although protein {{evolution}} can be approximated as a “molecular evolutionary clock,” it is {{well known}} that sequence change departs from a clock-like Poisson expectation. Through studying the deviations from a molecular clock, insight can be gained into the forces shaping evolution at the level of proteins. Generally, substitution patterns that show greater variance than the Poisson expectation are said to be “overdispersed. ” Overdispersion of sequence change may result from temporal variation in the rate at which amino acid substitutions occur on a phylogeny. By comparing the genomes of four species of yeast, five species of Drosophila, and five species of mammals, we show that the extent of overdispersion shows a strong negative correlation with the effective population size of these organisms. Yeast proteins show very little overdispersion, while mammalian proteins show substantial overdispersion. Additionally, X-linked genes, which have reduced effective population size, have gene products that show increased overdispersion in both Drosophila and mammals.

Comparison of these systems is expected to reveal structure/function relationships in these simple (primitive?) energy transducing membrane components and evolutionary relationships which had produced the structural features which allow the divergent functions. Findings indicate that very different primary structures are needed for these proteins to accomplish their different functions. Indeed, analysis of partial amino acid sequences from halo-opsin shows already that few if any long segments exist which are homologous to bacterio-opsin.

In order to survey the full extent of diversity in circadian rhythms among duckweed plants, we characterised the circadian rhythms of duckweed by employing a semi-transient bioluminescent reporter system.

The cloned DNA contains 914 bases, which includes the entire coding sequence of human prePrl as well as portions of the 5 - and 3 '-untranslated regions of the mRNA. The amino acid sequence predicted by our data differs from a previously reported amino acid sequence in 8 positions. With {{the results of this study}} we can now compare in one species the nucleotide sequences of the structural gene coding for each of the hormones of the Prl set. The sequence divergence at replacement sites is used to establish an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock</b> for the Prl set of genes. Using this clock, we postulate that the chromosomal segregation of human Prl and human growth hormone occurred about 392 million years ago and that growth hormone and chorionic sommatomammotropin underwent an intrachromosomal recombination within the last 10 million years.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the process of}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) evolution in vivo, a total of 179 HIV- 1 V 3 sequences derived from cell-free plasma were determined from serial samples in three epidemiologically linked individuals (one infected blood donor and two transfusion recipients) over a maximum period of 8 years. A systematic analysis of pairwise comparisons of intrapatient sequences, both within and between each sample time point, revealed a preponderance and accumulation of nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions in the V 3 loop and flanking regions as they diverged over time. This strongly argues for the dominant role that positive selection for amino acid change plays in governing the pattern and process of HIV- 1 env V 3 evolution in vivo and nullifies hypotheses of purely neutral or mutation-driven evolution or completely chance events. In addition, different rates of evolution of HIV- 1 were observed in these three different individuals infected with the same viral strain, suggesting {{that the degree of}} positive pressure for HIV- 1 amino acid change is host dependent. Finally, the observed similar rate of accumulation in divergence within and between infected individuals suggests that the process of genetic divergence in the HIV epidemic proceeds regardless of host-to-host transmission events, i. e., that transmission does not reset the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock.</b> A striking feature of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) in vivo infection is the rapid generation and turnover of viral variants, resulting in a high degree of sequence diversit...|$|E
40|$|All {{through the}} 1930 s, {{members of the}} famous Drosophila group at Caltech roamed the American West {{collecting}} fruit flies for genetic analysis. One discovery to come from these expeditions was an abundance of genetic inversions: blocks of genes that had flipped end-over-end. Flies from one geographic region might have a certain set of genes in the order abcdefg, but a population elsewhere could harbor the sequence dcbaefg, with the first four genes inverted. A further reversal, affecting a different block of genes, could produce an ordering such as dcfeabg. Theodosius Dobzhansky and Alfred H. Sturtevant, two of the leading Drosophilists, pointed out that such genetic rearrangements could help in reconstructing the family tree of the flies. More reversals would indicate greater evolutionary distance. The variations discovered by Dobzhansky and Sturtevant {{could be explained by}} reversing just one or two blocks of genes. Later, when gene order was studied in a broader range of organisms, more complex patterns emerged. In the 1980 s Jeffrey D. Palmer and Laura A. Herbon of the University of Michigan were measuring the pace of evolutionary change in plants of the cabbage family. Looking at the DNA in mitochondria (the energy-producing organelles), they found that the genes had been jumbled by multiple random reversals. Transforming cabbage into turnip took at least three reversals. More distant relatives such as cabbage and mustard appeared to be separated by a dozen or more reversal events— they could only estimate how many. If these genetic flip-flops are to serve as an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock,</b> w...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{environmental}} dependence {{of star formation}} timescales in low mass galaxies using the [α/Fe] abundance ratio as an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock.</b> We present integrated [α/Fe] measurements for 11 low mass (M_∼ 10 ^ 9 M_) early-type galaxies (ETGs) with a large range of cluster-centric distance in the Virgo Cluster. We find a gradient in [α/Fe], where the galaxies closest to the cluster center (the cD galaxy, M 87) have the highest values. This trend is driven by galaxies within a projected radius of 0. 4 Mpc (0. 26 times the virial radius of Virgo A), {{all of which have}} super-solar [α/Fe]. Galaxies in this mass range exhibit a large scatter in the [α/Fe] [...] σ diagram, and do not obviously lie on an extension of the relation defined by massive ETGs. In addition, we find a correlation between [α/Fe] and globular cluster specific frequency (S_N), suggesting that low-mass ETGs that formed their stars over a short period of time, were also efficient at forming massive star clusters. The innermost low-mass ETGs in our sample have [α/Fe] values comparable to that of M 87, implying that environment is the controlling factor for star formation timescales in dense regions. These low-mass galaxies could be the surviving counterparts of the objects that have already been accreted into the halo of M 87, and may be the link between present-day low-mass galaxies and the old, metal-poor, high-[α/Fe], high-S_N stellar populations seen in the outer halos of massive ETGs.

40|$|To {{examine the}} tempo of genomic {{evolution}} in birds, we mapped 161 restriction {{sites in the}} nuclear DNA of seven species of birds belonging to the pheasant superfamily Phasianoidea. The three regions mapped lie on different chromosomes and bear eight genes, coding for lysozyme c, three "alpha-like" globins, and four "beta-like" globins. Together, the three regions span about 56 kilobases, most of which is presumably noncoding. The maps differed from one another at a minimum of 77 sites and by 9 length mutations. The extent of sequence divergence due to base substitutions was inferred to be similar for all three regions, even though the three coding regions differ by 5 -fold from one another in mean rate of evolution at the amino acid level. A tree relating the maps differs in branching order from that implied by the traditional classification of phasianoid birds and is supported by published protein comparisons. Five of the nodes in the tree were associated with fossil evidence and historical biogeographic information, allowing us to estimate the mean rate of DNA divergence to be 0. 34 - 0. 40 % per million years. This rate {{is similar to that}} estimated for the globin gene regions of higher primates, which validates the concept of an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>clock</b> at the DNA level. Our fossil-based calibration of DNA evolution differs by a factor of almost 2 from that proposed by others on the basis of biogeography. In consequence, published estimates of divergence times for birds and primates that are based on a biogeographically calibrated DNA clock may be too long...|$|E
