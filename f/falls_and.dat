5|$|In 1924, Warren Street in Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> River Street in Hudson Falls {{became part}} of NY30, a highway that {{initially}} extended from Mechanicville to the Vermont state line near Fair Haven by way of Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Whitehall. It was realigned by 1926 to continue north from Whitehall toward the Canadian border. In 1926, the portion of NY30 between Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Whitehall {{was included in the}} new US4, which began in Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> continued east from Whitehall into Vermont by way of NY30's former routing. It was rerouted to follow its modern alignment south of Hudson Falls as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. US4's former routing between Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Hudson Falls {{became part of}} NY32B, a new route assigned in the renumbering that continued south to NY32 in Northumberland by way of an overlap with US4.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route18, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} {{ran from the}} Pennsylvania state line at Ripley {{to the mouth of}} the Niagara River north of Youngstown with a gap through the city of Buffalo. North of Buffalo, Route18 followed Niagara Falls Boulevard (modern NY950K and U.S. Route62 or US62) to Niagara <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> current NY104 and NY18F between Niagara <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Lake Ontario. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route18 north of Buffalo became the basis for NY34, which began at Main Street (NY5) in Buffalo and followed the path of legislative Route18 through Niagara <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. NY18 was assigned at the same time; however, it initially went from the Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US219, NY417, NY353 and US62. In Cattaraugus County, NY18 initially followed Leon and New Albion Roads between Cattaraugus and Little Valley.|$|E

5|$|Two {{sections}} {{of what is}} now NY167 were included as part of legislative routes when the New York State Legislature created a statewide legislative route system in 1908. From Richfield Springs to Paines Hollow, it was designated as part of Route5, which continued southeast to Kingston via Oneonta and northwest to Mohawk. The section {{of what is now}} NY167 north of Little Falls became part of Route26, which ran from Little Falls to Remsen via Dolgeville. In 1910, Route26 was realigned to follow a more direct routing between Little <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Remsen via Middleville and Poland. The former alignment of Route26 between Little <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Dolgeville went unnumbered until March1, 1921, when it became part of Route37, which was extended southwestward from Dolgeville to Little Falls.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all of US4 {{south of}} Hudson Falls {{initially}} overlapped other routes, {{all of which}} were assigned as part of the renumbering. In between Hudson <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northumberland, US4 overlapped NY32B, which began in Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> followed US4's former routing east to Hudson Falls. From Northumberland to Schuylerville and from Bemis Heights to Waterford, US4 was part of NY32. The segment from Schuylerville to Bemis Heights was designated NY32A. Lastly, the part of US4 south of Northern Drive (then-NY40) in Troy was concurrent to NY40. By 1932, NY40 was rerouted through Troy to follow a more easterly alignment through the city. The realignment moved the northern end of the overlap southward to the junction of US4 and Winter Street in North Greenbush.|$|E
