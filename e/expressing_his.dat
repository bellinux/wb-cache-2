5|$|Beauchamp's father lived a mile (1.6km) from Cooke's estate, and {{the young}} man wanted to meet her. Beauchamp {{gradually}} gained Cooke's trust by visiting under the guise of borrowing books from her library. By summer 1821, the two became friends and began a courtship. Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke was at least thirty-four. As the courtship progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, he would have to kill Solomon Sharp.

5|$|Bennett {{remained}} {{active in}} the military, continuing to serve {{as part of the}} Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932. In 1937, amidst increasing tensions in Europe, he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> concerns about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{defeat in}} World War I, Hipper retired on 13 December 1918 from {{the navy and}} lived a quiet life; he {{received}} a full war pension. During {{the chaos of the}} German Revolution of 1918–1919, Hipper hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently. He wrote a letter to Adolf von Trotha, the new fleet commander, <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. After the revolution was over, Hipper moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{advanced}} course, Middleton {{spent the summer}} as the senior instructor at a Reserve Officer Training Camp at Fort Logan, Colorado, then returned to Camp Benning for one more year {{as a member of}} the Infantry Board.

5|$|In 1291 Pope Nicholas IV sent {{a letter}} to Joachim III, dated 23 March, {{reminding}} the Bulgarian Patriarch of their old friendship and urging him to join the Roman Church. The Pope also {{sent a letter}} to George Terter I <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> hope to see Bulgaria return to the authority of Rome, alluding to the union between Bulgaria and Rome concluded in 1205 during the reign of emperor Kaloyan. Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on the matter and the papal initiative failed to produce any tangible results.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill.

However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> concern over some of its provisions.|$|E
5|$|In Lenin's absence, Stalin {{had begun}} {{consolidating}} his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating {{an image of}} himself as Lenin's closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him. Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's {{term was}} {{confirmed}} by the 1869 election, after which {{he was able to}} persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu's main supporters in the chamber. Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E

5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal is {{attempting}} to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> love for Mařenka.|$|E

As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E

5|$|The preeminent prose of {{the period}} was written by Piotr Skarga, the preacher-orator. In his Sejm Sermons Skarga {{severely}} criticized the nobility and the state, while <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> support for a system based on strong monarchy. Writing of memoirs had become most highly developed in the 17th century. Peregrination to the Holy Land by Mikołaj Radziwiłł and Beginning and Progress of the Muscovy War written by Stanisław Żółkiewski, {{one of the greatest}} Polish military commanders, are the best known examples.|$|E
5|$|The role of John Hart in Torchwood {{was written}} with the casting of Marsters in mind after he {{contacted}} the shows' producers <b>expressing</b> <b>his</b> interest in {{appearing in the}} programme's parent show, Doctor Who. The character is used to illuminate some of Jack's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of, and a parallel to, aspects of Jack's persona. Both Marsters and the general media also compared aspects of Hart's character to Marsters's role as Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. Whilst a few reviewers criticised the character in relation to his impact of the show's tone, a larger number welcomed the character and the energy Marsters brought to the role.|$|E
