40|$|Last years a {{successful}} development of high-voltage pulse forming techniques based on stepped transmission lines led to {{creation of a}} set of powerful and compact electrophysics facilities including a high-current pulsed electron accelerator STRAUS- 2 [1, 2]. The first sample of this accelerator was started up into exploitation in 1989. At present, three facilities of the same type exist in VNIIEF, one of them is used as an injector for a linear induction accelerator LIA- 10 M [2 - 5]. Two others are autonomous and applied for research in radiation physics. STRAUS- 2 accelerator (Fig. 1 a) is designed by a scheme of five-cascade double stepped forming line – DSFL (Fig. 1 b), that allows to realize a high voltage transformation factor: when charging the accelerator’s DSFL up to 0. 63 MV the <b>idle</b> <b>voltage</b> pulse amplitude reaches 4. 1 MV on its output...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{users have}} an {{electronics}} technician re-wire the 12BH7 feed same {{as on the}} later 6550 heads. By adding a 1K and filter cap feeding from the 220V screen supply to the front voltage amp of the 12BH7, this keeps the 6146B tube running reliably with far fewer issues. Conversion of 6146B to 6550 tubes has a dramatic impact on the output power. The amp will produce roughly 225 watts , due to the screen voltage being too low. As such, the power transformer of a 6146B SVT will be about 220V DC on the screen supply at idle instead of the typical 350V <b>idle</b> screen <b>voltage</b> normally seen on 6550 amps.|$|R
40|$|A circuit {{technique}} is presented {{for reducing the}} subthreshold leakage energy consumption of domino logic circuits. Sleep switch transistors are proposed to place an <b>idle</b> dual threshold <b>voltage</b> domino logic circuit into a low leakage state. The circuit technique enhances {{the effectiveness of a}} dual threshold voltage CMOS technology to reduce the subthreshold leakage current by strongly turning off all of the high threshold voltage transistors. The sleep switch circuit technique significantly reduces the subthreshold leakage energy as compared to both standard low-threshold voltage and dual threshold voltage domino logic circuits. A domino adder enters and leaves a low leakage sleep mode within a single clock cycle. The energy overhead of the circuit {{technique is}} low, justifying the activation of the proposed sleep scheme by providing a net savings in total power consumption during short idle periods...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} estimating relative electrochemical cell state of charge in a cascaded full-bridge multilevel converter. The control flexibility of the multilevel topology is used to introduce an idle state during which the cell is temporarily removed from the load current path {{in order to make}} a pseudo-open circuit measurement of cell voltage. This measurement is used to estimate relative cell state of charge. The duty cycle of each cell is adjusted based on this measurement in order to achieve balancing. The validity of the proposed balancing scheme is demonstrated through three different experiments: discharging of twelve cells without balancing, discharging the cells by implementing a balancing scheme without the <b>idle</b> state for <b>voltage</b> measurement and discharging with the proposed balancing incorporating the idle state. The results show that the proposed method can extract the entire capacity from each cell despite large imbalance of 28 % in initial cell state of charge, extending the effective capacity of the system by 19 %...|$|R
5000|$|This type had two {{stepping}} coils with pawls and ratchets, one {{to raise}} the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary telephone dial. On a two-motion selector, as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an [...] "unused" [...] outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (final selector in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer's line outlet. If the line was <b>idle</b> then ringing <b>voltage</b> would {{be applied to the}} called line and ringing tone was sent to the calling line.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{subthreshold}} {{and gate}} oxide leakage power characteristics of domino logic circuits are evaluated in this paper. The preferred input vectors and node voltage states are identified {{to minimize the}} total leakage power consumption in the sleep mode. New low leakage design guidelines {{based on the results}} are presented. Previous studies indicate that a discharged dynamic node voltage state with high inputs is preferable to reduce the subthreshold leakage power consumption in an <b>idle</b> dual threshold <b>voltage</b> domino gate. However, the gate oxide leakage is ignored in the previous studies. The significantly increased gate dielectric tunneling current, as described in this paper, shifts the leakage power characteristics of dynamic circuits in the sub- 65 nm CMOS technologies. Contrary to the previously published techniques in older technologies, a charged dynamic node voltage state with low inputs is preferred for reducing the total leakage power consumption in the wide fan-in dual threshold voltage domino gates. Similarly, a charged dynamic node voltage state with low inputs is preferred for lowering the leakage power consumption in all types of low threshold voltage domino gates in a 45 nm CMOS technology. 1...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{radiation}} is a practically inexhaustible and environmentally friendly source of energy. Solar panels {{are classified as}} devices very sensitive to radiation. Therefore, the problem of creating radiation-resistant solar panels is quite acute. In operation, solar batteries (SB) are exposed to hard corpuscular radiation (radiation belts, solar and cosmic radiation), resulting {{in the structure of}} accumulated violations leading to a gradual deterioration of their electrical characteristics. We have conducted experimental studies of single-degradation characteristics of solar cells (SE) based on GaAs with Ge substrate due to the structural damage produced by irradiation with fast neutrons and electrons and step-by-step irradiation with fast neutrons and electrons at different fluences. Before and after each set of neutron and electron fluence we have measured light current–voltage characteristics (CVC) and photosensitivity spectra of the AOC. We have determined the following parameters from the measured CVC: the fault current, the open circuit voltage, the maximum coefficient of performance (COP) (ratio of maximum power to the product of the flux density of solar energy and the cell area) and the fill factor (the ratio of maximum power to the product of the short-circuit current and <b>voltage</b> <b>idling)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous circuit is {{currently}} the most popular implementation method for digital circuit. However, its performance {{is limited by the}} worst-case delay of the slowest pipeline stage. At the same time it also suffers from clock skew problem and heavy loading of the global clock signal. Asynchronous circuit design has been proposed long ago for solving the above problems and it has intrinsic advantages over synchronous circuit design. Some of the advantages are average-case delay performance instead of worst-case delay, low power dissipation in <b>idle</b> mode, low <b>voltage</b> noise, low electromagnetic emission and clock skew free. Also it is flexible to remove or insert a pipeline stage. However, the asynchronous circuit design suffers from large local handshaking overhead, which limits its deployment for real life circuit. In this thesis, we investigate on the methods that reduce the overhead of the asynchronous circuit design in both pipeline operation scheduling and circuit level. In particular the theoretical optimal pipeline operation schedule was introduced and the improved design of the local stage controller, the completion detection circuit and the asynchronous pipeline were proposed to reduce the local handshaking overhead. Finally, an asynchronous pipelined butterfly unit for FFT operation has been designed and compared with the synchronous counterpart and other asynchronous circuit design styles to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
