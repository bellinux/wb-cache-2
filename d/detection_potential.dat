40|$|An online {{derivatization}} {{followed by}} a disposable electrochemical sensor {{was used for the}} determination of arbutin (AR) in cosmetic products. The AR was chemically oxidized by MnO(2) and subsequently reduced at inexpensive screen-printed carbon electrodes using a low <b>detection</b> <b>potential</b> which improved the selectivity of the method. The effects of various parameters, such as solution pH, <b>detection</b> <b>potential,</b> and flow rate of the mobile phase, were studied in detail. Under optimal conditions [pH 1. 6 (0. 1 M H(3) PO(4)), <b>detection</b> <b>potential</b> 0. 0 V (versus Ag/AgCl), flow rate 0. 6 mL/min] the linear range for AR was 0. 1 - 1500 ppm (r(2) = 0. 999) with LOD of 30. 06 ppb (S/N = 3).

Neuropsychological assessment {{can be helpful}} for the estimation of conversion risk in individual cases. The focus of neuropsychological research shifted from the evaluation of dementia to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even to the detection of cognitive change before significant cognitive decline. In the theoretical part is presented a contemporary outline of preclinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. The construct of MCI is the most studied topic in the prodromal stage of neurodegeneration and this part is dedicated to comprehensive analysis of MCI. The empirical research includes five studies on screening methods of cognitive abilities, memory and verbal fluency tests. We present normative and validity data in older adults and show their <b>detection</b> <b>potential</b> in MCI or preclinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases.

40|$|Gold nanotubular {{electrode}} ensembles {{were prepared}} by using electroless deposition {{of the metal}} within the pores of polycarbonate track-etched membranes. Mono-enzyme (GOx) and monolayer/bilayer bienzyme (GOx/HRP) bioelectrodes were prepared by immobilizing the enzymes onto gold nanotubes surfaces modified with mercaptoethylamine. Batch amperometric responses to glucose for the different bioelectrodes were determined and compared. The response of the two geometries (monolayer and bilayer) of the bienzyme electrodes was shown to vary with regard to sensitivity at <b>detection</b> <b>potentials</b> above 0 V. On the contrary, at <b>detection</b> <b>potentials</b> below 0 V, no noticeable influence of {{the configuration of the}} bienzyme on the response intensity was observed. The mono-enzyme (650 microAmM- 1 in benzoquinone (BQ) at - 0. 8 V versus Ag/AgCl) and the two bienzyme bioelectrodes (+/- 400 microAmM- 1 in hydroquinone (H 2 Q) at - 0. 2 V versus Ag/AgCl) display remarkable sensitivities compared to a classical GOx-modified gold macroelectrode (13 microAmM- 1 in BQ at - 0. 8 V versus Ag/AgCl). A remarkable feature of the bienzyme electrodes is the possibility to detect glucose at very low applied potentials where the noise level and interferences from other electro-oxidizable compounds are minimal. Another important characteristic of the monolayer bienzyme electrode is the possible existence of a direct electronic communication between HRP and the transducer surface...|$|R
40|$|Fraud {{costs the}} Australian economy {{approximately}} $ 3 billion annually, and its frequency and financial impact continues to grow. Many organisations are poorly prepared {{to prevent and}} detect fraud. Fraud prevention is not perfect therefore fraud detection is crucial. Fraud detection strategies are intended to quickly and efficiently identify frauds that circumvent preventative measures so that an organisation can take appropriate corrective action. Enhancing the ability of organisations to detect potential fraud may {{have a positive impact}} on the economy. An effective model that facilitates proactive <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud may potentially save costs and reduce the propensity of future fraud by early detection of suspicious user activities. Enterprise systems generate millions of transactions annually. While most of these are legal and routine transactions, a small number may be fraudulent. The enormous number of transactions makes it difficult to find these few instances among legitimate transactions. Without the availability of proactive fraud detection tools, investigating suspicious activities becomes overwhelming. This study explores and develops innovative methods for proactive <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud in enterprise systems. The intention is to build a model for <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud based on analysis of patterns or signatures building on theories and concepts of continuous fraud detection. This objective is addressed by answering the main question; can a generalised model for proactive <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud in enterprise systems be developed? The study proposes a methodology for proactive <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud that exploits audit trails in enterprise systems. The concept of proactive <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud is demonstrated by developing a prototype. The prototype is a near real-time web based application that uses SAS for its analytics processes. The aim of the prototype is to confirm the feasibility of implementing proactive <b>detection</b> of <b>potential</b> fraud in practice. Verification of the prototype is achieved by performing a series of tests involving simulated activity, followed by a full scale case study with a large international manufacturing company. Validation is achieved by obtaining independent reviews from the case study senior staff, auditing practitioners and a panel of experts. Timing experiments confirm that the prototype is able to handle real data volumes from a real organisation without difficulty thereby providing evidence in support of enhancement of auditor productivity. This study makes a number of contributions to both the literature and auditing practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{electrodes}}: carbon paste electrodes modified with nanoparticles of metallophthalocyanines (MPcNP-CPEs, M = Mn, Fe, Ni, Co), basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes modified with iron or nickel phthalocyanine nanoparticles and multiwalled carbon nanotube composites (FePcNP/MWCNT-BPPGE or NiPcNP/MWCNT-BPPGE),and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes modified with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and electropolymerized metal tetra-aminophthalocyanines (poly-MTAPc-MWCNT-BPPGE), where M is Mn, Fe, Ni or Co, were prepared. Electrochemical characterizations showed that faster electron transfer kinetics {{occurred at the}} NiPcNP/MWCNT-BPPGE than at the FePcNP/MWCNT-BPPGE surface. SEM and electrochemical characterizations of poly-MTAPc-MWCNT-BPPGE showed that MTAPc had been deposited on the MWCNTBPPGE surface, and that the poly-CoTAPc-MWCNT-BPPGE exhibited the fastest electron transfer kinetics of all the poly-MTAPc-MWCNT-BPPGEs. Using amitrole and asulam as test analytes, electrochemical experiments showed that, amongst the CPEs, the FePcNP-CPE and NiPcNP-CPE displayed the most electrocatalytic behavior towards amitrole and asulam oxidation, respectively, and further experiments were done to obtain the electrochemical parameters associated with these electrodes and the corresponding analytes.
