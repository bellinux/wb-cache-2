(CN). The current Agreement is in effect from July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004. Two critical areas affected {{the contents of the}} IA and the collaboration among agencies this academic year. First, the transition to community-based care added a third party to this Agreement. The privatization of child welfare services brought immense change this year, including but not limited to: changes in caseworker assignment; creation of new policies, procedures, and databases; turnover of staff; job deletion; <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> collaboration; etc. Second, new legal restraints regarding information sharing were encountered with compliance of the Family Educational Right To Privacy Act (FERPA) {{as the result of the}} Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) implementation. Although collaboration has been enhanced with the implementation of the IA, barriers to information sharing still exist.

40|$|Liquid-liquid microextraction {{coupled to}} LC with {{fluorescence}} detection for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> Environmental Protection <b>Agency's</b> 16 priority pollutant {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} in rainwater has been developed. The optimization of the extraction method has involved several parameters, including the comparison between an ultrasonic bath and a magnetic stirrer as extractant apparatus, {{the choice of the}} extractant solvent, and the optimization of the extraction time. Liquid-liquid microextraction gave good results in terms of recoveries (from 73. 6 to 102. 8 % in rainwater) and repeatability, with a very simple procedure and low solvent consumption. The reported chromatographic method uses a Core-Shell technology column, with particle size < 3 μm instead of classical 5 -μm particles column. The resulting backpressure was below 300 bar, allowing the use of a conventional HPLC system rather than the more expensive ultrahigh performance LC (UHPLC). An average decrease of 59 % in run time and 75 % in eluent consumption has been obtained, compared to classical HPLC methods, keeping good separation, sensitivity, and repeatability. The proposed conditions were successfully applied to the <b>determinations</b> <b>of</b> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in genuine rainwater samples. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

First, the conferral of Chevron deference is premised upon the existence <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> jurisdiction. If there is no jurisdiction, there is no deference.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} aspects of critical and referential realism to the “logic” of structural explanation through an analysis of Erik Olin Wright’s Classes and the debate surrounding this work.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model for interagency {{cooperation}} between community/junior colleges and public K- 12 schools in the delivery of community education services. The processes of interagency cooperation were determined to be: needs assessment, goal setting, program planning, program implementation, and program evaluation. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 Survey of Interagency Cooperation 2 ̆ 2 was developed to assess the extent of (1) actual and (2) desired cooperation. Data were collected from governing board members, chief administrators, and line administrators in 117 K- 12 schools and two-year colleges within Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and North Dakota. ^ Responses were compared by (a) actual versus ideal, (b) type of institution and (c) type of position. The findings and conclusions were: (1) Cooperation between community/junior colleges and public schools existed, but key decision-makers in both agencies supported increased cooperation. (2) Support for cooperation is necessary from chief administrators, governing boards and the community-at-large. (3) Written cooperative agreements, an excellent means of initiating cooperation, should include a (1) plan for resource allocation, (2) funding agreement, (3) designated communication channels and (4) plan for serving future needs. (4) Informal needs assessment channels should be maintained throughout the process. (5) Cooperative goal setting, especially assignment of fiscal and administrative responsibility and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>agency</b> most able to meet the need, should be accomplished by administrators with assistance from the advisory council. Possible services are educational courses and recreational activities for adults plus community development activities. (6) Cooperative program planning should include all planning aspects, especially public relations, curriculum development and staffing. (7) Cooperative program implementation should include all aspects of implementation, from scheduling to supervision. (8) Program evaluation input should be obtained from program participants, advisory council and administrators. ^ These conclusions were used to construct a model for cooperation between public schools and community/junior colleges for the delivery of community education services. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{courts and}} {{commentators}} {{have considered the}} information-forcing role of executive oversight and judicial review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> action, the dynamic {{relationship between the two}} has yet to be considered. This Article presents a novel justification for heightened judicial scrutiny in the absence of meaningful executive oversight, premised on a reasoned decision-making basis. Judicial review of certain types <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> <b>determinations</b> should be more stringent because those determinations have not been vetted by executive oversight and are thus less likely to be premised on reasons backed by empirical support. Agency cost-benefit analyses and agency conflict preemption determinations—two realms rarely if ever considered together—are compared in terms of their reliance on underlying factual predicates and contrasted in terms of the existing framework for executive oversight and judicial review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> <b>determinations.</b> A heightened judicial review standard—what I term “State Farm with teeth”—should guide courts’ evaluations of the cost-benefit analyses performed by independent agencies not subject to executive oversight. This Article is the first to draw the distinction between independent and executive agencies in the State Farm hard-look context. It is also the first to explore the recent Business Roundtable decision by the D. C. Circuit through this analytical lens. The stringent “State Farm with teeth” standard should likewise be applied to judicial review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> <b>determinations</b> <b>of</b> conflict preemption made in the absence of executive oversight. As this Article discusses, recent developments involving the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s preemption assertions regarding state banking laws provide a compelling illustration of why this should be so. This Article also points to a potential new information-forcing role for Congress. Using the Dodd-Frank Act as an illustration, this Article shows how Congress can set parameters for judicial review of administrative agencies’ fact-based conflict preemption determinations...|$|R
