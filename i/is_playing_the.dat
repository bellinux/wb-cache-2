5|$|While {{the song}} <b>is</b> <b>playing,</b> <b>the</b> {{background}} visuals feature the players' chosen avatar, {{along with the}} rest of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues. The reaction of the audience is based on the performance of the player judged by the Rock Meter. Guitar Hero II added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience. The games developed by Neversoft feature a simple storyline, usually about a band's quest for fame, which is told through animations played throughout the game. These animations were created by Chris Prynoski and his studio, Titmouse, Inc., who have also done animations for the animated show Metalocalypse.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> piano back inside the theater.|$|E
