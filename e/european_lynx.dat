30|$|Only {{in those}} areas of Europe with the {{presence}} of the other wild felid species, Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus, Temminck 1827) or <b>European</b> <b>lynx</b> (Lynx lynx, Schreber 1777), could confusion with wildcat scats be possible and genetic analysis of scats would be necessary (Guzmán et al. 2004; Alda et al. 2008; Harrington et al. 2010). Even so, the technical staff and scientists working on recovery programs of Iberian lynx in Spain are convinced that most scats can be differentiated without genetic analyses when field experience is extensive enough (as the size, shape, and color of lynx scats considerably differ; Gil-Sánchez (personal communication)). Perhaps {{the same could be said}} about <b>European</b> <b>lynx</b> scats (at least, it is expected that their physical measurements, such as the diameter, would be significantly larger than those of wildcat scats). However, in those particular cases in which researchers suspect that scat surveys may not be completely reliable due to any reason (including the lack of sufficient field experience), the data obtained must be verified using complementary methods such as genetic analysis or camera trapping, which cannot be the first option for monitoring wildcat populations across Europe due to their higher economic costs (e.g., Barea-Azcón et al. 2007; Harrington et al. 2010). Even so, there are many large areas of Europe where the wildcat is the only wild felid species present (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999) so that monitoring based on scat surveys can be applied without identification problems in a wide extent of the wildcat's range.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The <b>European</b> <b>lynx</b> {{disappeared}} from the French Alps around thc beginning of the 20 th century. The recovery in France is due to thc re-introduction in Switzerland between 1971 and 1976. From 1974 to 1994. there were 70 records. The first records were recorded in Chablais. More regu-lar records wcrc around the Aravis mountains. Over 20 years. a southward expansion of about 200 km has been observed but no continuous distribution area has been shown by the survey. Observa-tions remained scattered, probably bccause of low observation effort in many areas. Different possi-bilitics for connections with the Jura populations seemed {{to exist in the}} French Alps.

40|$|While hemoplasma {{infections in}} {{domestic}} cats are well studied, almost no {{information is available}} on their occurrence in wild felids. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate wild felid species as possible reservoirs of feline hemoplasmas and the molecular characterization of the hemoplasma isolates. Blood samples from the following 257 wild felids were analyzed: 35 Iberian lynxes from Spain, 36 Eurasian lynxes from Switzerland, 31 European wildcats from France, 45 lions from Tanzania, and 110 Brazilian wild felids, including 12 wild felid species kept in zoos and one free-ranging ocelot. Using real-time PCR, feline hemoplasmas were detected in samples of the following species: Iberian <b>lynx,</b> Eurasian <b>lynx,</b> <b>European</b> wildcat, lion, puma, oncilla, Geoffroy’s cat, margay, and ocelot. “Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum” was the most common feline hemoplasma in Iberian lynxes, Eurasian lynxes, Serengeti lions, and Brazilian wild felids, whereas “Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis” was the most prevalent in European wildcats; hemoplasma coinfections were frequently observed. Hemoplasma infection was associated with species and free-ranging status of the felids in all animals and with feline leukemia virus provirus-positive status in European wildcats. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16 S rRNA and the partial RNase P gene revealed that most hemoplasma isolates exhibit high sequence identities to domestic cat-derived isolates, although some isolates form different subclusters within the phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, 9 out of 15 wild felid species from three different continents were found to be infected with feline hemoplasmas. The effect of feline hemoplasma infections on wild felid populations needs to be further investigated.

40|$|Analysing {{datasets}} from hunting {{statistics and}} human cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), {{we found a}} positive correlation between the number of human TBE cases and the number of red fox (Vulpes vulpes).

Hares and grouse showed negative correlations with human TBE cases, suggesting that they might function as dilution hosts. Combining our findings with food web dynamics, we hypothesize a diversity of possible interactions between predators and human disease - some predators suppressing a given disease, others enhancing its spread, and still others having no effect at all. Larger-sized predators that suppress red fox numbers and activity (i. e. wolf, Canis lupus; <b>European</b> <b>lynx,</b> Lynx lynx) were once abundant in our study area but have been reduced or extirpated from most parts of it by humans.

40|$|With {{habitat loss}} and {{fragmentation}} having become {{two of the}} major threats to the viability of species, {{the question of how}} to manage landscapes for species conservation has attracted much attention. In this context, the planning of stepping stones has been proposed to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes. We present a simulation study with a neutral landscape approach to assess the effects of stepping stones on colonization success. To that end, we used a spatially explicit, calibrated population model of the <b>European</b> <b>lynx</b> (Lynx lynx) coupled with structured landscapes, in which we could control the landscape parameters of dispersal habitat coverage and contagion, as well as the number and size of stepping stones available for breeding. In general, we found that colonization success increased with increasing habitat coverage but decreased with increasing habitat contagion, while the introduction of stepping stones had significant effects in critical situations. Especially at low to medium dispersal habitat coverage and high disperser mortality, stepping stones had a positive effect on colonization success when they were large enough to produce new dispersers, but negative effects when they were small and located in a way that dispersers would be distracted from more suitable breeding habitat patches. The latter clearly constituted a shading effect and argues for a thorough consideration of the trade-offs related to stepping stone size and location when implementing stepping stones as a conservation measure, especially when the number of individuals of conservation concern is low...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{draws from}} {{a study of the}} role of zoos in forming attitudes towards {{biodiversity}} and native wild carnivores that are considered for reintroduction. The project is being developed by an interdisciplinary team (wildlife conservation, psychology, education) working towards the development of a questionnaire to investigate this topic in the UK. Research suggests that experiences with live animals in zoos may encourage empathy, through personal connection, which in turn facilitates greater concern towards biodiversity. Concomitantly, the reintroduction of wild carnivores to their native habitats may contribute to biodiversity by helping regulate ecosystem dynamics. Carnivores also carry a rich cultural and historical heritage. IUCN guidelines state the need for public support to establish a reintroduced population in the wild, therefore, carnivore restoration efforts benefit from the understanding of the human dimensions. A pilot study was carried out in Kent (spring 2015) using focus groups and interviews to investigate attitudes towards biodiversity, with particular focus on two species of carnivores native to the British Isles and currently considered for reintroduction (the <b>European</b> <b>lynx</b> Lynx lynx and the pine marten Martes martes) and the role of zoos in promoting support towards biodiversity conservation. Results suggest an association between seeing native wild carnivore species in the zoo and emotional responses such as ‘breaking down fears’, but also concerns about a disconnect between people and nature, and misunderstanding about the role of zoos in ‘protecting’ species. Below we offer a discussion of the themes that emerged from the analysis of focus groups and interviews in relation to biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|The <b>european</b> <b>lynx</b> (Lynx lynx) {{might be}} {{expected}} to have a high intake of radiocaesium in the parts of Sweden where the main prey of the lynx, namely reindeer and roe deer have high activity concentrations of radiocaesium because of high ground deposition. We have measured 137 Cs in muscle samples from 733 lynx during 1996 – 2003. The aim was to quantify the extent to which radiocaesium is transferred from fallout depositionto lynx, to test whether the transfer was higher in areas where there are reindeer present, {{to see if there was}} any decline in radiocaesium over time, and to calculate the radiation dose to lynx. Most samples were collected in central and northern Sweden during January–April. Activity concentrations in lynx varied from 13 Bq kg 1 to about 15 kBq kg 1 fresh weight, with the highest value corresponding to a radiation dose at 18 mGy/year. Aggregated transfer coefficients (Tag), calculated by dividing the 137 Cs activity concentration in lynx muscle by the average ground deposition (total from Chernobyl and nuclear weapon tests) within a 50 km radius around the location of the lynx, varied from 0. 004 to 1. 3 m 2 kg 1 and were significantly higher within the reindeer herding area than outside. The concentration ratio (CR) for lynx/reindeer was 2. 6 on average, whilst the average for lynx/roe deer outside the reindeer herding area was lower at 1. 3. Based on these results, a CR of around 2 could be considered representative for the general ratio between predator and prey. A long-term decline of radiocaesium in prey species was reflected in lynx, with an effective halflife of 7 years from 1996 to 2003. The study shows that the accumulation of radiocaesium in predators, especially predators of reindeer, makes them more vulnerable to high radiocaesium deposition than most other wild species...|$|E
