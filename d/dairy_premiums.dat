40|$|Recent Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reforms have}} {{affected}} dairy policy, including the milk quota system, {{and increased the}} market orientation of the sector. A modelling exercise, using the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM), simulates an initial sharp decline in the EU milk price {{in response to the}} decrease in the intervention prices of butter and SMP after 2003, followed by a period of stability and an increase from 2007 / 08 as the demand for dairy protein products increases over time and EU milk supply is still restricted by quotas. The phasing out of the milk quota following the implementation of the 2009 Health Check is estimated to lead to an increase in milk production and a decrease in the milk price both within and without the European Union. The gap between EU domestic and border prices is expected to continue to narrow. Looking at developments in dairy markets between 2000 and 2007, the study finds that milk prices did not decrease as much as expected because the intervention prices were no longer binding, in particular for skimmed milk powder. The income of dairy farms increased as decline in milk prices was more than compensated by the introduction of <b>dairy</b> <b>premium</b> and higher farm productivity due to the increase in farm size. However, since 2007, incomes of dairy farmers have strongly fluctuated as both milk and feed prices have been highly variable in opposite directions...|$|R

40|$|Switzerland aims to liberalise {{the milk}} market by 2011. This {{will result in}} {{distinctive}} changes in the basic conditions for agriculture. The impacts of the liberalisation are investigated with a composite model obtained by combining an optimization model for the agricultural sector and a dynamic simulation model for the milk and meat market. The calculations with the composite model indicate that the milk price depends strongly on the phasing out of market support, while the abolition of milk quotas in 2009 is less decisive. An introduction of a <b>dairy</b> cow <b>premium</b> leads to a higher milk production, especially with abolished milk quotas. In this case the European milk price level represents the lower limit for the milk price in Switzerland. Compared to the milk market, with falling quantities meat prices are likely to exhibit a stable development. dynamic simulation, sectoral optimisation, milk market, milk quota, Agribusiness, C 53, C 61, O 21, Q 13, Q 18,...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{products}} and beef are New Zealand's main export commodities, accounting for 22 per cent of total merchandise exports (Statistics New Zealand, 2005). The European Union (EU) is commonly known for distorting {{international trade in}} these products through subsidised production and exports. This leads to lower world market prices and hence lower export revenues for New Zealand. On the other hand, New Zealand benefits from high domestic EU prices through preferential access to the butter, cheese and sheepmeat markets. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU has already undergone several reforms in recent years. The 2003 CAP reform replaced the coupled direct support schemes by a Single Farm Payment (SFP), which will be mainly delivered to farmers irrespective of what they produce (hence 'decoupled' from production). The level of decoupling differs among the EU Member States. This report assesses {{the implementation of the}} SFP across Member States and how far it has been decoupled. The expected changes in the European Union's and New Zealand's trade in dairy {{products and}} beef resulting from the 2003 reform of the CAP are simulated, using a partial equilibrium trade model (Lincoln Trade and Environment Model; LTEM). The hypothesis is that a higher degree of decoupling of direct payments leads to a lower production and less EU exports. Hence, opportunities for NZ exports of dairy products and beef could increase. The results from the dairy sector are the opposite of the hypothesis: EU exports in dairy products are predicted to increase following the reform and this implies New Zealand exports to fall by 1. 5 per cent to 2. 0 per cent. This is due to a rise of the internal milk production quota {{in the course of the}} reform which outweighs the impact of the decoupling of the <b>dairy</b> <b>premium.</b> In the beef sector, EU outputs will be reduced as a result of the 2003 CAP reform. The market changes in the EU, however, are only partly transmitted to New Zealand because other beef producers also benefit. The returns to New Zealand beef producers increase by more if full decoupling in all EU Member States is applied then in case of only partial decoupling...|$|R

As a case study, we investigated the quality control (QC) system of Trentingrana cheese, {{a variety of}} the {{protected designation of origin}} Grana Padano. The production of Trentingrana cheese factories is supervised by their consortium through the assessment of sensory quality attributes by an expert panel; and, depending on the evaluation, the associated <b>dairies</b> receive price <b>premiums</b> or penalties. The procedures applied and the data collected over 8 years were evaluated, and critical points were identified. Ameliorations were suggested in accordance with good sensory practice and were verified over an additional 3 -year period. The QC system has been improved by increasing the number of evaluated samples proportionally to the amount of the production of each dairy, by introducing a balanced experimental design, by monitoring experts’ performance and by controlling the sample presentation to avoid systematic effects and psychological errors...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{milk with}} {{predominantly}} A2 protein was first marketed {{anywhere in the}} world in March 2003 in Australia by a dairy farm unaffiliated with A2 Corporation run by the Denniston family. Shortly thereafter, an Australian company called A2 Dairy Marketers licensed patent rights and the A2 trademark from A2 Corporation and started offering Australian <b>dairy</b> farmers a <b>premium</b> price for their milk, if it was shown to be pure A2. [...] The Dennistons and A2 Dairy Marketers marketed milk with predominantly A2 protein boldly, touting its safety and the dangers of A1 milk. However, Australian laws forbid companies from making misleading health claims about food, and in September 2004, A2 Dairy Marketers in Australia was fined $15,000 after it pleaded guilty to six breaches of those laws. The company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into administration in October and was liquidated in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars. A$1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled. A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A2 herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.|$|R
40|$|Milk {{marketing}} {{in rural}} area of Dhofar Region face {{a lot of}} difficulties and constrains by individual small scale farmers {{due to the lack}} of facilities and access to market. Therefore, farmers reduce their cow and camel milk production and group their animal into three or four groups to be milked in alternative days. Government Authorities decided to establish Milk Collection Centers to facilitate milk marketing and provide raw milk to Dairy industries. A risk analysis for the investment in milk collection centers on rural area of Dhofar Region was conducted in this study. The results showed that all MCC investments had a positive NPV except Shahbi Aseab Center. The study indicates there is a direct relationship between total milk collected, milk price, distant between MCC and Dairy plan and investment profitability. The study revealed an inverse relation between animal population at MCC zone and risk. The probability of achieving returns lower than the opportunity cost was highest for MCC located far from dairy plant which process and market <b>dairy</b> products. Risk <b>premium</b> for four MCC has been calculated relative to Salalah MCC (preferred location) and (Garoun Hirity MCC) was found as preferred MCC location and risk efficiency. In order to make the investment in MCC more attractive, the Government incentives need to be offered to farmers to increase milk production and improve raw milk quality. However, this approach might make investments in bulk milk collection centers feasible. Thus, a recommendabl...|$|R
40|$|As {{the first}} {{industrial}} nation, the UK {{was one of}} the earliest countries to experience the industrialisation of agriculture, a process that led to an increase in productivity, with more and more food produced by fewer and fewer people. As a result of this productivist turn, UK agro-food production and processing technologies are today among the most advanced in the world (Goodman & Watts, 1997). The sector as a whole is characterised by high levels of scientific knowledge and expertise in research and development, product innovation and food supply-chain technologies. To a greater extent than in many other European countries, the supermarkets have become the key players in shaping food consumption patterns in the UK. The sector {{remains one of the most}} regulated, in the UK and internationally yet, despite this, productivism is regularly prone to ‘food scares’ in which disease may move systemically through major agro-food supply chains (Cooke, 2007). Cases of UK ‘food scares’ have been well documented and lethal, ranging from ‘mad cow’ to ‘e-coli’ including the (2010) entry of unregulated transgenic milk and meat into the food chain. This suggests that although British agro-food production has been substantially re-institutionalised (with the closure of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) in 2000 and its replacement by DEFRA and the Food Standards Agency) the new system is by no means fool proof. Accordingly, economic, environmental and consumer pressures have strongly influenced development in the UK agro-food industry in recent years. But agro-food has experienced significant structural change as, product, process and organizational innovation and renewal efforts have been implemented to respond to new customer demands. These include: obesity concerns: high salt content in processed food; health-labelling (something some producers and supermarkets are still reluctant to implement except on their own terms); and the undoubted rise, albeit from a low base of demand, for organically produced food. Producers of industrial food are under increasing market pressure to develop more dedicated products and marketing strategies by emphasising domestic, locally-produced or organic qualities without losing the efficiency of standardised production and distribution technologies. In the organic food sector innovation efforts are carried out to better standardise products and technologies and expand markets without losing the dedicated product qualities (assumed health and ecological benefits) which differentiate them from mainstream products. There is also an extra tension as firm strategies try on the one hand, to broaden the customer base by selling through the large-scale distribution channels of supermarket chains and, on the other, seek to avoid that route and utilise more localised distribution involving less energy expenditure. Those in the latter category hold that supermarket distribution compromises the more ‘sustainable’ product profile of organic food, shifting it in the direction of conventional food products which might be regarded as unhealthy and unsound. In what follows we provide an analysis based on a funded research investigation of the UK, and particularly the Welsh agro-food industry, in order to understand the extent to which it has demonstrated innovation in escaping its productivist post-war cage. The chapter has three main aims: first, we seek to better understand the extent to which current practices appear to transgress inherited food production and consumption norms. Second, we seek to explore how an emerging new ‘paradigm’ of production and ‘regime’ regulating consumption impact market access. Third, we ask to what extent is Wales exploring ‘new path creation’ in the face of a hitherto dominant productivist paradigm and if so, why and with what effects elsewhere? In Wales, as opposed to other parts of the UK, this appears to be introducing a distinctive process of transition from <b>dairy</b> to <b>premium</b> grassland meat production...|$|R
