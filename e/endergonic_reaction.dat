25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an <b>endergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} step of the mechanism, an α-proton is removed by a strong base, {{resulting}} in the formation of an enolate anion, which is made relatively stable by the delocalization of electrons. Next, the carbonyl carbon of the (other) ester is nucleophilically attacked by the enolate anion. The alkoxy group is then eliminated (resulting in (re)generation of the alkoxide), and the alkoxide removes the newly formed doubly α-proton to form a new, highly resonance-stabilized enolate anion. Aqueous acid (e.g. sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid) is added in the final step to neutralize the enolate and any base still present. The newly formed β-keto ester or β-diketone is then isolated. Note that the reaction requires a stoichiometric amount of base as the removal of the doubly α-proton thermodynamically drives the otherwise <b>endergonic</b> <b>reaction.</b> That is, Claisen condensation does not work with substrates having only one α-hydrogen because of the driving force effect of deprotonation of the β-keto ester in the last step.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere are two {{fundamental}} axioms of surface metabolism theory: (i) pyrite formation from H 2 S and FeS is proposed {{as a source}} of energy for life, and (ii) archaic reductive citric acid cycle is put into the center of a metabolic network. However, the concept fails to indicate how sulfide oxidation ought to be coupled to processes driven by free energy change occurring during pyrite production, and secondly, how reductive citric acid cycle ought to be supplied with row material(s). Recently, the non-enzymatic methylglyoxalase pathway has been recommended as the anaplerotic route for the reductive citric acid cycle. In this paper a mechanism is proposed by which the oxidation of lactate, the essential step of the anaplerotic path, becomes possible and a coupling system between sulfide oxidation and <b>endergonic</b> <b>reaction(s)</b> is also presented. Oxidoreduction for other redox pairs is discussed too.

We have performed DFT and TDDFT computations on the reaction mechanism of this interesting enzyme. The results show that whereas in the ground state the reaction is strongly endergonic and has a very high activation free energy (38 kcal/mol), the first four excited states (corresponding to excitations within the conjugated porphyrin π-system) afford much lower activation free energies (< 25 kcal/mol) and spontaneous (or only slightly <b>endergonic)</b> <b>reaction</b> paths.

Mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload has deleterious consequences for the cells: increased membrane permeability leads to the release of pro-apoptotic factors and the activation of the apoptotic pathway. Even the absence of proper Ca 2 + transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria could be detrimental since it results in defective metabolism and autophagy.

As discussed in the overview, if the temperature and pressure are held constant, the Gibbs free energy is a (negative) proxy for the change in total entropy of the universe. It is [...] "negative" [...] because S appears with a negative coefficient in the expression for G, so the Gibbs free energy moves in the opposite direction from the total entropy. Thus, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy will not proceed spontaneously. However, in biological systems (among others), energy inputs from other energy sources (including the Sun and exothermic {{chemical reaction}}s) are [...] "coupled" [...] with reactions that are not entropically favored (i.e. have a Gibbs free energy above zero).
