40|$|Drilling is a {{standard}} process for producing holes in metal materials. With an increased hole depth the demands increase on both machine and tool. Deep hole drilling is a complex process which ischaracterized by a high metal removal rate and hole accuracy. A hole deeper than ten times the diameter {{can be considered a}} deep hole which requires a specialized drilling technique. During adeep hole drilling process, the forces generated on the <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> give a rise to a resultant radial force. The resultant radial force pushes the drill in a radial direction during a drilling operation. The radial force direction is of crucial importance in regard of tool guidance, stability and hole size accuracy. This force affects tool performance, reduces tool life and has an impact on the bore surface. Due to the complex nature of deep hole drilling, Sandvik Coromant wishes to get {{a better understanding of how}} their current deep hole drilling tools are balanced. The purpose of this study is to conduct a survey of a number of drills of Sandvik Coromant <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> assortment. The main aim of this study is to calculate and measure the resultant radial force generated during a deep hole drilling operation. The forces are calculated with the aid of a calculation program and test-runs on a number of drills. This report presents the calculated magnitude and direction of the resultant radial force duringentrance, full intersection and at the exit of the workpiece. In addition to the measured values of theresultant radial force during entry and full intersection. Four different drill geometries are evaluated which of two are competitor drills. A <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> geometry is re-modified in aspect to drill stability based on the outcome of the measured and calculated results. The results acquired from the performed calculation and measurements of the resultant showed that the resultant radial force acts in an angular direction that was outside the range between the support pads. This true for three of the four evaluated drill geometries. There were minor differences between the measured and calculated forces which enforce the reliability of the used calculation program. The modified drill geometry of a <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> gave an indication of which geometry variables have impact on the resultant radial force magnitude and angular direction. The data presented in this report can be a base for future development of a <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> toolgeometry in regard to the resultant radial force. Variables affecting the calculated results and theresultant radial force are presented and discussed. The study is concluded with suggestions of futurework based on the acquired data...|$|E

This research work investigates aspects of the <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> process with small diameter twist drills and presents a prototype system for real time process monitoring and adaptive control; two main research objectives are fulfilled in particular : First objective is the experimental investigation of the mechanics of the <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> process, using twist drills without internal coolant supply, in the range of diarneters Ø 2. 4 to Ø 4. 5 mm and working length up to 40 diameters.

The BTA (Boring and Trepanning Association) <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> {{process is}} {{commonly}} used to machine boreholes with a large drilling depth-to-diameter ratio (l/D) and outstanding workpiece quality.

These guide pads smooth the borehole wall by a forming process and improve the surface quality. Processes, that machine materials with a high adhesion tendency, such as high alloy stainless steel, suffer from poor surface quality in the borehole and the adhesion from the workpiece material on the guide pads.

40|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{high strength}} and performance-orientated materials contribute to enhance component properties {{and to improve}} resource efficiency. Consequently, these materials are constantly in demand and used more and more frequently in challenging applications. Within this context, high-strength bainitic steels as well as high temperature proof nickel based alloys are two of these material groups which are focused increasingly by automotive, aerospace and other applications sectors. The excellent material properties are linked to a sophisticated machining ability. Nevertheless, an economical manufacturing is an essential requirement to exploit the full potential {{of the use of}} high strength bainitic steels and high temperature-proof nickel based alloys. Therefore, it is absolutely indispensable to adopt and optimize existing manu¬facturing technologies. The research activities described in this thesis focus on the production of <b>deep</b> bore <b>holes</b> with smallest diameters and high length to diameter ratios based on mechanical processes. However, additional difficulties arise when single lip and twist <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> with smallest tool diameters are applied. Mentionable examples are very low tool rigidities, high mechanical tool loads owing to the limitedly realizable feed rates and the subsequently strong material squeezing and friction in the rounding of the cutting edge as well as the complicated chip removal through the small cross-sections of the chip flutes. In order to encounter the material and process specific challenges and to achieve a stable and productive <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling,</b> a determined tool and process design for both materials is carried out. In the course of the experimental investigations the influence of the cutting data, the tool design with respect to the cutting tip design, the tool coating composition and the coating thickness as well as the cooling lubricant in single lip <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> is evaluated. Furthermore, a comparison of single lip and twist <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> shows the advantages and disad¬vantages of both manufacturing processes. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanical tool loads, chip formation, tool wear and bore hole quality regarding the dimension and form tolerances as well as the surface quality is made to evaluate the various influencing variables. Additionally, a newly developed methodology of analysis allows a closer look on the chip formation at the corresponding cutting edges and the chip removal along the chip flutes in smallest diameter <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> for the very first time. Here, samples made of the particular test materials are inserted in transparent acrylic glass carriers and the chip formation in the operating zone is documented by high speed microscopy. At the same time, the findings of this high speed chip formation analysis contribute to a substantial increase in fundamental process knowledge. A concluding comparison of the representative process characteristics and the technological correlations in <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> of high strength bainitic steels and high temperature proof nickel based alloys with smallest diameters clarifies the significantly divergent tribological application behavior. The differing mechanisms of tool wear as well as the related wear forms result in very individual and particular requirements on an efficient tool and process design. Based on the achieved knowledge, recommendations for the industrial practice are derived which facilitate a reliable and cost-efficient mechanical manufacturing of <b>deep</b> bore <b>holes</b> with smallest diameters for both materials, while simultaneously ensuring high bore hole quality in future...|$|R

Electron microscopic analysis reveals various surface features such as grooves and plateaus, folding, material flaking that are exclusive to <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling.</b> It has been found that improved surface integrity in BTA drilling relies on a trade-off among feedrates and speeds.
