5|$|In 1869, Grant was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance {{and to give}} them U.S. diplomatic recognition. <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to keep}} Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Fish sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by Grant. The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> his family stayed with Fish in Washington {{for two months}} before setting out on a world tour that lasted {{approximately}} {{two and a half}} years. Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Julia left for England aboard the SS Indiana. During the tour the Grants made stops in Europe, the Mediterranean the Holy Land and points in the Middle East, meeting with notable dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria, Pope Leo XIII, Otto von Bismarck, Emperor Meiji and others. Grant was the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. During the tour, supported by the Hayes administration transported on naval ships, Grant assumed an unprecedented diplomatic capacity, unofficially representing the United States to strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process. Homesick, the Grants left Japan sailing on the City of Tokio escorted by a Japanese man-of-war, crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{original}} version having been broadcast on PBS, a pilot episode for an American version (known as Red Dwarf USA) was produced through Universal Studios {{with the intention of}} broadcasting on NBC in 1992. The show essentially followed the same story as the first episode of {{the original}} series, using American actors for most of the main roles: Craig Bierko as Lister, Chris Eigeman as Rimmer, and Hinton Battle as Cat. Exceptions to this were Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten, and the British actress Jane Leeves, who played Holly. It was written by Linwood Boomer and directed by Jeffrey Melman, with <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Naylor onboard as creators and executive producers. Llewellyn, <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Naylor travelled to America for the filming of the American pilot after production of the fifth series of the UK series. According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. <b>Grant</b> <b>and</b> Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.|$|E
