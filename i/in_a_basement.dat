5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse.

The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>basement</b> stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>basement</b> area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
