40|$|The Brazilian Environmental Data Collection System {{provides}} {{data collection}} services based on SCD- 1 and SCD- 2 satellites to an increasing user community. The SCD- 1, {{in spite of}} 19 years in flight operation, is operating in a degraded mode as well as SCD- 2 with 14 years in operation continues to offer 24 hours/ 7 days data relay function {{to more than a}} 1000 platforms. Several effort actions to improve the ground infrastructure to receive and to process the relayed messages have being performed. A <b>Data</b> <b>Collection</b> <b>Processor,</b> named PROCOD, is a ground receiving station equipment that process the down linked relayed frequency band and recover the messages transmitted from the data collection platform networks. A new PROCOD version was developed and installed in the Cuiaba ground station by mid- 2012. The development cycle follows the traditional space project phases, starting from specification to acceptance tests and field validation. The exceptional performance obtained with PROCOD III version during field tests in Cuiaba ground station is presented in this paper, as well as the concepts used in the design. This equipment employs digital processing technology, field programmable gate arrays components and more than 20 years of INPE experience in ground equipment development. The measured operational results show a 121 % improvement in message recovery compared to PROCOD-II for SCD- 1 passes and an 85 % improvement for SCD- 2. Although these exceptional results obtained, a new PROCOD version is being in discussion to meet demands for increasing numbers of platforms and applications. Pages: 9071 - 907...|$|E

The second is <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> that will occur during and immediately after environmental remediation in support of remediation activities.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for advanced modelling methods, which can reflect complex travel activities of individuals, requires enhanced travel <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> methods. The introduction of GPS-assisted <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> methods has provided {{an alternative to}} the conventional methods of travel <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> GPS-assisted <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> methods improve the accuracy of <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> and enable capturing more details of individuals' travel behaviour. Recent technological advancements in smartphone-based positioning technologies and communication facilities have opened up new opportunities to apply smartphones as the media of GPS-assisted <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> Although, different GPS-assisted methods have been employed recently, their performance has not been widely evaluated in real-world experiments compared to traditional <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> methods. Accordingly, this paper evaluates the performance of three GPS-assisted methods, namely handheld GPS tracking, smartphone-based GPS tracking and smartphone-based prompted-recall <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> methods, in conjunction with the web-based <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> to shed light on different aspects of GPS-assisted <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> methods. These methods are compared in terms of the quality and accuracy of the collected data, the demographic attributes of participants and the specifications of labelled trips. The results show that an appropriate employment of smartphones enhances the accuracy of <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> It is also found that putting an extra burden on participants during a travel <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> survey results in lower trip-rates and poor data quality.

We propose a multi-path scheduling algorithm for snapshot <b>data</b> <b>collection,</b> {{which has a}} tighter capacity bound than the existing best result, and a novel continuous <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> algorithm with comprehensive capacity analysis.

Thirdly, most of the existing works studying the <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> capacity issue are for centralized synchronous WSNs. However, wireless networks {{are more likely to be}} distributed asynchronous systems.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>collection</b> is a {{fundamental}} task in wireless sensor networks. In many applications of wireless sensor networks, approximate <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> is a wise choice due to the constraints in communication bandwidth and energy budget. In this paper, we focus on efficient approximate <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> with prespecified error bounds in wireless sensor networks. The key idea of our <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> approach ADC (Approximate <b>Data</b> <b>Collection)</b> is to divide a sensor network into clusters, discover local data correlations on each cluster head, and perform global approximate <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> on the sink node according to model parameters uploaded by cluster heads. Specifically, we propose a local estimation model to approximate the readings of sensor nodes in subsets, and prove rated error-bounds of <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> using this model. In the process of model-based <b>data</b> <b>collection,</b> we formulate the problem of selecting the minimum subset of sensor nodes into a minimum dominating set problem which {{is known to be}} NP-hard, and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm to find an approximate solution. We further propose a monitoring algorithm to adaptively adjust the composition of node subsets according to changes of sensor readings. Our trace-driven simulations demonstrate that ADC remarkably reduces communication cost of <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> with guaranteed error bounds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Data</b> <b>collection</b> for {{economic}} evaluation alongside clinical trials is burdensome and cost-intensive. Limiting both {{the frequency of}} <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> and recall periods can solve the problem. As a consequence, gaps in survey periods arise and must be filled appropriately. The aims of our study are to assess the validity of incomplete cost <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> and define suitable resource categories. Methods In the randomised KORINNA study, cost data from 234 elderly patients were collected quarterly over a 1 -year period. Different strategies for incomplete <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> were compared with complete <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> The sample size calculation was modified in response to elasticity of variance. Results Resource categories suitable for incomplete <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> were physiotherapy, ambulatory clinic in hospital, medication, consultations, outpatient nursing service and paid household help. Cost estimation from complete and incomplete <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> showed no difference when omitting information from one quarter. When omitting information from two quarters, costs were underestimated by 3. 9 % to 4. 6 %. With respect to the observed increased standard deviation, a larger sample size would be required, increased by 3 %. Nevertheless, more time was saved than extra time would be required for additional patients. Conclusion Cost data can be collected efficiently by reducing the frequency of <b>data</b> <b>collection.</b> This {{can be achieved by}} incomplete <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> for shortened periods or complete <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> by extending recall windows. In our analysis, cost estimates per year for ambulatory healthcare and non-healthcare services in terms of three <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> was as valid and accurate as a four complete <b>data</b> <b>collections.</b> In contrast, <b>data</b> on hospitalisation, rehabilitation stays and care insurance benefits should be collected for the entire target period, using extended recall windows. When applying the method of incomplete <b>data</b> <b>collection,</b> sample size calculation has to be modified because of the increased standard deviation. This approach is suitable to enable economic evaluation with lower costs to both study participants and investigators. Trial registration The trial registration number is ISRCTN 02893746 </p...|$|R
