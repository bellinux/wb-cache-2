5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> upside down.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the arrest}} of Tara and Clay, Jax struggles to hold SAMCRO {{together}} while Tara is imprisoned. Toric approaches both Tara and Clay and offers them deals in exchange for giving up SAMCRO; both initially refuse, but Clay later relents when confronted with being thrown into the prison's general population and assuredly being killed by inmates paid off by Damon Pope's men as a retaliation for Pope's murder. Juice returns to Charming after helping Bobby relocate after stepping down as VP, which angers Chibs, who doesn't believe Juice has been punished enough for talking to cops and later beats him. With the growing romance between Gemma and Nero, the death of Clay Morrow, and death of Tara, the tables <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> and club starts {{to go in a}} new darker direction.|$|E
25|$|In the Town of Poughkeepsie, {{just after}} the {{northern}} terminus of NY9D, 9 passes another distressed mall, South Hills and its healthier, newer counterpart, the Poughkeepsie Galleria. A mile further north, NY113 swings to the west at a cloverleaf interchange near the IBM plant, once the region's major employer. Entering the city of Poughkeepsie, at Sharon Drive, 9 returns to expressway status once again. Two miles (3.2km) north of Sharon, the highway connects to the US44/NY55 concurrency at an interchange {{in close proximity to}} the Mid-Hudson Bridge. This creates some unusual left exits, as traffic from 44/55 east wanting to go north on 9 is routed into a U-turn south of the highway, and likewise northbound drivers on 9 must <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> around to go west over the river. The limited-access highway comes to an end at the intersection with NY9G near Marist College.|$|E

500|$|Suzuki {{did not use}} storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He {{preferred}} {{to come up with}} ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know {{what is going to happen}} is the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially [...] "Japanese" [...] killer, [...] "If he were Italian, he'd <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> on by macaroni, right?" [...] Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went [...] "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore maebari, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.|$|E
500|$|US15 enters Maryland at Point of Rocks, {{named for}} the pair of {{mountain}} peaks between which the Potomac River cuts through Catoctin Mountain, Pine Rock in Maryland and Furnace Mountain in Loudoun County, Virginia. [...] The highway crosses the river on the Point of Rocks Bridge, a two-lane, eight-span camelback truss bridge that also passes over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision on the Maryland side of the river. [...] Just north of the bridge, US15 meets the western terminus of MD28 (Clay Street), which serves as {{the main street of}} the community of Point of Rocks. [...] The U.S. Highway heads north as a two-lane controlled-access road that passes through a mix of farmland and forest on the eastern flank of Catoctin Mountain. [...] North of its roundabout at MD464 (Point of Rocks Road), US15 has only two intersections, with Basford Road and Mountville Road, before passing under Elmer Derr Road and reaching a partial interchange with US340 (Jefferson National Pike) east of Jefferson. [...] There is no direct access from northbound US15 to westbound US340 or from eastbound US340 to southbound US15; that access is provided by using the Mt.

500|$|Honey pays {{homage to}} some of Nagai's other creations, such as the Mazinger and Devilman series; the first two episodes alone include many cameos. [...] The first shows Mayor Light and Chokkei in a picture with {{characters}} from Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen, Iyahaya Nantomo, and Oira Sukeban, while Devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle. In the second, a scene in a downtown market in Cosplay City has cameos from Hige Godzilla from Harenchi Gakuen and Naojiro Abashiri from The Abashiri Family; a scene in Honey's bedroom shows a bust of Mazinger Z and a framed picture of her father, Dr. Kisaragi; and several scenes show Mazinger Z Sayaka Yumi, The Abashiri Family Kikunosuke, and an unnamed character from Kekkō Kamen as they <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> into plastic-coated statues. Cutie Honey's skin-tight, full-body costume uses the same design and tricolor (blue, black, and red) scheme as that of Nagai's original manga, but its chest opening—with rounded side edges—resembles the one in her 1973 anime attire. The opening sequence used {{in the first four}} episodes shows versions of Honey's original seven forms in the TV series: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's techniques parody those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later episodes feature appearances by Akira Fudo of Devilman and Professor Kabuto of Mazinger Z. In episode 7, Honey transforms herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title sequence of episodes 5 through 8 features Sirene, Devilman's nemesis, and Akira Fudo of Devilman along with Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto. Devilman can be briefly seen as one of the back-up guitarists for the one-time antagonist Saline in episode 3.|$|E
500|$|Vampire Journals (1997) is a {{spin-off}} of the Subspecies film series, {{featuring the}} vampire Ash. Vampire Journals follows Zachary, a vampire with a conscience, who hunts the vampire bloodline that sired him. After witnessing {{the love of}} his life <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> into a vampire, Zachary destroys both her, and his master, and former protégé of Ash, Serena. Zachary, armed with the enchanted sword of a great vampire slayer called Laertes, seeks out the rest of Serena's bloodline to eradicate them. Zachary travels to Bucharest to find Ash. Zachary uses Ash's penchant for music and women to bait him out into the open for attack. Ash sets his sights on pianist Sofia, but is thwarted by Zachary during his first attempt to take Sofia. [...] It is revealed through a conversation between Ash and a seer that Zachary's coming was expected and that the two are destined to fight; however, Ash is to be the victor. Ash does not give up on acquiring Sofia, and hires her for his nightclub. Over the next few nights he drains her of blood, so that he may turn her into a new apprentice. He also makes a deal with Zachary: he will give Zachary a consort, protection from the Sun, and allow Zachary to see Sophia if he leaves the city the following night. While Ash is preparing to sire Sofia, he gives his daytime consult Iris the key to Zachary's room, so that she may dispose of his sleeping body in the sunlight. Seeing that his obsession with Sofia will ruin both their lives, Iris releases Zachary instead. Zachary arrives too late; Sophia has already accepted Ash's blood. Fighting off a weakened Ash, Zachary and Sofia escape from the nightclub. Ash follows them, but the rising sun becomes a problem. Zachary manages to get back the sword and kill Ash, whose body falls into the Sun's rays. Zachary and Sofia then find refuge in a nearby closet.|$|E

2500|$|Frontiere {{finally gave}} up and decided to move the Rams {{franchise}} to St. Louis. However, on March 15, 1995, the other league owners rejected Frontiere's bid to move the franchise by a 21–3–6 vote. Then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue stated after rejecting the move, [...] "This {{was one of the}} most complex issues we have had to approach in years. We had to balance the interest of fans in Los Angeles and in St. Louis that we appreciate very much. In my judgment, they did not meet the guidelines we have in place for such a move." [...] The commissioner also added: [...] "Once the bridges have been burned and people <b>get</b> <b>turned</b> off on a sports franchise, years of loyalty is not respected and it is difficult to get it back. By the same token, there are millions of fans in that area who have supported the Rams in an extraordinary way.

2500|$|On Number 24 and 24 A are two friezes {{accompanied}} by a legend [...] A ship got stuck in a lull but was miraculously saved by a beautiful lady who brought the captain down to her palace under the waves.

[...] Back in Stockholm, however, the captain forgot his promise and choose to unship his goods before delivering the letter.
