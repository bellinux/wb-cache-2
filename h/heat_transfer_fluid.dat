Because {{of the relatively}} high heat losses through the glazing, flat plate collectors will not reach temperatures much above 200°C even when the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid</b> is stagnant. Such temperatures are too low for efficient conversion to electricity.|$|E

25|$|A {{thermostat}} is {{a device}} for regulating {{the temperature of}} a system so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint temperature. The thermostat does this by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or regulating the flow of a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid</b> as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. The thermostat was invented in 1883 by Warren S. Johnson.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermostat}} exerts {{control by}} switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating {{the flow of}} a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid</b> as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a set-point temperature, examples include building heating, central heating, air conditioners, HVAC systems, as well as kitchen equipment including ovens and refrigerators and medical and scientific incubators.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} solar {{collectors}} for residential applications {{are available with}} either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid</b> through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems. In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains {{a small amount of}} thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1971, Monsanto marketed {{a series}} of polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) containing <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> designated as Therminol FR series in the United States and Santotherm FR series in Europe. FR series Therminol <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> contained PCBs, which imparted fire resistance. Monsanto voluntarily ceased sales of these fluids in 1971. No form of Therminol <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> have contained PCBs since that time.

30|$|While most {{conventional}} <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> {{have their}} limitations, {{development of a}} fluid to meet the ever-increasing demand of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> has become necessary. Choi et al. [1] of Argonne Laboratory proposed <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> which are the colloidal suspension of nanoparticles (Al, Cu, Al 2 O 3, CuO, SiC, CNT, etc.) in conventional fluids (water, ethylene glycol, engine oil, etc.), for superior <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> in various engineering applications. Small size and large {{surface to volume ratio}} of nanoparticles cause higher thermal conductivity, less clogging in flow channel and high <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> rate along with long-term stability of nanofluids, ensuring that they become the most desirable heating or cooling medium for today as well as for tomorrow.|$|R
500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid</b> in {{some types}} of nuclear {{reactors}} because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another heat transfer application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.|$|E

2500|$|Antifreeze was {{developed}} to overcome the shortcomings of water as a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid.</b> In some engines freeze plugs (engine block expansion plugs) are placed {{in areas of the}} engine block where coolant flows {{in order to protect the}} engine from freeze damage [...] if the ambient temperature drops below the freezing point of the antifreeze/water mixture. These should not be confused with core plugs, whose purpose is to allow removal of sand used in the casting process of engine blocks (core plugs will be pushed out if the coolant freezes, though, assuming that they adjoin the coolant passages, which is not always the case).|$|E
30|$|Convective <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> of {{conventional}} <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> inside micro/minichannel <b>heat</b> exchanger has been intensively studied {{due to its}} capability to remove high flux [27, 31, 61 – 67]. However, relatively {{few studies have been}} carried out to investigate the application of novel <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> inside mini/microchannels. The recent development of nanotechnology has led to intensify the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficient by using novel nanostructured working fluids. While there are some recent experimental studies, which have demonstrated the possibility of using nanostructured <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> inside micro/nanostructured surface to enhance <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> [20, 25, 28], other recent studies showed that the use of nanofluids and nanotube coating offers a lower <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficient at the coated surface compared to the bare surface [67 – 70].|$|R
40|$|Molten salts {{have better}} thermal {{properties}} than synthetic mineral oil, and hence {{they can be}} directly used as <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> in solar power plants, but in practice their direct applications as <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> are constrained due to their high freezing temperature points. In this paper, a class of ternary nitrate salt mixtures consisting of 50 - 80 wt% KNO(3), 0 - 25 wt% LiNO(3) and 10 - 45 wt% ca(NO(3)) (2) were processed and tested. Experimental results indicated that some mixtures within this range exhibited excellent thermal properties, such as a low melting point (< 100 degrees C), robust reliability, high-temperature stability (upto 500 degrees C) and a low viscosity (e. g., < 5 cP at 190 degrees C). Apart from these desirable thermo-physical properties, the manufacturing cost of these novel inorganic salts HTFs (<b>Heat</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Fluids)</b> is considerably {{lower than those of}} the existing commercial <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> (HTFs).

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of CdSe tetrapod-shaped quantum dots using phenyl-based <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> as inexpensive alternatives to octadecene solvent was studied. The CdSe tetrapods were synthesized using the hot-injection method, {{in which the}} trioctylphosphine selenide precursor and the shape-inducing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant were injected into a cadmium oleate-containing solvent at 190 degrees C. At a synthesis temperature of 160 degrees C, the resulting quantum dot particles were found to grow more slowly in <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> and pure phenyl-type solvents than in octadecene. With synthesis time, the selectivity to tetrapods increased, and the arms grew proportionally in width and length.

2500|$|Unsaturated organic {{compounds}} can store {{huge amounts of}} hydrogen. These Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed. Research on LOHC was concentrated on cycloalkanes at an early stage, with its relatively high hydrogen capacity (6-8 wt %) and production of COx-free hydrogen. [...] Heterocyclic aromatic compounds (or N-Heterocycles) are also appropriate for this task. A compound that stands in {{the focus of the}} current LOHC research is N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) but many others do exist. More recently dibenzyltoluene, which is already industrially used as a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid</b> in industry, was identified as potential LOHC. With a wide liquid range between -39°C (melting point) and 390°C (boiling point) and a hydrogen storage density of 6.2 wt% dibenzyltoluene is ideally suited as LOHC material. More recently, formic acid (FA) has been suggested as a promising hydrogen storage material with a 4.4wt% hydrogen capacity.|$|E
