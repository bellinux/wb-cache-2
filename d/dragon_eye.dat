2500|$|Breaking the {{symmetry}} of the helmet are subtle {{differences in the}} two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the cloisonné garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been [...] "manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same." [...] The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires {{and one or two}} fewer garnets. Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was [...] "reddish in colour" [...] against the [...] "yellowish" [...] hue of the sinister, while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter brow and on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of [...] "hatched gold foil," [...] those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing. The gold backing served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour. Where this backing was missing on the sinister eyebrow and one <b>dragon</b> <b>eye,</b> the luminosity of the garnets would be [...] "substantially dimmed" [...] by direct placement against the bronze.|$|E
