5|$|In June, Federer {{announced}} {{that after the}} end of his third term, he would resign as President of the ATP Players Council, a position <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> since 2008. At the Halle Open, Federer reached both the singles and the doubles finals and won his seventh Halle singles title, beating Alejandro Falla in the final. At Wimbledon, Federer reached a record ninth final, but he was defeated by Djokovic in an epic five-set match.|$|E
5|$|After narrow {{defeat in}} the general {{election}} of 1964, Douglas-Home resigned the leadership of his party, having instituted a new and less secretive method of electing the party leader. From 1970 to 1974 he served in the cabinet of Edward Heath as Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, an expanded version of the post of Foreign Secretary, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> earlier. After the defeat of the Heath government in 1974 he returned to the House of Lords as a life peer and retired from front-line politics.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} deal, Smythe {{resigned}} as president and managing director, nominating Stafford to succeed him. On Stafford's instigation, the board then granted Smythe a $15,000 annual allowance, an office at the Gardens, and a car and driver {{for the rest of}} his life. Stafford, Ballard and Bassett then nominated Smythe as chairman of the board. Smythe retired as NHL governor on February 5, 1962, a position <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> since 1927. Smythe resigned the chairmanship after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962 and Bassett succeeded him.|$|E

5|$|By 1588, Gebhard's {{joint pain}} (Gelenkenschmerz) {{prevented}} him from riding a horse; the climate of Cologne, damp and cold, made his condition worse, so he relinquished his claim on the Electorate {{to the protection of}} Adolf von Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, which they pursued until their deaths later that year. In the summer 1588, Gebhard established his residence at Strassburg, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> the office of dean of the cathedral since 1574and had maintained it concurrently with his position in Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Augustus died on 23 January 1698, leaving {{all of his}} territories to George {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, an office <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> since 1661. George thus became Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (also known as Hanover, after its capital) as well as Archbannerbearer and a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. His court in Hanover was graced by many cultural icons such as the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and the composers George Frideric Händel and Agostino Steffani.|$|E
5|$|Eustathios {{was then}} {{appointed}} as strategos {{of the border}} theme of Charsianon, a position notably inferior in rank {{to that of the}} Anatolics that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> previously. The Argyros family, however, had strong connections with Charsianon, from which it hailed. There he received the return to imperial service of a number of Armenian lords, Melias, the three brothers Baasakios, Krigorikios and Pazounes, and Ismael, who were established as march-wardens along the Empire's eastern border. Of them, Melias in particular would go on to become the founder of the theme of Lykandos and one of the main Byzantine leaders in the wars against the Arabs over the next 30 years.|$|E

5|$|In 1189, Hugh {{was one of}} {{only five}} sitting sheriffs who {{retained}} their office when Richard took the throne; the others included Geoffrey fitzPeter, William Briwerre, and Ranulf de Glanvill. However, in 1189, Bardulf did lose custody of Salisbury Castle, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> under Henry. Henry had given Bardulf the manor and barony of Brampton in Devonshire, but when Richard took the throne, the king took back Brampton, and gave Bardulf the manor of Hoo in Kent instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1589, Gebhard and {{his wife}} moved to Strasbourg, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> a prebendary {{position}} in the Cathedral chapter since 1574, and had maintained concurrently with his position in Cologne. Before his arrival some trouble had arisen in the chapter when three excommunicated canons, refugees from the Cologne strife, persisted in retaining their offices after they had accepted the reformed doctrines. He joined this party, which was strongly supported in the city, and {{took part in a}} double election to the bishopric in 1592. Despite some opposition, he retained his office until his death in 1601.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E

He was known {{to spend a lot of}} time on the club, attending fund raisers and giving talks. On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E
5|$|The Comitato Organizzatore dei XVI Giochi del Mediterraneo– Pescara 2009 (English: Organizing Committee of the XVI Mediterranean Games– Pescara 2009; {{abbreviated}} as COJM) {{was created}} in 2006 to oversee the staging of the Games. The committee {{was in charge of}} implementing and staging the Games, and to maintain the infrastructure and provide other services. The committee's board of directors consisted of politicians, IOC members from Italy, and presidents of the various Italian sports governing bodies. Mario Pescante was appointed as the Commissioner Extraordinary of the Games in 2008 by the Italian Government. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> the same office during the 2006 Winter Olympic, held in Turin.|$|E
5|$|Already in the 1880s, Muller had {{dabbled in}} {{ethnography}} and writing. On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F. Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden.|$|E

5|$|At the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Ricky Walden 4–1 in {{the last}} 16, John Higgins 5–1 in the quarter-finals, and Barry Hawkins 6–2 in the semi-finals. He defeated Ding Junhui 9–3 in the final to win his third Welsh Open title, and the 26th ranking title of his career. In the last frame of the final, he compiled a record 12th maximum break in professional competition, breaking the previous record of 11 maximum breaks that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> jointly with Stephen Hendry. During the season O'Sullivan competed at the Players Tour Championship, and finished second on the European Tour Order of Merit, {{to qualify for the}} Players Championship Grand Final. There he defeated Scott Donaldson 4–0 {{in the last}} 32, but lost 3–4 against Yu Delu in the last 16, despite making a 140, the highest break of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne lost 1,000 {{men in the}} two battles, {{leaving him}} outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1; American losses came to about 500 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most {{effective}} leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. That night he lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew {{under the cover of}} darkness. On the morning of October 8, he was back in the fortified positions <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> on September 16. By October 13 he was surrounded at Saratoga, and on October 17 he surrendered his army. The remnants of his expedition retreated from Ticonderoga back to Quebec.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 he {{was still}} doing {{engineering}} work for his former employers, who were beset with manufacturing problems and a shortage of engine-erectors. He was also running his own business engaged in general millwrighting and was still called upon by various Manchester engine owners who preferred to use his services for their machine erection and maintenance needs than those of Boulton and Watt. He had moved to New Street, Hanover Street and in December 1799 {{was appointed to the}} position of conductor of firemen and inspector of engines by the Manchester police commissioners, positions which effectively put him in charge of the fire brigade. One source– the one considered unreliable by Chaloner– has stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> the position for 20 years prior to his death.|$|E

5|$|The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{met with}} Groves on 30 January 1948 to {{evaluate}} his performance. Eisenhower recounted {{a long list}} of complaints about Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, insensitivity, contempt for the rules and maneuvering for promotion out of turn. Eisenhower made it clear that Groves would never become Chief of Engineers. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar military he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance the one <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 24 January 1948, just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the Manhattan Project. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|They {{finished}} second in the league in 1998–99 and 2001–02. With Harry Dixon's death in 2002, Harry Hodgson took up the post of President. In 2004, John Flynn stood down as chairman, and so for a year long period, Hodgson took up the title of club chairman as well. At the end of the 2004–05 season, he retired from the club. His replacement, Sandra Gordon, is still Chair at the club. She is the first ever female Chair of the club, and only the third {{in the history of the}} Northern League. In 2007, Bernard Fairbairn, who had followed his father and grandfather into the job, stood down as club secretary, a post <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> since 1961, giving him a total of 46 years in his position. Stephen Moralee has now taken over as club secretary.|$|E
5|$|After Caesar's assassination, Mark Antony, who {{had been}} Caesar's Master of the Horse, formed an {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution, and as such, the senate and assemblies remained powerless. The conspirators were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Lepidus became powerless, and Antony went to Egypt to seek glory in the east, while Octavian remained in Rome. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and committed suicide in 30 BC. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome, as the unchallenged master of the state. In 27 BC, Octavian offered to give up the Dictatorial powers which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>held</b> since 42 BC, but the senate refused, and thus ratified his status as master of the state. He became the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the transition from Roman Republic to Roman Empire was complete.|$|E
