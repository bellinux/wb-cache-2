25|$|The Colt Python {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally {{intended to be a}} large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Colt originally manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up {{for the duration of the}} hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. From the 1970s each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser; the first mass-produced revolver for which this was done.|$|E
2500|$|Official Colt {{historian}} RL Wilson {{described the}} Colt Python as [...] "the Rolls-Royce of Colt revolvers", and firearms historian Ian V. Hogg {{referred to it}} as the [...] "best revolver in the world". However, the revolver is not without its detractors. The downside to the Colt Python's precision is its tendency to go [...] "out of time" [...] with continued heavy shooting. This is a condition in which the cylinder does not turn in exact alignment with the <b>forcing</b> <b>cone,</b> so a shooter may be sprayed with burning propellant when the gun is fired, or the gun may not fire when used as a double-action. When this happens, the lockwork needs to be re-timed.|$|E

50|$|Cone fenders are an {{improved}} version of Cell type Fender recently introduced and recommended {{for all types}} of applications including high tidal variation sites. This advanced feature of lesser height of fenders improves material handling capabilities of Deck / Vessel Cranes which reduces overall cost of the project. Due to the geometrical shape of the fenders it can deflect more and it can absorb more energy from any direction. Maintaining reaction force, but doubling energy absorption, can be achieved by using two identical cone fenders in a back-to-back arrangement. In order to distribute the reaction <b>force,</b> <b>cone</b> fenders are typically supplied with large fender panels, which keeps the hull pressure low.|$|R
40|$|The <b>force</b> <b>cone</b> method {{developed}} by Claus Mattheck enables computer-free topology designing {{and offers a}} profound knowledge for lightweight structures. Thus, the recently developed method enhances the series of the so-called thinking tools. The method’s basic idea is the force distribution of a single force in an elastic plane. The symmetrically placed cones appear {{in front of the}} force and behind it. These cones intersect with 90 ° angles at primary points that quickly lead to a structural design proposal. Furthermore, the method is very useful for the evaluation of structures and their lightweight potential. With the knowledge of the load case, it is easy to identify the main tension and compression paths leading to a deeper understanding of lightweight results. Natural structures such as trees can also be understood in another way, highlighting the structural principles at the root, leaf, treetop or even the entire tree. Nowadays, technical lightweight solu-tions can be found with different methods, including the soft kill option developed at the KIT 20 years ago. The method resembles that of the biological mineralization process of living bone and results in structures that can be seen as optimized lightweight design proposals. The comparisons of those structures with the state-of-the-art designs used in the industry and with those found by the <b>force</b> <b>cone</b> method indicate the high potential of the new method. For the confi rmation of the basic rules and principles, different assembly posi-tions of force and supports as well as different types of supports, such as fi xed supports or torsion anchors, have been analyzed...|$|R
5000|$|The throat in a {{revolver}} {{is part of}} the cylinder, and like any other chamber, the throat should be sized so that it is concentric to the chamber and very slightly over the bullet diameter. At the end of the throat, however, things change. First, the throat in {{a revolver}} is at least as long as the maximum overall length of the cartridge, otherwise the cylinder cannot revolve. The next step is the cylinder gap, the space between the cylinder and barrel. This must be wide enough to allow free rotation of the cylinder even when it becomes fouled with powder residue, but not so large that excessive gas is released. The next step is the <b>forcing</b> <b>cone.</b> The <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> is where the bullet is guided from the cylinder into the bore of the barrel. It should be concentric with the bore, and deep enough to force the bullet into the bore without significant deformation. Unlike rifles, where the threaded portion of the barrel is in the chamber, revolver barrels threads surround the breech end of the bore, and {{it is possible that the}} bore will be compressed when the barrel is screwed into the frame. Cutting a longer <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> can relieve this [...] "choke" [...] point, as can lapping of the barrel after it is fitted to the frame.414243 ...|$|E
5000|$|Cylinder bore ∅ {{is given}} as [...]500 in. SAAMI {{recommends}} a 6 groove barrel with each groove being [...]130 in wide. A barrel with a bore ∅ of [...]4880 in and a groove ∅ of [...]4983 in is also recommended. The recommended twist rate is 1 in 18.75 in. While the bore diameter of [...]4880 in {{is consistent with}} other firearms which fire a [...]500 in diameter bullet, the groove diameter of [...]4983 in is an oddity as most firearms which fire a [...]500 in will have a groove diameter of equal to {{the diameter of the}} bullet. For this reason regular cast lead bullets should not be fired in the revolver as excessive leading of the <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> and barrel will occur, leading to excessive pressures or the deposited lead acting as an obstruction in the barrel or <b>forcing</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{redesigned}} Red Label {{was introduced}} by Ruger in 2013. The new version was lighter and featured refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil. These improvements were designed to deliver improved comfort and enhanced shooting performance and make the gun lighter to carry in the field. According to Ruger the new 12 gauge Red Label had a redistributed center of gravity for even greater instinctual swing and pointing. It also featured two-inch extended <b>forcing</b> <b>cones,</b> maximum back-bored barrels and a soft Pachmayr buttpad to enhance the shooting experience with reduced recoil. The suggested retail price for the new Red Label was $1,399 which was approximately $500 less than MSRP of the original when it was discontinued. The price drop was achieved by streamlining the manufacturing processes, making the shotgun less costly to produce.|$|R
5000|$|A {{revolver}} houses cartridges in a {{rotary cylinder}} and rotates them in-line with the cylinder bore (actually a <b>forcing</b> <b>cone)</b> prior to each shot. Revolvers {{are most often}} handguns, however examples of rifles and shotguns and cannon have been made. The cylinder is most often rotated by manipulation of the trigger and/or hammer, although some are [...] "double action" [...] using the manual pull of the trigger to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer.|$|E
50|$|The {{throating}} issue exists {{because in}} the USA it has been traditional to have short chambers so that the bullet is being engraved {{at the moment of}} insertion. European practice has more of a <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> construction which can, by itself, allow significantly higher chamber pressure. All Sig-Sauer handguns (for example) have European throating and all are certified to fire +P ammunition. Short throating and unnoticed bullet setback can easily increase chamber pressures by more than 10,000 psi.|$|E
5000|$|Upon firing, the ductile {{soft lead}} bullet (alloys of pure to nearly pure lead were used) allowed {{the base of}} the bullet to [...] "bump up" [...] to first the chamber {{diameter}} in the cylinder, then jump the gap, through the <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> into the rifling. This is effective with black powder, but less so with smokeless powder. Alloying the lead with tin or antimony to harden it makes this nearly impossible. Use of hard alloys typically leads to poor accuracy.|$|E

5000|$|All lead wadcutters require proper {{lubrication}} {{to prevent}} leading of rifling and <b>forcing</b> <b>cones</b> {{when used in}} firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940 ft/s. Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both [...]38 Special and [...]357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both [...]44 Special and [...]44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths {{may need to be}} set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case.|$|R

50|$|Most {{frangible}} bullets {{are subject}} to brittle failure upon striking a hard target. This mechanism {{has been used to}} minimize the tendency of malleable lead and copper bullets to ricochet from hard targets as large, cohesive particles. Brittle failure may occur at subsonic velocity. Attempting to crimp a brittle frangible bullet into the cartridge case may break the bullet. Brittle frangible bullets may break during the self-loading cycle of semi-automatic firearms; and those fired from revolvers often break as the bullet encounters the barrel <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> after leaving the cylinder.|$|E

The barrel on the 1860 Army has a <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> that is visibly shorter than that of the 1851 Navy, allowing the Army revolver to have a longer cylinder.

5000|$|The {{chamber of}} the gun is larger, to {{accommodate}} {{the thickness of the}} shotshell walls, and a [...] "forcing cone" [...] in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter. The <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> can be as short as a fraction of an inch, or as long as a few inches on some guns. At the muzzle end of the barrel, the choke can constrict the bore even further, so measuring the bore diameter of a shotgun is not a simple process, as it must be done away from either end.|$|E

50|$|Wadcutters are {{typically}} made from lead. Deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels {{and into the}} forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the <b>forcing</b> <b>cone,</b> introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup.

But Ken Griffey, Jr. led the top of the fourth off with a homer of his own to cut the lead in half. Then in the sixth, the Mariners managed to load the bases against Cone.

5000|$|After the {{introduction}} of the [...]45 Colt handgun cartridge, in 1872, the conversion of [...]44 caliber percussion revolvers began. Percussion cylinders were replaced with rear loading cartridge cylinders. This allowed the use of the [...]45 Colt cartridge. The load range for this cartridge was typically 28 to 40 grains of black powder. Thus, a Colt Walker revolver converted to shoot the [...]45 Colt cartridge is limited to a maximum of 40 grains even though the revolver was originally designed to load up to 60 grains. The [...]45 BPM cartridge was developed to allow for black-powder loads of more than 40 grains. This gives the converted Colt Walker the convenience of using self-contained cartridges and the advantage of loads beyond the 40 grain limitation of the [...]45 Colt cartridge and provides the added benefit of moving the bullet closer to the <b>forcing</b> <b>cone</b> as compared to the [...]45 Colt.

40|$|Solar sail propulsive {{performance}} {{is dependent on}} sail membrane optical properties and on sail membrane shape. Assumptions of an ideal sail (flat, perfect reflector) can result in errors which can affect spacecraft control, trajectory analyses, and overall evaluation of solar sail performance. A MATLAB(R) program has been developed to generate sail shape point cloud files for two square-architecture solar sail designs. Simple parabolic profiles are assumed for sail shape under solar pressure loading. These files are then input into the Solar Vectoring Evaluation Tool (SVET) software to determine the propulsive force vector, center of pressure, and moments about the sail body axes {{as a function of}} sail shape and optical properties. Also, the impact of the center-line angle, due to non-perfect optical properties, is addressed since this constrains sail <b>force</b> vector <b>cone</b> angle and is often overlooked when assuming ideal-reflector membranes.

40|$|Without an {{efficient}} transmission system {{the idea of}} {{an efficient}} vehicle is incomplete. During running of the vehicle especially in case of heavy vehicles the transmission system has to face different situations during which the system possibly can lose its efficiency. Definitely variations in efficiency of the transmission system demand from engine to vary its power to maintain the system efficiency to regulate speed of the vehicle. Gear shifting mechanism of the transmission system is one of the responsible agents for losing rotational speed of the system. The engine needs to increase its power to compensate such kind of losses by injecting the more fuel. Ultimately there will be more emissions on exhaust side. In this scenario the conducted research is concentrated on the gear shifting mechanism. To start with the well-defined aim a generic cone synchronizer mechanism modelled by a mechanical system with five degrees of freedom and comprising three rigid bodies is studied to understand the gear shifting process. To resolve complexity of the complete gear shifting processes detailed kinematic description of the phases and sub-phases gives an opportunity to capture the nature of bodies’ interaction and forces arise during their interaction. In the project a mathematical model to represent the whole gear shifting process is developed based on Constrained Lagrangian Formalism. The developed model went through validation test by using experimental data. Because the developed mathematical model is flexible to adopt other relevant models, the friction model is applied to the developed mathematical model and analyzed the differences in the results. The next step is to optimize the gear shifting process based on the input parameters. Using the developed model the analysis is performed in two steps; in first step the sensitivity analysis is considered to study the effect of variations of individual parameter on the system performance and in second step effects of a set of synchronizer mechanism's parameters which vary simultaneously are studied by using the optimization technique. Time duration of the gear shifting and speed difference at end of the main phase of synchronization process are chosen as objective functions of the system. Parameters estimated quickness and smoothness (comfort) of synchronization processes are cone angle, cone coefficient of friction, applied shift force, blocker angle, blocker coefficient of friction, cone radius, gear moment of inertia and ring moment of inertia. Eight cases of the synchronizer mechanism performance are studied under different scenarios of master/slave and different operating conditions. Further analysis on results obtained from the Pareto optimization clarifies the degree of influence of the input parameters. It was found that optimal performance of the system can be obtained by tuning few of the system parameters which have higher degree of influence instead of changing all the parameters together. For example in the case where the sleeve is considered as a master at nominal condition optimal performance of the synchronizer can be obtained by paying attention to applied shift <b>force,</b> <b>cones</b> angle, cones coefficient of friction, blocker angle and blocker coefficient of friction instead of taking all eight input parameters. At the end a graphical user interface is developed to obtain the synchronization performance diagram...|$|R
