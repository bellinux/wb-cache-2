5|$|There {{are several}} changes to {{gameplay}} {{and the way}} text is displayed during Bad Boys Love in the original version of the game: saving is disabled except at certain points in the story, the function to skip dialogue and interactions is removed, and plot-important dialogue and narrative are highlighted with colored text; usually yellow, though text of particularly critical importance is <b>highlighted</b> <b>in</b> red. In the 2014 remake however, the option to save is available at all times, the skip function is retained, and text is no longer <b>highlighted.</b> <b>In</b> both versions, the game's interface and controls change {{from that of a}} standard visual novel to similar to that of a '90s-era turn-based role-playing game during certain segments of the narrative.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati {{is always}} {{considered}} a widow, and thus, {{is the only}} Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since left her. Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is <b>highlighted</b> <b>in</b> many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This aspect of her life and career is <b>highlighted</b> <b>in</b> Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Narayan was {{nominated}} to the Rajya Sabha, the upper {{house of the}} Indian Parliament, for his contributions to literature.

His inaugural speech was focused on this particular problem, and resulted {{in the formation of}} a committee chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.|$|E

In 2001, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots.

5|$|In 2009 the European {{ombudsman}} published {{statistics of}} citizens' complaints against EU institutions, {{with most of}} them filed against the Commission (66%) and concerning lack of transparency (36%). In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies. Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was <b>highlighted</b> <b>in</b> a number of reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, {{particularly with regard to}} Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter. The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks to wildlife are <b>highlighted</b> <b>in</b> the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
