40|$|Abstract When {{parents are}} {{suspected}} of child abuse or neglect, their children may be placed with <b>foster</b> <b>families.</b> We estimate {{the relationship between the}} monthly subsidies paid to <b>foster</b> <b>families</b> and the quantity of foster care services provided. The empirical model uses variation in subsidies and foster care populations within 37 states and the years 1987 – 1995. One innovation in our approach is that we exploit the idea that states do not appear to set market clearing rates, as evidenced by a foster home shortage during this time period. In this case of excess demand, variation in the monthly subsidy traces out the supply curve. Our results show that states with high demand may be able to use economic incentives to recruit <b>foster</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: This article {{describes}} the first-year evaluation outcomes of a program developed to increase information technology access and skills among <b>foster</b> children and <b>families</b> {{within the context of}} a long-term foster care environ-ment.

Results: The results indicated after a year in the program, <b>foster</b> <b>families</b> increased their frequency of computer use, confidence in using computers and the Internet, and frequency of e-mail with social workers. Parents and foster children perceived the program to be useful in improving children’s technology skills, homework, grades, and interest in technology-related careers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a recent research project that provided {{an opportunity for the}} voices of a special group of young people to be heard. The biological children of <b>foster</b> <b>families</b> have rarely been the focus of foster care research. Their stories are used in this study to highlight individual experiences and, ultimately, to inform the practice of offering support to <b>foster</b> <b>families.</b> Twenty-two young people between the ages of nine and thirty-two were interviewed. Their stories told of life in a confusing and contradictory world of foster care. This paper presents, through the words of the young people, four essential themes that highlight these contradictions. These are: sharing and losing; being responsible and escaping; caring and resenting; shouting and keeping quiet. Recommendations are made to improve training and support to <b>foster</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to describe through a quantitative study the extent of support received by <b>foster</b> <b>families,</b> their opinion of the support and any areas that might need improvement. The <b>foster</b> <b>families</b> receive <b>foster</b> care support through a private agency. We concentrated on the following areas of support; education, health, contact with the children’s biological relatives and behavioral difficulties. These four areas have, in previous research, shown to be problematic for foster children. Foster care support through private agencies is a new phenomenon in Sweden where foster care has traditionally been the government’s responsibility. The data was collected through a survey sent to 149 <b>foster</b> <b>families.</b> Our research showed {{that the vast majority}} of the <b>foster</b> <b>families</b> are satisfied with the support received and they consider it to cover their needs. Most of the families surveyed answered that they would like to continue receiving the same level of support as they do today and that they don’t find any areas to be lacking. Previous research on foster children, focusing on the four areas mentioned above, conflicts with our results since it showed that these four areas are particularly problematic for foster children...|$|R
