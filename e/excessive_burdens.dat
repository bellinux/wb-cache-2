This system is to provide information regarding the chance of market disruptions and will allow for the governing body to closely follow the trade in this new environment. This regulation is beneficial for Canadian clothing and fabric manufacturers because now there are fewer restrictions. It is hoped by some that this ruling will open up the European market in the near future. Benefits of the abolition of quotas are also expected to textile companies in India and Pakistan.|$|E
5000|$|His most {{interesting}} work, which marks {{him as a}} thinker in advance of his age, Politicorum lib. X, was published in Mainz in 1621 and 1629. The book has been called an [...] "Anti-Machiavelli" [...] because the author describes the ruler of a Christian commonwealth {{in accordance with the}} principals of revelation. In the questions of political and national economy which he discusses he advocates the reform of taxation, the freeing of the soil from <b>excessive</b> <b>burdens,</b> state ownership of certain industries for the purposes of revenue, indirect taxation of objects of luxury, a combination of the protective system with free trade, and state aid for popular associations. The Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria was so impressed by the ability shown in this work that he chose Contzen for his confessor. During his residence in Munich, which began in 1623, he completed and published his commentary on the four Gospels, and on the epistles of St. Paul to the Romans, the Corinthians, and the Galatians. He also wrote a political novel, Methodus doctrinæ civilis, seu Abissini regis Historia, in which he showed the practical working of his political theories.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the orders}} of Ambrogio Spinola, Philip IV's army laid siege to Breda in August 1624. The siege was {{contrary}} to the wishes of Philip IV's government because of the already <b>excessive</b> <b>burdens</b> of the concurrent Eighty and Thirty Years' wars. The strategically located city was heavily fortified and strongly defended by a large and well prepared garrison of 7,000 men, that the Dutch were confident would hold out long enough to wear down besiegers while awaiting a relief force to disrupt the siege. Yet despite the Spanish government's opposition to major sieges in the Low Countries and the obstacles confronting any attack on such a strongly fortified and defended city, Spinola launched his Breda campaign, rapidly blocking the city's defences and driving off a Dutch relief army {{under the leadership of}} Maurice of Nassau that had attempted to cut off the Spanish army's access to supplies. In February 1625, a second relief force, consisting of 7,000 English troops under the leadership of Horace Vere and Ernst von Mansfeld, was also driven off by Spinola. After a costly eleven-month siege, Justin of Nassau surrendered Breda in June 1625. Only 3,500 Dutchmen and fewer than 600 Englishmen had survived the siege.|$|E

50|$|Bistor {{was born}} in Macomb, Illinois. His parents died during his {{childhood}} and he supported the surviving family members, six brothers, by lighting streetlights in Macomb. He moved to Chicago as a teenager and worked as bicycling collector for a local real estate firm. In 1917, he was {{a founder of the}} firm Hedberg and Bistor. The two enjoyed a booming business in the 1920s and acquired some prime property, including a fifteen-story skyscraper in the Loop and a massive apartment complex on Lake Shore Drive. They went heavily into debt to finance this expansion and found it difficult to adapt when real estate values dipped in the late 1920s. In 1930, Bistor became the president of the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers (ARET), an organization of real-estate taxpayers in Chicago and Cook County. Between 1931 and 1933, it organized one of the largest tax strikes in American history.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of emission entitlements across countries {{is the single}} most controversial issue in international climate policy. Extreme positions within the policy debate range from entitlements based on current emission patterns (sovereignty) to entitlements based on equal-per-capita allocations (egalitarianism).

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} develop {{through a}} combination of genetic vulnerability and environmental stress, however the genetic basis of this risk is unknown. To understand the genetic basis of this risk, we performed whole exome sequencing on 93 unrelated individuals with eating disorders (38 restricted-eating and 55 binge-eating) to identify novel damaging variants. Candidate genes with an <b>excessive</b> <b>burden</b> of predicted damaging variants were then prioritized based upon an unbiased, data-driven bioinformatic analysis. One top candidate pathway was empirically tested for therapeutic potential in a mouse model of binge-like eating. An <b>excessive</b> <b>burden</b> of novel damaging variants was identified in 186 genes in the restricted-eating group and 245 genes in the binge-eating group. This list is significantly enriched (OR = 4. 6, p< 0. 0001) for genes involved in neuropeptide/neurotrophic pathways implicated in appetite regulation, including neurotensin-, glucagon-like peptide 1 - and BDNF-signaling. Administration of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exendin- 4 significantly reduced food intake in a mouse model of 'binge-like' eating. These findings implicate ultra-rare and novel damaging variants in neuropeptide/neurotropic factor signaling pathways in the development of eating disorder behaviors and identify glucagon-like peptide 1 -receptor agonists as a potential treatment for binge eating...|$|R

40|$|The {{allocation}} of emission entitlements across countries {{is the single}} most controversal issue in international climate policy. Extreme positions within the policy debate range from entitlement based on current emission patterns (CEP) to equal-per-capita (EPC) allocations.

We find welfare implications for the various regions to be strongly influenced by changes in the terms of trade. Especially, regions may experience considerable welfare losses even under entitlement schemes which impose no binding emission constraint on them.

40|$|Jordan {{faces an}} archetypal {{combination}} of high water scarcity, with {{a per capita}} water availability of around 150 m 3 per year significantly below the absolute scarcity threshold of 500 m 3, and strong population growth, especially due to the Syrian refugee crisis. A transition to more sustainable water consumption patterns will likely require Jordan’s water authorities to rely more strongly on water demand management in the future. We conduct {{a case study of}} the effects of pricing policies, using an agent-based model of household water consumption in Jordan’s capital Amman, in order to analyze the distribution of burdens imposed by demand-side policies across society. Amman’s households face highly intermittent piped water supply, leading them to supplement it with water from storage tanks and informal private tanker operators. Using a detailed data set of the distribution of supply durations across Amman, our model can derive the demand for additional tanker water. We find that integrating these different supply sources into our model causes demand-side policies to have strongly heterogeneous effects across districts and income groups. This highlights the importance of a disaggregated perspective on water policy impacts in order to identify and potentially mitigate <b>excessive</b> <b>burdens...</b>|$|E
