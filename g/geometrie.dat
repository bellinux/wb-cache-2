25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, a {{fruitful}} collaboration between Serre and the two-years-younger Alexander Grothendieck led to important foundational work, {{much of it}} motivated by the Weil conjectures. Two major foundational papers by Serre were Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents (FAC), on coherent cohomology, and <b>Géometrie</b> Algébrique et <b>Géométrie</b> Analytique (GAGA).|$|E

25|$|In 1854, Gauss {{selected}} the topic for Bernhard Riemann's Habilitationvortrag, Über die Hypothesen, welche der <b>Geometrie</b> zu Grunde liegen. On {{the way home}} from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.|$|E
25|$|Legendre uses {{a similar}} {{construction}} in Éléments de <b>géométrie,</b> but taking X {{to be the}} midpoint of BC. The proof is similar but side-side-side must be used instead of side-angle-side, and side-side-side is not given by Euclid until later in the Elements.|$|E
25|$|The inspiring <b>Geometrie</b> der Lage (1847) of Karl Georg Christian von Staudt {{provided}} Segre {{with another}} project. He encouraged Mario Pieri {{to make a}} translation, Geometria di Posizione (1889), while Segre composed a biographical sketch of von Staudt that {{was included in the}} publication.|$|E
25|$|Von Staudt's <b>Geometrie</b> der Lage (1847) {{was a much}} admired text on {{projective}} geometry. In 1889 Pieri translated it as Geometria di Posizione, {{a publication}} that included {{a study of the}} life and work of von Staudt written by Corrado Segre, the initiator of the project.|$|E
25|$|Descartes made {{significant}} progress with the methods {{in an essay}} titled La <b>Geometrie</b> (Geometry), {{one of the three}} accompanying essays (appendices) published in 1637 together with his Discourse on the Method for Rightly Directing One's Reason and Searching for Truth in the Sciences, commonly referred to as Discourse on Method.|$|E
25|$|Fundamental {{groups also}} appear in {{algebraic}} geometry {{and are the}} main topic of Alexander Grothendieck's first Séminaire de <b>géométrie</b> algébrique (SGA1). A version of van Kampen's theorem appears there, and is proved along quite different lines than in algebraic topology, namely by descent theory. A similar proof works in algebraic topology.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{he wrote}} Applications d'analyse et de <b>géométrie,</b> {{which served as}} an {{introduction}} to his earlier work Traité des propriétés projectives des figures. It was published in two volumes in 1862 and 1864. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1865.|$|E
25|$|René Descartes {{published}} La <b>Géométrie</b> (1637), {{aimed at}} reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems, giving algebra a more foundational role (while the Greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line). Descartes' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, x is {{commonly}} used as the name for an independent variable or unknown value. The modern tradition of using x to represent an unknown was introduced by René Descartes in La <b>Géométrie</b> (1637). As {{a result of its}} use in algebra, X is often used to represent unknowns in other circumstances (e.g. X-rays, Generation X, The X-Files, and The Man from Planet X; see also Malcolm X).|$|E
25|$|Jean-Victor Poncelet (1 July 1788 – 22 December 1867) was a French {{engineer}} and mathematician who served most notably as the Commanding General of the École Polytechnique. He {{is considered a}} reviver of projective geometry, and his work Traité des propriétés projectives des figures is considered the first definitive text on the subject since Gérard Desargues' work {{on it in the}} 17th century. He later wrote an introduction to it: Applications d’analyse et de <b>géométrie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Melik's 1867 {{arithmetic}} {{course was}} highly popular, going through ten reprints. He {{followed up with}} other textbooks and introductory courses: Despre moneta română ("On the Romanian Currency", 1868); Elemente de <b>Geometrie</b> ("Elements of Geometry", 1869, ten reprints); Elemente de Topografie ("Elements of Topography", 1879, four reprints). From 1883 to 1888, Melik, Culianu and Constantin Climescu put out the magazine Recreații Științifice ("Scientific Recreations"), considered a direct precursor of the more prestigious Gazeta Matematică.|$|E
25|$|Around 1958 Serre {{suggested}} that isotrivial principal bundles on algebraic varieties – those that become trivial after pullback by a finite étale map – are important. This acted as one {{important source of}} inspiration for Grothendieck to develop étale topology and the corresponding theory of étale cohomology. These tools, developed in full by Grothendieck and collaborators in Séminaire de <b>géométrie</b> algébrique (SGA) 4 and SGA 5, provided the tools for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures by Pierre Deligne.|$|E
25|$|The {{adjective}} Cartesian {{refers to}} the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes who published this idea in 1637. It was independently discovered by Pierre de Fermat, who also worked in three dimensions, although Fermat did not publish the discovery. Both authors used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' La <b>Géométrie</b> was translated into Latin in 1649 by Frans van Schooten and his students. These commentators introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes' work.|$|E
25|$|Plücker died in 1868, {{leaving his}} book on the {{foundations}} of line geometry incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete {{the second part of}} Plücker's Neue <b>Geometrie</b> des Raumes, and thus became acquainted with Alfred Clebsch, who had moved to Göttingen in 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the following year, along with visits to Berlin and Paris. In July 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a short time, he served as a medical orderly in the Prussian army before being appointed lecturer at Göttingen in early 1871.|$|E
25|$|Carol I, {{the newly}} crowned King of Romania, again rewarded Melik's services: in February 1884, Monitorul Oficial {{published}} {{news that the}} mathematician had been made Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania; when later errata informed Melik that he was merely a Knight of that company, he {{refused to accept the}} award altogether. Melik was still an active popularizer on scientific topics, publishing, in 1885, a surveying and ballistics tract: Equerulu grafometru sau quadrantulu de campania al D-lui Colonel de Artilerie A. Costiescu ("The Graphometer or Campaign Quadrant of the Artillery Colonel A. Costiescu"). In 1888, he issued three new textbooks: Arithmetic for 3rd- and 4th-graders, Geometry for the primary course, and a Curs practic de <b>Geometrie</b> elementară ("Practical Course in Elementary Geometry").|$|E
25|$|The Jewish {{mathematician}} Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi (12th century, Spain) authored {{the first}} European book {{to include the}} full solution to the general quadratic equation. His solution was largely based on Al-Khwarizmi's work. The writing of the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298 AD) is the first known one in which quadratic equations with negative coefficients of 'x' appear, although he attributes this to the earlier Liu Yi. By 1545 Gerolamo Cardano compiled the works related to the quadratic equations. The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by Simon Stevin in 1594. In 1637 René Descartes published La <b>Géométrie</b> containing the quadratic formula in the form we know today. The first appearance of the general solution in the modern mathematical literature appeared in an 1896 paper by Henry Heaton.|$|E
25|$|All {{the work}} {{related to the}} Parallel Postulate {{revealed}} that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing so. Careful examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid's reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, {{there was a clear}} need for a new set of axioms, which would be complete, and which in no way relied on pictures we draw or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as Hilbert's axioms, were given by David Hilbert in 1894 in his dissertation Grundlagen der <b>Geometrie</b> (Foundations of Geometry). Some other complete sets of axioms had been given a few years earlier, but did not match Hilbert's in economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms.|$|E
25|$|François Viète's work on new algebra at {{the close}} of the 16th century was an {{important}} step towards modern algebra. In 1637, René Descartes published La <b>Géométrie,</b> inventing analytic geometry and introducing modern algebraic notation. Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a determinant was developed by Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa in the 17th century, followed independently by Gottfried Leibniz ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using matrices. Gabriel Cramer also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. Permutations were studied by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in his 1770 paper Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in which he introduced Lagrange resolvents. Paolo Ruffini was the first person to develop the theory of permutation groups, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{properties}} of surfaces of revolution were known already to Archimedes. The development of calculus {{in the seventeenth}} century provided a more systematic way of proving them. Curvature of general surfaces was first studied by Euler. In 1760 he proved a formula for the curvature of a plane section of a surface and in 1771 he considered surfaces represented in a parametric form. Monge laid down the foundations of their theory in his classical memoir L'application de l'analyse à la <b>géometrie</b> which appeared in 1795. The defining contribution to the theory of surfaces was made by Gauss in two remarkable papers written in 1825 and 1827. This marked a new departure from tradition because for the first time Gauss considered the intrinsic geometry of a surface, the properties which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. The crowning result, the Theorema Egregium of Gauss, established that the Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant, i.e. invariant under local isometries. This point of view was extended to higher-dimensional spaces by Riemann and led to what is known today as Riemannian geometry. The nineteenth century was the golden age for the theory of surfaces, from both the topological and the differential-geometric point of view, with most leading geometers devoting themselves to their study. Darboux collected many results in his four-volume treatise Théorie des surfaces (1887–1896).|$|E
