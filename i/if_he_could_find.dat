5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Paul Stoddart {{stated that}} he would sell Minardi <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the right buyer. Stoddart claimed that he had 41 approaches. His {{criterion}} for a sale was {{the ability of a}} buyer to move the team forward and leave the team based in Faenza. The drinks manufacturer Red Bull, which already owned another Formula One team, Red Bull Racing, decided to set up a second team to promote American drivers that have risen through its young driver programme, Red Bull Driver Search.|$|E
25|$|Honner set {{out with}} Sergeant T. G. Pryor and three privates to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> water in A Company's area around Koram. At around 15:00, they {{came across a}} banana plantation, and saw troops moving around in it. They assumed that they were from A Company, but when they {{approached}} they were fired on, and Honner and Pryor were both wounded. Pryor, wounded in the throat and chest, attempted to drag Honner, who {{was wounded in the}} thigh and could not move easily, but Honner ordered him to return to get help. Private W. H. G. remained to protect Honner; the other two privates accompanied Pryor.|$|E

25|$|Moore {{was born}} on February 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the eldest of four {{children}} born to Harold, Sr. and Mary (Crume) Moore. His father was an insurance agent whose territory covered western Kentucky {{and his mother was}} a homemaker. Because he was interested in obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York and felt his chances were better if he was located in a larger city, he left Kentucky at the age of seventeen before finishing high school and got a job in Washington, D.C. working in the U.S. Senate book warehouse. Moore finished high school at night while working days and graduated from St. Joseph Preparatory School in Bardstown with the class of 1940. Moore attended George Washington University at night for two years, working at his warehouse job while waiting on an appointment to West Point. During his time at George Washington University he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation authorizing each senator and representative additional appointments to the military and naval academies, Moore was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Representative Ed Creal (4th District, Kentucky) but Moore had no desire to go to the Naval Academy. Moore asked Creal <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> another congressman that would trade his Military Academy appointment for Creal's Naval Academy appointment would he be agreeable to that arrangement. Creal agreed, and Moore soon found Representative Eugene Cox of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, with an open appointment to West Point. Cox was impressed with Moore's tenacity and he left Cox's office with the West Point appointment.|$|E
500|$|By June 1961, Hand {{was in a}} wheelchair. He {{joked that}} he felt idle because he had taken part in no more than about 25 cases that year, {{and that he would}} start another job <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> one. The {{following}} month, he suffered a heart attack at Cornish. He was taken to St Luke's Hospital in New York City, where he died peacefully on August 18, 1961. The New York Times ran a front-page obituary. The Times of London wrote: [...] "There are many who will feel that with the death of Learned Hand the golden age of the American judiciary has come to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] {{was written}} by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins and Jason Sellers. According to Sellers, they were at Jenkins' house when they started {{composing}} the song. He explained, [...] "We just {{wanted to write a}} love song. We had an idea of what we were targeting. We didn’t write it as a duet. We wrote it, and Andy thought about recording it. After we got the song written, we played it for Jason. Jason Aldean's idea for it was to make it a duet." [...] The song is the first duet that Aldean has recorded. In an interview with Nashville.com, Aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet. Nevertheless, he and producer Michael Knox thought the lyrics would work for two people <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a female artist as a duet partner. Aldean considered a number of female vocalists to record the song with, especially Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. However, Clarkson remained as his first choice. He explained, ...|$|E

500|$|Axelrod {{composed}} Song of Innocence in {{one week}} and began recording in mid-1968. He recorded the album at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and enlisted his close-knit group of veteran studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer. He had worked with them when producing sessions for other recording artists. Axelrod did not play any instruments on Song of Innocence; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33players to perform his notated charts. He {{had learned how to}} read and orchestrate complex music charts from jazz musicians during the 1950s. Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and organ on the record. Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary Igor Stravinsky. [...] "That way the sounds don't seem to go all over the place", he later said. [...] "Music seems so small in a studio." [...] Axelrod originally wanted some of the album's compositions to feature a large-scale choir but was uncertain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the appropriate ensemble, so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each section of the score.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland Indians {{owner and}} team {{president}} Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, {{which had been}} informally segregated {{since the turn of}} the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues. Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, reported Doby's off-field behavior was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect. But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, [...] "One afternoon when the team trots out on the field, a Negro player will be out there with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Van Gogh's {{thoughts}} returned {{several times}} to the painting by Eugène Delacroix of Torquato Tasso in the madhouse. [...] After a visit with Paul Gauguin to Montpellier to see Alfred Bruyas's collection in the Musée Fabre, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, asking <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> {{a copy of the}} lithograph after the painting. [...] Three and a half months earlier, he had been thinking of the painting {{as an example of the}} sort of portraits he wanted to paint: [...] "But it would be more in harmony with what Eugène Delacroix attempted and brought off in his Tasso in Prison, and many other pictures, representing a real man. Ah! portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that is what I think must come." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} that the king, by {{the aid of the}} saint Shaikh Ahmad Khattu, called up the prophet Elijah or Khidr, and from him got leave to build a city <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> four Ahmads who had never missed the {{afternoon}} prayer. A search over Gujarat yielded two, the saint was the third, and the king the fourth. The four Ahmads are said to have been helped by twelve Babas; these were Baba Khoju, Baba Laru, and Baba Karamal, buried at Dholka Baba Ali Sher and Baba Mahmud buried at Sarkhej a second Baba Ali Sher who used to sit stark naked; Baba Tavakkul buried in the Nasirabad suburb, Baba Lului buried in Manjhuri, Baba Ahmad Nagori buried near the Nalband mosque, Baba Ladha buried near the Halim ni Khidki, Baba Dhokal buried between the Shahpur and Delhi gates, Baba Sayyid buried in Viramgam.

2500|$|In early 1932, May was {{involved}} in another manhunt, this time for Albert Johnson, soon known as the [...] "Mad Trapper of Rat River." [...] While serving a search warrant for illegal trapping on the Rat River, Constable King of the RCMP was shot and wounded by Johnson, sparking off a long chase that became front-page news across the continent. Johnson killed Constable Edger Millen. May was again hired to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> Johnson, who had seemingly disappeared. On February 13, May solved the mystery when he noted a set of footprints leading off from caribou tracks {{in the middle of}} the frozen river. Johnson had been following their tracks to hide his own, but had to strike off the path to set up camp at night. Following the trail over the next few days, the RCMP rounded a bend on the river on February 17 to find Johnson {{in the middle of the}} trail again, unable to dodge for the bank without his snowshoes on. A firefight broke out during which one of the RCMP officers was seriously wounded and Johnson killed. May arrived just after the action ended. He landed beside the injured officer and flew him [...] to a doctor and was credited with saving his life.|$|E

2500|$|On the August 23 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Slater {{interrupted}} {{the introduction of}} the new WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship. Daniel Bryan and Shane McMahon offered Slater a [...] SmackDown contract <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a partner and win the tag team title tournament. After struggling to find a partner, former opponent Rhyno approached Slater and agreed to be his partner, this would slowly transition Slater to a fan favorite {{for the first time since}} 2010. Slater and Rhyno defeated the Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) in the first round and The Hype Bros (Zack Ryder and Mojo Rawley) in the semifinals to advance to the final match at Backlash. At the pay-per-view, Slater and Rhyno defeated The Usos to become the inaugural SmackDown Tag Team Champions, with Slater winning his first championship in the WWE in over 5 years, with his last championship win back at 2011. With the win, Slater also earned a contract. They were nicknamed [...] "Beauty and the Man Beast". On the September 13 episode of SmackDown, Slater and Rhyno defeated The Ascension to successfully retain the titles in their first defense following Slater's official live contract signing. On October 9 at No Mercy, Slater and Rhyno successfully defended the titles against The Usos. On the October 11 episode of SmackDown, Slater and Rhyno saved Dolph Ziggler from being attacked by The Miz and The Spirit Squad. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler, Slater and Rhyno were defeated by The Miz and The Spirit Squad in a six-man tag team match. On the October 25 episode of SmackDown, Slater and Rhyno would retain their titles against The Spirit Squad. At Survivor Series, Slater and Rhyno were the team captains for Team SmackDown in the 10–on–10 Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match, where they were defeated by Team Raw. At , Slater and Rhyno's reign came to an end at 84 days after they were defeated by Randy Orton and Bray Wyatt.|$|E
2500|$|Sergeant Buckland {{had given}} {{evidence}} on 3 March {{that he had}} investigated Dala and his evidence was so disparaging to Gribble's claims for the site that Commissioner Wood visited Dala on the 14th to see for himself. From what he found, Wood had no hesitation in declaring Buckland unreliable and less than candid with the commission and confirmed Gribble's account. The rainy season was late and the ash and footprints were still present and clearly visible (the first rain of the season fell {{the day after the}} Commission left). Sergeant Buckland had claimed that when he visited the site he found no evidence of a police camp, Wood found the site strewn with empty food cans and tobacco tins which he regarded as evidence of a police camp. A partially burnt tree surrounded by ash was peppered with what Gribble claimed were bullet scars but which Buckland had testified were marks made by stones or other blunt objects. Recalled by Wood, Buckland admitted that one of the marks had been a bullet scar and that Quartpot, a police tracker, had later dug a bullet from it which Wood asked to be produced. Constable Donegan, who had taken possession of the bullet, had said that he was not certain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> it, however it was found and given to Wood. Later, Inspector Douglas said that the bullet looked like a [...]44, the same caliber as the police issue Winchester although lighter in weight, but stated that it would be impossible for a bullet to pass through a human body and lodge in a tree behind it. Green noted that the Winchester rifle was a popular model carried by travelers in the area and that bullets extracted from trees in the Kimberley did not necessarily come from police rifles. At the subsequent trial of Regan and St Jack, Buckland repeated his testimony that there was no police camp at Dala, the tree scars had been made by a stone and the recovery of the bullet was never brought up.|$|E
