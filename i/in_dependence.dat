Methods: Serum albumin and prealbumin of 44 COPD patients using breathing machine> 48 h were tested at admission, 1 week, 2 weeks treatment. According to the existence of ventilator dependence, divided the patients into the ventilator dependence group and the ventilator independence group, compare the albumin, prealbumin average of two groups, evaluate {{the correlation between the}} serum albumin, prealbumin and ventilator <b>dependence</b> <b>in</b> patients with COPD. Results: Albumin levels reduced in both groups after 1 week treatment, but there was no statistically significant difference.

Prealbumin levels in the ventilator independence group after 1 week treatment didn’t reduced, but reduced <b>in</b> the ventilator <b>dependence</b> group, the difference was statistically significant.

40|$|Correlation effects arising during liquid {{infiltration}} into hydrophobic porous medium are considered. On {{the basis}} of these effects a mechanism of energy absorption at filling porous medium by nonwetting liquid is suggested. In accordance with this mechanism, the absorption of mechanical energy is a result expenditure of energy for the formation of menisci in the pores on the shell of the infinite cluster and expenditure of energy for the formation of liquid-porous medium interface in the pores belonging to the infinite cluster of filled pores. It was found that <b>in</b> <b>dependences</b> on the porosity and, consequently, <b>in</b> <b>dependences</b> on the number of filled pores neighbors, the thermal effect of filling can be either positive or negative and the cycle of infiltration-defiltration can be closed with full outflow of liquid. It can occur under certain relation between percolation properties of porous medium and the energy characteristics of the liquid-porous medium interface and the liquid-gas interface. It is shown that a consecutive account of these correlation effects and percolation properties of the pores space during infiltration allow to describe all experimental data under discussion...|$|R

However, loops in real application programs are often arbitrarily nested. Moreover, compilers are often unable to determine <b>dependence</b> distances. <b>In</b> contrast, our algorithms generate synchronization code based directly on array subscripts and do not require constant distances <b>in</b> data <b>dependences.</b> The algorithms are designed for arbitrarily nested loops, including triangular or trapezoidal loops. ...|$|R
