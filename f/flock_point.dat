50|$|Many of {{the towns}} European residents, excited by the {{prospect}} of a battle, formed picnic parties and <b>flocked</b> to vantage <b>points</b> on the nearby hills to obtain a good view of events. They were confident that the French would win, and expected Tamsui to be in French hands by nightfall.|$|R
5000|$|Paranormal enthusiasts <b>flock</b> to <b>Point</b> Pleasant {{in search}} of Mothman, a {{creature}} {{said to be a}} harbinger of imminent disaster that inhabits an abandoned TNT factory from World War II. John Keel published a book in 1975 entitled The Mothman Prophecies, and a film inspired by the novel was released in January 2002. Later, another film, loosely based on the legend, was also released. The town is host to a Mothman Museum, and every year it holds a Mothman Festival that features tours, pageants, balls, films, music, and other events to celebrate what they consider [...] "one of Point Pleasant’s largest tourist attractions." ...|$|R

[...] Tamsui {{had a large}} foreign population at this period, {{and many of the}} town's European residents formed picnic parties and <b>flocked</b> to vantage <b>points</b> on the nearby hills to watch the unfolding battle.|$|R
60|$|As they crept round a <b>point</b> <b>flocks</b> {{of ducks}} left {{the water and}} the air throbbed with a beat of wings that {{gradually}} died away. The fire, round which the others sat, was out of sight, and the rustle of the tossing birches emphasized the quietness. Charnock let the canoe drift, and Sadie looked up at him from her low seat among the wagon robes he had brought.|$|R
5000|$|The {{notion of}} [...] "birds of a feather <b>flock</b> together" [...] <b>points</b> out that {{similarity}} {{is a crucial}} determinant of interpersonal attraction. Studies about attraction indicate that people are strongly attracted to lookalikes in physical and social appearance ("like attracts like"). This similarity is in the broadest sense: similarity in bone-structure, characteristics, life goals and physical appearance. The more these points match, the happier people are in a relationship (Folkes, 1982, Wilson et al., 2006).|$|R

"And I've succeeded {{beyond my}} hopes, for here you are, a steady, {{sensible}} businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying up {{the blessings of}} the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my <b>flock,</b> I'll just <b>point</b> to you, and say 'There's your model, my lads'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{being on}} the run and with a price on his head, Plunkett refused to leave his <b>flock.</b> At some <b>point</b> before his final incarceration, he took refuge in a church that once stood in the townland of Killartry, in the parish of Clogherhead in County Louth, seven miles outside Drogheda. He was arrested in Dublin in December 1679 and imprisoned in Dublin Castle, where he gave {{absolution}} to the dying Talbot. Plunkett was tried at Dundalk for conspiring against the state by allegedly plotting to bring 20,000 French soldiers into the country, and for levying a tax on his clergy to support 70,000 men for rebellion. Though this was unproven, some in government circles were worried {{about the possibility that}} a repetition of the Irish rebellion of 1641 was being planned and in any case this was a convenient excuse for proceeding against Plunkett. Lord Ormonde, aware that Lord Essex was using the crisis to undermine him, did not defend Plunkett in public. In private however he made clear his belief in Plunkett's innocence and his contempt for the informers against him: [...] "silly drunken vagabonds... whom no schoolboy would trust to rob an orchard".Plunkett did not object to facing an all-Protestant jury, but the trial soon collapsed as the prosecution witnesses were themselves wanted men and afraid to turn up in court. Lord Shaftesbury knew Plunkett would never be convicted in Ireland, irrespective of the jury's composition, and so had Plunkett moved to Newgate Prison in London in order to face trial at Westminster Hall. The first grand jury found no true bill, but he was not released. The second trial has generally been regarded as a serious miscarriage of justice; Plunkett was denied defending counsel (although Hugh Reily acted as his legal advisor) and time to assemble his defence witnesses, and he was also frustrated in his attempts to obtain the criminal records of those who were to give evidence against him. His servant James McKenna, and a relative, John Plunkett, had travelled back to Ireland and failed within the time available to bring back witnesses and evidence for the defence. During the trial, Archbishop Plunkett had disputed the right of the court to try him in England and he also drew attention to the criminal past of the witnesses, but to no avail. Lord Chief Justice Sir Francis Pemberton addressing these complaints said to Plunkett: [...] "Look you, Mr. Plunket, it is in vain for you to talk and make this discourse here now..." [...] and later on again: [...] "Look you, Mr. Plunket, don't mis-spend your own time; for the more you trifle in these things, the less time you will have for your defence".|$|R
40|$|The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) {{system was}} used as a basis for {{describing}} a methodology for the management of reproduction in small ruminant flocks. The seven principles of the HACCP system are: 1. Conduct a hazard analysis 2. Identify critical control points 3. Establish critical limits for each control point 4. Establish monitoring procedure 5. Establish corrective actions 6. Establish a record keeping procedure 7. Establish verification procedures. The first principle of HACCP requires a description of the production system. The small ruminant reproduction process was subdivided into four sub-processes with a total of 33 phases. The ewe management cycle consists of 12 phases and the ram management cycle, replacement ewe cycle and replacement ram cycle each consists of seven phases. The reproductive process was described by a flow diagram. The hazards were categorized as management, environmental, nutritional, genetic, predatory, physiological and disease factors that could affect reproductive performance. The second principle requires the establishment of Critical Control Points (CCP). Seventeen CCPs in the reproductive process were established and monitoring and diagnostic procedures for each of the critical control points was described together with suggested corrective actions. The resulting HACCP plan formed the basis of consultations with 30 commercial small stock enterprises. Each of the Critical Control Points was applied to at least three and up to 30 of the flocks over the period of the trial to establish the practicality and validity of the procedures which were described as standard operating procedures. Data forms were designed for the structured collection of data regarding the process as well as the CCPs. The Critical Control Points and forms that were selected in this project were as follows: CC 1. Ewe selection. Prior to Ewe preparation. Ewe selection data form CC 2. Ram selection. Prior to Phase two of ram preparation. Ram selection data form CC 3. Ewe preparation. Prior to start of mating (end of flushing period). Ewe preparation data form CC 4. Ram preparation. Prior start of mating (end of flushing period). Ram preparation data form CC 5. Joining. Start of mating period. Joining data form CC 6. Mating. End of mating period. Mating data form CC 7. Scan. > 35 days after mating. Scan data form CC 8. Rescan. ≥ 30 days after initial scanning. Rescan data form CC 9. Pregnant. Prior to start of lambing. Pregnancy management data form CC 10. Lambing. End of lambing period. Lambing data form CC 11. Marking. After neonatal period. Marking data form CC 12. Weaning. Separation of lambs from ewes. Weaning data form CC 13. Ewe replacement. At ewe selection. Replacement maiden data form CC 14. Ram replacement. At ram selection. Replacement ram data form CC 15. Genital soundness. Prior to ram selection. Ram genital soundness data form CC 16. Ram recovery. About 8 weeks after mating. Ram recovery data form CC 17. Last day of lambing. About 146 days after end of joining. Last day of lambing data form. In addition to the specific procedures described in the seventeen CCP's three CCP's were described that can be performed to assist in monitoring the general health and welfare of the <b>flock</b> at strategic <b>points</b> in the management cycle: CC 18 Body condition score CC 19 Helminthic status CC 20 Nutritional status. Qualitative aspects of the critical control point as well as certain quality control questions were described as a generic quality control form. This generic form is modified annually to reflect hazard issues that need to be followed up the following year. Specific questions are entered on the form which is diarised for the next year. The use of these generic forms assisted in the process of continuous improvement by ensuring that adjustments to the Flock Health and Production Plan are made to prevent repeating management failures. Examples of the use of the CCP's are described on the basis of data that was collected from the flocks that participated in the project. Upon conclusion a questionnaire was completed by 12 / 25 of the flock managers who participated. The results of the survey indicated that there was general acceptance of a HACCP – based management system for the management of reproduction in the small ruminant enterprises by the flock managers that responded to the questionnaire. Flock managers agreed that the program must be adapted to their individual needs, would not be a problem to implement but needed to be simple and many would need assistance. Training and information was considered important aspects. There was general consensus that financial results should form part of the program and that comparisons within the group on an anonymous basis is accepted. The two responses that showed the least variance were the needs to reduce production risk and to be informed of potential hazards. Flock managers disagreed the most in their response about the range of control points they would implement. This correlates with the expressed need to have individually adapted programs. Flock managers were not very positive about the benefits of a quality control and certification system. Predation proved {{to be the most important}} hazard followed by parasites and stock theft, all three being highly variable as indicated by a large variance. The HACCP-based methodology should be applied in and extended form to all aspects of the flock production system to assist in improving sustainability.
