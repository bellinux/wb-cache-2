On 5 October 1945 the Army Council took the decision to retain the ACC {{as an integral part}} of the post war Army. The Corps then went from strength to strength.

50|$|Berlocq {{struggled}} to adapt his level from the Futures and Challengers to the ATP main level events {{and has to}} date achieved only limited success on the ATP, however his first win was significant. In the ATP Masters Series event in Miami Berlocq defeated the much-hyped American <b>junior</b> and wildcard <b>entrant</b> Donald Young 6-0, 6-0. Both Berlocq and Young had never won a match on the ATP and this win was achieved on hardcourt which is not Berlocq's favoured surface. After defeating Young, Berlocq then played American James Blake and lost this match, 0-6, 0-6, therefore creating an unusual achievement of winning his first ATP-level match 6-0, 6-0 and then losing by the same scoreline in the next round.|$|R
