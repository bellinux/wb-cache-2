50|$|Residential {{dwellings}} {{almost always}} take supply {{from the low}} voltage distribution lines or cables that run past the dwelling. These operate at voltages of between 110 and 260 volts (phase-to-earth) depending upon national standards. A few decades ago small dwellings would be fed a single phase using a dedicated two-core service cable (one core for the active phase and one core for the neutral return). The active line would then be run through a main <b>isolating</b> <b>switch</b> in the fuse box and then split into one or more circuits to feed lighting and appliances inside the house. By convention, the lighting and appliance circuits are kept separate so the failure of an appliance does not leave the dwelling's occupants in the dark. All circuits would be fused with an appropriate fuse based upon the wire size used for that circuit. Circuits would have both an active and neutral wire with both the lighting and power sockets being connected in parallel. Sockets would also be provided with a protective earth. This would {{be made available to}} appliances to connect to any metallic casing. If this casing were to become live, the theory is the connection to earth would cause an RCD or fuse to trip—thus preventing the future electrocution of an occupant handling the appliance. Earthing systems vary between regions, but in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia both the protective earth and neutral line would be earthed together near the fuse box before the main <b>isolating</b> <b>switch</b> and the neutral earthed once again back at the distribution transformer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For {{experiments}} to be reproducible, {{it is important}} to have a known and controlled environment. This requires isolation from the surroundings. For security experiments, e. g. with hostile software, this is even more important as the experiment can affect the environment in adverse ways. In a normal campus laboratory, isolation can be achieved by network separation. For an online environment, where remote access is essential, full separation is not possible, and therefore the security implications must be carefully considered. In this paper, a way to enable remote experiments is described, where users are given full control over the computer installation. Automating the install procedure and dynamically creating isolated experiment networks provide remote users with the tools needed to do experiments in a reproducible and secure environment. The installation is done by automatically installing prepared clone images, which contains a hard drive representation, to the machines own hard drive. When an experiment starts, the machines in the experiment are automatically booted and placed on an <b>isolated</b> (<b>switched)</b> network. This way experiments are isolated from each other. By using firewall techniques, connections from outside the laboratory can only be made from the user’s machine into his/her experiment.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of natural resources}} and renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) energy, has been highlighted for global energy solution. The PV power control unit in the PV power-generation technology requires a high step-up DC–DC converter. The conventional step-up DC–DC converter has low efficiency and limited step-up ratio. To overcome these problems, a novel high step-up DC–DC converter using an <b>isolated</b> <b>switched</b> capacitor cell is proposed. The step-up converter uses the proposed transformer and employs the switched-capacitor cell to enable integration with the boost inductor. The output of the boost converter and isolated switched-capacitor cell are connected in series to obtain high step-up with low turn-on ratio. A hardware prototype with 30 V to 40 V input voltage and 340 V output voltage is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed converter. As an extended version, another novel high step-up isolated switched-capacitor single-ended DC–DC converter integrated with a tapped-inductor (TI) boost converter is proposed. The TI boost converter and isolated-switched-capacitor outputs are connected in series to achieve high step-up. All magnetic components are integrated in a single magnetic core to lower costs.

40|$|Hybrid {{systems are}} a {{powerful}} formalism for modeling and reasoning about cyber-physical systems. They mix the continuous and discrete natures {{of the evolution}} of computerized systems. Switched systems are a special kind of hybrid systems, with restricted discrete behaviours: those systems only have finitely many different modes of (continuous) evolution, with <b>isolated</b> <b>switches</b> between modes. Such systems provide a good balance between expressiveness and controllability, and are thus in widespread use in large branches of industry such as power electronics and automotive control. The control law for a switched system defines the way of selecting the modes during the run of the system. Controllability is the problem of (automatically) synthezing a control law in order to satisfy a desired property, such as safety (maintaining the variables within a given zone) or stabilisation (confinement of the variables in a close neighborhood around an objective point). In order to compute the control of a switched system, we need to compute the solutions of the differential equations governing the modes. Euler's method is the most basic technique for approximating such solutions. We present here an estimation of the Euler's method local error, using the notion of " one-sided Lispchitz constant " for modes. This yields a general control synthesis approach which can encompass several features such as bounded disturbance and compositionality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} field {{distribution in the}} Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) gas chamber {{is an important factor}} for the design of GIS structure. The {{electric field}} distribution in the GIS gas chamber should be uniform as far as possible, to avoid excessive concentration of the electric field causing the occurrence of flashover and discharge in GIS. The electric field intensity in the gas chamber is higher than its dielectric’s isolating strength when SF 6 /N 2 mixed gas is used as the insulation dielectric of the gas chamber to reduce the consumption of pure SF 6, and the research in this paper aim to solve this problem. Electric-filed numerical analysis and optimal design of GIS gas chamber structure have been done in this paper. The GIS gas chamber 3 D model is built in Solidworks, and finite element analysis of the model is calculated in ANSYS. Electric field numerical calculation for the gas chamber model is calculated based on the theory of electrostatic field. The calculation results show that the electric field intensities of <b>isolated</b> <b>switch,</b> earthing switch and insulation rod are excessive high, and the optimizations for its internal structure are necessarily followed, then calibrating calculations of electric field are carried on the optimized model. The calculating results convey that the electric field intensity in gas chamber decreased significantly, and the maximum value of electric field intensity is lower than the dielectric strength of alternative gas. It means that the alternative gas can meet the insulation requirements for the gas chamber after optimization...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the fourth variable (V 4) region of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) in virus infection has not been well clarified, though the polymorphism of this region {{has been found to}} be associated with disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In the present work, we focused on the correlation between HIV- 1 gp 120 V 4 region polymorphism and the function of the region on virus entry, and the possible mechanisms for how the V 4 region contributes to virus infectivity. Therefore, we analyzed the differences in V 4 sequences along with coreceptor usage preference from CCR 5 to CXCR 4 and examined the {{importance of}} the amino acids within the V 4 region for CCR 5 - and CXCR 4 -tropic virus entry. In addition, we determined the influence of the V 4 amino acids on Env expression and gp 160 processing intracellularly, as well as the amount of Env on the pseudovirus surface. The results indicated that V 4 tended to have a shorter length, fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS), greater evolutionary distance, and a lower negative net charge when HIV- 1 <b>isolates</b> <b>switched</b> from a coreceptor usage preference for CCR 5 to CXCR 4. The N- and C-terminals of the HIV- 1 V 4 region are highly conserved and critical to maintain virus entry ability, but only the mutation at position 417 in the context of ADA (a R 5 -tropic HIV- 1 strain) resulted in the ability to utilize CXCR 4. In addition, 390 L, 391 F, 414 I, and 416 L are critical to maintain gp 160 processing and maturation. It is likely that th...|$|R
