40|$|International audienceBackground: Prisons in Madagascar are at {{high risk}} of plague outbreak. Occurrence of plague {{epidemic}} in prisonscan cause significant episode of urban plague through the movement of potentially infected humans, rodents andfleas. Rodent and flea controls are essential in plague prevention, by reducing human contact with plaguereservoirs and vectors. Insecticide treatment is the key step available for the control of <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> which transmit thedisease from infected rodents to human. The implementation of an adapted flea control strategy should rely on theinsecticide susceptibility status of the targeted population. For the purpose of plague prevention campaign inprisons, we conducted insecticide resistance survey on Xenopsylla cheopis, the <b>rat</b> <b>flea.</b> Methods: Fleas were collected on rats caught in six prisons of Madagascar. They were exposed to insecticidetreated filter papers and mortality was recorded following World Health Organization protocol. Results: The fleas collected in the prisons had different resistance patterns, while a high level of resistance toinsecticides tested was described in the Antanimora prison, located in the heart of Antananarivo, the capital ofMadagascar. Conclusions: This finding is alarming in the context of public health, knowing that the effectiveness of flea controlcould be jeopardized by insecticide resistance. In order to establish more accurate <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> control in prisons, themain recommendations are based on continuous monitoring insecticide susceptibility of flea, insecticide rotation,and {{the development of a new}} method for flea control...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} first three {{documented}} cases of murine typhus imported into Europe from Indonesia, discuss clues for the diagnosis of the disease, and urge that murine fever {{be considered in the}} diagnosis of febrile disease in travelers. One of the oldest recognized, most common, but least reported arthropod-transmitted zoonoses (1, 2), murine virus is caused by Rickettsia typhi, formerly named R. mooseri, a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium (1, 2). The main vector of murine typhus is the <b>rat</b> <b>flea</b> Xenopsylla cheopis, which maintains R. typhi in rodents. Flea bites and contamination of excoriated skin or the respiratory tract with infected flea feces are the major sources of human infection throughout the world (2). The classic reservoir and vector are the <b>rat</b> and <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> respectively (2); however, the role of cat fleas and opossums in maintaining this microorganism has been suggested in some areas of the United States where <b>rats</b> and <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> are absent (2, 3). Although murine typhus has a worldwide distribution, it is often unrecognized, and documented cases are rarely reported, particularly in tropical countries. Three recent cases of murine typhus in 2 months in patients returning to Europe from Indonesia indicate that murine typhus should be considered a possible cause of imported fever from Indonesia. Case 1 In October 1997, a 29 -year-old man living in France was hospitalized with a 2 -day history of fever. On admission, his temperature was 40 °C and his pulse, at 70 /min, was dissociated.

40|$|Abstract New {{findings}} on the geographical distribution and ecto- and endoparasites of Rattus norvegicus, Rattus rattus, and Mus musculus were recorded in 1999 - 2000. Seven specimens of R. rattus were trapped in the coastal plain of Israel, six of these in the Haifa area and one in Tel Aviv. Up to this record, the coastal plain was known to harbor only R. norvegicus. An adult R. norvegicus was trapped in Jerusalem, a new record of this species inland. The <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> Xenopsylla cheopis, is a parasite of R. norvegicus in Israel, and its known geographical distribution was, till now, the coastal plain. X. cheopis is the vector of murine typhus, a few cases of which are recorded each year only in the coastal plain. One specimen of R. norvegicus trapped in Tel Aviv was infested with a single X. cheopis. This level of infestation of 0 - 1 <b>fleas</b> per <b>rat</b> is {{in accordance with the}} infestation index recorded in Israel {{since the beginning of the}} 1980 s. One specimen of X. cheopis was recorded on the R. norvegicus trapped in Jerusalem, possibly indicating a changing distribution pattern of the <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> together with the invasion of R. norvegicus to the inland areas. The most worrying finding was 31 <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> recorded on a single R. norvegicus in the Lod area. Such a high infestation level has not been observed in Israel since the 1960 s, posing a threat to public health. Only a few mite specimens were found on both rat species. A large population of rat lice, Polyplax spinulosa, was found on R. rattus from the village of Yesodot.
