40|$|This Working Paper {{is one of}} {{a series}} {{representing}} work under an SERC grant on queue management strategies for urban traffic control systems whose objectives are:- (i) to generalise the strategies developed in an earlier study of queue management, (ii) to develop a computer graphics based representation of queue propagation and management; (iii) to test the strategies' applicability and performance in UK networks; (iv) to investigate their incorporation into standard signal optimisation programs. Clark (1991) in WP 343 describes the graphics model developed at ITS as a queue-management tool for traffic engineers. In order to calibrate the model, and later implement a suitable queue management strategy recommended by the model, a small oversaturated urban traffic network was required. Six possible sites in the West Yorkshire region were suggested by HETS (West Yorkshire <b>Highway</b> <b>Engineering</b> and Technical <b>Services)</b> for consideration. Wellington Street in Leeds city centre was identified as the most suitable being a linked series of three signalized junctions where blocking-back was commonplace, parking violations were minimal and an adequate filming position was available...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{application}} of suitable techniques for detecting outliers and suggesting estimates for missing values in various forrns of traffic count data. The data {{used in this study}} came from three sources. The first set was provided by the Department of Transport's (DOT) regional office in Leeds and consists of automatic hourly traffic counts at four sites. The second set {{was part of a larger}} database provided by West Yorkshire <b>Highways,</b> <b>Engineering</b> and Technical <b>Services</b> (HETS). This set consists of automatic half hourly traffic counts on a single site. The third and final set was provided by Nottinghan University and consists of automatic five minute traffic counts at 40 locations, in close proximity to each other, from Leicester. Three suitable techniques emerged from pilot studies of such series conducted by Watson et a 1 (1992 a) and Redfern et a 1 (1992). The three techniques are: a) Maintaining an average and variability measure over time; b) ARIMA modelling with detection of large residuals; C) A point's influence on the correlation structure of the series. A fourth technique, by-eye detection and estimation, provides an intuitive comparison for the first three techniques...|$|R

40|$|Keywords:Transient {{vibration}} signals;Highway engineering;Subgrade;Degree of compaction;Detection Abstract:In {{order to}} be able to maintain the safety,stabilize the operation, and prolong the <b>service</b> life of <b>highway</b> <b>engineering,</b> it is necessary to place particular emphasis on the detection of <b>highway</b> <b>engineering.</b> In view of the current imperfection existed in operation techniques of cutting-ring method and sand replacement method. This paper puts forward to a kind of non-destructive detection method for <b>highway</b> <b>engineering</b> based on transient vibration signals. The author makes a detailed analysis and discussion on the main principle and application of the detection method. In highway construction project, especially the implementation process of the highway construction project, roadbed compaction degree is taken as one of the key indicators to measure the quality of the <b>highway</b> <b>engineering</b> construction project,which arouses the concern and attention of contractor and user.

50|$|The first {{research}} {{dedicated to}} <b>highway</b> <b>engineering</b> was initiated in the United Kingdom {{with the introduction}} of the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), in 1930. In the USA, <b>highway</b> <b>engineering</b> became an important discipline with the passing of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which aimed to connect 90% of cities with a population of 50,000 or more. With constant stress from vehicles which grew larger as time passed, improvements to pavements were needed. With technology out of date, in 1958 the construction of the first motorway in Great Britain (the Preston bypass) {{played a major role in}} the development of new pavement technology.|$|R
