5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
25|$|Along with Jimmy and Bachchan, Pooja {{comes out}} of the water too. She had been hiding in their trunk the whole time. She tells them that she has hidden the money in seven {{different}} places across India. Jimmy and Pooja decide to run away with the money. The duo decide that Pooja should seduce Bachchan <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> did Jimmy. She tries to seduce him but finds out that they are each other's childhood loves, and they both fall in love. After recovering all of the money, Bachchan decides to leave with it, not knowing that Jimmy has replaced the money with stones.|$|E
25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> did before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E

500|$|Lhermitte's last {{victim was}} her eldest daughter, Yasmin. The mother called over Yasmin {{and told her}} she had a {{surprise}} for her, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had done with Myriam. Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house. Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013 {{interview}} {{following the}} announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in [...] of the Star Wars series.

She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [...] I just think she would be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle." [...] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said {{the same day that}} Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> {{did before}} on her {{previous}} projects Sugar & Spice and Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1, Harrison served as executive producer for K.I.S.S which entailed her scouting the producers, songwriters, arranging the album track listing, and {{keeping track of}} the accounting. Her fifth studio album Sugar & Spice was catered more to Japan's distinct sound and market, but approaching K.I.S.S., she wanted to make a classic Mýa album even if it meant digging deeper into her pockets. K.I.S.S. has a balance of mid-tempos, up-tempos, slow jams and great production. [...] "As fun as this album is, there's also lots of substance to be discovered lyrically, without getting bored or depressed", she described. In an interview with 4Eight Media, she said, [...] "The creative process was a combination of including songs that I had in my archive for years in addition to travelling across the U.S. and Jamaica to work with different producers and artists. She chose the songs that best worked together sonically & arranged the track listing of the album accordingly." [...] Harrison used a few songs on the album that have existed in her archive {{for a couple of years}} that finally found the appropriate place to reside. The entire album with the new material took her about 5 months to assemble & complete. Between October 2010 & February 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Kahlo's {{paintings}} often feature root imagery {{with roots}} {{growing out of}} her body to tie her to the ground, reflecting in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and finally in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for either good and/or ill. In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth, and her own sense of unity with Mexico itself. In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations. Additionally, hair features {{as a symbol of}} growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off. Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her and/or a threat to harm her own body <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves. Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors serve as a symbol of a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to [...] "cut up" [...] women, both metaphorically and literally. In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, and as a woman, Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo.|$|E
