Out of the spyware samples Norton detected, {{a significant number}} were not removed completely, requiring manual removal. Norton also <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to prevent spyware infections.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{another small}} group of Australian volunteers also served {{in a number of}} {{operations}} in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission, although these missions were mainly aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India, and they also <b>did</b> <b>little</b> fighting.|$|E

5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, {{they agreed that}} Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new {{civilian}} government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio <b>did</b> <b>little.</b> Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to political opponents and lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive without it.|$|E
5|$|As the Norse era {{drew to a}} {{close the}} Norse-speaking princes were {{gradually}} replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of Barra. This transition <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of the 10 February 1942 the German {{flotilla}} prepared to undertake their operation. As they slipped anchor RAF bombers appeared over head. The German ships conducted a u-turn and sped back to the dock. The RAF bombers released their bombs but <b>did</b> <b>little</b> damage. Fortunately they did not notice anything untoward.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the liberation}} of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis <b>did</b> <b>little</b> for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was {{spending}} {{most of his time}} in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first time. Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1966 {{until the}} end of 1967, President Johnson {{continued}} to dole out sensitive targets one by one to the generals while simultaneously trying to placate the doves in Congress and within his own administration with periodic cutbacks and half-hearted peace initiatives. In the end, this erratic course satisfied no one and <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to alter the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|More {{recordings}} {{as leader}} ensued following Hope's return to New York, but they <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced {{the frequency of}} his public performances, which ended a year before his death, {{at the age of}} 43. He remains little known, despite, or because of, the individuality of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.|$|E

When they tried again on 22 March, they were attacked by Russian coastal defence guns that had been transferred there, and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay.

5|$|Overcrowding and {{shortages}} of equipment in England {{meant that it}} was decided to keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter, during which time they would undertake further training in order to prepare them for their eventual use in the trenches in France. Despite this, however, the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received in this time could only be considered very rudimentary in nature, and despite popular opinion at the time, it <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to prepare them for what was to come.|$|E
5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E

5|$|The {{criticism}} <b>did</b> <b>little</b> {{to dissuade}} Etty from attempting {{to reproduce the}} success of Cleopatra, and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens {{for almost a}} year before {{returning}} to Twentieth Century-Fox on loan and appearing as Henry M. Stanley in Stanley and Livingstone, his only film of 1939.

In October of that year, a Fortune magazine survey to find the nation's favorite movie actor listed Tracy in first place.|$|E

Gilchrist scored 118 in the First Test against New Zealand and an unbeaten 83 in the Third Test in Perth as the Australians held on for a draw with three wickets intact. However, Gilchrist <b>did</b> <b>little</b> in the triumph over South Africa, failing to pass 35. He ended the summer Tests with 353 runs at 50.42.|$|E

5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his {{dissatisfaction with the}} position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and <b>did</b> <b>little</b> to change the political culture in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's education would be difficult on a congressman's low salary. He left office on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist.
