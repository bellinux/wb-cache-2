5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have <b>ever</b> <b>felt).</b> Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{was born}} in Dayton, Ohio, the fifth child of Bill and Bess (Lee) Clemens. He is of German descent, his {{great-grandfather}} Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated {{when he was an}} infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> envious of other players was when he saw them in the clubhouse with their fathers. Clemens lived in Vandalia, Ohio, until 1977, and then spent most of his high school years in Houston, Texas. At Spring Woods High School, Clemens played baseball for longtime head coach Charles Maiorana and also played football and basketball. He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Minnesota Twins during his senior year, but opted to go to college.|$|E
25|$|Rod {{sticking}} {{has been}} attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, bearing wear, clutch wear, and drive mechanism seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like bearing and clutch wear) would only apply to a movement performed by the control rod drive mechanism. Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine if there had been any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> a control rod stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.|$|E

500|$|Burton was {{impressed}} with Anton Furst's designs in The Company of Wolves, and previously failed to hire Furst as production designer for Beetlejuice. Furst had been too committed on High Spirits, a choice he later regretted. Furst enjoyed working with Burton. [...] "I don't think I've <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> so naturally in tune with a director", he said. [...] "Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Do You..." [...] {{is built}} around gentle guitar {{strumming}} and a playful rhythm section, featuring a walking bassline and double-time drums. Chris Kelly of Fact categorizes it as an atmospheric pop rock song, while Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press calls it [...] "a mellow R outtake". The song begins with an echoed haze and acoustic guitar, with Miguel asking, [...] "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> alone?" [...] It is then followed by a euphoric vocal reverb that leads to blasting drums, and Miguel asks [...] "Do you like drugs" [...] over a smooth guitar riff.|$|E

The 54-win Lakers faced the 40–42 Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs, where Houston upset the Lakers 2–1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3.|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, The Daily Telegraph {{placed the}} title on its top ten {{list of the}} most overrated films. Telegraphs Tim Robey stated, [...] "It's a {{criminal}} failing of the movie that it purports to be about people’s dreams being invaded, but demonstrates no instinct at all for what a dream has <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> like, and no flair for making us feel like we're in one, at any point." [...] The film won an informal poll by the Los Angeles Times as the most overrated movie of 2010.|$|E
500|$|During 2006, Higgins {{lived in}} Broome, Western Australia for six months, {{away from the}} {{entertainment}} industry. The relaxed lifestyle helped her focus on writing new material. The landscape made a big impression, [...] "It was the first place I'd <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country" [...] and inspired her to write [...] "Going North". She then toured the United States and South Africa, writing more material on the road. In September she based herself in Los Angeles to record her second album, On a Clear Night, with producer Mitchell Froom. [...] "Steer" [...] was released as an EP, followed a fortnight later by its album on 28 April 2007, both debuted at No.1 on their respective charts.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the break began, Stump was the {{heaviest}} {{he had ever been}} and loathed the band's image as an [...] "emo" [...] band.

[...] Wentz, who had been abusing Xanax and Klonopin, was divorced by his wife Ashlee Simpson and returned to therapy. [...] "I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day," [...] Wentz recalled.

I started thinking – like, being old would be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, {{you have to}} be careful that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at the suggestion of Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{appointed}} a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making Ian Crook first-team coach and John Deehan chief scout. However, the initial turnaround in form {{could not be}} maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the Championship. Gunn labelled his players as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] after the 4–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years, Writing in Tales from the City, Gunn said of the match [...] "Even going to Charlton on the last day, I thought we could survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them how sorry I was." ...|$|E

500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because I knew there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins looked up at the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It dawned on me how small we are, how short life is ... I felt so liberated to have finally figured that out." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?' The only other record I <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|Bustles Tracy Dye wrote that, in {{addition}} to [...] "7 Lessons About Life & Facing Fear", the song also reinforces the importance of pursuing other opportunities, the belief that [...] "material items don't lead to fulfillment", building new relationships and friendships, exploring new environments, {{and the concept of}} girl power. BuzzFeed's Aylin Zafar described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "an anthem for anyone who has <b>ever</b> <b>felt</b> they were on the outside, looking into a place ... that they yearned to be a part of." [...] The Daily Dots Aja Romano believes that the ballad mirrors [...] "every young girl’s wish to get away from her over-protective parents and explore the world", a sentiment shared by Rebecca Rose of Cosmopolitan who dubbed it [...] "every young girl's lament about wanting to be part of something she idolizes." [...] Donna Dickens of HitFix concurred that the song's lyrics are about [...] "yearning to break free from suffocating parental expectations". Writing for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song about [...] "fantasizing over living a life you can’t," [...] to which he believes many people are able to relate. Derrick Gill of KXKX believes that the song is also based around the traditional saying [...] "Is the grass greener on the other side?" ...|$|E
