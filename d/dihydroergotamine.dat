These attacks can be succesfully treated with acute medications. Those include triptans, ergotamins, <b>dihydroergotamines,</b> and NSAID. The objective of this thesis was {{the details of the}} strategy of migraine treatment. In addition, other things will be discussed: pathophysiology, and clinical signs of migraine, specific and non-specific therapy, treatment of status migreneous, surgical and alternative therapy. The most common used therapy of migraine is analgesic, ergotamines, triptans and NSAID.

5000|$|The area of {{intranasal}} medication delivery {{provides a}} huge opportunity for research - both for specifically developed pharmaceutical drugs designed for intranasal treatment, {{as well as}} for investigating off label uses of commonly available generic medications. Nasal sprays for local effect are quite common. Steroids, antiasthma medications such as salbutamol, ipratropium, montelukast and a large number of inhalational anaesthetic agents are being used commonly. The recent developments in intranasal drug delivery systems are prodigious. Several antimigraine drugs, available by the trade names of Imitrex- sumatriptan; Zomig - Zolmitriptan; Migranal - <b>Dihydroergotamine</b> and the OTC nasal spray Sinol-M; are also currently administered by nasal administration because a fast effect is desired and oral administration can be prohibited by nausea. Peptide drugs (hormone treatments) are also available as nasal sprays, in this case to avoid drug degradation after oral administration. The peptide analogue desmopressin is, for example, available for both nasal and oral administration, for the treatment of diabetes insipidus. The bioavailability of the commercial tablet is 0.1% while that of the nasal spray is 3-5% according to the SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics). Syntocinon nasal spray containing oxytocin is used to increase duration and strength of contractions during labour. Intranasal oxytocin is also being actively investigated for many psychiatric conditions including alcohol withdrawal, anorexia nervosa, PTSD, autism, anxiety disorders, pain sensation and schizophrenia. Intranasal Calcitonin, calcitonin-salmon is used to treat Hypercalcaemia arising out of malignancy, Paget's disease of bone, post menopausal and steroid induced osteoporosis, Phantom limb pain and other metabolic bone abnormalities, available as Rockbone, Fortical and Miacalcin Nasal Spray. GnRH analogues like nafarelin and busurelin are used for the treatment of anovulatory infertility, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, delayed puberty and cryptorchidism. Other potential drug candidates for nasal administration include anaesthetics, antihistamines (Azelastine), antiemetics (particularly metoclopramide and ondansetron) and sedatives that all benefit from a fast onset of effect. Intranasal midazolam is found to be highly effective in acute episodes of seizures in children. Recently, {{the upper part of the}} nasal cavity, as high as the cribriform plate, has been proposed for drug delivery to the brain. This [...] "transcribrial route" [...] published first in 2014 was suggested by the author (Baig AM. et al,) for drugs to be given for Primary Meningoencephalitis [...] Naloxone is used intravenously in opiate addiction in emergency cases, in rapid opiate detoxification, and as a diagnostic tool. The nasal drug administration of naloxone was found to be as effective as the intravenous route. In opioid overdoses, where hypotension and sometimes damaged veins make intravenous administration difficult, nasal naloxone offers a wide margin of safety and reduced risk of infection from vessel puncture while enabling even untrained bystanders to assist a victim. The prevention of abnormal nasal blood vessel growth (Avastin) and even the delivery of medications and drug antidotes such as hydroxocobalamin (antidote to cyanide poisoning) are being developed via intranasal medications. More recently interest is developing on delivery of a number of peptides and other drugs to the nose for direct transport into the brain to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Intranasal insulin is being investigated for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. IN ketamine, commonly being used for the treatment of breakthrough pain in patients with chronic pain is now becoming an area of significant research interest for the treatment of bipolar disease and major depressive disorder with early results suggesting a strong and prolonged antidepressant effect following a single subdissociative dose (50 mg) of ketamine.|$|E

We studied the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in six migraineurs and six control subjects at rest and during acute glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks using positron emission tomography with the novel radioligand (11) C-dihydroergotamine, which is chemically identical to pharmacologically active <b>dihydroergotamine.</b> The influx rate constant Ki, average dynamic image and time activity curve were assessed using arterial blood sampling and served as measures for receptor binding and thus blood-brain barrier penetration. At rest, there was binding of (11) C-dihydroergotamine in the choroid plexus, pituitary gland, and venous sinuses as expected from the pharmacology of <b>dihydroergotamine.</b> However, there was no binding to the brain parenchyma, including the hippocampus, the area with the highest density of the highest-affinity <b>dihydroergotamine</b> receptors, and the raphe nuclei, a postulated brainstem site of action during migraine, suggesting that <b>dihydroergotamine</b> is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. This binding pattern was identical in migraineurs during glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks as well as in matched control subjects. We conclude that (11) C-dihydroergotamine is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier interictally or ictally demonstrating that the blood-brain barrier remains tight for <b>dihydroergotamine</b> during acute glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine {{on the blood}} {{pressure}} of anaesthetized rats depended on the dose and the initial level of blood pressure. At medium blood pressure levels, 5 -hydroxytryptamine gave a depressor response and sometimes a pressor response which was more evident with large doses. The depressor effect was less apparent or even absent at low, and more pronounced at high, blood pressure levels, and the converse applied to the pressor components. Adenosine also gave a depressor and pressor response.

40|$|Renal {{proximal}} tubular {{cells have}} been shown to express aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-AAAD), which converts L-dopa into dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptophan [(OH) Trp] into 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT; serotonin). Because 5 -HT receptors have been demonstrated in proximal cells, we hypothesized that 5 -HT may act as an autocrine/paracrine modulator of proximal transport. We evaluated this possibility in opossum kidney (OK) cells, a renal epithelial cell line with a proximal phenotype expressing 5 -HT 1 B receptors, and in intact anaesthetized rats. 5 -HT synthesis by OK cells increased with incubation time and (OH) Trp concentration, and was abolished by benserazide, an L-AAAD inhibitor. 5 -HT reversed parathyroid hormone (PTH) -induced cAMP accumulation in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner and reduced the PTH inhibition of P(i) uptake without affecting the NaP(i) - 4 mRNA level. The effects of 5 -HT on cAMP generation and Na-P(i) co-transport were reproduced by (OH) Trp, except in the presence of benserazide, and by L-propranolol and <b>dihydroergotamine,</b> two 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists. In rats, (OH) Trp and <b>dihydroergotamine</b> decreased fractional P(i) excretion. Benserazide abolished the effect of (OH) Trp but not that of <b>dihydroergotamine.</b> In conclusion: (i) locally generated 5 -HT blunts the inhibitory effect of PTH on Na-P(i) co-transport in OK cells; (ii) endogenous 5 -HT decreases P(i) excretion in rats; and (iii) 5 -HT is a paracrine modulator involved in the physiological regulation of renal P(i) transport...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{antimigraine}} drugs ergotamine and sumatriptan {{may cause}} angina-like symptoms, possibly resulting from coronary artery constriction. We compared the coronary vasoconstrictor {{potential of a}} number of current and prospective antimigraine drugs (ergotamine, <b>dihydroergotamine,</b> methysergide and its metabolite methylergometrine, sumatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, avitriptan). METHODS AND RESULTS: Concentration-response curves to the antimigraine drugs were constructed in human isolated coronary artery segments to obtain the maximum contractile response (Emax) and the concentration eliciting 50 % of Emax (EC 50). The EC 50 values were related to maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported in patients, obtaining Cmax/EC 50 ratios as an index of coronary vasoconstriction occurring in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we studied the duration of contractile responses after washout of the acutely acting antimigraine drugs to assess their disappearance from the receptor biophase. Compared with sumatriptan, all drugs were more potent (lower EC 50 values) in contracting the coronary artery but had similar efficacies (Emax < 25 % of K+-induced contraction). The Cmax of avitriptan was 7 - to 11 -fold higher than its EC 50 value, whereas those of the other drugs were < 40 % of their respective EC 50 values. The contractile responses to ergotamine and <b>dihydroergotamine</b> persisted even after repeated washings, but those to the other drugs declined rapidly after washing. CONCLUSIONS: All current and prospective antimigraine drugs contract the human coronary artery in vitro, but in view of low efficacy, these drugs are unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia at therapeutic plasma concentrations in healthy subjects. In patients with coronary artery disease, however, these drugs must remain contraindicated. The sustained contraction by ergotamine and <b>dihydroergotamine</b> seems to be an important disadvantage compared with sumatriptan-like drugs...|$|E

40|$|Between 1085 and 1927, {{epidemics}} of convulsive ergotism were widespread {{east of the}} Rhine in Europe due {{to consumption}} of grain contaminated with ergot, which is produced by the fungus Claviceps purpurea. West of the Rhine, consumption of ergot-contaminated food caused epidemics of gangrenous ergotism. The clinical features of convulsive ergotism-muscle twitching and spasms, changes in mental state, hallucinations, sweating, and fever lasting for several weeks-suggest serotonergic overstimulation of the CNS (ie, the serotonin syndrome). The ergot alkaloids are serotonin agonists. <b>Dihydroergotamine</b> binds to serotonin receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which {{is the site of}} neuropathological changes in convulsive ergotism. <b>Dihydroergotamine</b> given to human beings can cause the serotonin syndrome. Ergots produced by different strains of Claviceps purpurea, and those growing in different soils, may have different ergot alkaloid compositions. An alkaloid, present in high concentrations in ergots from east of the Rhine, may have caused convulsive ergotism at a circulating concentration insufficient to produce peripheral ischaemia.

40|$|It was {{previously}} shown that porcine cranial arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) constrict to 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), ergotamine, <b>dihydroergotamine,</b> {{as well as}} sumatriptan and that sumatriptan acts exclusively via 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors. The present study was devoted to establish the contribution of 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors in the constriction of AVAs elicited by 5 -HT (in presence of 0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 ketanserin), ergotamine and <b>dihydroergotamine</b> in anaesthetized pigs. Intracarotid infusion of 5 -HT (2 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1) and intravenous doses of ergotamine (2. 5 – 20 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and <b>dihydroergotamine</b> (3 – 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) reduced AVA and increased nutrient blood flows and vascular conductances. The vasodilator response to 5 -HT, observed mainly in the skin and ear, was much more prominent {{than that of the}} ergot alkaloids. Treatment with the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist GR 127935 (0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) significantly attenuated both ergot-induced AVA constriction and arteriolar dilatation, whereas GR 127935 only slightly affected the carotid vascular effects of 5 -HT. The results suggest that 5 -HT constricts carotid AVAs primarily via receptors, which seem to differ from those (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D) stimulated by sumatriptan. The ergot alkaloids produce AVA constriction for a substantial part via 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors, but also stimulate unidentified receptors. Both these non- 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors may be targets for the development of novel antimigraine drugs. The moderate vasodilator response to the ergot derivatives seems to be mediated, at least in part, by 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors, whereas the arteriolar dilatation caused by 5 -HT may be mediated by other, possibly 5 -HT 7 receptors...|$|E
