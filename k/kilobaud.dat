25|$|The type of {{modulation}} used {{is normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK is used on the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 ms long and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA time slots in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as time-division multiplexing. Small guard periods are used between time slots.

2500|$|Early {{reviews of}} Temple of Apshai praised the game's {{graphics}} and unusual complexity, while criticizing long loading times and slow screen build-up for the dungeon graphics. Compute! stated that Temple of Apshai for the PET [...] "is {{for anyone who}} is tired of simple 'video games' ... is quite an experience". It advised readers {{to be aware that}} [...] "this is a serious game. Be prepared to THINK". Jerry Pournelle in BYTE called it [...] "an excellent real-time dungeon game", and later reported that his sons had [...] "nearly worn out the Dungeons of Apshai". <b>Kilobaud</b> Microcomputing criticized the long load times, but liked the game's graphics and [...] "excellent" [...] documentation. PC Magazine stated that the IBM PC version did not fully exploit the computer's graphics capability, but that players [...] "will find excitement and entertainment ... it's certainly worth the silver to grab this game for the PC". The magazine was also favorable towards Upper Reaches of Apshai, which it called [...] "better than Temple of Apshai in some ways". Popular Science called Temple of Apshai [...] "a good example of a graphic adventure game", but also stated that in it and other games like it [...] "the play seems to drag" [...] because [...] "it takes time to draw the pictures". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave Temple of Apshai an overall B rating, concluding that it was [...] "an excellent game, one that's very involving", and gave the same grade to Hellfire Warrior and Curse of Ra.|$|E

The earliest and the slowest but still common 4N35 opto-isolator, for example, has {{rise and fall}} times of 5 μs into a 100 Ohm load and its bandwidth is limited at around 10 kilohertz - sufficient for applications like electroencephalography or pulse-width motor control. Devices like PC-900 or 6N138 recommended in the original 1983 Musical Instrument Digital Interface specification allow digital data transfer speeds of tens of <b>kiloBauds.</b> Phototransistors must be properly biased and loaded to achieve their maximum speeds, for example, the 4N28 operates at up to 50 kHz with optimum bias and less than 4 kHz without it.|$|R

5000|$|In 1979 Russell Sipe {{left the}} Southern Baptist Convention ministry. A fan of {{computer}} games, he realized in spring 1981 {{there was no}} magazine dedicated to computer games. Although Sipe had no publishing experience, he formed Golden Empire Publications in June and found investors. He chose the name of Computer Gaming World (CGW) instead of alternatives such as Computer Games or <b>Kilobaud</b> Warrior because he hoped that the magazine would both review games {{and serve as a}} trade publication for the industry.

5000|$|Wayne Green, {{the creator}} of many {{magazines}} such as 73, founded 80 Microcomputing as a spinoff of his <b>Kilobaud</b> Microcomputing solely for Tandy Corporation's Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I microcomputer.

5000|$|The term 'nibble' {{originates}} {{from its}} representing 'half a byte', with 'byte' a homophone of the English word 'bite'.In 2014, David B. Benson, {{a professor emeritus}} at Washington State University, remembered that he playfully used (and may have possibly coined) the term nibble as [...] "half a byte" [...] and unit of storage required to hold a binary-coded decimal (BCD) decimal digit around 1958, when talking to a programmer of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.The alternative spelling 'nybble' reflects the spelling of 'byte', as noted in editorials of <b>Kilobaud</b> and Byte in the early 1980s.Another early recorded {{use of the term}} 'nybble' was in 1977 within the consumer-banking technology group at Citibank. It created a pre-ISO 8583 standard for transactional messages between cash machines and Citibank's data centers that used the basic informational unit 'NABBLE'.|$|E
5000|$|Green {{added that}} {{although}} his company Instant Software had published [...] "hundreds {{of programs for}} the TRS-80 and want to translate {{as many as possible}} for use on the TI-99/4", it could not find anyone among more than 1,000 developers in its network who could port software to the computer, adding [...] "We understand the problems with the system and the efforts Texas Instruments made to make translation difficult". Rival companies were much more open with information. The next issue of <b>Kilobaud</b> Microcomputing reported that a Commodore executive promised that the forthcoming VIC-20 would have [...] "enough additional documentation to enable an experienced programmer/hobbyist to get inside and let his imagination work". IBM released complete software and hardware technical information for the Personal Computer when announcing it in 1981, stating that [...] "the definition of a personal computer is third-party hardware and software".|$|E
50|$|Appendix IV of G.961 {{specifies}} a {{line system}} based on echo cancellation and a substitutional 3B2T (SU32) line code, which maps three bits into 2 ternary symbols. As with MMS43 and AMI, the ternary symbol can either be a positive (+), zero (0), or negative (-) voltage. The mapping from 23=8 to 32=9 symbols leaves one unused symbol. When two subsequent input (binary) information words are identical, the (ternary) code word is substituted by the unused code word. A 0.75 ms frame carrying 108 bits of 2B+D data is mapped to 72 ternary symbols. To this frame, a 6-symbol preamble, one CRC symbol, and 2 symbols from the CL channel are added, yielding a frame size of 81 ternary symbols and a symbol rate of 108 <b>kilobaud.</b> The CL channel is used for supervisory and maintenance functions between the LT and NT1.

5000|$|Starting in 1978 Tandy/Radio Shack {{promoted}} {{itself as}} [...] "The Biggest Name in Little Computers". By 1980 InfoWorld described Radio Shack as [...] "the dominant supplier of small computers". <b>Kilobaud</b> Microcomputing estimated {{that it was}} selling {{three times as many}} computers as Apple Computer, with both companies ahead of Commodore. By 1981 hundreds of small companies produced TRS-80 software and accessories, and Adam Osborne described Tandy as [...] "the number-one microcomputer manufacturer" [...] despite having [...] "so few roots in microcomputing". Roach became Tandy's CEO that year, Leininger became director of strategic planning, and French founded a software company. Although selling computers did not change the company's [...] "schlocky" [...] image, the Radio Shack name embarrassed business customers, and Tandy executives disliked the [...] "Trash-80" [...] nickname for its products, by 1984 computers accounted for 35% of sales and the company had 500 Tandy Radio Shack Computer Centers.|$|E
5000|$|Wayne Green, the Publisher/Editor of <b>kilobaud,</b> {{had been}} the {{publisher}} of BYTE magazine, (another influential microcomputer magazine of the time) where he published the first four issues in his own office. But one day in November 1975 Wayne came to work, and found that his ex-wife {{and the rest of}} the Byte magazine staff had moved out of his office and had taken the January issue with them. Consequently, the January 1976 issue had Virginia Green listed as publisher instead of Wayne Green. Wayne was not happy with this development, so he left Byte to start a new magazine to compete with the fledging Byte. He wanted to call it [...] "KiloByte" [...] to trump Byte. But the people of Byte quickly trademarked KILOBYTE as a cartoon series in Byte magazine. So he named the new magazine [...] "kilobaud" [...] instead. The magazine was first published in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Appendix III of G.961 {{specifies}} a {{line system}} based on the Time Compression Multiplex (TCM) duplex method and an alternate mark inversion (AMI) line code. The AMI line code maps one input bit to one ternary symbol. Like with MMS43, the ternary symbol can either be a positive (+), zero (0), or negative (-) voltage. A 0 bit is represented by a zero voltage, while a 1 bit is alternatingly represented by a positive and a negative voltage, resulting in a DC-bias free signal. In a 2.5 ms interval, each side can send a 1.178 ms frame representing 360 bits of 2B+D data. To the 2B+D data, an 8-bit preamble, 8 bits from the CL channel, {{as well as a}} parity bit are added, yielding a frame size of 377 bits and a baud rate of 320 <b>kilobaud.</b> The CL channel is used for operations and maintenance, as well transmitting a 12-bit CRC covering 4 frames.|$|E
50|$|Legacy T1 {{carriers}} operated {{using the}} {{alternate mark inversion}} (AMI) line code, more recently also B8ZS, on two wire pairs. Each wire pair was operated in simplex, that is, one wire pair was used for transmission in each direction. The Nyquist frequency of a 1.544 megabaud signal is 772 kHz. Higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly than lower frequencies, motivating the use of technologies that reduce the signal bandwidth. In HDSL, full duplex by means of echo cancellation is used, enabling simultaneous transmission in both directions {{on each of the}} two wire pairs, effectively reducing the symbol rate by a factor two. Through the use of 2B1Q encoding, two bits are combined to one symbol, further reducing the symbol rate by a factor of two. For this two-pair 2B1Q variant of HDSL, framing increases the bitrate from 1.544 Mbit/s to 1.568 Mbit/s, resulting in a symbol rate of 392 <b>kilobaud</b> and a Nyquist frequency of 196 kHz.|$|E
