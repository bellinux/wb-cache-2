Herfindahl Hirschman IndexThis index is used in Europe and in the USA for antitrust regulatory purposes, in order to assess the feasibility of mergers and acquisitions.The HHI is calculated as the relative frequencies squared and summed, comprehensive of all actors in the playfield. So far, it gives more importance to biggest player in proportion. Even if interesting, a HHI, often wrongly assess the real behaviours on the field.Consider, for the comparison sake, the retail concentration in Europe. Top 5 retail distributors account for the 70% of the market share.

While a multitude of studies {{are related to the}} determination of concentration in the manufacturing industry, the literature is rather silent on concentration in various branches of the third sector. The analysis distinguishes between static and dynamic aspects of concentration. A variety of statistical tools is employed in order to render highly reliable results. The outcome gives some evidence in favor of the existence of a <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>market</b> for auditing services in Germany, both in absolute and relative terms. Compared to 1987 the findings indicate further increasing degrees of concentration since the "Bilanzrichtliniengesetz" and the extended auditing requirements incident thereto came into effect. ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{gasoline}} has {{a relatively}} inelastic demand, raising government revenue via gasoline taxes could appear appropriate as it entails {{a relatively small}} deadweight loss. However, gasoline retail is generally a <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>market,</b> hence the assumption of perfect competition when considering tax incidence might be misleading. Theoretically, in oligopolistic markets taxes can be shifted forward less (more) than proportionally to retail prices; a possibility usually denoted by undershifting (overshifting). Generally, this depends on unobservable parameters of the demand and cost functions. In this paper we device a novel empirical test, based on observables, to assess whether taxes are under- or overshifted in an oligopolistic market. The test depends on the interaction between market structure and taxes. We apply our test to the Canadian retail gasoline market using a panel data set of 10 cities, finding that gasoline taxes are undershifted...|$|E

Classical economic theory describes four different types of markets: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Each category demonstrates certain distinguishing characteristics with respect to pricing, technology, and customer service.

This paper will study the impact of market concentration as quantified by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index on fourteen electronic markets.

Furthermore, the paper provides the results demonstrating the relationship between market concentration and price, technology, and customer satisfaction.

40|$|By {{employing}} a Granger causality methodology in a panel data framework, {{this article explores}} the relationship among efficiency, capitalization and credit risk within the local Italian banking system. Focusing the attention on cooperative banks, we specifically test whether managers take more risks in <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>markets</b> (i. e. monopoly) than in partially competitive markets (i. e. duopoly). The evidence shows that in more <b>concentrated</b> <b>markets,</b> management efficiency generates a decrease in risk-taking (rejecting the bad management hypothesis) {{with respect to the}} partially competitive markets. Results are consistent with the idea that banks with less local competition are able to increase their profits by indulging more freely in rent-seeking behaviour, minimizing their risk-taking and, consequently, improving the quality of their assets through additional screening processes. The financial crisis does not seem to affect the conduct of management in terms of bank investment decisions and risk-taking. A series of robustness tests generally confirms our findings...|$|R
