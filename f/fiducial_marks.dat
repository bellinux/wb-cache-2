Vision systems in the stencil printing machines use these <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> for aligning the PWB. Without these fiducials the printer would not print the solder paste in exact alignment with the pads. There {{are two types of}} fiducials used namely global and local fiducials. Global fiducials align the printer to the PWB. Local fiducials are required for precise placement of fine pitched components, in the component placement stage. Local fiducial cannot be used in the printing process The entering PWB should have close dimensional tolerances so that it mates to the stencil. This is necessary to achieve the required alignment of solder blocks on the pads.|$|E

The photograph was taken on December 11, 1962, at 1832 GMT (pass 2512, camera I, frame 8) and was received at Point Mugu, Calif. via direct readout. The center-cross <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> is located approximately 80 mi. northeast of Albuquerque, N. Mex. near the crest of the Rockies. North is toward the top of the picture. At the time of this photograph a recent surge of Arctic air had invaded the Great Plains.

The quasi-stationary front separating the two air masses lay north-south along the eastern slope of the Rockies, nearly coincident with the well-defined western edge of the cloud band.

40|$|Abstract- The {{coherent}} signal averaging process requires an accurate {{estimation of the}} fiducial point in all beats to be averaged. The temporal cross-correlation between the detected beat and a template beat is the typical alignment method used with high-resolution ECG (HRECG) records. However, this technique does not produce a precise <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> in records with high noise levels. In this study, we propose a new alignment method based on the multi-scale cross-correlation between the wavelet transforms of the template and the detected beat, respectively. The wavelet and temporal methods were tested for several simulated records corrupted with white noise and electromyographic (EMG) noise of different RMS levels. The results indicate that wavelet alignment method produces a lower trigger jitter than the temporal method in all tests. We conclude that the proposed alignment method {{can be used in}} records with high noise levels, like those found in Holter HRECG systems...|$|R

50|$|Medical {{images that}} are {{obtained}} using technologies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are two-dimensional, planar, tomographic images of patient anatomy. Treatment modalities such as stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery operate in the three-dimensional space of the patient. Hence, the central problem with using CT, MRI or PET to guide stereotactic surgery or radiosurgery is the transfer of patient information from the two-dimensional coordinate system of the planar CT, MRI or PET image into the three-dimensional coordinate system of the stereotactic or radiosurgical instrument. The N-localizer provides an elegant {{solution to this problem}} by creating <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> or landmarks in each tomographic image. The N-localizer comprises a diagonal rod that extends from the top of one vertical rod to the bottom of a second vertical rod (Figure 1). This combination of rods creates two circles and one ellipse in a tomographic image. The ellipse moves away from one circle and towards the other circle as the image plane moves downward with respect to the N-localizer. Measuring the relative distances between the ellipse and the two circles permits calculation of the point where the image plane intersects the diagonal rod. The attachment of three N-localizers to a stereotactic instrument (Figure 2) permits calculation of three points where the image plane intersects the three diagonal rods (Figure 3). Because three points determine a plane in three-dimensional space, these three points of intersection determine the spatial orientation of the image plane relative to the stereotactic instrument. Hence, the spatial orientation of any patient anatomy that is seen in the planar image is also determined relative to the stereotactic instrument. Because the spatial orientation of the patient anatomy is determined unambiguously relative to the stereotactic instrument, patient information may be transferred from the two-dimensional coordinate system of the planar image into the three-dimensional coordinate system of the stereotactic instrument.|$|E

The forward model {{that is used to}} predict the light propagation is based on one generic anatomical MR scan. In both approaches we use this model MR-scan to translocate the position of the optical fiber grid from our experimental setup to the FEM model space.

40|$|Fabricating and {{measuring}} sub- 5 nanometer features brings to light several pressing issues in future semiconductor industry manufacturing and dimensional metrology. This dissertation presents a feasible process to create nanostructures using scanning probes with applications in dimensional metrology and nanomanufacturing processes. Using the lattice spacing of a crystal as the fundamental "ruler" or scale, sub 5 nm critical dimension reference standards {{can be created}} with atomic scale dimensional control. This technique relies on atomically sharp tips to provide robust imaging and patterning (nanolithography) capabilities. We have developed a comprehensive process to routinely produce high quality scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tips. The quality of STM tips are {{a critical factor in}} achieving reproducible patterning. A modified electrochemical etching method has been used to create sharp tips with preferred apex geometry. By using a field ion microscope (FIM), tip surfaces have been cleaned by field evaporation. Finally, a thermal ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) process is implemented to stabilize the atoms on the tip apex for improved performance. The process is also found to be capable of restructuring the apex to regain atomic resolution when tips fail during imaging or patterning. Silicon (100) samples with pre-patterned micrometer-size <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> are used as templates in this technique. The <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> are used as 2 D references to relocate the tip scanned area and the lithographic patterns. Large atomically-flat reconstructed (100) surfaces are obtained after a wet chemical cleaning process and a high temperature annealing process. After the high temperature annealing process, we observed reproducible step-terrace patterns formed on surfaces due to the <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks.</b> A kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation was used to study quantitatively the evolution of surface morphology under the influence of <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks.</b> Some of the key aspects, such as the electromigration effect and step permeability have been extensively studied. Hydrogen-passivated silicon (100) reconstructed surfaces are used to create nanopatterns by selective depassivation lithography. Optimized depassivation procedures enable us to fabricate patterns from the microscale to the atomic scale consistently using an UHV STM. To preserve and later enhance the nanopatterns, SiO 2 hard etch mask marks are formed by oxidizing the patterns using ambient humidity or gaseous oxygen.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if measurements of breast morphology computed from three-dimensional (3 D) stereophotogrammetry are equivalent to traditional anthropometric measurements obtained directly on a subject using a tape measure. 3 D torso images of 23 women ranged in age from 36 to 63 who underwent or were scheduled for breast reconstruction surgery were obtained using a 3 dMD torso system (3 Q Technologies Inc., Atlanta, GA). Two different types (contoured and line-of-sight distances) of a total of nine distances were computed from 3 D images of each participant. Each participant was photographed twice, first without <b>fiducial</b> points <b>marked</b> (referred to as unmarked image) and second with <b>fiducial</b> points <b>marked</b> prior to imaging (referred to as marked image). Stereophotogrammetry was compared to traditional direct anthropometry, in which measurements were taken with a tape measure on participants. Three statistical analyses were used to evaluate the agreement between stereophotogrammetry and direct anthropometry. Seven out of nine distances showed excellent agreement between stereophotogrammetry and direct anthropometry (both marked and unmarked images). In addition, stereophotogrammetry from the unmarked image was equivalent to that of the marked image (both line-of-sight and contoured distances). A lower level of agreement was observed for some measures because of difficulty in localizing more vaguely defined fiducial points, such as lowest visible point of breast mound, and inability of the imaging system in capturing areas obscured by the breast, such as the inframammary fold. Stereophotogrammetry from 3 D images obtained from the 3 dMD torso system is effective for quantifying breast morphology. Tools for surgical planning and evaluation based on stereophotogrammetry have the potential to improve breast surgery outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerned}} with a comparative study {{and implementation of}} Interior orientation manually and automatically for KFA- 1000. In manually method, firstly, we reproduced the image to its reduced size photographically from the original image to be measurable in a mono comparator from 30 * 30 cm to 23 * 23 cm which proceeds by measuring of photo coordinates of four pieces of KFA- 1000 photo. After computation, it was realized that geometric distortion due to photography is high so the chosen method {{is to make a}} photographic reproduction of the image in suitable pieces, measuring with traditional instruments and pining the pieces together before calculation. In the second method, we scanned the space photo and used digital image processing techniques in which CCF (Cross correlation Function) and BinaryCCF were used to approximate positioning followed by quadratic surface fitting for the purpose of precise fiducial centre determination. In both methods, we applied three types of transformation called Conformal, Affine and 2 D projective to the algorithms. The final results showed that we could achieve sub-pixel accuracy of nearly 10 micrometer for 25 micrometer pixel size image by using 2 D projective transformation which is approximately equal to the accuracy achieved in manual method. With respect to differences between aerial and KFA- 1000 photos, we considered those differences and applied them to the algorithms used in both fields (aerial and space) particularly different background at location of each <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> in KFA- 1000 which made us to resample a suitable template while in aerial photos backgrounds in any photo are similar with good contrast which guarantee the robustness of the algorithms. We also examined the effect of pre-processing techniques on the robustness of algorithm and took into account the results. 1...|$|R
