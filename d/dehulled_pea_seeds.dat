40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of steeping in different chemicals (Alum and Trona) on the proximate and functional properties of Pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> was studied. The seeds were steeped in different chemicals (Alum and Trona) with different concentrations and time intervals of 24 h and 48 h. The above treated seeds were then dehulled, dried and milled. Properties {{of the resulting}} flours were determined using standard methods and the result obtained were analyzed statistically. Results obtained showed that steeping improved the ease of <b>dehulling</b> pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> with optimum at 48 h without chemical. Increase in concentration of chemicals (Alum and Trona) increased fibre content being more effective with trona (3. 89 - 4. 92 %). Increase in concentration decreased protein (22. 1 - 19. 76 %), fat (1. 48 - 1. 23 %) and moisture content (12. 27 - 11. 33 %). This happened in all cases while it increased ash (3. 16 - 4. 12 %), fibre (3. 89 - 4. 92 %) and carbohydrates (61. 86 - 63. 03) in proximate analyses. Increase in chemical concentration increased wettability (198 sec- 411 sec), water absorption (1. 27 - 4. 16 ml/g) and decreased oil absorption (2. 55 - 1. 28 ml/g) except water absorption for 48 h (1. 65 - 2. 25 ml/g) which had a change in trend.

Protein feedstuffs also contained samples from less known plant feed materials for pigs and poultry, such as sainfoin seeds with hulls or <b>dehulled,</b> grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> and soybean by-product okara. Feed samples were analysed for dry matter, ash, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, neutral and acid detergent fibre, lignin, starch, sugars, amino acids, minerals, phytic acid, phytase activity and in vitro digestibilities according to Boisen and Fernàndez (1995, 1997) {{to predict the}} standardised ileal digestibility of amino acids (Boisen 2007). MTT, Agrifood Research Finland, analysed all the feed ingredients {{that were used in}} the feeding experiments throughout the ICOPP project.

40|$|As {{part of the}} EU Core Organic II {{research}} project ICOPP (Improved contribution of local feed to support 100 % organic feed supply to pigs and poultry), a feeding trial was conducted in which grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> were included in diets for weaned piglets. The grass pea is a hardy grain legume that produces protein-rich seeds, but due to its content of the neurotoxin ODAP, intensive feeding is risky. Since ODAP is water-soluble and susceptible to heat, hydrothermal treatment (=toasting) greatly reduces toxicity. In the feeding trial, four isocaloric diets with a similar lysine content were compared: A control diet, one diet containing 20 % raw grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds,</b> and two diets with toasted grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> (20 and 30 %, respectively; as fed basis). Including grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> in the diet had no significant influence on feed intake of the piglets. The body weight development of the piglets did not differ between the control diet and the two diets containing toasted grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds,</b> whereas including raw grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> had a significantly negative effect: Two weeks after weaning, piglets weighed significantly less than all other groups, and this difference became even more pronounced with time.

In this study, we used high-throughput RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analyses to examine the changes in gene expression during seed development in vegetable pea and grain pea, and compare the gene expression profiles of these two pea types. RNA-Seq generated 18. 7 G of raw data, which were then de novo assembled into 77, 273 unigenes with a mean length of 930 bp. Our results illustrate that transcriptional control during <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> development is a highly coordinated process. There were 459 and 801 genes differentially expressed at early and late seed maturation stages between vegetable pea and grain pea, respectively. Soluble sugar and starch metabolism related genes were significantly activated during the development of <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> coinciding {{with the onset of}} accumulation of sugar and starch in the seeds. A comparative analysis of genes involved in sugar and starch biosynthesis in vegetable <b>pea</b> (high <b>seed</b> soluble sugar and low starch) and grain <b>pea</b> (high <b>seed</b> starch and low soluble sugar) revealed that differential expression of related genes at late development stages results in a negative correlation between soluble sugar and starch biosynthetic flux in vegetable and grain <b>pea</b> <b>seeds.</b> RNA-Seq data was validated by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis for 30 randomly selected genes.

40|$|Abstract Background In <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> (Pisum sativum L.), the Def locus defines an abscission event {{where the}} seed {{separates}} from the funicle through the intervening hilum region at maturity. A spontaneous mutation at this locus {{results in the}} seed failing to abscise from the funicle as occurs in wild type peas. In this work, structural differences between wild type peas that developed a distinct abscission zone (AZ) between the funicle and the seed coat and non-abscission def mutant were characterized. Results A clear abscission event was observed in wild type <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> that were associated with a distinct double palisade layers at the junction between the seed coat and funicle. Generally, mature seeds fully developed an AZ, which was not present in young wild type seeds. The AZ was formed exactly below the counter palisade layer. In contrast, the palisade layers at the junction of the seed coat and funicle were completely absent in the def mutant <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> and the cells in this region were seen to be extensions of surrounding parenchymatous cells. Conclusion The Def wild type developed a distinct AZ associated with palisade layer and counterpalisade layer at the junction of the seed coat and funicle while the def mutant <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> showed non-abscission and an absence of the double palisade layers in the same region. We conclude {{that the presence of}} the double palisade layer in the hilum of the wild type <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> plays an important structural role in AZ formation by delimiting the specific region between the seed coat and the funicle and may play a structural role in the AZ formation and subsequent detachment of the seed from the funicle. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Coccidiosis {{caused by}} protozoans of genus Eimeria is a chicken {{parasitic}} disease of great economical importance. Conventional disease control strategies depend on vaccination and prophylactic use of anticoccidial drugs. Alternative solution {{to prevent and}} treat coccidiosis {{could be provided by}} passive immunization using orally delivered neutralizing antibodies. We investigated the possibility to mitigate the parasitic infection by feeding poultry with antibody expressing transgenic crop seeds. Results Using the phage display antibody library, we generated a panel of anti- Eimeria scFv antibody fragments with high sporozoite-neutralizing activity. These antibodies were expressed either transiently in agrobacteria-infiltrated tobacco leaves or stably in <b>seeds</b> of transgenic <b>pea</b> plants. Comparison of the scFv antibodies purified either from tobacco leaves or from the <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> demonstrated no difference in their antigen-binding activity and molecular form compositions. Force-feeding experiments demonstrated that oral delivery of flour prepared from the transgenic <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> had higher parasite neutralizing activity in vivo than the purified antibody fragments isolated from tobacco. The <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> content was found to protect antibodies against degradation by gastrointestinal proteases (> 100 -fold gain in stability). Ad libitum feeding of chickens demonstrated that the transgenic seeds were well consumed and not shunned. Furthermore, feeding poultry with shred prepared from the antibody expressing <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> led to significant mitigation of infection caused both by high and low challenge doses of Eimeria oocysts.

The recovery of hull was 3 to 6 times higher in beach pea than that of green pea and field pea. The crude protein content in beach pea hull was 2 - 5 % higher than others. The beach pea hull, dhal and whole seeds were good source of macro- and micro- minerals {{than that of the}} other two peas. The electron microscopic structure of beach pea hull crude fibre showed a very close and compact structure than green pea and field pea hull crude fibre structure. Lowering the hardness of beach <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> with mechanical or chemical treatments will give more scope for their utilization in the human nutrition...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the suitability of pea and canola products, and of thin distillers' solubles, for use in salmonid diets with the ultimate aim of enhancing market opportunity for these agricultural crops and byproducts produced in western Canada. Four experiments were conducted with rainbow trout to evaluate the palatability, digestibility and nutritional value of pea and canola products. The ability of thin distillers' solubles to increase feeding activity, and the effect this product has on nutrient and dry matter digestibility of pea products, was also evaluated. Experiments one and two were conducted with the objective of comparing feed consumption, time to satiation and feeding aggressiveness in fish fed four diets containing canola meal or air-classified pea protein, with or without the presence of a palatability enhancer (Finnstim™). Feed consumption of a diet containing 15 % canola meal was equal to that of a commercially available trout ration (P ≤ 0. 05). Feed consumption of a diet containing 30 % air-classified pea protein, although being lower than the commercial ration (P ≤ 0. 05), did not indicate severe palatability problems. It was concluded that these two ingredients offer potential as alternative plant protein sources for feeding rainbow trout. Feed consumption of neither plant protein source was increased with supplementation of a commercial palatability enhancer. However, feeding response was significantly increased (P ≤ 0. 05) with supplementation of thin distillers' solubles at a level ≥ 3. 3 %; of the diet. Experiment three determined the effects that various milling and heat treatments had on nutrient, dry matter and energy digestibility of four pea ingredients as follows: autoclaved air-classified pea protein, raw/whole peas, raw/dehulled peas and extruded/dehulled peas. Digestibility of the protein component was uniformly high for all pea ingredients (apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of 90. 0 - 94. 6 %), regardless of the processing treatment, and compared favourably to protein digestibility values from other plant sources. Heat treatments achieved by autoclaving or extrusion greatly increased starch digestibility by 41 - 75 % (P ≤ 0. 05), which consequently increased energy and dry matter digestibility of whole and <b>dehulled</b> <b>peas.</b> Autoclaved air-classified pea protein had superior protein (ADC of 94. 6 %), energy (ADC of 87 %) and dry matter (ADC of 84 %) digestibility that compared favourably with other plant sources currently utilized in aquafeeds. Thin distillers' solubles was a highly digestible ingredient and supplementation with this product did not adversely affect digestibility values of the various pea ingredients. Experiment four compared the growth performance of rainbow trout fed diets containing soybean meal, <b>dehulled</b> <b>peas,</b> air-classified pea protein or canola meal fines as the primary plant ingredient in the diet, and evaluated the effectiveness of thin distillers' solubles as a feed enhancing compound for rainbow trout over a 12 week period. Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, hepatosomatic index and dressout percentage were similar for the four plant protein sources (P ≤ 0. 05). It was concluded that <b>dehulled</b> <b>peas,</b> air-classified pea protein and canola meal fines are suitable ingredients for use in trout diet formulation. Addition of thin distillers' solubles, while increasing feed intake in the short term, did not increase feed intake (P ≤ 0. 05) ofpea and canola diets over the 12 week trial period. It can be concluded that further processing of peas and canola meal is of benefit in producing palatable, nutritious ingredients suitable for rainbow trout diet formulation. Peas, regardless of processing treatment, were a palatable ingredient. However, digestibility of the nutrient and energy fraction of peas varied with processing treatment. Air classification of <b>dehulled</b> <b>peas</b> produced a highly desirable pea ingredient with a concentrated protein, low starch content which resulted in superior digestibility relative to whole, <b>dehulled</b> or extruded <b>peas.</b> Similarly, sieving of conventional canola meal produced a palatable, high protein ingredient. Thin distillers' solubles were not effective as a palatability enhancer over a long-term period. The failure of this product to increase feed intake may be attributed to the destruction of amino acids during thermal processing or due to a decrease in gustatory stimulation with time. In conclusion, the overall results of these experiments show that there is great opportunity for utilization of pea and canola products in aquafeeds provided adequate processing treatments are used to concentrate the protein constituents and to remove components which inhibit digestion, absorption and utilization of these alternative protein sources by salmonid species...|$|R

40|$|A 15 -week {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of graded levels of boiled and dried pigeon pea meal on carcass characteristics of cockerels. In a completely randomized design, two hundred 1 -week old Bovan nera (dominant black) cockerels were divided into 5 groups of 40 chicks containing 4 replicates of 10 chicks each. They were assigned five dietary treatments containing 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 % levels of boiled and dried pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> meal in diets 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Data obtained from the carcass measurements were subjected to analysis of variance using SPSS version 16. Processing reduced the levels of trypsin inhibitor, cyanide, tannins, and phytic acid, by 79. 36 23. 53, 99. 06, and 6. 07 % respectively compared to the raw seed. Dressing percentage was not significantly affected by the inclusion of pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> meal. There {{was no significant difference in}} dressing percentage amongst the pigeon pea seed-based diets. Carcass cut-up parts (breast, wings, thighs and drumsticks) were not affected by dietary pigeon pea levels. These results suggest that up to 30 % boiled pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> meal can be included in cockerel diets without adverse effects on the meat yielding components...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{ferritin}} has {{a three-dimensional}} structure predicted {{to be very}} similar to that of animal ferritin. It has, however, an additional specific sequence of 24 amino acids at its N-terminus named extension peptide (EP). In order to determine precisely the interactions between EP and other domains of the <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> ferritin subunit, three point mutations were performed. The mutated residues were chosen by three-dimensional computer modelling of the <b>pea</b> <b>seed</b> ferritin subunit structure [Lobréaux, Yewdall, Briat and Harrison (1992) Biochem.

When Ala- 13 was replaced by His, as in mammalian ferritins, ferroxidase activity was significantly reduced. Moreover, in vitro iron-core formation in Pro-X [...] >Ala, Lys-R [...] >Glu and Ala- 13 [...] >His mutants was increased after denaturation by urea followed by renaturation; this was also observed with the EP deletion mutant (r delta TP/EP).
