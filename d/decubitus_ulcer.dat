Wound infection delays healing in <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> and standard treatment include wound dressing and use of antibiotics.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVB) on the healing of <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers.</b> The study was also designed to learn the effect of UVR (Type B) on bacteria. Methods: Ten subjects with ascertained bilateral pressure sores (6 at the gluteal region and 4 at the heels) on the left lower extremities were recruited for this study. The left limbs (experimental limbs) were radiated with UVR (B) coupled with normal wound dressing while the right (control) limbs only received normal wound dressing for 6 weeks. The data were analyzed using descriptive and non-parametric inferential statistics (Kruska Wallis test). Results: There was 78. 9 % decrease in the mean surface area of the <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> of the experimental (left) limbs while there was only 37. 4 % decrease in the mean surface area of the <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> of the control (right) limbs.

40|$|Background. The {{causes of}} <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> include {{ischaemia}} and neurotrophic tissue changes induced by their chronic compression, continuous pathologic moisture and shift of tissues that determine local ishaemia. The {{aim of the}} article: to study clinical options and suppurative complications of <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in terms of insulin resistance (IR) {{in the context of}} combined treatment optimization. Materials and methods. Total sample of retro- and prospective analyses involved results of comprehensive treatment of 112 patients. Type 2 DM was diagnosed in 37 patients, I comparison group included 27 patients with <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> without complications (I–III stages) and DM, with <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> stage IV — II comparison group; and the control group included other 75 individuals. Results. The patients with type 2 DM (I comparison group) had considerable decrease in HOMA index of β-cell function and increased HOMA index of IR (8. 31  ±  0. 02, р <  0. 01). Patients with type 2 DM with complicated <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> (II comparison group) had more significant increase of circulating insulin indexes (p 2  <  0. 01), HOMA index of IR (p 2  <  0. 05), and considerable decrease on HOMA index of β-cell function (p 2  <  0. 05). The correlation analysis of HOMA-IR indicators and element concentration in the blood revealed the correlation only in patients with type 2 DM (I and II comparison groups) : potent negative correlation (r = – 0. 72; p <  0. 001) was revealed between the HOMA-IR and Mg 2 + content in erythrocytes; intermediate negative correlation (r = – 0. 66; p <  0. 01)  — between HOMA-IR and Zn 2 + concentration in the blood serum; and a negative one (r = – 0. 69; p <  0. 01)  — between HOMA-IR and Cr 3 + level in the blood serum.

40|$|Introduction: Cervicovaginal decubitus {{ulceration}} is {{a well-known}} complication of advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP). There is no consensus for its management. This case series describes the outcome of using repeated vaginal packs soaked with oestrogen cream to reduce POP and promote <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcer</b> healing. We aimed to investigate the speed of ulcer healing and endometrial safety with this regimen. Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with stage 3 or 4 POP and intact uterus with <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcer</b> who were planned for surgery that included hysterectomy after ulcer healing. Vaginal packs are replaced at least biweekly—or more frequently if extruded—until ulcer resolution. Results: Thirteen patients were studied. Mean age was 69 ± 6 years and mean duration of menopause was 19 ± 6 years. Nine patients had a single ulcer and four had multiple ulcers. Mean ulcer diameter was 2. 8 ± 1. 5 cm and mean duration for ulcer healing was 26 ± 14 days. Hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction was performed a median of 5 (range 0 – 153) days after ulcer healing was first noted. Histopathological examination of the endometrium following hysterectomy showed three specimens with endocervical hyperplasia; one had concurrent proliferative endometrium, two had simple endometrial hyperplasia and another two had proliferative endometrium.

The treatment sessions in all three groups were administered once daily. The patients in groups I and II were irradiated with focused irradiation at an angle from a distance using a conically shaped light probe 3 mm in diameter. The irradiated area was 0. 5 cm 2.

Subjects included in the study had been on highprotein supplements primarily in the form of liquid milk shakes. The subjects were started on a fortified food program identified as a Food Instead of Supplement (FIS) program and monitored for three months. Weight, calorie, and protein intakes were used to measure changes in nutritional status. Outcomes related to nutritional status such as functional ability and the presence of <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> were also monitored for changes. Student t-tests, Wilcoxon's rank sum, and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test were use for the statistical analysis. Statistics, including means and standard deviations, were completed using the SAS statistical package. The analysis indicated a statistically significant increase in weight and protein intake {{with the use of the}} FIS program. Because of the small number of subjects with <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers,</b> statistics were not completed regarding the presence of <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers.</b> However, the number of subjects with <b>decubitus</b> <b>ulcers</b> was noted to have dropped with the use of the FIS program.
