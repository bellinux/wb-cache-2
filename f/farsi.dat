5|$|The largely outnumbered {{defenders}} of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a trench on {{the suggestion of}} Salman <b>Farsi,</b> which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Muslim-allied Medinan Jews, Banu Qurayza, to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organised defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco.|$|E

25|$|In the 8th century, a Persian from Balkh {{known as}} Saman Khuda left Zoroastrianism for Islam while {{living under the}} Ummayads. His {{children}} founded the Samanid Empire (875–999). <b>Farsi</b> became the official language and had a higher status than Bactrian, {{because it was the}} language of Muslim rulers. It eventually replaced the latter as the common language due to the preferential treatment as well as colonization.|$|E

25|$|Ferdowsi {{lived his}} life as a poor man {{constantly}} moving from court to court, and eventually died a poor widower, having lost his only son. Tus, at one point was an opulent city in the greater Khorasan region but it was repeatedly sacked by Oguz Turks, Mongols, and Uzbeks from the steppe. This and the growing influence of Mashad as a political and religious center within Khorasan shaped Ferdowsi's experience and in many way influenced his writing as Tus lost prestige. Additionally, Arabic had found prestige in lands conquered by the Arabs and there was threat of Middle Persian being lost in favor of Arabic. Ferdowsi's role is critical in that using the least number of loan-words he transferred the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) into Modern Persian (<b>Farsi).</b>|$|E
25|$|Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires {{tales of}} heroic act by protagonists {{fighting}} against their antagonists. In that sense it {{is a national}} epic that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts {{of the history of}} pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes. The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is Feraydoon Sadeghi who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. Rostam, the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus {{of the majority of the}} scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple. Centered inside the edifice surrounding by the frieze scenes and other artistic endeavors is the tomb stone of the poet. Etched in the tomb stone in <b>Farsi</b> (Persian) is the description of Ferdowsi's contribution to the Persian-speakers and at the end it ends by denoting the poet's date of birth, date of death, and the date at which the mausoleum was built.|$|E

500|$|The Persian {{alphabet}} {{was introduced}} into education and public life, although {{the banning of}} the Islamic Renaissance Party in 1993 slowed down the adoption.

In 1989, with the growth in Tajik nationalism, a law was enacted declaring Tajik the state language. In addition, the law officially equated Tajik with Persian, placing the word <b>Fârsi</b> (the local name for Persian) after Tajik. The law also called for a gradual reintroduction of the Persian (Arabic) alphabet.|$|E
