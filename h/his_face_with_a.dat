5|$|In late 1993, {{in order}} to make Todd look more menacing, he was given a scar to his right cheek by Marty's friend, Luna Moody, when she hit him in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crowbar while {{preventing}} his attempt to rape Marty for a second time. The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd's scar, which later became synonymous with the character.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect {{in the midst of}} her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|In , Cobra Commander's profile {{has been}} modified, stating that he {{considers}} himself a warrior king. This {{rendition of the}} character possesses snake-like eyes as well as full battle armor. He wears a helmet that resembles a snake's head and covers <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hood. The snake staff he carries contains a number of hidden weapons systems. In the Sigma 6 animated series, the Commander was voiced by Marc Thompson. At the series conclusion, most of Cobra has been captured but Cobra Commander and Firefly are still at large.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, {{the train station}} and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of}} the building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E
25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scarf and a helmet. Amid the din of the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E
25|$|Psychosis {{originally}} {{lost his}} mask to Rey Misterio Sr. during {{a tour of}} Mexico, as he removed the mask {{and handed it to}} Mysterio Jr. while simultaneously covering <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> towel. He also lost the mask to Billy Kidman on the September 27 episode of Nitro, revealing his face to the American audience. On occasion, he was also paired with Juventud Guerrera, and when the later won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Title, Guerrera was kayfabe injured and had Psychosis defend the title. In reality, Guerrera and Jerry Flynn were arrested on DUI charges; Psychosis immediately lost the belt to previous champion Jushin Thunder Liger. Neither Juventud Guerrera's championship win nor Psicosis' title defense was recognized by New Japan Pro Wrestling until 2007. Psychosis had a second Cruiserweight title reign in WCW shortly after unmasking, when the previous champion Lenny Lane, who portrayed a flamboyant homosexual on television, got WCW in trouble with GLAAD. As a result, Lane was pulled from television and Psychosis was given the belt to defend. The WCW announcers claimed that he had won it at a house show. However, on his first televised appearance with the title, Psychosis lost it to Disco Inferno. This earned him the dubious distinction of having lost two titles he never won.|$|E

25|$|In {{the seventh}} and final book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's {{remaining}} Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps {{ensure the safety of}} her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{drew the}} story of the film from his parents' divorce; Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it [...] "essentially a spiritual autobiography, a {{portrait}} of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination". References to his childhood occur throughout: Elliott fakes illness by holding a thermometer to the bulb in his lamp while covering <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heating pad, a trick frequently employed by the young Spielberg. Michael picking on Elliott echoes Spielberg's teasing of his younger sisters, and Michael's evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how Spielberg {{had to take care of}} his sisters after their father left.|$|E
500|$|... (1984) {{continues}} the story, with a presumed-dead Jason (Ted White) {{found by the}} police and taken to the morgue. Jason awakens at the morgue and kills an attendant and a nurse, and makes his way back to Crystal Lake. A group of teens renting a house there fall victim to Jason's rampage. Jason then seeks out Trish (Kimberly Beck) and Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) next door. While Trish distracts Jason, Tommy kills him. [...] follows Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd), who was committed to a mental hospital after the events of The Final Chapter, and has grown up constantly afraid that Jason (Tom Morga) will return. Jason's body was supposedly cremated after Tommy killed him. Roy Burns (Dick Wieand) uses Jason's persona to become a copycat killer at the halfway home to which Tommy was moved. Jason appears in the film only through Tommy's dreams and hallucinations. In [...] (1986), Tommy (Thom Mathews), who has run away from a mental institution, visits Jason's grave and learns that Jason's body was never actually cremated, but buried in a cemetery near Crystal Lake. While attempting to destroy his body, Tommy inadvertently resurrects Jason (C. J. Graham) via a piece of cemetery fence that acts as a lightning rod. Now possessing superhuman abilities, Jason returns to Crystal Lake, now renamed Forest Green, and begins his killing spree anew. Tommy eventually lures Jason back to the lake where he drowned as a child and chains him to a boulder on the lake floor, but almost dies in the process. Tommy's friend, Megan Garris, finishes Jason off by cutting <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> boat propeller.|$|E

60|$|Charley {{advanced}} {{to take the}} hand that was held out to him; but stopped again, short of it. The heavy, bloodshot eyes of the schoolmaster, rising to <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effort, met <b>his</b> look of scrutiny.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Ulliott was {{involved}} in a fight {{on the way home from}} the Golden Nugget Pool Hall in Kingston upon Hull. Ulliott was set upon by five men and their wives (one of whom slashed <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steel comb), after protecting his younger brother. He fought back and eventually returned home. Ulliott later claimed that he was proud of the experience and the incident made him realise that he could not be beaten in a fight [...] "inside".|$|E
2500|$|Next are verses {{from the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John {{referring}} to Jesus {{after he was}} flogged by soldiers. Another section shows the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas watching the punishment of Jesus from afar. Christ then receives the cross. The next section shows Jesus on his knees with Simon of Cyrene [...] carrying the cross and followed by a large crowd and soldiers. Saint Veronica appears in front of Christ, wiping <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cloth. The north and south segments show the falls Jesus suffered while carrying the cross while the three Marys look on.|$|E
2500|$|Moses descends {{from the}} mountain, {{and his face}} is transformed, so that from that time onwards he has to hide <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> veil. Moses assembles the Hebrews and repeats to them the commandments he has {{received}} from God, which are to keep the Sabbath and to construct the Tabernacle. [...] "And all {{the construction of the}} Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished, and the children of Israel did according to everything that God had commanded Moses", and from that time God dwelt in the Tabernacle and ordered the travels of the Hebrews.|$|E

60|$|She made no reply. He {{looked at}} her closer. The girl's eyes were trying to read <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> utter {{carelessness}} of concealment, which forbade (even to his mind) all unworthy interpretation of her motive for stopping {{him on his way}} out.|$|R

2500|$|The player {{primarily}} controls Sergeant Gary [...] "Roach" [...] Sanderson, a British {{member of}} an international elite counter-terrorist unit named Task Force 141. In addition to Roach, the player will also assume control of Private First Class Joseph Allen and Private James Ramirez of the United States Army Rangers. Several non-playable characters feature prominently in the story. The now Captain John [...] "Soap" [...] MacTavish. serves as {{a senior member of}} Task Force 141, acting as Roach's superior officer. Another member of the unit is SAS operator Lieutenant Simon [...] "Ghost" [...] Riley, who conceals <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> skull print balaclava and is Soap second in command. Sergeant Foley, along with his subordinate, Corporal Dunn, is initially Joseph Allen's squad leader, and becomes James Ramirez's squad leader later in the story.
