40|$|Research PaperJapan is {{the number}} 1 {{country in the world}} in terms of tuna harvest[1]. For example, it started from about 294, 961 tons in 1975, then reached its peak at 371, 103 tons in 1985. Although the harvest {{declined}} since 1985, it bounced back for the recent years and reached 343, 611 tons in 1993 (Table 1 and Figure I). While Japan has the largest tuna harvest in the world, it relies on import for both fresh and frozen tuna to meet its domestic demand. The amount imported has increased from about 84, 703 tons in 1981 to around 273, 399 tons in 1993 (Table 2) of which the frozen tuna has increased from about 73, 000 tons to about 184, 000 tons. For domestically demanded frozen tuna, Thunnus albacares (i. e. Yellow Fin tuna) and Thunnus obsess (i. e. Big Eye tuna) are the two major categories. Other than domestic supply, Taiwan and South Korea are the two major suppliers among about fifty countries.

40|$|Deep-water {{fish are}} {{becoming}} an interesting object of studies and research {{due to the}} development of deep fishery activities. This paper analyses the chemical composition and nutritional value of the fish species Mora moro (Risso, 1810) inhabiting deep Mediterranean waters. The fatty acid profile and the principal water-soluble proteins present in the white muscle of this fish species have also been determined. The major fatty acids were 22 : 6 n- 3, 16 : 0, 18 : 1 n- 9, 20 : 4 n- 6 and 20 : 5 n- 3. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content was higher than that of saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids, but the ratio PUFA/SFA was lower than the value reported in other studies. Both the atherogenic index and thrombogenic index were very low. Water-soluble proteins were characterised by monodimensional native PAGE and 2 -D SDS-gel electrophoresis. Protein patterns showed the presence of parvalbumins and of the principal myofibrillar proteins. Therefore, the deep-water fish M. moro could represent an interesting target for <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishery</b> and commercial exploitation...|$|R
40|$|Research into {{vulnerable}} marine ecosystems (VMEs) on {{the high}} seas and the impacts of bottom fishing and ad hoc management measures are high priority today thanks to UN General Assembly Resolution 61 / 105. An interdisciplinary methodology (specifically designed for selecting cold-water coral protection areas) and a case study focused on the Hatton Bank (NE Atlantic) are presented. This interdisciplinary approach, developed under the ECOVUL/ARPA project, was based on conventional fisheries science, geomor-phology, benthic ecology, and sedimentology. It contributes to defining practical criteria for identifying VMEs, to improving knowledge of their distribution off Europe’s continental shelf, and to providing advice on negative fishing impacts and habitat protection. The approach was used to identify the bottom-trawl <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishery</b> footprint on the western slope of Hatton Bank, to map the main fishing grounds and related deep-sea habitats (1000 – 1500 m deep), and to study the interactions between fisheries and cold-water corals.

40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishery</b> for aristeid shrimps off Brazil is reviewed from its early days in 2002. Descriptive data were collected by observers on board 75 directed fishing trips conducted in the study period, {{with a total of}} over 15, 000 monitored trawls. An incipient fishing phase took place between No-vember 2000 and October 2002, when aristeid shrimps were occasionally reported in the bycatch of operations mostly targeting the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi). After that, a directed fishery was established for these resources. All nine vessels involved in this fishery (one national and eight chartered) concentrated on 11 limited grounds between 700 and 800 m deep and 18 °S and 34 °S. The main species caught between November 2002 and May 2007 was the "carabinero" Aristaeopsis edwardsiana (456, 710 kg), followed by the "moruno" Aristaeomorpha foliácea (121, 497 kg), and then the "alistado" Aristeus antillensis (27, 919 kg). The trawlers operate in conjunction, such that the total area of each fishing ground was swept at least twice. This harvest pattern substantially reduced "carabinero" catch rates from 14 kg hour- 1 in the first sampled trimester to 4 kg hour- 1 in the last. Despite the inferred biomass reduction of this species, the fishery has continued without a formal management plan...|$|R

A total of 32 483 hauls were sampled. Some data from the Div. 3 NO Spanish bottom trawl survey in 1995 and 1996 were also included in this study. Witch flounder yield was estimated for this period. The yield showed an annual seasonality where yield was greater in spring. Through the period 1992 – 96, the overall annual yield showed a general increase. The length frequency and the length/weight relationship were obtained from samplings performed at depths ranging from 800 m to 1500 m. The length range of the individuals was 26 – 60 cm in males and 22 – 72 cm in females. The mean length decreased throughout the period analyzed, and was higher in the large vessel catches. The individuals were also larger in Div. 3 M. The sex ratio showed seasonal variation in the large vessel catches, while no clear trend appeared in the small vessels.

This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the blue ling (Molva dypterygia). In addition to the total catch, the composition of the retained catch and the discard are studied. For the main retained species, the dressing types are described and the conversion coefficients are presented. The length distribution of the catches and the discards, length-weight relationships and other biological aspects of some of the main species are analysed...|$|R

50|$|The {{alfonsino}} (Beryx decadactylus), {{also known}} as the alfonsin, longfinned beryx, red bream, or imperador, is a species of deepwater berycid fish of the order Beryciformes. It can be found in temperate and subtropical ocean waters nearly worldwide, though it is uncommon. It is typically associated with deep-sea corals, and schools are known to form over seamounts. Adults are demersal and search for prey along the ocean floor, primarily fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Like other members of its family, it is remarkably long-lived, with individuals reaching ages of up to 69 years, and possibly longer. It can reach sizes of up to 100.0 cm in length and 2.5 kg in weight and is targeted by commercial fisheries. Its low reproductive rate and the time it takes for juveniles to mature make it vulnerable to expanding <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fisheries,</b> but it is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its extensive range.|$|E

5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of <b>deep-sea</b> commercial <b>fisheries</b> operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|R
