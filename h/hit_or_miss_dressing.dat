40|$|International audienceThe <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform is a {{fundamental}} morphological operator, {{and can be used}} for template matching. In this paper, we present a framework for adaptive <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform, where structuring elements are adaptive with respect to the input image itself. We illustrate the difference between the new adaptive <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform and the classical <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform. As an example of its usefulness, we show how the new adaptive <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform can detect particles in single molecule imaging...|$|R
50|$|By 1986, {{the number}} of <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> stores in the United States had reached 420, and sales had climbed to $300 million. Some 70 percent of its {{inventory}} {{was made up of}} nationally known brands. The remaining 30 percent consisted of standard apparel, produced by <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> under its own private label. With such a merchandise mix, <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> was able to sell current fashions at 20 to 50 percent less than most specialty stores.|$|R

50|$|Within {{six years}} of that opening, Zayre Corp. found another avenue to the off-price fashion market. In 1983, Chadwick's of Boston began to sell {{selected}} <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> items through mail-order catalogs. <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> and Chadwick's crossover operations allowed customers to handle products before ordering, and brought frequent buyers the convenience of home shopping.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Zayre Corp. diversified into {{specialty}} retailing. Among Zayre's early acquisitions was the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> chain, an off-price chain {{specializing in}} upscale women's clothing. The first store, which opened in Natick, Massachusetts in 1965, flourished and grew into a chain so quickly that within four years it attracted the attention of the much larger Zayre Corp. In 1969, Zayre Corp. bought the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> chain and began its exploration of the off-price fashion market. Zayre's timing could not have been better. During the recession of the 1970s, <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss's</b> results climbed so rapidly that Zayre Corp. considered expanding its off-price upscale apparel merchandising.|$|R

50|$|In 1986, {{profits of}} the Zayre chain, {{targeting}} low- to middle-income customers, dropped, although T.J. Maxx, <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss,</b> and Chadwick's of Boston, targeting mid- to higher-income customers, continued to grow. That year alone, Zayre Corp. opened 35 more T.J. Maxx stores and 31 new <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> stores. Zayre Corp.'s off-price retailing chains {{had become so}} successful that by 1987 Zayre thought it prudent to organize them under one name and grant them autonomy from the decreasingly prosperous parent company.|$|R

60|$|A cold March wind whistled {{and yelled}} round the twisted {{chimneys}} of the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss.</b> The {{day had been}} a trial to every sense. First there would come a long-drawn distant moan, a sigh {{like that of a}} querulous woman; then the sigh grew nearer and became a shriek, as if the same woman were working herself up into a passion; and finally a gust of rainy hail, mixed with dust and small stones, was dashed, like a parting insult, on the windows of the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform (HMT) is a {{well known}} {{morphological}} technique {{which can be used}} for shape and object recognition in digital image processing. The standard HMT is a particularly powerful tool for locating objects which are noise free in both the background and foreground regions, do not exhibit internal texture and where objects have well defined edges. Often for various reasons, objects of interest do not exhibit such qualities and as a result may not be detected by the standard HMT. This paper proposes a percentage occupancy based <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Transform for the detection of objects subject to noisy edges, internal texture, holes and non homogeneous intensit...|$|R

60|$|The man {{who spoke}} {{was one of}} the latest spectators that had arrived, after the news that some {{pleasant}} entertainment was on foot had passed into the warm alcoholic air and within the swinging doors of the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now Maitland, {{knowing the}} <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss,</b> {{and the private}} room up-stairs with the dormer windows, where the deed must have been done, if done at all, was certain that there could not {{possibly}} have been any eye-witness of the crime.|$|R
6000|$|It is, perhaps, {{desirable}} and even necessary {{to explain how}} this arrangement came into existence. We have already made acquaintance with [...] "mine host" [...] of the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss,</b> and {{found him to be}} by no means the rosy, genial Boniface of popular tradition. That a man like Maitland should be the lessee of a waterside tavern, like the <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss,</b> was only one of the anomalies of this odd age of ours. An age of revivals, restorations, experiments--an age of dukes who are Socialists--an age which sees the East-end brawling in Pall Mall, and parties of West-end tourists personally conducted down Ratcliffe Highway--need not wonder at Maitland's eccentric choice in philanthropy.|$|R

60|$|The <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> tavern, to {{customers}} (rough customers, at least) who entered it on a foggy winter night, seemed merely a public by the river's brim. Not being ravaged and parched by a thirst for the picturesque, Tommy and his mates failed to pause and observe the architectural peculiarities of the building. Even {{if they had}} been of a romantic and antiquarian turn, the fog was so thick that they could have seen little to admire, though there was plenty to be admired. The <b>Hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> was not more antique in its aspect than modern in its fortunes. Few public-houses, if any, boasted for their landlord such a person as Robert Maitland, M.A., Fellow of St. Gatien's, in the University of Oxford.|$|R

60|$|Life was <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>miss</b> and happy-go-lucky with us. Little {{was ever}} planned, and less was executed.
