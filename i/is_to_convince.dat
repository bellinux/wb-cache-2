5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to view themselves as citizens of the planet.|$|E

The portal {{is unique to}} each soul: for a child, {{it may be a}} wonderful carnival, but for a yoga master, it may be a Deva beckoning from within a Divine Lotus. Souls cannot be forced to enter the portals, so part of the reapers' job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> them to do so.|$|E

500|$|The team {{spent a lot}} of {{resources}} in carrying out detailed motion capture, to enhance players' engagement with the story and make it easier for them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances. Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records every little detail of their faces. The team initially did the recording at Los Angeles, where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in Helsinki, where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a [...] "Sweat Box", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the rise}} in Ketèlbey's popularity, and in sales of his sheet music, in 1918 he {{became a member of}} the Performing Rights Society. Except for a brief {{interval}} in 1926 when he resigned over a dispute about the allocation of funds to its members, he remained a lifelong member. In 1919 he composed the romantic work In the Moonlight, which his publisher considered to be [...] "a work of striking beauty". In the following year he wrote Wedgwood Blue—a gavotte—and In a Persian Market; the latter became one of his more popular works. The musicologist Jonathan Bellman, calling In a Persian Market [...] "immortal", describes it as [...] "an 'intermezzo scene' for band or small orchestra; reprehensibly demeaning or delightfully tacky". The work was not without its critics; the composer and conductor Nicolas Slonimsky quotes the view of a Russian journal that [...] "the suite... had its 'immaculate conception' in imperialistic colonial England. The composer's intention <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the listener that all's well in the colonies where beautiful women and exotic fruits mature together, where beggars and rulers are friends, where there are no imperialists, no restive proletarians." [...] In The Musical Times, the pseudonymous reviewer [...] "Ariel" [...] described the work as [...] "naive and inexpensive pseudo-orientalism", which led to heated correspondence in the journal over the following months between the composer and the critic.|$|E

[...] VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, {{he was one of the}} [...] "Sexiest Men" [...] of 2010, and 2011. Celia Walden criticised Usher for being overly explicit, remarking [...] "the subject of his own sexual prowess, women and lingerie will obliterate any traditional interview technique." [...] In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating [...] "The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon". In 2013, Complex placed him in its [...] "Most Stylish R Singers of the 90's" [...] list. Men's Health magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue with Lou Schuler calling him [...] "the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry". In 2014 and 2015, his Calvin Klein Collection suits saw him listed as [...] "Best Dressed Men" [...] by various outlets at the Golden Globe Awards and Grammy Awards.

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at how easy it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, {{than it would be}} to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{violence}} and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that Pulp Fiction should be seen {{in light of the}} short stories of Flannery O'Connor, which likewise feature [...] "religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor."

2500|$|After {{the events}} in [...] "Judgment Day", the Watchers abandon all pretense of not interfering in the Game. Believing that MacLeod is {{responsible}} for the slaughter of the Watchers, Jack Shapiro, their head, orders his death and, at the beginning of [...] "One Minute To Midnight", Duncan is trying to survive their manhunt. Believing the only way to avoid a war between the Watchers and the Immortals <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Shapiro of his innocence, MacLeod goes to their battle headquarters, only to find that the Immortal who is the real killer has beaten him to the punch. The bitter irony of the situation is revealed - Jacob Galati is hunting the Watchers after Horton killed his Immortal wife, Irena, during his rampage across Europe in 1992 that ended when he killed Darius in Paris, ("The Hunters"). Jacob refuses to believe that the Watchers are not evil, but agrees to meet Joe, who has been nursed back to health by Methos. Joe won't meet Jacob though and helps the Watchers to capture him. Duncan is forced to stand by whilst the Watchers murder Jacob and is devastated to receive his friend's Quickening. Methos rejects Joe and the Watchers for what they have become, but MacLeod returns to confront Shapiro, {{to put an end to}} the killing. When Shapiro refuses, Joe belatedly realizes that his friend has become another Horton and helps Duncan to secure peace with the Watchers. Wanting nothing to do with Paris, Duncan returns to Seacouver. There, he finds the Immortal Cassandra waiting for him. She is being hunted by Roland Kantos, one of her students, and she tells Duncan of a [...] "Prophecy" [...] that he will defeat great evil. Kantos relies on the hypnotic power of his voice to defeat his opponents, but Duncan, after nearly losing his head to Kantos' tricks, defeats the mesmerist by plugging his ears. Joe comes to the dojo and gets the cold shoulder from Duncan, but before he leaves, he tells MacLeod that Richie is in town, ("The End Of Innocence"). Duncan tries to make his peace with Richie, but the young Immortal is still plagued by nightmares after Duncan almost killed him in [...] "Something Wicked" [...] and warns Duncan to stay away from him. When Richie challenges and kills Carter Wellan, his mentor Haresh Clay comes for Richie, breaking his sword. Richie is arrested trying to steal another one from a museum and is bailed out by Duncan, who warns him that Clay is as good as they come and gives him a sword. The two Immortals work out their differences and, now acting as equals, it is Duncan who asks Richie to stand aside as he avenges his humiliation at Clay's hands when they first met and takes his head. In [...] "Archangel" [...] Duncan accidentally kills Richie thinking he is a demon he is destined to face.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{the whole}} {{difference}} between {{the aim of the}} orator and the aim of any other artist, such as the poet or the sculptor.

Once let Mr. Chamberlain be mistaken for a practical man, and his game is won. He has only to compose a theme on empire, and people will say that these plain men say great things on great occasions. He has only to drift in the large loose notions common to all artists of the second rank, and people will say that business men have the biggest ideals after all. All his schemes have ended in smoke; he has touched nothing that he did not confuse. About his figure there is a Celtic pathos; like the Gaels in Matthew Arnold's quotation, [...] "he went forth to battle, but he always fell." [...] He is a mountain of proposals, a mountain of failures; but still a mountain. And a mountain is always romantic.|$|E
