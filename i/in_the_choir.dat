As a youth he sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> and later taught catechism.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Edwards, Princeton's third president: in the Theology {{window in}} the nave's south wall and again among the Protestant leaders carved into the {{woodwork}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> behind the altar.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{also has}} a chamber organ, built by the Scottish organ-builders Lammermuir, which is {{normally}} kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> but which can be moved around, for services and concerts, {{in other parts of}} the Cathedral. It is regularly used for authentic accompaniment of Tudor and baroque music.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>choir</b> {{consists}} of ca. 30-35 people who rehearse every Tuesday from 8-10 pm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village town hall in Edermünde-Grifte. Every year {{there is one}} weekend workshop and every two years they go on tour. <b>In</b> 2011 <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> gave a concert in Berlin; <b>in</b> 2013 <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> went to Bedfordshire, England for 4 days, and <b>in</b> 2015 <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> went to Vienna, Austria for 4 days.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Grand Philharmonic <b>Choir</b> {{is a large}} {{classical}} music choir based <b>in</b> Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. <b>The</b> <b>choir</b> sings regularly with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony at <b>the</b> Centre <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Square. <b>The</b> <b>choir's</b> artistic director is Mark Vuorinen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>choir</b> has sung for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican City five times. <b>In</b> 2005, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> marked its Carnegie Hall debut under David White. <b>In</b> 2006, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> {{returned}} to Italy where it performed for Pope Benedict XVI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel of St. Peter's Basilica. <b>In</b> 2009, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> sang at Vienna's Musikverein during the International Haydn Festival commemorating the 200th {{anniversary of the}} death of Austrian composer, Joseph Haydn.|$|R
5|$|Woodfull married Gwen King, whom he {{met while}} singing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> at his father's church in Albert Park, and they married after Woodfull's return from the England tour in 1926. They had three children. His two sons Jack and Bill Jr, played for Melbourne University Cricket Club and became {{successful}} dentists.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin died on 19 November 1242 at Wells and {{was buried}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of Wells Cathedral. He {{may have been}} the father of Nicholas of Wells. The {{memorial}} brass on his tomb is allegedly one of the earliest brasses in England. He employed the medieval architect Elias of Dereham as a household official.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 2002 <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> {{recorded}} {{their first}} album, A Land of Pure Delight. <b>In</b> 2007 <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> recorded another album {{as part of}} the RSCM's 80th anniversary celebrations, entitled Out of the Stillness.|$|R
50|$|A {{highlight}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir’s</b> {{history was}} its participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> impeachment trial of former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada at <b>the</b> Senate <b>in</b> January 2001.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, Russo {{began with}} several participations as chorist for many artist's publications. In 1972 she sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> of Balletto di Bronzo's Ys.|$|R
5|$|The Chapel of the Order is the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Every four years, an {{installation}} ceremony, {{presided over by}} the Great Master, and a religious service are held in the Chapel; the Sovereign attends every alternate ceremony. The last such service was in May 2014 and was attended by the Sovereign. The Sovereign and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|At age fourteen, Pascu's voice changed. He {{was still}} a soprano <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> but had to use his head voice. As a high school student, Pascu had to enlist in the Union of Communist Youth (UTC), the Romanian {{communist}} regime compulsory youth organization. In 1976, he enrolled at the Agnita High School, which later became the Agro-Industrial High School. The same year, he gave up handball and began a more formal study of guitar music, using the Maria Boeru textbook as his guide. He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.|$|E
5|$|Cooper Anderson (Matt Bomer), Blaine's (Darren Criss) {{older brother}} and an actor in {{television}} ads, visits McKinley High and is treated as a celebrity by Blaine's boyfriend Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Sue. Blaine is unhappy, though, when after he and Cooper do an impromptu mashup of two Duran Duran songs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> room, Cooper finds fault with Blaine's singing. Sue recruits Cooper to give an acting master class for the club, which contains such bad advice that Blaine is appalled. Worse, Cooper subsequently criticizes Blaine's acting in a class scene.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>choir</b> {{has participated}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World <b>Choir</b> Games {{numerous}} times and won gold in 2006 (Xiamen) and 2014 (Riga). <b>In</b> 2016 <b>the</b> World <b>Choir</b> Games ranked <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> 41 out of 1000 overall and <b>the</b> 5th Female <b>Choir.</b>|$|R
50|$|Born in London, Halsey sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> of both New College, Oxford and King's College, Cambridge. He studied {{conducting}} at the Royal College of Music in London.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Choir</b> School has {{traveled}} {{over the years}} to sing in Chicago, Montreal, Washington, DC, and Rome. <b>In</b> 2005, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> sang <b>in</b> Rome for Masses at St. Peter's Basilica and at the Church of Santa Susanna and again in 2013 before an audience with Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square and a performance <b>in</b> Assisi. <b>The</b> <b>choir</b> has sung at Mass on multiple occasions at the Basilica of <b>the</b> National Shrine <b>in</b> Washington, DC, most recently <b>in</b> 2011. <b>The</b> <b>Choir</b> School has also performed at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City in 2012.|$|R
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of York.|$|E
5|$|Mantle {{was born}} in Barnet, then lived in Hertfordshire, in 1957. He was the cousin of John Hallam and was a keen {{supporter}} of Chelsea Football Club from a young age. Mantle studied at the boarding school Kimbolton School in Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire between 1970 and 1975, and was a chorister <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Choir</b> of St John's College, Cambridge for four years. He first worked {{on a farm in}} Cambridgeshire during his studies and soon became interested in theatre. He appeared in 11 productions of the National Youth Theatre in five seasons between 1974 and 1978.|$|E
5|$|Representations of Old Bridge {{can be seen}} {{in local}} heraldic and civic stationery, {{including}} the crest of Pontypridd Rugby Football Club, and Cilfynydd Rugby Football Club. The community-to-community organisation PONT (Partnerships Overseas Networking Trust), also bases its logo upon the Bridge. Pontypridd High School in Cilfynydd incorporates the bridge design into the school shield, as does Pontypridd Town Council with its logo representing the South Wales Valleys and a section of the Old Bridge in the foreground. Pontypridd Male Voice Choir also incorporates the Old Bridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> logo.|$|E
50|$|The Orchestra also {{regularly}} appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tabernacle <b>Choir's</b> {{weekly radio}} and TV broadcasts of Music and the Spoken Word, <b>the</b> <b>Choir's</b> acclaimed Christmas specials on PBS, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Choir's</b> recording projects, including several on the Telarc label. More recent recordings on <b>the</b> <b>Choir's</b> own label have enjoyed tremendous success, appearing prominently on Billboard's classical and classical crossover charts. Additionally, the Orchestra accompanies the Temple Square Chorale in its semiannual concerts and {{has provided the}} music for various LDS Church stage productions such as the annual Christmas favorite Savior of the World.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> June 2008 <b>the</b> <b>Choir</b> held a Come and Sing {{event in}} Swansea, at which Mozart's Coronation Mass was {{performed}}. <b>In</b> December 2008 <b>the</b> <b>Choir</b> performed Verdi's Requiem.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s <b>the</b> <b>choir's</b> {{history was}} {{recorded}} in a documentary, Keeping <b>the</b> Flame Alive. <b>In</b> 2005, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> was <b>the</b> subject of a PhD dissertation, We Shall Go Forward With Our Songs Into a Better Life, by Beneta Walters-Fredland.|$|R
5|$|The Mixed Choir {{is opened}} to all {{students}} at City College and currently has a membership of approximately 135students. The Concert Choir is a more selective group consisting of about 50students, who must audition for their places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir.</b> The Singin'/Swingin' Knights is an even more selective group composed of 25students. The Knights and Daze Show Choir {{is a group of}} students, who perform a choreographed dance routine while they sing. With the exception of the Knights and Daze Show Choir, which performs jazz and pop music, the choir's repertoire consists of gospel music, spirituals, and Classical works by composers such as Handel and Michael Praetorius.|$|E
5|$|Verdi had {{a younger}} sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833. From {{the age of}} four, Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he {{attended}} the local school. After learning to play the organ, he showed so much interest in music that his parents finally provided him with a spinet. Verdi's gift for music was already apparent by 1820–21 when he began his association with the local church, serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> acting as an altar boy for a while, and taking organ lessons. After Baistrocchi's death, Verdi, {{at the age of}} eight, became the official paid organist.|$|E
5|$|When Makeba was {{eighteen}} days old, {{her mother was}} arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent {{the first six months}} of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.|$|E
50|$|The John Tree Award scheme, {{contributed to}} by R.T.J. Tree, choir president, was {{launched}} <b>in</b> 1991. <b>The</b> {{objective of the}} scheme is to link local schools and <b>the</b> <b>choir.</b> Annual prizes are awarded to musicians/singers at Pontypridd schools, based on talent. Award winners take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir's</b> annual celebrity concert.|$|R
25|$|Many {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> {{have gone on}} to Oxbridge, with choral {{scholarships}} on leaving Tiffin. As of 2017, there are Old Tiffinians currently singing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> of King's, St John's, Trinity, Jesus, Emanuel and Queens' Colleges in Cambridge, and Exeter, Magdalen, Queen's, Oriel and St Edmund Hall Colleges in Oxford.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Choir</b> {{was awarded}} <b>the</b> National Medal of Arts.|$|R
5|$|Bishop Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again {{moved the}} bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, {{with the title}} Bishop of Bath. Jocelin was a brother of Bishop Hugh II of Lincoln and {{was present at the}} signing of the Magna Carta. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald and was responsible for the Bishop's Palace, the choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also had a manor house built at Wookey, near Wells. Jocelin saw the church dedicated in 1239 but, despite much lobbying of the Pope by Jocelin's representatives in Rome, did not live to see cathedral status granted. The delay may have been a result of inaction by Pandulf Verraccio, a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and Bishop of Norwich, who was asked by the Pope to investigate the situation but did not respond. Jocelin died at Wells on 19 November 1242 and was buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of the cathedral; the memorial brass on his tomb is one of the earliest brasses in England. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the cathedral, {{including}} the chapter house, was finished in 1306, {{it was already too}} small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. Bishop John Droxford initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided Lady chapel was added at the east end by 1326. Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and retrochoir beyond. He oversaw the building of Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men who were employed to sing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I {{gave the}} chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, {{creating}} a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended {{with the onset of}} the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailer, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.|$|E
50|$|Beside the Gothic Altar of the Magi (c. 1300) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>choir,</b> {{a bronze}} baptismal font <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high <b>choir</b> by Ghert Klinghe (1480) and a four-metre-high wood carving of Christophorus, the cathedral's main attraction {{is the famous}} Bordesholm Altar.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Choir</b> Director {{received}} <b>the</b> Milken Family Foundation's National Educator Award.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> 1960, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> {{was shaken}} by President Moser's {{accidental}} death; his successor was Rudolf Massini. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, Ulbrich handed {{over some of}} his responsibilities: his wife, Helene Sandreuter, and his son, Markus Ulbrich, along with Kurt Tschirren, an employee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administration, assisted him <b>in</b> leading <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> and Markus Ulbrich and Tschirren Kurse worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> educational department.|$|R
