In this period health authorities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> countries almost invariably reported communicable diseases as their main public health problems, whereas, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> countries, <b>the</b> only communicable diseases still considered as public health problems were tuberculosis, venereal diseases, and hepatitis. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> countries nearly half of the principal causes of death were communicable diseases, and <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> and developed countries respiratory infections ranked high on the list.

Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
