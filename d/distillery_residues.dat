El estudio se realizó en un área de la Estación Experimental "Indio Hatuey", en el municipio de Perico, provincia de Matanzas, Cuba. La especie de pasto predominante fue Panicum maximum cv. Likoni y como leguminosa Leucaena leucocephala. Se estudiaron 18 novillas, distribuidas en un diseño completamente aleatorizado en tres grupos de seis animales; el grupo control no recibió suplementación (A) y los otros dos grupos se suplementaron con residuos de destilería del maíz en un 10 % (B) y 20 % (C) de los requerimientos de proteína con relación al peso vivo. Se determinó la composición química, la disponibilidad de materia seca, la ganancia de peso vivo, la infestaci��n parasitaria y el hematocrito. Al analizar las ganancias diarias por tratamiento se encontraron diferencias significativas (P The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with corn <b>distillery</b> <b>residues</b> {{on the performance of}} heifers in an association of grass and leucaena. The study was conducted in an area of the Experimental Station "Indio Hatuey", Perico municipality, Matanzas province, Cuba. The prevailing pasture species was Panicum maximum cv. Likoni and as legume, Leucaena leucocephala. Eighteen heifers, distributed in a completely randomized design in three groups of six animals, were used; the control group did not receive supplementation (A), and the other two groups were supplemented with corn <b>distillery</b> <b>residues</b> in 10 % (B) and 20 % (C) of the protein requirements with regards to live weight. The chemical composition, dry matter availability, live weight gain, parasite infestation and hematocrit were determined. When analyzing the daily gain per treatments, significant differences (P< 0, 05) were found and the highest values were obtained in treatment C (805 g/animal/day); while A and B showed 479 and 572 g/animal/day, respectively. The hematocrit values (between 28, 1 and 30, 5 %), as well as the egg count, were maintained, without significant differences among treatments. The supplementation with distillery corn residues was concluded to influence positively the mean daily gain, and it also maintained the hematocrit values within the recommended range for cattle...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen hybrids and 16 {{varieties}} of sweet sorghum were investigated for yields of grain, stover, juice extract for bio-ethanol distillation and bagasse and {{the relationships between}} these productive traits. There was a large degree of independency between grain and stover yields, suggesting that sweets sorghum can provide both grain and fodder yield. Juice extract yields from the stems were not significantly related to grain yields. The differences in stover fodder quality traits were significant: nitrogen content ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 72 % in hybrids and from 0. 50 to 0. 89 % in varieties while in vitro digestibility ranged from 43. 8 to 54. 5 % in hybrids and from 48. 8 to 54. 8 % in varieties. Differences in in vitro digestibility of bagasse plus stripped leaves were also substantial, ranging from 39. 3 to 49. 1 % in hybrids and from 42. 0 to 50. 4 % in varieties. The palatability of bagasse and stripped leaves to cattle was investigated by incorporation of the <b>distillery</b> <b>residues</b> of one sweet sorghum variety into a commercial feed block, replacing the traditionally used (non sweet) sorghum stover. There was no statistical difference in intake (DMI) and live weight gain (LWG) between bulls fed the bagasse plus stripped leaf based blocks (DMI of 3. 7 % of live weight and 0. 73 kg/d of LWG) and bulls fed the original sorghum stover based commercial feed block (DMI of 3. 5 % of live weight and 0. 82 kg/d of LWG). We conclude that sweet sorghum can provide food (grain), fodder (bagasse/leaf residues) and bio-ethanol at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Aims of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the cost-benefit analysis in neufchatel whey bioconversion into rectified ethanol and organic liquid fertilizer. Bioconversion whey into rectified ethanol and organic liquid fertilizer has shown great potential as a way to reduce the pollution resulting from cheese-making process. Semi pilot scale experiment was done to ferment 5 L neufchatel whey using 5 % K. lactis at 33 °C for 24 h in semi anaerobic plastic container without agitation and then distilled into 96. 2 % purity. Data collected and analyzed descriptively related to benefit cost ratio/BCR, net present value/NPV and internal rate returns/IRR. The result showed that semi pilot scale bioconversion of neufchatel whey resulting in 106. 42 ml rectified ethanol and 4404. 22 ml <b>distillery</b> <b>residue.</b> Economic benefit could achieved by the support of <b>distillery</b> <b>residue</b> sales as organic liquid fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} {{fermentation}} waste–Sorghum <b>Distillery</b> <b>Residue</b> (SDR) as {{a precursor to}} prepare different kinds of Sorghum <b>Distillery</b> <b>Residue</b> Activated Carbon (SDRAC) by physical activation with steam, in order to evaluate the water purification and the preliminary safety of water quality before and after purification. The turbidity, total hardness, nitrite nitrogen, total bacterial count, and coliform of the water purified by prepared SDRAC were 0. 12 NTU, 55. 6 mg/L, 0. 00 mg/L, 1 CFU/mL, and below 1. 0 CFU/mL, respectively, meeting the quality standard for drinking water in Taiwan. The total organic carbon in water was reduced by 34. 5 %, at most. The cytotoxicity test results of the Ames Tests for the water specimens before and after filtration by SDRAC showed that the bacterial survival rate was higher than 80 % of control group, meaning {{that there is no}} cytotoxicity. The mutagenicity results showed that the spontaneous revertants were not exceeded by over two times, suggesting no mutagenicity. The SDRAC; therefore, has functional value of water purification, and can be preliminarily regarded as a safe natural water purifying material...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum <b>distillery</b> <b>residue</b> (SDR), {{one type}} of {{fermentation}} waste, {{was used as the}} precursor to prepare activated carbon (AC) using the method of physics activation with steam– or CO_ 2 –activation. The yield and iodine value of sorghum <b>distillery</b> <b>residue</b> activated carbon (SDRAC) was 15. 74 to 29. 24 % and 113 to 684 mg/g using CO_ 2 –activation, as well as 10. 63 to 26. 07 % and 548 to 770 mg/g using steam–activation. As the iodine value of SDRAC was above 700 mg/g, the methylene blue adsorption value was 143. 56 to 344. 87 mg/g, the BET specific surface area was 502. 7 to 530. 1 m ^ 2 /g, the average pore diameter ranged from 2. 89 to 3. 18 nm and the true density was 1. 86 to 1. 97 g/cm ^ 3. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the SDRAC were classified as Type IV, indicating the presence of microporous and mesoporous structures, according to the Bruauer, Deming, Deming and Teller (BDDT) Classification, and were H 3 type hysteresis loops for most of the mesoporous structures in accordance with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). SDR, with a suitable activation condition, can serve as an excellent precursor for preparing AC because the iodine value and the BET specific surface area of the resulting SDRAC can be reached at the commercial value. SDRAC is able to be applied to liquid absorption, such as water purification, due to its mesoporous structure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{components}} of a cane flexi-factory consist of a sugar factory, cogeneration power plant, refinery and a <b>distillery.</b> Bagasse, a <b>residue</b> obtained from the crushing a sugar cane in the sugar factory, is burnt in in an boiler of an annexed cogeneration plant to produce superheated steam which is then fed in a condensing extraction steam turbine coupled with an alternator to produce electricity and low pressure and temperature steam. The latter is used as process heat to produce raw sugar and refined sugar in the sugar factory and refinery respectively. Although the Mauritian sugar cane factories are equipped with the latest technology such as efficient electric motors equipped with variable speed drives, diffusers, automated systems, real-time monitoring of processes, efficient pumps, opportunities exist for a reduction in energy consumption for the evaporating process. Analysis of heat consumed by a flexi-factory shows that the five effect evaporator used by its sugar factory {{is by far the}} largest consumers. Robert and Kestner types of evaporators are mainly used. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the reduced steam consumption of a multiple effect evaporator by adding one effect of falling thin film evaporator type. Results shows that a savings of 41. 5 kg/h of steam consumption per ton of cane crushed can be achieved. This amount of steam saved will be used by cogeneration power plants to produce an additional amount of 18 GWh electricity annually...|$|R
