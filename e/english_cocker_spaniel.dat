5|$|Cocker Spaniels are dogs {{belonging}} to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American Cocker Spaniel and the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> {{both of which}} are commonly called simply Cocker Spaniel in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting Spaniels.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine {{was a large}} {{breed of}} spaniel, {{described}} as reaching two feet at the withers and six feet from the nose to the tail. It had a closely set coat, curlier {{than that of the}} <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> or the English Springer Spaniel. An intelligent breed, it was particularly adapted to the climate of the Swiss Alps.|$|E

5|$|The Russian Spaniel {{resembles the}} <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> {{with a body}} similar to the field lines of that breed though with the longer ears of the show line. The body of the Russian Spaniel tends to be longer {{than that of the}} English Cocker however, and the breed has only one line rather than being split into {{separate}} specific show and field lines of the same breed.|$|E
5|$|The dog who is {{considered}} to be the father of the modern <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> is Ch. Obo, who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother. Obo's son Ch. Obo II {{is considered}} to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel, who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the breed}} had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders {{on either side of the}} Atlantic had created {{different}} breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> as a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, The Kennel Club {{registered}} 424 Welsh Springer Spaniels, {{compared with}} 12,599 English Springer <b>Spaniels</b> and 13,445 <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels.</b> Numbers remained steady, with 420 Welsh Springer Spaniels being registered in 2004, however numbers of English Springer Spaniels increased to 14,765 and <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels</b> to 16,608. Numbers remain {{closer to the}} American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004. The breed remains more popular than some other breeds of Spaniel, including the Clumber Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. Total registrations in the UK during 2016 fell to 299 qualifying it to be included on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is study of the {{available}} literature sources that deal with issue of color, temperament and effect of color to character traits of <b>English</b> <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> and assess difference of temperament between solid coloured and particoloured lines of <b>English</b> <b>cockers</b> in the Czech Republic.

5|$|The Russian Spaniel is the {{youngest}} of the Russian gundogs. It originated mostly from <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels</b> and <b>English</b> Springer Spaniels. Breeds known as Russian Spaniels have been mentioned as early as 1891 in New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had {{a median}} {{lifespan}} of about 10 to 11 years, {{which is on}} {{the low end of the}} typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{remains a}} rare breed, {{even in the}} UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were {{registered}} with The Kennel Club {{and has been in}} steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} findings associated with pulsus alternans in <b>English</b> <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> with dilated cardiomyopathy and {{to review the}} phenomenon of mechanical alternans, usually found in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Methods: The case records of 10 <b>English</b> <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> with dilated cardiomyopathy and pulsus alternans were reviewed. All dogs had been referred in moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Pulsus alternans was clinically recognised by palpation of a regular alternation of femoral pulse amplitude and confirmed by echocardiography in all cases. Pulsus alternans was an intermittent finding in all 10 dogs. Results: Phonocardiographic recordings were obtained in three dogs to document variation in {{the intensity of the}} heart sounds, with one case exhibiting absence of the second heart sound in alternate beats. M-mode echocardiography performed in all dogs showed alternation of the pattern of mitral valve diastolic motion. Doppler echocardiography showed marked alternation in stroke volume in the aortic outflow in all cases. It also showed alternation in mitral regurgitation and in the velocity of early ventricular filling. Clinical Significance: Pulsus alternans may be more prevalent in <b>English</b> <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> than in other breeds, and because of its intermittent nature, its incidence may be higher than that previously reported. It has diagnostic relevance as it usually indicates severe myocardial depression. Echocardiography allows non-invasive detection of mechanical alternans and provides further insights into its pathophysiology and clinical significance. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{very rare}} genetic {{disorder}} of sexual development {{which has been}} observed in one dog of this breed is a testicular/ovotesticular disorder, which can result in dogs that are genetically female (XX) developing testes or ovotestes instead of ovaries. This disorder was formerly referred to as SRY-negative XX sex reversal, and is more commonly documented in American and <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are two modern breeds of cocker spaniel, the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and {{to use their}} eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} United States, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked the 23rd most popular breed {{according}} to registration statistics of the AKC in 2009, {{a decrease in}} popularity since 1999 when it was ranked 13th. For twenty five years the American Cocker Spaniel {{was the most popular}} dog in America. It was ranked number one first in 1936 prior to the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> being recognized as a separate breed, and held onto the spot until 1952 when Beagles became the most popular dog. It regained the spot in 1983 and held on at number one until 1990. In the UK, the American Cocker Spaniel is far less popular than its English cousin with 322 registrations compared to the English Cocker's 22,211 in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> is {{the most}} {{successful}} breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928. This was mostly due {{to the success of}} dog breeder H.S. Lloyd's Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 19301950. They are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700. The English Cocker's popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th.|$|E
50|$|His daughter, Jennifer Lloyd Carey, {{like her}} father and {{grandfather}} became a breeder of <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels.</b> At the age of 11 in 1948 she attended Crufts {{for the first time}} at the show where H.S. Lloyd's Tracey Witch of Ware won Best in Show. As of 2011, she became the longest-running Crufts competitor, having shown dogs at the competition for the first time in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|The eh sable {{extension}} allele {{has been}} studied only in <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels</b> and produces sable {{in the presence of}} dominant black KB and tan point at/at.

50|$|The {{genetics}} behind roan {{dogs are}} still unclear, and at present candidate genes have been ruled out. There remains {{a great deal}} of ambiguity in terminology regarding mottled dogs, which are called roan, ticked, mottled and belton depending on the context. The roan or ticked color is described in many breeds of gundogs such as <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> <b>English</b> Springer Spaniels, Field Spaniels and Brittanys, German Longhaired Pointers, German Shorthaired Pointers, Spinoni Italiani, Lagotto Romagnolos and English Setters, as well as Border Collies and many other breeds.|$|R
5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> the German Shepherd and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, {{the most common cause of}} death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second most common cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} some of {{the characteristics}} of a cardiomyopathy in <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels.</b> Forty‐nine dogs from a kennel with a history of a cardiomyopathy were assessed clinically, electrocardiographically and radiographically. Angiography, haemodynamic and post‐mortem examinations were carried out on selected dogs. On electrocardiographic (ECG) and radiographic criteria the dogs were classified into five groups. Twenty‐six dogs (Group 1) were normal. Seven dogs (Group 2) showed ECG changes compatible with left or biventricular hypertrophy in the absence of radiographic abnormality. This was interpreted as concentric hypertrophy. Seven dogs (Group 3) showed ECG and radiographic evidence of cardiac hypertrophy with five of the seven exhibiting enlargement of both chambers. The changes were considered to be compatible with eccentric hypertrophy. Post‐mortem findings in dogs with ECG characteristics of Groups 2 and 3 have shown concentric hypertrophy in three cases and eccentric hypertrophy in one case. Six dogs (Group 4) had right axis deviations. Three dogs (Group 5) showed left axis deviations. It is suggested that a cardiomyopathy exists in <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels</b> initially developing as a concentric hypertrophy and progressing to eccentric hypertrophy. At present the aetiology is unknown...|$|R
5|$|The Russian Spaniel {{is a type}} of spaniel first {{standardised}} in 1951 in the Soviet Union after World War II by cross breeding <b>English</b> <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> <b>English</b> Springer Spaniels {{and other}} spaniel breeds. Physically it is similar to a <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> but has a shorter, tighter coat and a longer body. Developed and used as hunting dogs, this breed does not suffer from any major health complaints other than those normally associated with spaniels. Popular in its native Russia, the breed was only introduced overseas in the 1990s, and is not yet recognised by any major kennel clubs.|$|R
5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to blindness.
