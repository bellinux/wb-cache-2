Sharks are captured both for their meat and for use of their fins in shark fin soup.|$|E
30|$|The energy {{consumption}} of device node consists of ten parts {{as shown in}} Equation 69. The first part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> backoff. The second part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> CCA transmission. The third part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> data packet transmission using CSMA/CA in CAP. The fourth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> request GTS. The fifth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> data packet transmission using GTS in CFP. The sixth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> waiting due to deferred transmission. The seventh part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> idle. The eighth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> receiving beacon. The ninth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> receiving ACK if transmitting packet is successful, and the tenth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> ACK if transmission packet using GTS is successful.|$|R

5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> Some related species such as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{numerous}} laws that {{form part of}} kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of certain animals (such as pork, shellfish (both Mollusca and Crustacea)) and most insects, {{with the exception of}} certain species of kosher locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to a process known as shechita. There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact the suitability of food <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
30|$|The energy {{consumption}} of coordinator node consists of seven parts {{as shown in}} Equation 70. The first part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> idle. The second part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> transmission beacon. The third part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> receiving data at CSMA/CA in CAP. The fourth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> receiving request for GTS allocation. The fifth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> receiving data at GTS in CFP. The sixth part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> transmitting ACK, if receiving packet successful in CAP. The seventh part is energy <b>consumption</b> <b>for</b> transmitting ACK, if receiving packet GTS is successful in CFP. Finally, the total {{energy consumption}} in networks consist of the energy consumption by devices node and coordinator node as shown in Equation 71.|$|R

5|$|An {{increase}} in criticism and the considerable toxicity {{of the meat}} appears to be achieving the opposite. During the first hunt {{of the season in}} Taiji in 2009, an estimated 50 Pilot Whales and 100 Bottlenose Dolphins were captured. Although all the Pilot Whales were killed, and 30 Bottlenose Dolphins were taken for use in dolphinariums, the 70 remaining animals were set free again instead of being killed <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E

Given this endowment bundle (c,f), the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the Edgeworth box along the Pareto Set (Contract curve). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's Marginal rate of substitution are equal.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crustaceans}} {{are consumed}} by humans, and nearly 10,700,000tons were produced in 2007; {{the vast majority}} of this output is of decapod crustaceans: crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, and prawns. Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> are shrimp and prawns, and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total. Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed, with only 118,000tons of krill being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet.|$|E

5|$|Suillus sibiricus is {{reportedly}} edible, {{but it is}} without any commercial or culinary value. It is one of over 200 species of mushrooms frequently collected <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> in Nepal. Its taste has been described variously by authors as sour (Europe) and not distinctive or slightly bitter (North America). Its odour is not distinctive.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{distributed}} in the Northern Hemisphere, Tricholoma vaccinum is found in northern Asia, Europe and North America. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with spruce or pine trees, and its mushrooms are found on the ground growing in groups or clusters in late summer and autumn. Although some consider the mushroom edible, it is of poor quality and not recommended <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been the subject}} of considerable research.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
