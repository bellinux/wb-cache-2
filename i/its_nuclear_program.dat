25|$|In April 2010, Washington {{stepped up}} its efforts to impose {{a new round of}} {{sanctions}} on Iran over <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Key powers such as Turkey, India and China oppose the adoption of a new round of sanctions against Tehran. As a result, the U.S. Congress has delayed arms sales sought by the Turkish military.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, a Reuters/Ipsos poll {{revealed}} {{that a majority of}} Americans, 56%, would support military action against Iran, even if it led to increased gas prices, if there was evidence demonstrating that Tehran was building nuclear weapons. 39% said that they opposed a military strike, while 62% of Americans said that they'd support Israel striking Iran over <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations {{task force}} on U.S. {{relations}} towards Iran. Among the task force's primary recommendation was to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding Iranian nuclear technology. Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to develop <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> {{in exchange for a}} commitment from Iran to use the program only for peaceful means.|$|E

She supported the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, in part because the United States needed a greater military presence in the region to counter the North Korean threat.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, {{sanctions}} {{have taken a}} serious toll on Iran's economy and people. Since 1979, the United States has led international efforts to use sanctions to influence Iran's policies, including Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Western governments fear is intended for developing the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran counters that <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> is for civilian purposes, including generating electricity and medical purposes.|$|E
25|$|Wilkerson {{said in an}} {{interview}} on BBC Newsnight, January 17, 2007, that an Iranian offer to help stabilise Iraq after the American invasion, was positively received at the State Department, yet turned down by Dick Cheney.

Security Council under Chapter 7, to impose additional sanctions on Iran.|$|E
50|$|North Korea has no <b>nuclear</b> power <b>program</b> currently. Earlier the {{building}} of nuclear plant near Sinpo was started by USSR but construction was cancelled {{due to lack of}} funding. Under the Agreed Framework, North Korea agreed to end <b>its</b> graphite-moderated <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>program</b> in exchange for construction of two PWRs at Kumho, but construction was suspended in November 2003. Under the Six-Party Talks, 19 September 2005 North Korea pledged to end all <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> and return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in exchange for international inspections in return for benefits including energy aid and normalization of relations with Japan and the United States.|$|R

25|$|In June 2010 Stuxnet, an {{advanced}} computer worm was discovered. It {{is believed that}} it had been developed by US and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. In a study conducted by Institute for Science and International Security it is estimated that Stuxnet might have damaged as many as 1,000 centrifuges (10% of all installed) in the Natanz enrichment plant. Other computer viruses and malware, including Duqu and Flame, were reportedly related to Stuxnet. Iran claims that its adversaries regularly engineer sales of faulty equipment and attacks by computer viruses to sabotage <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, Rice {{traveled}} to Israel for meetings with Israeli officials in which nuclear talks with Iran were discussed. Rice's visit, {{the first in}} her role as national security adviser, came as peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed. The Obama administration made clear that Rice's trip was part of regularly scheduled talks and that the stalled Middle East peace discussions were not on the agenda. However, White House Spokesman Jay Carney said negotiations with Iran over <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> would be on the agenda, among other topics.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, North Korea {{signed the}} U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework with the United States. North Korea thereby agreed to end <b>its</b> graphite-moderated <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>program,</b> {{including}} {{the construction of}} a 200 MWe power reactor at Taechon, in exchange for the construction of two 1000-MWe light-water reactors at Kumho. Construction of these was started in 2000 by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, but was suspended in November 2003. Under the Six-Party Talks held on 19 September 2005, North Korea pledged to end all <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> and return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, submitting to international inspections in return for benefits including energy aid and normalization of relations with Japan and the United States.|$|R
25|$|Iran {{consistently}} {{claimed that}} <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> is purely for civilian purposes, {{and that it}} has no intention of ever utilizing its peaceful nuclear program to develop nuclear weapons. During the course of Iran's recent history, specifically during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran has experienced significant outages of its commercial electricity grid. Iran has also continuously claimed that it intends to ultimately export part of the electricity produced by its nuclear reactors to its regional neighbors, as a way of diversifying its mainly oil-based economy to more diversified revenue streams.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Iran’s continued illicit nuclear activities, the United States {{and other countries}} have imposed unprecedented sanctions to censure Iran and prevent its further progress in prohibited nuclear activities, {{as well as to}} persuade Tehran to address the international community’s concerns about <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Acting both through the United Nations Security Council and regional or national authorities, the United States, the member states of the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Canada, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, and others have put in place a strong, inter-locking matrix of sanctions measures relating to Iran's nuclear, missile, energy, shipping, transportation, and financial sectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{future of}} nuclear power varies greatly between countries, {{depending}} on government policies. Some countries, {{many of them in}} Europe, such as Germany, Belgium, and Lithuania, have adopted policies {{of nuclear power}} phase-out. At the same time, some Asian countries, such as China, South Korea, and India, have committed to rapid expansion of nuclear power. Many other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, have policies in between. Japan was a major generator of nuclear power before the Fukushima accident, but as of August 2016, Japan has restarted only three of its nuclear plants, {{and the extent to which}} it will resume <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> is uncertain.|$|E

50|$|The Communist Party of India (Marxist) {{that was}} {{supporting}} the Dr Manmohan Singh government, {{objected to the}} agreement siting reasons that proposal would see the United States supply nuclear technology to India in return for India agreeing to United Nations inspections of <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> and the splitting of the civil and military aspects of those programs. CPI(M) believed that this would cause India to be effectively subservient to the US. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also objected, {{on the grounds that}} the inspections could impede development of the country's <b>nuclear</b> arms <b>program.</b>|$|R
