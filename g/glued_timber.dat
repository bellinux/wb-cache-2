5000|$|The Russian bath (banya) of Novolazarevskaya Station, Schirmacher Oasis, Queen Maud Land (...) , is {{the only}} <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> {{building}} in Antarctica.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the bath was born in 2006 and it became the first {{building}} {{of its kind in}} Antarctica. <b>Glued</b> <b>timber</b> was chosen as the material because of its thermal stability and energy efficiency. The project was developed in the summer of 2006; it was produced and test-built at Greenside's factory in Saint Petersburg, Russia. All engineering systems were first made on a special test model between December 2006 and March 2007 in Greenside's Saint Petersburg factory. <b>Glued</b> <b>timber</b> parts were shipped to Antarctica by the icebreaker Akademik Fyodorov in November 2006.|$|E
50|$|On March 10, 1959, the Soviet Union {{set up the}} {{research}} station Lazarev on the shelf ice {{in the region of}} the Schirmacher Oasis. The station was reinstalled in 1961 into the Oasis and was named Novolazarevskaya. In summer, up to 70 crew members reside at the station. In winter, on average 30 scientists and technicians work at the Novolazarevskaya Station. Research in natural sciences includes geodesy, glaciology, limnology, geomagnetism, geology, biology, meteorology, seismology, and other areas of expertise.On 20 December 2007 the Russian Bath was built near the station. It is the only <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> building in Antarctica.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper will}} {{examine the effect of}} the knots {{distribution}} on strength of <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> beams. The finite element model was made to simulate <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> beams with defects (knots) and to predict behavior in areas containing knots while bending. This model was then compared with results from static bending test of <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> beam. The initial position of the rupture was then compared with the FEM model [6] and thus thee influence of knots on strength could be determined...|$|R
30|$|The use of <b>glued</b> {{laminated}} <b>timber</b> {{products in}} Japanese post and beam housing has grown {{dramatically in the}} last decade. This leads to a growing market for wood lamina which is a prior product for manufacturing glued laminated posts and beams in Japan. The Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) for <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> and structural <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> are dictated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) Notification 1152 [1] and MAFF Notification 235 [2] respectively. This notification provides visual and machine grading requirements for various wood species of lamina. Manufacturers of the <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> {{have the option of}} visually or machine graded lamina on which the strength grades of <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> are based. The choice of the grading methods will often depend on the yields that can be achieved in visual grades as compared to the machine grades [3]. If the actual structural properties of the lamina in a particular species are higher than those visually graded, then there are technical and material benefits to be achieved by machine grading the laminae.|$|R
50|$|Early {{designs of}} the 1920s were often built by amateurs, who {{employed}} the lightest materials {{available to them}} at the time, which were often <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> boarding or plywood on the floor, 4 mm plywood topsides, and varnished canvas decks. Most were about 4 m long and stepped hulls were employed with a 75 mm step to induce air under the hull, to enable the boat to float on air bubbles. The concept of 'planing' was not fully understood. Thus, hulls were flat bottomed with an upward curve at the bow and the step 2/3 of the way aft. The sheer weight of a 100 hp. engine was {{enough to keep the}} bow from digging in. In Ireland the sport was managed by the Motor Yacht Club of Ireland which had a base at the Lough Ree Yacht Club near Athlone.|$|E
40|$|Glued {{connections}} are relatively new in structural timber engineering. They {{are expected to}} show high connection stiffness {{as well as a}} high connection strength compared to mechanical connections e. g. dowel‐type connections. The main aim of this thesis is to characterize the behavior of <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> connections under pure tension by conducting experiments as well as numerical simulations. Hereby the influence of different parameters is studied such as the geometry (bond-line length and thickness) and the material properties (e. g. adhesives of highly diverse stiffness). Additionally, reference tests on a dowel-type connection are made. The purpose is to see the differences between dowelled and glued connections and {{to see if there are}} some advantages in using <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> connections (the base geometry was chosen acc. to Eurocode 5). Finite element models were created in the software ABAQUS. The models were used to predict the connection stiffness and compare this to the experimental results. In addition, parametric studies were performed on e. g. overlapping lengths. The comparison between experiments and simulations showed good agreement. It was found that glued connections with the adhesives SikaPower- 4720 and SikaFast- 5215 NT (an epoxy and an acrylate, respectively) had higher stiffness than the dowel connections, whereas connections with the silicone adhesive SikaSil SG- 500 had a lower stiffness. A general conclusion drawn from this work is that the <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> connections simulated in this project should also be suitable for application to complex connections and situations involving other loading situations than pure tension...|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the strength properties of <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> composed of edge-glued laminae and to investigate the influence of edge gluing on the strength properties. <b>Glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> composed of multiple-grade laminae (symmetrical composition, strength grade E 95 -F 270, 10 laminations) was produced from karamatsu (Larix kaempferi) edge-glued laminae according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard. The bending, tensile, and compressive strengths of the <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> were measured. The average bending, tensile, and compressive strengths were 33.4, 24.5, and 35.9 MPa, respectively, and these values are almost equal to those of <b>glued</b> laminated <b>timber</b> composed of karamatsu single-piece laminae. It was determined that finger-joints and knots in the edge-glued laminae played a significant role in the failure of specimens. However, the use of glued edge-joints did not appear to affect the failure of specimens.|$|R

40|$|The {{bonding quality}} of epoxy <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> and glass fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (GFRP) was evaluated {{by means of}} compression loading shear test. Three timber species (Radiata pine, Laricio pine and Oak) and two kinds of GFRP (plates and rods made with polyester resin reinforced with mat and roving glass fibre) were glued and tested using three epoxy formulations. The increase in shear strength with age after the setting of epoxy formulations {{and the effect of}} surface roughness on timber and GRP gluing (the planing of the surface of timber and the previous sanding of GRP) were studied. It can be concluded that the mechanical properties of these products make them suitable for use in the reinforcement of deteriorated timber structures, and that a rough timber surface is preferable to a planed one, while the previous sanding of GRP surfaces is not advantageous...|$|E

40|$|Cross-laminated timber is an {{environmentally}} friendly material, which possesses a decreased level of anisotropy {{in comparison with}} the solid and <b>glued</b> <b>timber.</b> Cross-laminated timber could be used for load-bearing walls and slabs of multi-storey timber buildings as well as decking structures of pedestrian and road bridges. Design methods of cross-laminated timber elements subjected to bending and compression with bending were considered. The presented methods were experimentally validated and verified by FEM. Two cross-laminated timber slabs were tested at the action of static load. Pine wood was chosen as a board's material. Freely supported beam with the span equal to 1. 9 m, which was loaded by the uniformly distributed load, was a design scheme of the considered plates. The width of the plates was equal to 1 m. The considered cross-laminated timber plates were analysed by FEM method. The comparison of stresses acting in the edge fibres of the plate and the maximum vertical displacements shows that both considered methods can be used for engineering calculations. The difference between the results obtained experimentally and analytically is within the limits from 2 to 31 %. The difference in results obtained by effective strength and stiffness and transformed sections methods was not significant...|$|E
40|$|In the {{graduation}} thesis are presented large finger joints. Large finger joints are <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> joints, used for connecting wooden elements, usually glulam beams. Frequently {{this kind of}} joints connect corners of three – hinged frames, used for building prefabricated timber structures with spans up to 40 m. In comparison with mechanical joints, glued joints are cheaper and they have excellent load – carrying capacity, but poor ductility. I have installed large finger joints in the glulam frame structure, that is figment of my imagination, used for sports activities. In {{the graduation}} thesis is also presented design of large finger joints according to current standards Eurocode and according to old DIN standards, {{with the purpose of}} comparing the design procedures. I have made a tool in Microsoft Excel for calculating load – carrying capacity of direct and insert type of large finger joints in frame corners and large finger joints at straight beams of constant height. The tool was made with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications program, which is a development tool build in Microsoft Excel. At the end of the graduation thesis there are examples and a research about which parameters affect load – carrying capacity of large finger joints...|$|E
40|$|Historically, timber bridges {{always have}} played an {{important}} role for people in crossing the water barriers, depth valleys or other obstacles. In my presentation I would like to give short historical view of timber bridge development in Latvia and some comments about characteristic structures. After that I will give some information about the timber bridges that are maintained today on Latvian roads. And {{at the end of my}} presentation I will give some examples about the proposed new bridges. The first timber bridge in Latvia was found during the archeological investigation on Araishi lake Fortress. Through excavations it was established that the raiši lake Fortress was built and inhabited in the 9 th - 10 th century. Bridge consisted from log beams covered by round timber and supported on timber pale foundations. It was surprising high engineering level. The first large floating bridge over Daugava River near Riga was build by Swedish King Karl XII before his attack on Riga city during the North war in year 1702. The bridge was in service till 1710. The next floating bridge in Riga city was built in 1715 and it was in service till 1896. Golden age for timber bridges in Latvia was the period from the end of 19 century till the II World War. In that time Latvia had high qualified bridge engineers which were able to design and build interesting bridge structures. After the II World War many bridges was destroyed and the major part of them was rebuilt or built as temporary bridges in timber structures. For temporary structures for spans from 12 till 32 m often were used board trusses, consisting from two diagonally nailed board layers. Today on Latvian rods have been maintained 23 timber bridges and bridges with timber elements. Of course today’s timber bridges are not so impressive than the bridges built before the II World War. The timber bridges had limited load carrying capacity and shorter life time if compared with concrete or steel bridges; therefore the use of timber bridges goes down. In 90 ties was reconsidered the advantages of timber as structural material. The new achievements in timber industry, especially in wood protections technologies and use of <b>glued</b> <b>timber,</b> allowed using the timber bridges on rods with less traffic. The timber bridges could be well adopted in surround nature, therefore they have been built in natural parks and rest places. The timber as structural material was out of active use for approximately last 45 years. The purpose was the short life time of sown timber materials and low load carrying capacity of timber bridge structure. Today’s achievements in timber protection systems, new joining methods, possibility to producē the <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> structures with clearly indicated properties, will return the timber as structural material in bridge construction industry...|$|E

40|$|Timber joints with glued-in rods are an {{increasingly}} used technical solution for numerous structural applications, {{and show the}} potential of adhesively bonded connections involving timber and other materials [1]. These joints partially still face scepticism with regard to manufacturing defects that may impact the structural performance of the bonded joint. A major concern is the possible lack of adhesion resulting from inadequate preparation of the joint on site. Previous studies {{on the effect of}} bonding defects on the capacity of bonded joints [2] pointed out a nuanced relationship between defects and joint capacity that depends on the brittleness or ductility of the adhesive. This paper presents experimental evidence followed by numerical investigations to shed light on the relationship between defects and capacity of <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> joints. For this purpose, timber joints with glued-in steel rods were manufactured with different types of defects likely to be encountered during their manufacturing on-site: i) rods placed at an angle to the drill hole instead of being in the joint axis, and ii) rod placed {{at the edge of the}} drill hole instead of fully centred. The effect of these defects on joint capacity was investigated with three different adhesives in combination with three different rod anchorage lengths: firstly, on the stresses caused by uniaxial tension loading using numerical modelling, secondly on the joint capacities using experiments. The experimental investigating of the influence of manufacturing defects on the capacity of timber joints with glued-in steel rods, completed by numerical calculations, demonstrated that joints with sufficient rod anchorage (herein 10 times the rod diameter) do not exhibit a statistically significant loss of capacity, if compared to defect free joints...|$|E
40|$|Glued-in rods are an {{increasingly}} used technical solution for numerous structural applications in timber engineering, and demonstrate {{the potential of}} adhesively bonded connections. During the insertion process the adhesive fills a very narrow gap over significant anchorage contact area, raising concerns that manufacturing defects may impact the structural performance of the bonded joint, namely the possible lack of adhesion resulting from inadequate preparation of the joint on site. Previous studies {{on the effect of}} bonding defects on the capacity of bonded joints identified a nuanced relationship that depends on the ductility of the adhesive. This paper presents experimental evidence that sheds light on the relationship between defects and capacity of <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> joints. Joints composed of softwood glulam members and mild steel glued-in threaded rods were manufactured with two types of defects likely to be encountered on-site: i) rods placed at an angle inside drill hole instead of aligned with the joint axis, and ii) rod placed {{against the side of the}} drill hole instead of fully centered. To establish performance benchmarks a first phase studied the influence of the anchorage length and the rod diameter using three different adhesives. The effect of these defects on joint capacity was investigated with three different adhesives in combination with three different rod anchorage lengths. The investigations demonstrated that joints with sufficient rod anchorage (herein 10 times the rod diameter) do not exhibit a statistically significant loss of capacity, if compared to defect free joints. These results can contribute towards better understanding of the influence that the studied parameters have on the performance on timber joints with glued-in rods, as well as to translate this information to promote the development of further applications...|$|E

40|$|As the world’s {{population}} and welfare {{are on the}} rise, the pressure on natural resources such as timber is increasing rapidly. Therefore, it is becoming ever more important that the consumption of these materials becomes more efficient by enhancing the recycling- and reuse economy. This research scopes down to one product in particular: timber. This research is aimed at 1) identifying technical options {{that can be used}} to improve timber use efficiency in the construction industry, and 2) exploring the factors that determine the feasibility of implementing these technical options. Industrial ecology literature is used to identify, five options and their technical potential to reduce the amount of timber waste: prefabrication, Industrial Flexible Demountable (IFD) construction, timber skeleton construction, <b>glued</b> <b>timber</b> construction and selective removal of timber for reuse and recycling. Additionally, governance literature is examined to understand the social dimension of implementation. To be able to obtain insight on the feasibility of implementing these options in the construction sector, interviews are conducted with public actors, private actors and the scientific community. Representatives from licensing authorities, commissioning authorities, designers, contractors, branch organizations and knowledge brokers were included. The results generated by these interviews indicate that the progress towards implementing technical options to improve timber use efficiency is slow. The factors that influence the feasibility of implementation process relate to actor characteristics, institutional context within which the construction industry functions, and the policy content that regulates this industry. As for the actor-based features, results indicate that the feasibility of creating a coalition between the above mentioned actor groups is compromised due to competing interests and priorities between them. With regard to institutional features, project-based cooperation and changing constellations of actors result in a lack of knowledge institutionalization and shared responsibility, which limit the opportunities for improving timber use efficiency. The influence of the policy content on timber use efficiency is weak; licensing authorities devote little attention to timber use efficiency. The main focus appears to be on regulating energy consumption during the use phase of buildings. This research provides the reader with an in-depth understanding of how these factors influence the implementation of options that improve timber use efficiency...|$|E
