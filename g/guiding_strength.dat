40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} parabolic bow-tie laser arrays (PBTLAs) which are a novel category of laser diodes specially designed to achieve high power with high brightness at 980 nm. Output powers in excess of 2. 8 W/facet have been measured from five-element PBTLAs with output beam less than twice the diffraction limit, achieving high brightness of 275 MWcm/sup - 2 /srad/sup - 1 / at 3 A (pulsed) injection current (= 22 times the threshold). Changes in the achievable brightness due {{to changes in the}} optical cavity geometry and in the lateral optical <b>guiding</b> <b>strength</b> are discussed in detail, using the coupled-mode theory to interpret the experimental results. At threshold all devices operate in the highest (double lobed) array mode. At higher currents the arrays of tapered lasers change to quasi-in-phase operation when the modal gain of the fundamental array mode dominates because of the combined effect of carrier hole burning and spatial filtering from the narrow stripe central section of the device. Similar trends have been observed under continuous-wave operation. The reduction of lateral optical <b>guiding</b> <b>strength</b> is deleterious for the operational characteristics of PBTLAs and linear bow-tie arrays, and it leads to filamentation in gain-guided devices even at low currents. Theoretical results presented in this paper show that scalability is in principle possible; however, changes in the lateral gain profile due to hole-burning can significantly increase the modal gain of higher order modes and, therefore, strongly influence the optical output profile...|$|E
40|$|We apply a novel {{optimization}} scheme {{from the}} image processing and machine learning areas, a fast Primal-Dual method, to achieve controllable and realistic fluid simulations. While our method is generally applicable to many problems in fluid simulations, {{we focus on}} the two topics of fluid guiding and separating solid-wall boundary conditions. Each problem is posed as an optimization problem and solved using our method, which contains acceleration schemes tailored to each problem. In fluid guiding, we are interested in partially guiding fluid motion to exert control while preserving fluid characteristics. With our method, we achieve explicit control over both large-scale motions and small-scale details which is valuable for many applications, such as level-of-detail adjustment (after running the coarse simulation), spatially varying <b>guiding</b> <b>strength,</b> domain modification, and resimulation with different fluid parameters. For the separating solid-wall boundary conditions problem, our method effectively eliminates unrealistic artifacts of fluid crawling up solid walls and sticking to ceilings, requiring few changes to existing implementations. We demonstrate the fast convergence of our Primal-Dual method with a variety of test cases for both model problems. Comment: 14 pages, 18 figures, supplemental video [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, fabrication, characterisation and theoretical modelling of oxide confined GaAs/AlGaAs VCSELs operating around 850 nm wavelength. Three VCSEL structures utilising different oxide aperture thickness were designed. The oxide apertures contained in these VCSELs {{can be easily}} formed through the selective wet oxidation process. Detailed experimental investigations were performed on these devices with emphasis placed on the dependence of the resonant wavelength characteristics, the threshold and modal properties on the aperture size and oxide thickness. A feasibility study of polarisation control through using nonsymmertical apertures was also carried out. These experimental activities were supplemented by theoretical modelling which included calculation of resonant wavelengths and eigenmode sizes using a scalar variational method that assumed Hermite-Gaussian transverse field variations. In addition, the light-current characteristics {{of the first two}} eigenmodes were also simulated by solving the photon and carrier rate equations, after their modal reflectance and transmittance had been calculated. The theoretical predictions were then compared with the experimental findings and ways of improving the model have also been suggested. The oxide apertures in these VCSELs provides both current constriction and optical confinement. The resultant index <b>guiding</b> <b>strength</b> is dependent on the thickness {{as well as on the}} longitudinal position of the oxide. Devices with stronger guiding have smaller mode sizes which results in lower modal reflectance, larger blue shifts in resonant wavelengths from that of plane wave values, and larger wavelength separations between the fundamental mode and the higher order modes. Devices with smaller aperture sizes also have larger spectral separations and blue shift in resonant wavelengths. When the symmetry in aperture shape is broken, the wavelength degeneracy between the TEM, o and TEM 0, mode is also broken. Among the three VCSEL structures, the one with the strongest guiding provides single mode operation at larger aperture size and is less affected by thermal lensing effects. However, lower threshold currents and higher efficiencies can be obtained from devices with weakest guiding. Despite being more susceptible to thermal lensing effects, single mode power up to 1. 72 mW and threshold current as low as 350 μA can be obtained from devices with weakest guiding design...|$|E

40|$|Predicting from first-principles {{calculations}} whether mixed metallic elements phase-separate or form ordered structures is a {{major challenge}} of current materials research. It can be partially addressed in cases where experiments suggest the underlying lattice is conserved, using cluster expansion (CE) {{and a variety of}} exhaustive evaluation or genetic search algorithms.

We present an integrated approach of CE and high-throughput ab initio calculations (HT) applicable to the full range of compositions in binary systems where the constituent elements or the intermediate ordered structures have different lattice types. The HT method replaces the search algorithms by direct calculation of a moderate number of naturally occurring prototypes representing all crystal systems and guides CE calculations of derivative structures.

Statistical analyses showed significant differences between gender and dancer seniority levels.

The two flux ropes, or the two current channels embedded in the external magnetic field, are produced by two identical plasma guns.

40|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that magnetic reconnection {{is the dominant}} process at the magnetopause that enables the transfer of mass, momentum, and energy from the solar wind into the Earth's magnetosphere. Observations have also shown that magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause can sometimes be quasi-steady but at other times very unsteady (resulting in so-called flux transfer events). The reason for this dual behavior is, however, not understood. Another issue of considerable controversy is {{the existence of a}} "universal" reconnection rate, independent of the system size. Here we use a combination of hybrid (electron fluid, kinetic ions) and full particle simulations to address these issues. Our previous work using hybrid simulations has shown that reconnection can be intermittent even in the anti-parallel case.
