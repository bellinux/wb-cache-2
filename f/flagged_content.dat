Results of analysis of variance indicated significant difference between generations for all the traits. Degree of dominance revealed over-dominance for all the traits.

Estimation of heritability and mode of gene action indicated that selection for improvement of traits studied in stress condition and specifically in early generations have medium genetic gain.

It is therefore imperative to have a wide-ranging understanding of water stress effects on crop physiological processes so as to better manage, improve and adapt crops to future climates. A field study was carried out to investigate the influence of four moisture levels on the following: (1) flag leaf CO 2 assimilation and flag leaf carbon content; (2) the utility of flag leaf spectral reflectance to monitor leaf water status and as an indicator of biomass and grain yield; and (3) biomass and grain yield performance of four spring triticale genotypes in a dry winter environment (steppe, arid climate). The experiment was carried out in a factorial arrangement of four moisture levels and four spring type triticale genotypes). Soil moisture level significantly influenced biomass accumulation, grain yield, CO 2 assimilation, <b>flag</b> leaf carbon <b>content</b> and spectral reflectance. Grain yield levels ranged from 0. 8 to 3. 5 t ha(- 1) in 2013 and 1. 8 to 4. 9 t ha(- 1) in 2014. CO 2 assimilation was significantly higher under well-watered (WW) conditions (9. 92 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) in 2013; 11. 64 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) in 2014) and decreased gradually with moisture level to 1. 82 and 4. 74 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) under severe stress (SS) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. <b>Flag</b> leaf carbon <b>content</b> was significantly higher under water limited conditions compared to WW. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Water Index (WI) were significant and positively correlated to biomass and grain yield. WI was particularly strongly correlated to biomass (0. 72 ***) and grain yield (0. 55 ***). However, no clear varietal effects were detected. This study revealed that carbon tends to accumulate in flag leaves under water stress and that <b>flag</b> leaf carbon <b>content</b> is influenced more by the export capacity of the flag leaves than on CO 2 assimilation rate.

40|$|On torsion in the cohomology {{of locally}} {{symmetric}} varieties Peter ScholzeAbstract. The main {{result of this}} paper is the existence of Galois representations associated with the mod p (or mod pm) cohomology of the locally symmetric spaces for GLn over a totally real or CM field, proving conjectures of Ash and others. Following an old suggestion of Clozel, recently realized by Harris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne for characteristic 0 cohomology classes, one realizes the cohomology of the locally symmetric spaces for GLn as a boundary contribution of the cohomology of symplectic or unitary Shimura varieties, so that the key problem is to understand torsion in the cohomology of Shimura varieties. Thus, we prove new results on the p-adic geometry of Shimura varieties (of Hodge type). Namely, the Shimura varieties become perfectoid when passing to the inverse limit over all levels at p, and a new period map towards the flag variety exists on them, called the Hodge-Tate period map. It is roughly analogous to the embedding of the hermitian symmetric domain (which is roughly the inverse limit over all levels of the complex points of the Shimura variety) into its compact dual. The Hodge-Tate period map has several favorable properties, the most important being that it commutes with the Hecke operators away from p (for the trivial action of these Hecke operators on the flag variety), and that automorphic vector bundles come via pullback from the <b>flag</b> variety. <b>Content...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. User {{generated}} video content {{has become}} increasingly popular, {{with a large number}} of internet video sharing portals appearing. Many portals wish to rapidly find and remove objectionable material from the uploaded videos. This paper considers the flagging of uploaded videos as potentially objectionable due to sexual content of an adult nature. Such videos are often characterized by the presence of a large amount of skin, although other scenes, such as close-ups of faces, also satisfy this criterion. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} introduce to this task two uses of contextual information in the form of detected faces. The first is to use a combination of different face detectors to adjust the parameters of the skin detection model. The second is through the summarization of a video in the form of a path in a skin-face plot. This plot allows potentially objectionable segments of videos to be found, while ignoring segments containing close-ups of faces. The proposed approach runs in real-time. Experiments are done on per pixel annotated and challenging on-line videos from an on-line service provider to prove our approach. Large scale experiments are carried out on 200 popular public video clips from web platforms. These are chosen from the community (top-rated) and cover a large variety of different skin-colors, illuminations, image quality and difficulty levels.

The effect of subsoiling in fallow period on soil water storage, accumulation of proline, and formation of grain protein after anthesis were determined. Our results showed that subsoiling in fallow period could increase water storage in the 0 – 300 cm soil at pre-sowing stage and at anthesis stage with low or medium N application, especially for the 60 – 160 cm soil. However, the proline content, glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity in flag leaves and grains were all decreased by subsoiling in fallow period. In addition, the content of albumin, gliadin, and total protein in grains were also decreased while globulin content, Glu/Gli, protein yield, and glutelin content were increased. With N application increasing, water storage of soil layers from 20 to 200 cm was decreased at anthesis stage. High N application resulted in the increment of proline content and GS activity in grains. Besides, correlation analysis showed that soil storage in 40 – 160 cm soil was negatively correlated with proline content in grains; proline content in grains was positively correlated with GS and GDH activity in <b>flag</b> leaves. <b>Contents</b> of albumin, globulin and total protein in grains were positively correlated with proline content in grains and GDH activity in flag leaves.
