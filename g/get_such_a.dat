Before he was allowed to take office, however, the appointment was blocked and David Finney, the cousin of Thomas McKean, was given the seat.

25|$|The 2015 {{regional}} election {{was the first}} to produce a majority for openly separatist parties. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insisted that Spain's constitution does not allow a region to secede. Spain's Basque Country unsuccessfully tried to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> move approved in Parliament in 2008. Catalan president Artur Mas instead scheduled an independence referendum for 2014, which was downgraded to being a more informal ballot after further intervention by the Constitutional Court. The dispute remains unresolved, as of March 2015.|$|E
25|$|The PPACA {{also made}} some changes to Medicare enrollee’s’ benefits. By 2020, it will close the {{so-called}} “donut hole” between Part D plans’ coverage limits and the catastrophic cap on out-of-pocket spending, reducing a Part D enrollee’s’ {{exposure to the}} cost of prescription drugs by an average of $2,000 a year. This lowered costs for about 5% of the people on Medicare. Limits were also placed on out-of-pocket costs for in-network care for public Part C health plan enrollees. Most of these plans had such a limit but ACA formalized the annual out of pocket spend limit. Beneficiaries on traditional Medicare do not <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> limit but can effectively arrange for one through private insurance.|$|E

25|$|The coffee {{companies}} of Houston formed the Greater Houston Coffee Association in fall 2000. The industry {{then tried to}} make Houston a major coffee shipping port. Coffee sold through futures contracts may only be shipped to a New York Board of Trade-certified port, and Texas's ad valorem tax on warehouse inventories {{made it impossible for}} Houston to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> certification. The tax was written into the Constitution of Texas, so the Greater Houston Coffee Association asked State Representative Joe E. Moreno and State Senator Mario Gallegos to present a constitutional amendment bill to exempt cocoa and coffee stored in Harris County warehouses from the tax. Voters approved the amendment in 2001. Since then Houston's role as a coffee port increased. After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, much of the traffic switched to Houston.|$|E

But there was another level of {{reaction}} coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama," [...] he said. [...] "It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one – maybe a documentarian."

500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I never thought I would <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{offered a}} more {{positive}} impression of the piece. The Examiner celebrated Etty's having [...] "outdone his former self, {{and most of his}} contemporaries". A reviewer in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction said that [...] "few pictures have attracted or deserved more attention than this masterly production," [...] describing the figures as [...] "graceful and elegant". The Athenaeum thought it [...] "decidedly the most attractive picture in the whole Exhibition", noting that their review was delayed because in the opening week of the exhibition, [...] "the crowds which continually stood in front of it rendered it quite impossible to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> view of it as would enable us to do it justice". Colburn's New Monthly Magazine considered it [...] "another instance of the rapid advances which this rising artist is making towards perfection." [...] The most effusive praise was offered in poetic form by [...] John Taylor, who in September 1828 imagined that if Milton and Nicolas Poussin were both alive to see the painting, Milton would view it with [...] "proud delight", while Poussin would suffer an [...] "envious thorn" [...] with the realization that Etty's abilities had surpassed his own.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Bannerghatta is {{the first}} {{biological}} park in India to have a fenced forested elephant sanctuary where elephants can roam around freely without chains. A newly captured elephant was bought here. It was a herculean task to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge animal to the national park. During offloading, it got stuck in the truck, cranes were called to ensure safety of this animal. Presence of elephant expert Carol Buckley made sure that chirag suffered no further troubles. His eating habits were also taken care of, which primarily includes grass. [...] It is designed by elephant expert Carol Buckley and covers an area of 122 acres. The fence is sponsored by animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, which raised funds of Rs. 1 crore for its installation. “The elephants are absolutely free to roam without human interference, and will be free of tussles with other wild elephants,” Manilal Valliyate, PETA India's Director of Veterinary Affairs was quoted saying in an interview to The Hindu. According to a report published in Times of India, US elephant expert Margaret Whittaker {{came up with the}} innovative idea after visiting BBP last year. She gave the local mahouts training on 'protected contact' with the jumbos. This leads to safe interaction between human beings and elephants by keeping them separated {{while at the same time}} using positive techniques to manage the animals.|$|E
