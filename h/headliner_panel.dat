50|$|Woodbridge may be {{best known}} as an {{automotive}} foam supplier. These technologies are used in applications such as: seats, head restraints, arm rests, <b>headliners,</b> instrument <b>panels,</b> floor systems, cargo management compartments and various safety components.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1966, IH also offered the Scout 800 Sportop, which had an {{upgraded}} interior and a unique fiberglass top (also {{available as a}} convertible) with a slanted rear roof and a continental spare tire kit. The [...] "Champagne Series" [...] Scout was a high-option Scout offered in the Scout 80 and later Scout 800 models. The Champagne series was another [...] "Doll Up Scout" [...] that featured a <b>headliner,</b> door <b>panels</b> and carpet.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Blacktop package", {{based on}} SE and SXT, came {{equipped}} with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with gloss black pockets, a gloss black grille, black headlamp bezels, an all-black interior including <b>headliner,</b> door <b>panels</b> and console, unique black cloth seats and door trim panels with silver accent stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with silver accent stitching and a leather shift knob, choice of 6 body colors (Granite Crystal, Billet Silver, Brilliant Black, Maximum Steel, Redline Red, Bright White). SXT models also include fog lamps.|$|R
50|$|The stylist {{responsible}} {{for the design of}} the vehicle interior develops the proportions, shape, placement, and surfaces for the instrument panel, seats, door trim <b>panels,</b> <b>headliner,</b> pillar trims, etc. Here the emphasis is on ergonomics and the comfort of the passengers. The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).|$|R
30|$|The {{manufactured}} polyester fabrics {{are usually}} laminated with foam and a lightweight fabric ‘scrim’. These are manufactured to a schedule and then shipped to a cut and sew company. These companies, often {{part of the}} final seat manufacturer, receive the fabric in roll form and mechanically cut parts which are then sewn {{together to create a}} seat cover. The covers are then usually shipped, often over long distances, to where the seat itself is being made, where they are incorporated into the final seat. The seat is then sequenced in trackside as the car they are destined for is being made just in time; the seat assembler receives notification of which type, colour and style manufacture of the seat is required a few hours before it is required to meet the rest of the car on the assembly line. Other parts, e.g., engines, <b>headliners,</b> instrument <b>panels,</b> doors etc. are equally sequenced in.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a version}} of Touareg with seats with {{two-tone}} leather combination [...] "Nappa" [...] upholstery in 2 colour combinations (Pepper Beige-Titan Black, Dark Burgundy-Titan Black), heated front seats with electric 12-way settings, electro-pneumatically adjustable backrest side bolsters and head restraints with longitudinal and height adjustment; leather door inserts, a black <b>headliner</b> and sill <b>panel</b> strips in stainless steel with exclusive lettering, decorative elements made from real wood in [...] "Olive Silk Gloss", 19-inch [...] "Salamanca" [...] alloy wheels in Sterling Silver (no-cost optional 19-inch Girona wheel, optional 20-inch [...] "Tarragona" [...] wheel), Chrome & Style package, roof rails in anodised silver.|$|R
40|$|There is good {{potential}} {{for use of}} Reclaimed fibers such as cotton, Polyester in moldable nonwoven materials for automotive applications. Variety of automotive parts, such as <b>headliner,</b> wall <b>panels,</b> trunk liners, parcel shelves, and hood sound insulators with excellent shape stability can be manufactured by conventional techniques. These fibers are coupled with economic and environmental benefits. The thermal insulation properties of the nonwoven materials were determined, in accordance with ASTM, using the new thermal conductivity tester. The experimental data show that thermal insulation properties of the nonwoven materials vary significantly, {{depending on the type}} of Reclaimed fibre [...] This research work starts with opening and segregating the reclaimed fibers. Later the fibers get transformed to a non-woven, by passing it through a sequence of operations, which encompass the mechanical web laying technique, the aerodynamic principle and chemical bonding. The focus of this research is to produce compostable used fibre based non-woven. These non-woven disposed off after their intended use in an eco-friendly way. Implementing this innovative method reduces the production cost of automobile interior products...|$|R
50|$|From 1977 to 1980 IH {{contracted}} with Midas Van Conversion Co. of Elkhart, Indiana, to build special luxury models {{to be offered}} through its dealers. These vehicles had swivel bucket seats, shag carpet, color keyed interiors, door <b>panels,</b> <b>headliner,</b> grille guards, dual sunroofs, overhead clocks, 3rd seat, reading lights, tinted windows, fender flares, and special side appliques and paint designs. Models included the Family Cruiser (or just Cruiser), the Street Machine, and Off-Road Vehicle. Another company called Van American (Goshen, Indiana) offered similar options to compete with Midas; however these vehicles were only offered for a short time, making them very rare today. See one here.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{polyurethane}} is utilized extensively as a foam or varnish. Seats, dashboard instrument <b>panels,</b> <b>headliners,</b> and bumpers {{are common}} uses for polyurethane in automobiles. The solid wheels used on rollerblades, skateboards, and shopping carts are often entirely made of polyurethane. Modern medicine uses polyurethane for artificial heart valves {{and as a}} transparent varnish for many prosthetic devices. The construction industry uses polyurethane for insulation, molding, and other residential fixtures. Other identifiable uses for polyurethane include Wilson tennis grips, Seiko watch-bands, Gorilla Glue, and Excel Adhesive. It is unlikely {{that many of these}} products would have been manufactured on an industrial scale without Hanford’s original process.|$|R
5000|$|The Automotive Experience {{business}} unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers. It {{is one of}} the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world. The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world. A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, <b>headliners,</b> door <b>panels,</b> instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors. Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics. Brands produced under this {{business unit}} include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper. As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide. On June 6, 2015, Johnson Controls had scheduled an exit from the automotive seating business to concentrate on core business of building ventilation and automotive batteries. [...] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.|$|R
50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau http://www.poltronafrau.com/portal/page/portal/UI/webpages/poltronafrau/home?lang=en of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door <b>panels,</b> <b>headliner,</b> carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door pull handle.|$|R
50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the plush leather interior was designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau of Italy. The seats were made by Poltrona Frau at a rate of only five a day. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement used in the larger Nissan Infiniti Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door <b>panels,</b> <b>headliner,</b> carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door pull handle. This version of the Leopard was the first car sold in Japan to include a passenger-side airbag as standard equipment.|$|R
30|$|Often {{described}} as tiered, {{up to four}} tiers excluding the OEMs, tier 1 supplies interior compartments, e.g. seats, engines, floors; tier 2 carries out subassembly activities such as cut and sew and supply parts such as headliners; tier 3 supplies the manufacturing for the upholstery whilst tier 4 supplies the materials (Shishoo 2008). Tiers 1 and 2 companies may be integrated, and ‘cut and sew’ operations may {{be carried out by}} the same company. Fabric laminators supply their services the cut and sew operations (Tier 2). The fabric formation companies may also conduct fabric lamination in-house or out-source. There are many permutations; companies may supply yarn directly to the fabric formation company, foam and scrim directly to a fabric lamination company or only yarn to the fabric formation company and the fabric formation company supplies the scrim to the fabric lamination company. Moreover, the three companies may be integrated (Taylor 2012). An example is the consolidation by tier 1 companies. The OEMs, frustrated by the increasingly longer lead times and operational constraints, only worked with fabric suppliers with cut and sew operations. Tier 1 companies (e.g. Johnson Controls) have bought out fabric companies and become vertically integrated companies with control of upstream and downstream activities making the full range of products from seats, instrument <b>panels,</b> <b>headliners,</b> etc. With 25 % of the market, Johnson Controls vertical integration captures increasing amount of value along the chain but loses flexibility and speed. The independent status of Sage AI is advantageous because it affords flexibility and speed within the system (Taylor 2012).|$|R
40|$|Natural fiber {{composites}} {{have got}} more focus {{in recent times}} due to their intrinsic properties such as lightweight, biodegradable, low cost etc. Several researchers have made bio-composites out of many natural fibers such as jute, flax, sisal. These composites have large market in Europe and North America where it is used in automobile and construction industry. A lot of {{research has been done}} to improve the properties such as surface modification of fiber, manufacturing hybrid composites. However, the natural fibers are dissimilar and vary largely due to many factors such as variety, harvest, maturity, climate etc. Apart from technical drawbacks, these fibers grow only in certain countries such as India and China. High demand raised the price of these fibers which increases the product price as well. Wood-based fibers such as Lyocell and Viscose was used to make composites in order to make less variation in products, decrease the dependency of natural fibers, promoting locally available fibers and encourage forest products as value-added products. Lyocell and viscose fibers have relatively less variation and high quality. Bio-composites were made by reinforcing wood-based fibers in soybean based thermoset matrix. Hybrid composites were prepared by mixing two different wood-based fibers in known ratio. The fiber content in the composites was between 40 and 60 weight%. Mechanical properties were characterized by tensile, flexural and impact tests. Lyocell and viscose based composites had better mechanical properties than jute fiber composites. Alkali treatment of Lyocell fibers improved the mechanical properties of the composites. The behaviour of wood-based fiber composites were studied under wet environment as well. In wet environment, the mechanical properties of wood-based fiber composites were superior to jute fiber composites. Lyocell based composites had tensile strength of 135 MPa and tensile modulus of 17 GPa. The composites had flexural strength of 127 MPa and flexural modulus of 7 GPa. Better percentage elongation was obtained when viscose fiber was reinforced in matrix. Viscose composites had better impact strength and viscoelastic properties. The change in properties in two different wood-based fibers (Lyocell and viscose) lies in the morphology of the fiber itself. Hybrid composites were produced and the effect of hybridization was clear in most of the cases. The properties were able to be tailored by making hybrid composites, by changing the amount of each fiber in the composites. The results (tensile and flexural) were competitive and fulfil the requirements of these composites to be used in several applications including automotive <b>headliners,</b> car door <b>panel,</b> construction door frame etc. The forest products such as wood fibers could be used in composites to produce environmentally friendly products and promote forest industry.
