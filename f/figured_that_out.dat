I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E

In the thirty years before the meltdown, Bosnian Serbs had declined from 43 percent to 31 percent of the population, while Bosnian Muslims had increased from 26 percent to 44 percent.

5000|$|Parker and {{her family}} moved to Naperville, Illinois {{at the age of}} two, where she spent her {{childhood}} and adolescent years before college. Her whole family loved basketball, and she began playing at an early age. Her father played basketball at the University of Iowa in the 1970s. The Parker family were also huge Chicago Bulls fans. Candace was worried about playing basketball, fearing she would not live up to the level of play her father and brother demonstrated, so she focused on playing soccer. It wasn't until the eighth grade that her family convinced her to play basketball. Her father helped coach and critique her. Parker said of the experience, [...] "He did things to make me mad, to challenge me, because I was so much more athletic and had so much more knowledge of the game than everyone else that sometimes I just coasted.

5000|$|Writer Nat Segaloff called Milius:The best {{writer of}} the {{so-called}} USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated - some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s ... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends ... Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.Milius himself once said:Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because you don’t know what anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that you know what’s popular today - only Steven Spielberg knows what’s popular today. Only Steven Spielberg will ever know what’s popular. So leave it to him. He’s {{the only one in}} the history of man who has ever <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> Write what you want to see.

40|$|Valuing {{the arts}} {{on their own}} terms, hummm … This {{presentation}} title was assigned {{to me by the}} NASAD Executive Committee, and, dutifully, I accepted it. I did make one small change; I added the question mark. The question is two-fold: What does it mean to value the arts on their own terms and, once we’ve <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> is it really such a good idea? Allow me to answer both of those questions right up front so that should you zone out {{during the course of this}} rather lengthy monologue or feel the need to adjourn to the bar you’ll still be able to join the debate about the wrong-headedness of the keynote speaker later on this evening. Valuing the arts on their own terms means to ascribe the worth of a specific art form in terms of its intrinsic qualities. Let us take for example the visual arts. Intrinsic qualities of visual works of art are the sensorial, intellectual, and/or emotional stimuli derived from images and compositions of arranged lines, colors, textures, shapes, and forms or, in the case of Ceci n’est pas une pipe, the coupling of words and images. Thus, to value the visual arts on their own terms means to place great worth on the knowledge, experience, meaning, and observational and manual skills — in short, ways of thinking and doing – that emerge from contemplation of and reaction to such stimuli. Is valuing the arts on their own terms a good idea? I believe it is. But is justifying the arts on thei...|$|E
