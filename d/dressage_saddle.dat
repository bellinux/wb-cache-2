25|$|English saddles {{are used}} for English riding {{throughout}} the world, not just in England or English-speaking countries. They are the saddles used {{in all of the}} Olympic equestrian disciplines. The term English saddle encompasses several different styles of saddle, including those used for eventing, show jumping and hunt seat, <b>dressage,</b> <b>saddle</b> seat, horse racing and polo.|$|E
2500|$|An English-style saddle is {{required}} for riding dressage, specifically a [...] "dressage saddle" [...] which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight saddle flap, mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage saddles have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English saddles to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider's legs. The saddle is usually placed over a square, white saddle pad. Colored trim on the white saddle pad is permitted. A <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> {{is required}} in FEI classes, although any simple English-type saddle may be used at the lower levels.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were reports}} {{that the number of}} {{residents}} increased by 60% during the 1990s to about 25,000 although a second estimate (based on the 2000 census based on a different map) places the residential (nighttime and weekend) population in 2000 at 12,042. By 2001 there were several grocery stores, dry cleaners, and two grade schools and a top high school. There is a barber shop across from the New York Stock Exchange which has been there a long time. By 2001 there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a 24-hour neighborhood, although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent. There were ten hotels and thirteen museums by 2001. Stuyvesant High School moved to its present location near Battery Park City in 1992 and has been described as one of the nation's premier high schools with emphasis on science and mathematics. In 2007 the French fashion retailer Hermès opened a store in the financial district to sell items such as a [...] "$4,700 custom-made leather <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> or a $47,000 limited edition alligator briefcase". Some streets have been designated as pedestrian–only with vehicular traffic prohibited at some times. There are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city. By 2010 the residential population had increased to 24,400 residents with crime statistics showing no murders in 2010. The area is growing with luxury high-end apartments and upscale retailers.|$|E
50|$|The billets of most <b>dressage</b> <b>saddles</b> {{are very}} long, {{to allow the}} girth to be buckled near the horse's elbow rather than {{underneath}} the rider's leg (which would {{get in the way}} of giving effecting leg aids). However, some <b>dressage</b> <b>saddles</b> come with shorter billets.|$|R
50|$|Wintec {{offers several}} <b>dressage</b> <b>saddles</b> {{including}} the Wintec 250; Wintec 500, Wintec 500 Pony, Wintec 500 Wide; Wintec Pro; Wintec Pro with Contourbloc {{and the famous}} Wintec Isabell.|$|R
50|$|Thigh roll: {{the padded}} part {{at the rear}} of the panel's sweat flap, which lies behind the rider's thigh and can give extra {{stability}} in the saddle. Very common in <b>dressage</b> <b>saddles</b> but much less so in jumping saddles as it may interfere with freedom of movement of the rider's leg.|$|R
5000|$|The seat {{is usually}} much deeper in a <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> than a jumping saddle, {{and allows the}} rider to sit comfortably and relax to best {{influence}} the horse. The stuffing of the panels is often {{kept to a minimum}} in a <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle,</b> to allow a closer feel with the horse. It often has a wider bearing surface than a jumping saddle.|$|E

50|$|Schleese Saddlery Service, Ltd., {{headquartered}} in Ontario, Canada, is {{a manufacturer of}} English riding saddles {{owned and operated by}} Certified Master Saddler Jochen Schleese, his wife Sabine, and their partner Earl Rothery. The company offers custom manufacture and expert fitting for English <b>dressage</b> <b>saddles.</b> Schleese Saddlery was the first North American English saddle manufacturer to export their product to the European market.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dressage</b> <b>saddles</b> {{have a very}} straight-cut flap, {{much longer}} than a jumping saddle, which {{accommodates}} the longer leg position of a dressage rider, who works only on the flat and {{does not need to}} jump fences. The pommel is a bit higher and the deepest point of the saddle's seat more forward, all to allow for this longer leg position.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{the largest}} {{organizer}} of equestrian competitions is the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF). The organization offers equitation classes at its recognized shows, {{including those in}} hunt seat, <b>dressage</b> seat, <b>saddle</b> seat, and Western.|$|R
50|$|Isabell Werth worked {{alongside}} Bates Australia {{to develop}} the Isebell <b>Dressage</b> <b>Saddle</b> available in Bates and Wintec.|$|E
50|$|Wintec 500 {{dressage}} is {{an entry}} level saddle. It features Flexiblocks {{to allow the}} ride to change the knee rolls of the saddle. it is made from hard wearing equileather and is a great first <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The polo saddle is {{designed}} specifically for the mounted game. It has a relatively flat seat and the saddle flaps are long and fairly straight to accommodate the longer leg position, although more forward than the <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Double bridle: Also {{called a}} Weymouth bridle, double bridles use two bits at once, a small snaffle called a bradoon and a curb or Weymouth bit, and {{require the use}} of two sets of reins. Double bridles are usually only seen used in upper level <b>dressage,</b> in <b>Saddle</b> seat riding, and for showing in certain other events that require formal attire and equipment.|$|R
50|$|During the 18th century, most {{riders in}} Europe used high-pommel and cantle saddles, {{with a wooden}} frame for {{classical}} <b>dressage.</b> This <b>saddle</b> {{was based on a}} model used for bull fighting, cattle work, long-distance travel, and mounted combat, as its high pommel and cantle helped to provide the rider with support. This saddle is still used today, most notably by the Spanish Riding School, and also in Iberia and eastern Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Browband: The crownpiece {{runs through}} the browband. The browband runs from just under one ear of the horse, across the forehead, to just under the other ear. It {{prevents}} the bridle from sliding behind the poll onto the upper neck, and holds multiple headstalls together when a cavesson or second bit is added, and holds the throatlatch in place on designs where it is a separate strap. In certain sports, such as <b>dressage</b> and <b>Saddle</b> seat, decorative browbands are sometimes fashionable.|$|R
50|$|Like the All-Purpose saddle, the {{jumping saddle}} usually has three short billets. However, other styles (such as monoflap jumping saddles) have longer billets that mirror the <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{so that the}} rider no longer has to ride with extra bulk under the leg.|$|E
50|$|English saddles {{are used}} for English riding {{throughout}} the world, not just in England or English-speaking countries. They are the saddles used {{in all of the}} Olympic equestrian disciplines. The term English saddle encompasses several different styles of saddle, including those used for eventing, show jumping and hunt seat, <b>dressage,</b> <b>saddle</b> seat, horse racing and polo.|$|E
50|$|Most event riders have a {{jumping saddle}} {{as well as}} a <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle,</b> since each places them in a {{position}} better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted jumping saddle. At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as banks and drops.|$|E
5000|$|Accordingly, {{a saddle}} {{designed}} for a specific discipline will attempt to place a rider naturally at the most suitable position for the anticipated activity of the horse. For example, a [...] "close contact" [...] style of English saddle, designed for show jumping, places the rider's seat farther forward than does a <b>dressage</b> style English <b>saddle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The leg should hang {{down the}} horse's side, making even contact along its whole length (inner thigh, knee, and calf), {{and should not}} change {{position}} when the upper body moves. The rider's weight is dropped {{along the back of}} the leg and into the heel through a flexible ankle, so that the heel is lower than the toes. The toes are generally turned out slightly, to a degree greater than in the flatwork-only English riding disciplines such as <b>dressage</b> or <b>saddle</b> seat. This places the back of the calf against the horse, instead of the whole inner calf as in dressage, which decreases the refinement in communication between horse and rider, but anchors the rider and increases security. Toes should turn no more than 45 degrees out.|$|R
50|$|The {{dressage}} test {{is somewhat}} similar to <b>dressage</b> under <b>saddle.</b> The test is {{performed in a}} 40 by 80 or 40 by 100 metre arena with letter markers, where transitions in speed and gait are to take place. The judge scores each movement {{on a scale of}} 0-10, with a 10 being the highest mark possible. The difficulty of the test increases with each subsequent level of competition. At the lower levels, only one judge will normally be positioned at C (the centre of the short side of the arena) and the Test may have 16 movements. At higher levels, 3 judges may be used and at International competitions and World Championships there may be up to 5 judges, with the Championship Test having 25 movements. The judges' marks are averaged (added together and divided by the number of judges).|$|R
50|$|A {{dressage}} girth, or Lonsdale girth, is {{shorter than}} the usual girths used on other saddles. This is because the <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> has longer billets, to keep the buckles {{out from under the}} rider's leg, and so a shorter girth may be used. Dressage girths can be made of all the materials, and in all the styles, mentioned before, and also can be made entirely of very strong elastic.|$|E
50|$|The saddle is kept {{on with a}} girth {{attached}} to billets under the flaps, similar to those on a <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle.</b> A surcingle passing over {{the seat of the}} saddle is also used to provide additional safety. The rear of the saddle is sometimes secured by a crupper. A breastcollar is sometimes added. A saddle blanket or numnah is used under the saddle to absorb sweat and to protect the back of the horse.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "all-purpose" [...] or [...] "eventing" [...] saddle (also {{sometimes}} called a [...] "general purpose" [...] saddle) {{was developed to}} allow riders to use one saddle both over fences and on the flat. This type of saddle has a deep seat with a long, but somewhat forward flap. The flaps usually have padding under the leg, for support while jumping. The design {{is intended to be}} a compromise between the flatter [...] "close contact" [...] jumping saddle with a forward flap, and deep-seated <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> with a long, straight flap.|$|E
5000|$|In the English riding disciplines, {{the most}} common design of cavesson noseband is the Plain or French cavesson, a noseband that encircles the nose 1-2 inches below the cheekbone. This type of noseband is seen in most English disciplines, {{especially}} in <b>dressage,</b> show hunters, <b>Saddle</b> seat, equitation and field hunters, but is the basic noseband for all disciplines [...] This noseband comes in various styles from a plain flat leather suitable for hunting, to raised, double raised, fancy stitched, colored and padded styles. All of them perform the same purpose.|$|R
50|$|Ebony Horsewomen {{provides}} {{its young}} participants {{with a complete}} lineup of programs that emphasize S.T.E.M., equitation, and civic-mindedness which highly encourage {{young men and women}} to become community leaders and skilled equestrians who often go on to pursue equine careers and jobs in the farrier, mental health, and veterinarian fields. Some of Ebony Horsewomen's most noted offerings are their Junior Mounted Patrol program for boys, their Young Ladies <b>Dressage</b> Team, Saturday <b>Saddle</b> Club, and their Equestrian and Animal Summer Day Camp. Program participants have access to fully equipped horse stables, a cooking cottage, outdoor riding rings and an indoor riding arena, and close proximity to a variety of small farm animals, which makes for a nurturing learning environment and memorable experiences.|$|R
5000|$|An English-style saddle is {{required}} for riding dressage, specifically a [...] "dressage saddle" [...] which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight saddle flap, mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage saddles have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English saddles to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider's legs. The saddle is usually placed over a square, white saddle pad. Colored trim on the white saddle pad is permitted. A <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> {{is required}} in FEI classes, although any simple English-type saddle may be used at the lower levels.|$|E
50|$|In the USA, the attire and turnout for Show Hacks are {{modeled on}} {{dressage}} competition. While {{any type of}} correct hunt seat tack and attire is legal, the preferred style (even before 6:00 pm when formal attire is generally worn) is that of formal Grand Prix Dressage: Black or navy shadbelly, top hat, white breeches, black boots, white gloves, <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> and double bridle. Whips are permitted, spurs are optional. Coloured browbands are not allowed, though dressage-style browbands with some ornamentation are acceptable. Kimblewick and Pelham bits are allowed in addition to traditional snaffle bits and double bridles. Horses are usually shown with a braided mane and the tail is left unbraided or lightly pulled on the upper portion of the dock {{in a manner similar}} to dressage competition.|$|E
50|$|The term English saddle {{encompasses}} several types, {{including those}} used for show jumping and hunt seat, <b>dressage,</b> <b>Saddle</b> seat, horse racing and polo. To non-horsemen, the major distinguishing feature of an English saddle is {{its lack of}} a horn. However, some Western saddles, such as those used to ride rough stock in rodeos and certain types of western-influenced saddles used in endurance riding, lack a horn as well. These saddles can still be classified as western-influenced, however, due to the deep seat, high cantle, prominent pommels, wide fenders (stirrup leathers) and large, leather-covered stirrups. In addition, saddles used for working cattle in nations other than the United States, such as the Australian Stock Saddle and the Charro Saddles of South America, often share stock saddle features such as a deep seat and extra leather to protect horse and rider, but lack a horn.|$|E
5000|$|The seat of this saddle {{is longer}} and flatter {{than that of}} a forward seat or <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle.</b> The seat places the rider's center of balance farther back on the horse than in other English riding disciplines, though correct saddle seat equitation still demands that the rider's legs and feet be {{balanced}} under the horse. The pommel is always cut back to allow greater freedom of the front legs and shoulder, as well as to accommodate the higher set neck and higher withers typical of the saddle seat breeds. The flap is wide front-to-back, with no blocks or rolls beneath, and ends closer to the cantle than any other English saddle so that the rider's leg (whose thigh is further back than in other styles because the seat is also farther back) is protected. Riders use very long stirrups, usually at least as long as those of dressage riders.|$|E
5000|$|This saddle {{is used in}} the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, {{for showing}} on the flat or over low fences, and is a direct {{descendant}} of the English hunting saddle. The show saddle is designed to show off the horse's conformation, most notably the shoulder, and is therefore a minimal saddle with a close fit and straight-cut flap. The seat is very flat, and there are no knee or thigh rolls, so the saddle offers little support to the rider. Like the American Saddle Seat saddle, the English showing saddle has a stirrup bar set farther forward and a cutback pommel that falls behind rather than over the withers, though the seat is less flat and the rider's center of balance is closer to that of a <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle.</b> Many show horses are also presented in fatter condition than in more athletic disciplines, so the billets are placed to help keep the saddle properly placed on a rounder animal, with the foremost billet on show pony saddles frequently being attached directly to the point of the front arch of the tree; this is known as a [...] "forward point".|$|E
5000|$|There {{were reports}} {{that the number of}} {{residents}} increased by 60% during the 1990s to about 25,000 although a second estimate (based on the 2000 census based on a different map) places the residential (nighttime and weekend) population in 2000 at 12,042. By 2001 there were several grocery stores, dry cleaners, and two grade schools and a top high school. There is a barber shop across from the New York Stock Exchange which has been there a long time. By 2001 there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a 24-hour neighborhood, although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent. There were ten hotels and thirteen museums by 2001. Stuyvesant High School moved to its present location near Battery Park City in 1992 and has been described as one of the nation's premier high schools with emphasis on science and mathematics. In 2007 the French fashion retailer Hermès opened a store in the financial district to sell items such as a [...] "$4,700 custom-made leather <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle</b> or a $47,000 limited edition alligator briefcase". Some streets have been designated as pedestrian-only with vehicular traffic prohibited at some times. There are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city. By 2010 the residential population had increased to 24,400 residents with crime statistics showing no murders in 2010. The area is growing with luxury high-end apartments and upscale retailers.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between the styles of English saddle are small but significant. The most important distinctions are the location and therefore {{the balance of the}} seat, and the flap length and shape. A saddle used for a discipline where the rider sits more upright with a longer leg, such as in dressage, has a flap that is longer to accommodate the leg, and less inclined forward (as the knee does not need to go forward). The seat will also be closer to the withers, to keep the rider's center of gravity in the correct spot. However, in disciplines where the rider needs shorter stirrups for better balance and security, such as in the jumping disciplines, the saddle flap is moved proportionately forward and shortened, and the seat is moved further back. A jumping saddle will have a shorter and more forward flap than a <b>dressage</b> <b>saddle,</b> with the seat slightly more towards the cantle. If the flap was not inclined forward, the rider’s knee would hang over the flap, and the flap would constantly push the leg out of position (usually backward), so that the rider would become unstable and interfere with his horse. If the seat was not moved rearward, the rider would be forced ahead of the saddle over a fence. A racing saddle, where jockeys ride with incredibly short stirrups, will have an extremely forward and short saddle flap (almost more horizontal than vertical), and the seat will be extended well back from the pommel to keep the rider’s center of gravity correctly situated.|$|E
