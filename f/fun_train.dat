50|$|Amtrak first {{restored}} {{service to}} Las Vegas on February 4, 1972, with the Las Vegas <b>Fun</b> <b>Train,</b> {{also known as}} the Crapshooters Express. This was more an excursion train than regular intercity service, running on the weekends only and then only for the winter season. Amtrak modeled the train on the Reno <b>Fun</b> <b>Train,</b> which made weekend trips from the San Francisco Bay Area to Reno, Nevada during the winter season. Begun under the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1963, it had continued under Amtrak and was doing good business.The trips were sponsored by the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, which agreed to cover any losses sustained by Amtrak. Las Vegas mayor Oran K. Gragson was aboard for the first seven-hour trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The inaugural train featured live music and poker games, in addition to a generous supply of alcohol. In Las Vegas the train stopped in a rail yard opposite the Union Plaza Hotel, which had opened in 1971. The train ran for three months, from February to May. For the first two months the train departed Los Angeles on Friday and returned on Sunday; on March 26 it switched to Sunday-Tuesday in an attempt to drum up weekday business in Las Vegas, with mixed results.|$|E

This was possible because it used idle equipment from Amtrak's thrice-weekly Los Angeles-New Orleans Sunset Limited. Comedian Milton Berle was aboard for the first trip; celebrities slated to travel aboard future trips included Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Wilt Chamberlain, Dana Andrews, Parnelli Jones, and Leslie Uggams.

30|$|The lack of {{engagement}} and motivation in classroom-based training {{is one of}} the primary Six Sigma training issues being faced in most of the organizations nowadays. The narrow focus of the current Six Sigma training only gives a partial picture of Six Sigma project experience without considering the project management aspects such as the planning of resources. To address this concern, this paper offers a broader and more <b>fun</b> <b>training</b> approach, i.e., an extrinsically and intrinsically motivating Six Sigma competition game where it provides a complete real-life project experience. Learners need to discuss, plan, and decide on how to make use of their earned resources—“coins” to develop their shooting model—“y = f(x)” by applying what they learned in Six Sigma training course if they are keen to triumph in the game. The cooperative learning within the team and competition-based learning increase the level of intensity and excitement in the Six Sigma training and thus enables an improved engagement that leads to a more effective understanding and retention of knowledge. Conversely, it can affect the learning environment in the class if managed unwisely. After all, one size does not fit all. Training design needs to be relevant to the organization and functions’ needs and delivered when they require it and in a format that the organization finds feasible.|$|R

30|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the lack of {{knowledge}} is a significant limitation to the correct interpretation of hemodynamic variables [17]. Serious games are video games designed to learn and train on serious topics, such as safety and processes. Serious games are increasingly used in industry and hospitals [18]. They increase the use of learning tools (this is <b>fun)</b> and <b>training</b> efficiency (this is simulation) [19]. Advantages of simulation training over traditional education methods include unlimited exposure to rare but complicated clinical events and the absence of risk for patients [20]. Simulation-based training was demonstrated to improve medical knowledge, clinical performance and comfort in procedures. It is also useful to teach teamwork and communication, a key element of quality of care [21]. Therefore, the current development of serious games in health care [18] may greatly benefit hemodynamic monitoring, given the large number of hemodynamic variables and tools, as well as the complexity of cardiovascular physiology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In Turkey, {{the studies}} have {{reported}} that {{the age at which}} sexual intercourse and sexual activity starts has been steadily declining. There is an urgent need to increase social and health services for young people in order to provide them with a healthy life by changing their risky behaviors, avoiding unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Sexual and reproductive health training particularly for adolescents warrants special attention and consideration. The objective of our study is to find out the short and long term effectiveness of a training course on peer education. Methods The study was conducted on 237 students who participated in a 40 hour Peer Trainer Training course. We utilized two types of evaluation methods to measure the effectiveness of the training on students' knowledge and attitude. The first method consisted of administering 3 tests comprised of the same 45 questions at 3 separate time intervals. Prior to the training a pre-test was given to obtain a measurement of base knowledge, and then an immediate post-test was given to evaluate the change in the knowledge and opinion of the participants. Finally, 6 months later the same test was administered to measure the retention of knowledge by the students. In the second type of evaluation, the participants' assessment of the training itself was sought by asking them to complete a Short Course Evaluation Form. We utilized SPSS 12. 0 for descriptive analysis, and the Wilcoxon two related sample t-test were run. Results According to the pre and immediate post-test results, the training resulted in an increase in knowledge learned by an average of 21. 6 % (p 0. 05). Participants thought that they had <b>fun</b> during <b>training,</b> and they became aware of what they knew and what they did not know.
