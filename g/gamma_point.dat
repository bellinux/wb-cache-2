The phonon frequencies at the <b>Gamma</b> <b>point</b> increase with increasing pressure, except the B- 1 g mode. The phonon band structure at 73 GPa, the study of elastic constants {{as a function of}} pressure, and the structural relaxation at various pressure provide evidence for spontaneous elastic deformation, i. e., a ferroelastic phase transition at 64 GPa of stishovite in the tetragonal rutile structure to the orthorhombic CaCl 2 structure.

40|$|The Kondo {{insulator}} SmB 6 {{has long}} been known to exhibit low temperature (T < 10 K) transport anomaly and has recently attracted attention as a new topological insulator candidate. By combining low-temperature and high energy-momentum resolution of the laser-based ARPES technique, for the first time, we probe the surface electronic structure of the anomalous conductivity regime. We observe that the bulk bands exhibit a Kondo gap of 14 meV and identify in-gap low-lying states within a 4 meV window of the Fermi level on the (001) -surface of this material. The low-lying states are found to form electron-like Fermi surface pockets that enclose the X and the <b>Gamma</b> <b>points</b> of the surface Brillouin zone. These states disappear as temperature is raised above 15 K in correspondence with the complete disappearance of the 2 D conductivity channels in SmB 6. While the topological nature of the in-gap metallic states cannot be ascertained without spin (spin-texture) measurements our bulk and surface measurements carried out in the transport-anomaly-temperature regime (T < 10 K) are consistent with the first-principle predicted Fermi surface behavior of a topological Kondo insulator phase in this material.
