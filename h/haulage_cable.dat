25|$|Even more confusingly, {{a hybrid}} cable car/funicular line once {{existed in the}} form of the {{original}} Wellington Cable Car, in the New Zealand city of Wellington. This line had both a continuous loop <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. This line was rebuilt in 1979 and is now a standard funicular, although it retains its old cable car name.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designer}} of the system was James Fulton, a Dunedin-born engineer. Fulton was responsible for both selecting the route and deciding the method of operation, a hybrid between a cable car and a funicular.

50|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in the construction of}} the line was dealing with the climb between Erkrath and Hochdahl. Because of the steep slope (1 in 30 (3.3%)) in this section for a long time trains had to be hauled by cable, originally driven by a stationary steam engine. A few months later <b>haulage</b> by <b>cable</b> attached to a stationary steam engine was changed to <b>haulage</b> by <b>cable</b> attached via pulleys to a locomotive running downhill on an additional track. In 1926, <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> on the incline was replaced by bank engines.|$|R

50|$|Drum hoists take up {{more space}} than a {{friction}} hoist {{for the same}} service as all of the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> must be accommodated on the drum when the hoist is fully raised. Drum hoists require rapid fluctuations in power demand, which can pose a problem if power is generated on site rather than provided through the main power grid.|$|E
25|$|The {{car barn}} is {{situated}} directly above the power {{house and the}} Cable Car Museum. The museum's entrance is at Washington and Mason. It contains several examples of old cable cars, together with smaller exhibits and a shop. Two galleries allow the visitor to overlook the main power house, and also to descend below the junction of Washington and Mason Streets and see the large cavern where the <b>haulage</b> <b>cables</b> are routed out to the street.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} part of the complex that also houses the cable car power house, which drives the cables, and the car depot ("barn"). The car depot is not open to the public, but two {{overlook}} galleries allow the visitor to view the power house, and to descend below the junction of Washington and Mason streets in order to view the large cavern where the <b>haulage</b> <b>cables</b> are routed via large sheaves out to the street.|$|R

50|$|The Metrocable {{system is}} a branch of Medellín's metro and it is managed by the {{corporation}} Metro of Medellín. The system uses Monocable Detachable Gondola technology which consists of cable cars connected to a fixed cable through means of a detachable grip. The <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> is pulled by large wheels allowing the cabins to move at an average speed of 10 mph.|$|E
50|$|Crab {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} a winch for pulling cars out of the un-powered tracks. This approach allowed use of temporary track that was too light to carry {{the weight of the}} a cable-reel or battery locomotive. The disadvantage of a crab locomotive was that someone had to pull the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> from the winch to the working face, threading it over pulleys at any sharp turns.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Angels Flight was {{a conventional}} funicular, with both cars {{connected to the}} same <b>haulage</b> <b>cable.</b> Unlike more modern funiculars {{it did not have}} track brakes for use in the event of cable breakage, but it did have a separate safety cable which would come into play in case of breakage of the main cable. It operated for 68 years with a good safety record.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in the construction of}} the line was dealing with the climb between Erkrath and Hochdahl. The line has a gradient of 3.33% and rises 82 m in about 2.5 km. For more than one hundred years, this was the steepest main line in Europe. For many years trains had to be hauled by cable, originally driven by a stationary steam engine. A few months later <b>haulage</b> by <b>cable</b> attached to a stationary steam engine was changed to <b>haulage</b> by <b>cable</b> attached via pulleys to a locomotive running downhill on an additional track. With the duplication of the remainder of the line in 1865, the steep section of line became three-track, until the electrification of the line in 1963. The third track was rebuilt in 1985, as part of the additional third track built for the planned S-Bahn line. In 1926, <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> on the incline was replaced by bank engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened {{along with the}} Düsseldorf-Elberfeld railway from Düsseldorf to Erkrath by the Düsseldorf-Elberfeld Railway Company on 20 December 1838. The line between Erkrath and Hochdahl has a {{gradient}} of 3.33% and rises 82 m in about 2.5 km. For {{more than one hundred}} years, this was the steepest main line in Europe. For many years trains had to be hauled by cable, originally driven by a stationary steam engine.

50|$|On the {{funicular}} {{section of}} the line, the tramcars are pushed uphill and braked downhill by cable tractors, also known as cable dummies or, in Italian, carro scudo. These vehicles are permanently attached to the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable.</b> They are not coupled to the tramcars; gravity holds {{the lower end of}} the tramcar against the upper end of the cable tractor. There have been three generations of cable tractors on the line.|$|E
50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the shaft bottom gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the tail ropes and so on. Because drum hoists do not have tail ropes, the hoisting system is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|E
50|$|The Peak Tram {{was opened}} {{for public service}} on 28 May 1888 by the then {{governor}} Sir George William des Voeux. As built, the line used a static steam engine to power the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable.</b> It was at first used only for residents of Victoria Peak. Despite that, it carried 800 passengers on its first day of operation, and about 150,000 in its first year, transported in the line's original wooden-bodied cars. The tram's existence accelerated the residential development of Victoria Peak and the Mid Levels.|$|E

50|$|As well {{as being}} {{the point at which}} {{passengers}} change cars, the Halfway stop is also the control centre for the line. The electric motors which drive the cables that propel the cars are located in the central building of the stop, as are the winchmen who control them. This in turn leads to a further difference between the two sections. With the drive {{at the top of the}} lower section, there are only two <b>haulage</b> <b>cables,</b> from the Halfway stop to each car. As the upper section has its drive at the bottom of the section, a third cable is needed that connects the two cars via a sheave at the Summit stop.|$|R
50|$|The 10.4 km Glasgow Subway in Scotland {{opened the}} same year and used <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> until it was {{electrified}} in 1935.|$|R
50|$|The upper section, the Gipfelbahn, {{built in}} 1973, has {{a length of}} 845.18 metres, has two pylons and climbs through 190 metres. It is driven by a 283 kW engine at the middle station. The two track cables of the second section have a {{diameter}} of 39 mm; the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> is 20 mm thick. The Gipfelbahn only has one car with a capacity of 60 passengers. With a maximum speed of 8 m/s (28.8 km/h) {{it is able to}} transport 450 people per hour over this short stretch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{caissons}} ran on {{a railway}} track of 7 ft gauge with [...] flat bottom rails on longitudinal timbers, on a gradient of 1 in 10. There were two tracks. They ran on ten pairs of wheels, of 3 ft diameter except the uppermost pair were 1 ft {{and the second}} pair were 2 ft, to accommodate the wedge shape of the carriage. A continuous rack was fixed to the longitudinal timbers, and a pawl—Leslie calls it a [...] "pall"—attached to the carriage was arranged to engage the rack if the tension was let off the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fellhornbahn I, a {{cable car}} built by Habegger, entered service in 1972. It had {{a length of}} 1,869 metres and climbed through a height of 863 metres. The two track cables of each cable car route had a dimater of 50 mm, the <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> was 28 mm thick. Drive for the two cable cars, with their {{capacity}} of 100 passengers, was provided by an engine at the bottom station delivering 552 kW. The first section had three pylons; there were 54, 51 and 24 metres high. Since {{the construction of the}} parallel Fellhornbahn II (see below), Fellhornbahn I has been used mainly in summer.|$|E
50|$|In the 1850s, John Fowler used a Clayton & Shuttleworth {{portable}} engine to drive apparatus {{in the first}} public demonstrations of the application of <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> to cultivation.|$|R
5000|$|The Cromford and High Peak Railway, which mainly hauled coal, also {{opened in}} 1830 but had {{gradients}} so steep - 1 in 8 - that <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> was essential.http://www.wirksworth.org.uk/CHPR.htm ...|$|R
5000|$|Designed for <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> up {{and down}} 1 in 100 grades at Rainhill {{in the belief that}} {{locomotive}} haulage was impracticable. The Rainhill Trials showed that locomotives could handle 1 in 100 gradients.|$|R
50|$|The new {{drive and}} safety system {{completely}} replaced the system {{which was the}} cause of the fatal 2001 accident. Like the original Angels Flight design and most traditional funicular systems, the new drive system incorporates a single main <b>haulage</b> <b>cable,</b> with one car attached to each end. Also like the original design, a second safety cable is utilized. To further enhance safety, unlike the original design, each car now has a rail brake system, as a backup to the main backup emergency brakes on each bull-wheel. Another added safety feature is an independent evacuation motor to move the cars should the main motor fail for any reason.|$|E
50|$|The loco shed {{is still}} evident {{close to the}} top of the highest incline, near the point where the Cowlyd tramway {{branched}} off the Eigiau tramway. Unlike the lower inclines, this one has not subsequently been utilized by the pipepines running down to Dolgarrog. At its head is an abandoned corrugated iron winding shed, a replacement for an earlier one. Although the inclines were originally three separate ones, they were latterly worked as one, though the three sections were of different inclinations, the middle and upper sections each being less steep than the one below. The <b>haulage</b> <b>cable</b> was continuous and was still in place in 1973 as was the track.|$|E
50|$|The steeper 1 in 50 grades from Liverpool down to {{the docks}} were {{operated}} by cable traction for several decades until locomotives improved. <b>Cable</b> <b>haulage</b> continued to be used where gradients were even steeper.|$|R
50|$|The {{ascent of}} the Cowlairs incline {{continued}} to be a difficulty, and electric traction was proposed, but not proceeded with. From August 1909 steam traction with banking assistance handled everything; the <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> was discontinued.|$|R
50|$|The {{engineer}} of the Clay Street {{line was}} William Eppelsheimer. However, given Hallidie's previous experience of <b>cables</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> systems, {{it seems unlikely}} that he did not contribute to the design of the system.|$|R
50|$|The boilers were {{replaced}} in 1862 - 1863 by seven Cornish boilers. The <b>cable</b> <b>haulage</b> continued in operation until 31 January 1908, when banking engines took over. The stationary engines at Cowlairs were scrapped the following year.|$|R
