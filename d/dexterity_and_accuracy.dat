50|$|The étude {{is played}} {{at a brisk}} and lively allegretto tempo and studies right hand jumping between {{intervals}} larger than one octave, sometimes even stretching for two whole octaves within the time of a sixteenth note. As a whole, the étude can be practiced to increase <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> at large jumps on the piano, along with agility of the weaker fingers of the hand. The largest intervals reached by the right hand are fifteenths (two octaves) and sixteenths (two octaves and a second). Sixteenth notes are played between the two notes, and the same note is played two octaves or two octaves and a second higher with no rest. Little time is provided for the pianist to move the hand, thus forcing the pianist to avoid tension within the muscles. Fifteenth intervals are quite common {{in the beginning of}} the étude, while the sixteenth intervals appear twice, at the thirtieth and thirty-second measures.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of parallel manipulators is their good accuracy but near the singularity their <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> is poor. In this paper, we propose an approach to eliminate the disturbance caused by the presence of singularities in the workspace of a parallel manipulator. The effect of parallel singularity on the resolution of the forward kinematics model (FKM) is eliminated by adding a redundant sensor in one passive joint of the parallel manipulator. A study is made to choose the passive joint that gives the maximum of accuracy on the resolution of FKM. The proposed approach is applied to a spherical parallel manipulator (SPM) for tele-manipulation with haptic feedback. An experimental comparison is made to prove the benefit of the redundant sensor on the FKM. A singularity and kinematics study of the SPM is developed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a robustness study of 3 R manipulators and aims at answering the following question: are generic manipulators more robust than their non-generic counterparts? We exploit several properties specific to 3 R manipulators such as singularities, cuspidality, homotopy classes, and path feasibility, {{in order to}} find some correlations between genericity and robustness concepts. It turns out that the farther a manipulator is from non-generic ones, the more robust it is with respect to homotopy class and number of cusps. Besides, we state that the proximity of a manipulator to non-generic frontiers may severely affect its robustness with respect to path-feasibility. Finally, we notice that the <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> the <b>accuracy</b> of 3 R manipulators do not depend on genericity...|$|R
40|$|Registration is {{necessary}} whenever planning data (e. g. biopsy needle trajectories based on preoperative images) {{have to be}} transferred into the operation room (OR).

Since a medical robot works in an operating room, close to the patient and the medical staff, it has to satisfy much stricter requirements with respect to an industrial one. From a kinematic point of view, the robot must reach any target position in the patient's body being less invasive as possible for the surgeon's workspace. In order to meet such requirements a suitable performance index to optimal kinematic design is needed. This paper proposes an optimal index which maximizes the robot workspace and minimizes the invasiveness with respect to the surgeon's workspace.

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery {{has been established}} as an important way forward in surgery for reducing patient trauma and hospitalization with improved prognosis. The introduction of robotic assistance enhances the manual <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> of instrument manipulation. Further development of the field in using pre- and intra-operative imaging guidance requires {{the integration of the}} general anatomy of the patient with clear pathologic indications and geometrical information for preoperative planning and intra-operative manipulation. It also requires effective visualization and the recreation of haptic and tactile sensing with dynamic active constraints to improve consistency and safety of the surgical procedures. This paper describes key technical considerations of tissue deformation tracking, 3 D reconstruction, subject-specific modeling, image guidance and augmented reality for robotic assisted minimally {{invasive surgery}}. It highlights the importance of adapting preoperative surgical planning according to intra-operative data and illustrates how dynamic information such as tissue deformation can be incorporated into the surgical navigation framework. Some of the recent trends are discussed in terms of instrument design and the usage of dynamic active constraints and human-robot perceptual docking for robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This platform can be utilized to accurately simulate vehicle vibration with x, y, z-axis translation and roll, pitch, yaw-axis rotation.

Conventionally various prosthetic control techniques exists and each has their own advantages and disadvantages. These control techniques ranges from simply implementable, cable-controlled, body-powered prosthetics to technologically challenging Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) based prosthetics control system. The effectiveness of a upper-limb prosthetic control method for wide-spread application depends on various factors such as cost-effectiveness, ability for easy fabrication, ruggedness, repeatability on daily use, easily installable, usability, ability to bring <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> to perform various gestures/associated activities etc. The current techniques have major drawbacks, namely: with EMG there is a need of relatively complex electronics/sensor electrodes and classification algorithms for implementing large gesture range; EEG suffers from reliability issue and cost; sweating and placement positions of electrodes may interfere with reliable working in case of both EEG and EMG techniques; need of invasive surgery and associated high cost in case of TMR or implanted myo/neural interface etc. We will present demo of a robust, non-invasive, simple, touch-based toe gesture sensor system for upper limb prosthetic control...|$|E

Nevertheless, the <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> required for the positioning of new tools are often unreachable, if surgeons are not assisted by suitable systems. Significant advantages are derived from the introduction of computer and robot technologies. For that reason, the interaction between robotic systems and surgeons today is producing new interest worldwide both in medical and engineering fields. In particular, medical robotics has found fruitful ground in neurosurgical applications, since the high functional density of the central nervous system requires strict accuracy constraints on tool positioning. As a matter of fact, the major benefits of robots, such as precision, accuracy and repeatability, make them ideal as neurosurgeons’ assistants. This paper presents a master-slave haptic robotic system for minimally invasive neurosurgery, which can aid surgeons in performing safer and more accurate stereotactic neurosurgical treatments. The design of the proposed system is based on LANS (Linear Actuator for NeuroSurgery), which has been developed by our Research Group.

NEUMESY is a six joints serial manipulator whose kinematic structure lets the robot to adapt to different patient’s positions while minimizing the overall dimensions. Owing to the usual symmetry of a surgical tool, the kinematic dimension of the neurosurgical task is five, being given by one point and one direction on the space. Therefore the NEUMESY is kinematically redundant, leaving an extra DOF to the surgeon to choose a suitable robot configuration which minimally limits his movements during the surgical operations.

In {{the field of}} medicine, manual and technical skills must also be ac-quired to competently perform invasive procedures such as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). Until recently, training in FFB and other endoscopic procedures has occurred on the job in real patients.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Surgical robots {{have been}} widely used to assist {{surgeons}} to carry out dexterous surgical procedures via various ways. Robotically assisted surgery allows surgeons to overcome the limitations in the minimally invasive surgery and thus to enhance the surgical performance. Most of the robotically assisted surgery require surgeon’s operation directly or indirectly via a teleoperation station. A certain level of autonomy in robotic surgery could not only free the surgeon from some tedious and repetitive tasks, but also utilize the advantages of the robot: high <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This work considers the image-guided robotic neurosurgery, aiming to semi-automate a neurosurgical procedure for clean up the tumor residues after manual removal of the brain tumor using a surgical robot, where the manual operation is a tedious and time-consuming task for surgeons due to long time integration of the fluorescent signal. The entire medical procedure is modeled using behavior tree framework, and encoded and tested on RAVEN TM II surgical robotic platform using a simulated brain phantom. Furthermore, a path planner is developed that automatically synthesize different ablation path plans to cover the entire tumorous regions. At the current stage, the path planner is able to generate three types of path patterns for the surgeon to choose the most reliable plan before robotic execution. Along with the generated path plans, other computed metrics such as the total number of the via-points in each plan, estimated time for the robotic execution, will also be delivered to the surgeon for reference...|$|E
40|$|Computer assistive {{technologies}} have developed considerably {{over the past}} decades. Advances in computer software and hardware have provided motion-impaired operators with much greater access to computer interfaces. For people with motion impairments, the main di�culty in the communication process is the input of data into the system. For example, {{the use of a}} mouse or a keyboard demands a high level of <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Traditional input devices are designed for able-bodied users and often do not meet the needs of someone with disabilities. As the key feature of most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is to point-and-click with a cursor this can make a computer inaccessible for many people. Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an important area of research that aims to improve communication between humans and machines. Previous studies have identi�ed haptics as a useful method for improving computer access. However, traditional haptic techniques su�er from a number of shortcomings that have hindered their inclusion with real world software. The focus of this thesis is to develop haptic rendering algorithms that will permit motion-impaired operators to use haptic assistance with existing graphical user interfaces. The main goal is to improve interaction by reducing error rates and improving targeting times. A number of novel haptic assistive techniques are presented that utilise the three degrees-of-freedom (3 DOF) capabilities of modern haptic devices to produce assistance that is designed speci�- cally for motion-impaired computer users. To evaluate the e�ectiveness of the new techniques a series of point-and-click experiments were undertaken in parallel with cursor analysis to compare the levels of performance. The task required the operator to produce a prede�ned sentence on the densely populated Windows on-screen keyboard (OSK).

40|$|In recent years, robot {{assisted}} Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) {{is playing}} {{an increasingly important}} role in surgery. Although the benefit of reduced patient trauma and hospitalisation with improved prognosis has been achieved through the enhanced <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> of instrument manipulation {{by the introduction of}} robotic assistance, the use of current master-slave platform has inevitably imposed the increased physical separation that deteriorates the hand-eye coordination {{due to a lack of}} haptic feedback. To this end, the concept of Virtual Fixtures (VFs) and Active Constraints has attracted significant research interests. It provides in situ effective guidance of access routes to the target anatomy safely. However, its clinical potential is only well established for procedures such as orthopaedic surgery, which are conducted under a static frame-of-reference due to the relatively rigid anatomy involved. The main focus of this thesis is concerned with modelling spatial constraints that are adaptive to tissue deformation. These constraints define safe manipulation margins for an entire robot rather than just its end-effector. An analytical framework is proposed to control an articulated flexible robotic device. Provided with these dynamic active constraints, the framework enables the operator to perform smooth articulation or steady navigation along curved anatomical pathways even under rapid tissue deformation. The challenges induced by hyper-kinematic redundancy of the robot and increased computational burden of real-time haptic rendering are addressed so that they facilitate seamless interaction with the robot by using lower degree-of-freedom (DoF) haptic interfacing device. Furthermore, the use of a gaze contingent paradigm is also investigated to enhance the human-robot interaction by linking the manipulation constraints with visual track. To demonstrate the practical nature of the proposed framework, detailed quantitative validations were conducted on groups of subjects. Future directions and potential improvements to the proposed techniques are finally outlined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Neurologically, it {{is proven}} that {{stimulation}} of larger diameter fibers - e. g. using appropriate coldness, warmth, rubbing, pressure or vibration- can close the neural "gate" so that the central perception of itch and pain is reduced. This fact is based upon "Gate-control" theory of Melzack and Wall. Presentation of the hypothesis Syringe Micro Vibrator is a new design being introduced {{for the first time}} in the field of Dentistry. This device is a promising breakthrough in pain and anxiety management and may deliver solution for clinicians plagued with patient pain phobia. It has an off-set rotating micro vibration creator with ultra high frequency and ultra low altitude that can be easily placed on any standard dental syringe and some disposable syringes. This device was registered as an invention in dentistry and received Iran National Patent number of 63765. Testing the hypothesis By creating micro vibration, this device would be effective in reducing the pain and anxiety confronted with most types of intraoral injections as palatal, mandibular block, intraligamental and local infiltration. From the aspect of the patient pain management, this device contributes both physiologically (based on Gate Control Theory of pain) and psychologically (based on the device function as will be explained by dentist to the patient as a modern pain reducing technology). From the aspect of clinician, SMV motor provides vibrations with ultra high frequency to alleviate pain, but since it has ultra low vibration altitude, it has no adverse effect on the clinician <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> during injection and it does not interfere with pin point localization of injection site. Implications of the hypothesis Upon mounting on a conventional dental anesthesia injection syringe, SMV is switched on and the clinician then uses normal injection technique to administer the anesthetic. This device is not only a useful accessory device for ordinary patients, but also more useful for pediatric patients and those who have a phobia of intraoral injection or pain. </p...|$|E
40|$|Up to now, self damping data {{generally}} {{comes from}} dynamic tests performed on test spans which length {{is of the}} order of some tens of meters. Those tests rely {{on the assumption that the}} conductor self damping changes the amplitude of incident and reflected travelling wave. In other words, there are no standing wave within a vibrating conductor and in practice, the amount of self damping is deduced from measurements of vibration amplitudes at adjacent “false vibration nodes”. The corresponding measurements require lots of <b>dexterity</b> <b>and</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This paper investigates the possibility of deducing the self damping properties of power line conductors from a series of tests performed quasi statically on a short prestressed conductor sample. Data recorded by Godinas [1] on 4 m long prestressed conductor samples has been used as an input (the conductors used are made of aluminium alloy, type AMS). This data was obtained by applying a cyclic quasi-static bending moment in the middle of the conductor sample and recording the corresponding strains. The experiment was reproduced at several prestress levels. A mining and analysis of this data has been performed so that in a first time the relationship between moment and curvature can be adequately defined. Then the corresponding internal work has been computed analytically (per integration). Finally a formulation for the self damping per unit length is proposed as a function of the antinode amplitude of vibration, frequency, conductor tension, bending stiffness, mass per unit length plus a special parameter called “b”. The latter parameter has the dimension of energy [J]. The corresponding results are found to be consistent with those deduced from the widely used “power law”, using Noiseux’s exponents [2, 3]. Also, a simplified version of the formula shows that the sensitivity of the self damping to the vibration amplitude, frequency and tension is comparable to that found by others authors using another self damping measurement technique [1], but with the difference that in this case, the exponents for frequency, amplitude and tension are integers, fully justified by the physics behind the phenomenon of damping.
