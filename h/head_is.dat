50|$|Sel-sync {{along with}} the {{multi-track}} <b>head</b> <b>was</b> invented by Ross Snyder at Ampex in 1955. Three problems had to be solved: mechanical alignment, switching of the record track to playback mode and multitrack erase head. The hard problem was the switching of a track between record and playback mode, as the impedance of record <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> {{quite different from the}} impedance of play back heads. Prior to Sel-Sync record <b>heads</b> <b>were</b> directly wired to the record electronics and playback <b>heads</b> <b>were</b> directly wired to the playback electronics. Also the designs of the two <b>heads</b> <b>were</b> very different. The problem of switching very low-level/high-impedance circuitry without introducing hum or noise had to be solved. Mort Fujii in the Ampex special projects lab was responsible for the actual design.|$|R
5|$|Some {{paintings}} also {{depict the}} sacrifice of Aravan. In these scenes, he is often depicted bowing to Kali, while his <b>head</b> <b>is</b> about to be severed; or, as in one Sowcarpet painting, a self-decapitated Aravan holds both a sword and his own severed head, offering the latter to the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times.

5|$|The <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the <b>head</b> <b>is</b> rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E
50|$|In the daisy family, {{the flower}} <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> {{made up of}} many small flowers called florets, and are either homogamous or heterogamous. Heterogamous <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> made up of two types of florets, ray florets near the edge and disk florets in the center. Homogamous <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> made up of just one type of floret, either all ray florets or all disk florets.|$|R
5|$|The colossal <b>heads</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{precisely}} dated. However, the San Lorenzo <b>heads</b> <b>were</b> {{buried by}} 900BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes {{had been moved}} from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. The period of production of the colossal <b>heads</b> <b>is</b> therefore unknown, as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium. Estimates of the time span during which colossal <b>heads</b> <b>were</b> produced vary from 50 to 200 years. The San Lorenzo <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to be the}} oldest, and are the most skillfully executed. All of the stone <b>heads</b> have <b>been</b> assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, generally to the Early Preclassic (1500–1000BC), although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata <b>Head</b> <b>are</b> attributed to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC).|$|R

5|$|The severed head of Aravan is {{a common}} motif in Draupadi's temples. Often it is a {{portable}} wooden head; sometimes this even has its own shrine in the temple complex. Icons of Aravan's head are also often placed on the corners and edges of Draupadi temple roofs. As a pey or bhuta (spirit), Aravan acts as a guardian against other spirits, for the temple itself, and also for the Patukalam ceremony. Patukalam, in the Draupadi cult, is the symbolic ground on which the Mahabharata war is ritually re-enacted. In the taluks of Thajavur, Kumbhakonam and Pattukkotai, Aravan's <b>head</b> <b>is</b> enshrined permanently in a mandapa or within a temple niche. The largest known Aravan <b>head</b> <b>is</b> found at the Hajiyar Teru temple in Kumbhakonam.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The <b>head</b> <b>is</b> grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the <b>head</b> <b>is</b> grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{split open}} by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

This scene is intercut with footage of two military leaders playing chess.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest.

Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
