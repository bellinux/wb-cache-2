5|$|Black Lives Matter {{originally}} used social media—including <b>hashtag</b> activism—to reach {{thousands of}} people rapidly. Since then, Black Lives Matters has embraced a diversity of tactics.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Obama {{joined the}} {{campaign}} to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The First Lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign <b>hashtag.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{shooting}} of two police officers in Ferguson {{and in response to}} BLM, the <b>hashtag</b> #BlueLivesMatter was created by supporters of the police. Following this, Blue Lives Matter became a pro-police officer movement in the United States. It expanded after the killings of American police officers.|$|E
40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{an analysis of}} data from 502, 891 Twitter users and focused on investigating the potential correlation between <b>hashtags</b> and the increase of followers {{to determine whether the}} addition of <b>hashtags</b> to tweets produces new followers. We have designed an experiment with two groups of users: one tweeting with random <b>hashtags</b> and one tweeting without <b>hashtags.</b> The results showed that there is a correlation between <b>hashtags</b> and followers: on average, users tweeting with <b>hashtags</b> increased their followers by 2. 88, while users tweeting without <b>hashtags</b> increased 0. 88 followers. We present a simple, reproducible approach to extract and analyze Twitter user data for this and similar purposes...|$|R
40|$|We {{conduct a}} study of the spatio-temporal {{dynamics}} of Twitter <b>hashtags</b> through a sample of 2 billion geo-tagged tweets. In our analysis, we (i) examine the impact of location, time, and distance on the adoption of <b>hashtags,</b> which is important for understanding meme diffusion and information propagation; (ii) examine the spatial propagation of <b>hashtags</b> through their focus, entropy, and spread; and (iii) present two methods that leverage the spatio-temporal propagation of <b>hashtags</b> to characterize locations. Based on this study, we find that although <b>hashtags</b> are a global phenomenon, the physical distance between locations is a strong constraint on the adoption of <b>hashtags,</b> both in terms of the <b>hashtags</b> shared between locations and in the timing of when these <b>hashtags</b> are adopted. We find both spatial and temporal locality as most <b>hashtags</b> spread over small geographical areas but at high speeds. We also find that <b>hashtags</b> are mostly a local phenomenon with long-tailed life spans. These (and other) findings have important implications for avarietyofsystemsandapplications,includingtargetedadvertising, location-based services, social media search, and content delivery networks...|$|R
3000|$|There {{is a need}} {{to explain}} the low {{precision}} results. Defined in Eq.  13, the precision P(p) is normalized over the number of <b>hashtags</b> returned by our system. As we ask for an increasing number of recommended <b>hashtags</b> (along the horizontal axis), the denominator also increases. However, recall from Table  1 that most tweets in our sanitized corpus only contain few <b>hashtags</b> ([...] 1.34 <b>hashtags</b> per tweet on average). Worse, only 7.4 [...] % of tweets contain more than two <b>hashtags.</b> Therefore, when we request p [...] > [...] p' <b>hashtags</b> to be recommended, where p' is the actual number of <b>hashtags</b> in the tweet, the precision is artificially reduced. This is the case for all methods evaluated.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, at {{the same}} time as Twitter {{executives}} paid to attend a political fundraiser by Hillary Clinton, the Twitter platform banned a pro-Bernie Sanders account that had started a <b>hashtag</b> critical of Clinton's fundraising from wealthy donors.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Ratajkowski {{promoted}} Fyre Festival on Instagram with Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, {{and other}} actresses/models. Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model {{to use the}} <b>hashtag</b> #ad, but has since deleted the post. The Federal Trade Commission has said #ad only worked if {{at the beginning of}} paid posts, and that the <b>hashtag</b> alone was not a sufficient disclaimer. A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles. The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud. On June 27. she was announced as the cover model for the August 2017 Australian Harper's Bazaar, which had different newsstand and subscriber covers photographed by Pamela Hanson.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2016, Twitter {{launched}} Instant Unlock Card, a {{new feature}} that {{encourages people to}} tweet about a brand in order to earn rewards and utilize the social media network's conversational ads. The format itself consists of images or videos with call-to-action buttons and a customizable <b>hashtag.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Twitter, {{currently}} {{the most popular}} microblogging tool available, is used to publish more than 140, 000, 000 messages a day. Many users use <b>hashtags</b> to categorize their tweets. However, <b>hashtags</b> are not restricted in any way in terms of usage or syntax {{which leads to a}} very heterogeneous set of <b>hashtags</b> occurring in the Twitter universe and therefore, decreases the search capabilities. In this paper, we present an approach for the recommendation of highly appropriate <b>hashtags</b> to the user during the creation process. The recommendations aim at encouraging the user to (i) use hastags at all, (ii) use more appropriate <b>hashtags</b> and (iii) avoid the usage of synonymous <b>hashtags.</b> Therefore the vocabulary of <b>hashtags</b> becomes more homogenous regarding both syntax and semantics. ...|$|R
30|$|Unlike the <b>hashtags</b> {{recommended}} by HF-IHU, kNN fails {{to identify any}} intuitively salient tags for our three sample users (Table  4). Moreover, most of recommended <b>hashtags</b> by kNN are in the top 50 popular <b>hashtags.</b> As observed in the evaluation with retweets, the performance of kNN method is directly affected by retweets in the data set. Since there are more terms that were tweeted with popular <b>hashtags,</b> it is more probable that tweets containing popular <b>hashtags</b> score high with Cosine similarity.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning July 2, 2009, Twitter {{began to}} {{hyperlink}} all <b>hashtags</b> in tweets to Twitter search {{results for the}} <b>hashtagged</b> word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced [...] "Trending Topics" [...] on the Twitter front page, displaying <b>hashtags</b> that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to spam the trending list and ensure that <b>hashtags</b> trend naturally.|$|R
5|$|Twitter often censors {{trending}} hashtags {{that are}} {{claimed to be}} abusive or offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican and #thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive. There are allegations that Twitter removed #NaMOinHyd from the trending list and added an Indian National Congress-sponsored <b>hashtag.</b>|$|E
5|$|During a Twitter {{conversation}} with fellow comic writer Joe Hill in 2013, Moore mentioned sales of Rachel Rising had fallen {{and he may}} have to cancel it if they fell any further. Concerned fans responded by using the #SaveRachelRising <b>hashtag</b> in an effort to show support and promote the book. Afterwards the sales stopped falling, but they did not increase. In January 2016, Moore announced the series would end at issue 42.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{movement}} {{began with the}} use of the <b>hashtag</b> #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin. Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown, resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the <b>hashtag</b> and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hashtags</b> {{can be used}} on {{the social}} network Instagram, by posting a picture and <b>hashtagging</b> it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be <b>hashtagged</b> #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain <b>hashtags,</b> some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and {{therefore}} do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked <b>hashtags</b> that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use. The ban against certain <b>hashtags</b> has a consequential role in the way that particular subaltern communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.|$|R
30|$|Users quickly {{coordinate}} {{on a few}} <b>hashtags</b> to use for an event, {{whether that}} event is a protest, sporting event, or meme [25]. As a result, the set of unique <b>hashtags</b> people use may decline when <b>hashtags</b> are being used most frequently, even if {{the total number of}} tweets with <b>hashtags</b> increases. Converging to a few <b>hashtags</b> and using them intensively is what we call coordination. We call this coordination because individuals are more likely to protest when they know many others will protest, and using a few <b>hashtags</b> repeatedly signals that there exists a latent demand for protest [26]. As the communication about upcoming protest occupies more of a country’s total communication, individuals should have higher confidence that others will protest.|$|R
30|$|In particular, the queries include {{relevant}} users (e.g., @YF_Academy, @esmeefairbairn, @resonanceltd, @Big PotentialSI, etc.), single <b>hashtags</b> (#socfin, #impinv #socialfinance, #impactinvestment, etc.), combined <b>hashtags</b> (#social & #finance, #social & #investment, #impact & #assessment, etc.), and <b>hashtags</b> {{of major}} impact investing events (#impact 2, #socap 17, #OxfordIIP, #skollwf, etc.).|$|R
5|$|Paynter {{developed}} an increasing fan base as people followed the Zayat family's social media updates, drawing comparisons {{to the struggle}} of Barbaro a few years earlier. Both Ahmed and Justin Zayat sent out regular tweets and the <b>hashtag</b> #PowerUpPaynter was used to help organize updates to the public. Paynter received handmade posters from children and hundreds of get well cards.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the <b>hashtag</b> #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the <b>hashtag</b> #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quantity}} of <b>hashtags</b> {{used in a}} post or tweet {{is just as important}} as the types of <b>hashtags</b> used. It is currently considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two <b>hashtags</b> are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three <b>hashtags</b> are seen by some as the [...] "absolute maximum", and any contribution exceeding this risks [...] "raising the ire of the community." ...|$|R
50|$|Why I Stayed {{was listed}} {{as one of the}} top social change <b>hashtags</b> of 2014 by Forbes, and one of the top 10 <b>hashtags</b> that started a {{conversation}} by Time Magazine. In March 2015, Why I Stayed was recognized as one of 8 <b>hashtags</b> that changed the world.|$|R
40|$|This dataset {{features}} all the tweetids and labels {{that were}} used to model the language of 24 <b>hashtags,</b> and test the performance on predicting the <b>hashtags</b> in unseen tweets.

5|$|Cena hosts American Grit on Fox, {{which is}} a reality {{television}} series with 10 episodes. 16 {{men and women were}} split into four teams, where challenges were given. A $1 million USD prize was given to the winning team. American Grit premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016. Cena has been retweeting motivational tweets from his followers on Twitter who used the <b>hashtag</b> #ShowYourGrit, {{in a way that the}} fan did something motivational to his/her friends in a real-life scenario. The finale of Season 1 aired on June 9, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} spots on the television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the <b>hashtag</b> TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{franchise}} has spawned a selection of merchandise, including posters and prints, items of clothing and sketchbooks of Purcell's work during various stages of the series' development. Collectable statues of the characters have also been created. However, despite references in Purcell's sketchbooks and demand from both fans and journalists alike, plush toys of the characters have not been produced. However, a plush toy of Max has been created and sold, albeit limited edition, as a collaboration between internet shop <b>Hashtag</b> Collectibles and Steve Purcell.|$|E
30|$|Overall {{popularity}} This method simply {{recommends the}} most frequently occurring (popular) <b>hashtags</b> in the training set for each test tweet. Table  2 shows the top 30 popular <b>hashtags</b> in our data set. This ranking method is not designed to make personalized recommendation, and therefore, the recommendations are consistently the same <b>hashtags</b> for any given tweet.|$|R
30|$|One {{advantage}} of HF-IFU {{is that our}} algorithm looks up candidate <b>hashtags</b> using the terms in a candidate tweet. This means {{that the number of}} candidate <b>hashtags</b> grows {{as a function of the}} number of terms in the tweet (t) and is bound from above by the total number of <b>hashtags</b> in the corpus (H). Because Twitter limits tweets to 140 characters, only a small number of words will actually fit in a tweet. Thus, the dominating term will be, in the worst case, the search over all H <b>hashtags.</b> However, the terms in any given tweet will typically not be associated with all H <b>hashtags,</b> so in practice, we would expect the cost to be substantially lower.|$|R
50|$|Compounding {{tends to}} produce longer lexemes which {{may result in}} lexemes of {{unwieldy}} proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where <b>hashtags</b> compound to form longer-sized <b>hashtags</b> that are at times more popular than the individual constituent <b>hashtags</b> forming the compound.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the <b>hashtag</b> #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 2016, {{publicity}} stills {{of the ongoing}} production of season 2 were posted online accompanied by a short message by Lana Wachowski introducing the #Road2Sense8 <b>hashtag</b> under which new pictures would be posted. On December 3, 2016, the Christmas special episode was screened at São Paulo's Comic Con Experience, in advance of its Netflix premiere on December 23. The second episode of the second season was screened out of competition during the Series Mania festival in Paris, on April 18, 2017. On April 23, a screening of {{the second and third}} episodes took place in Chicago's Music Box Theatre, in a benefit for the American Civil Liberties Union, followed by Lana Wachowski taking questions from the audience, and again on April 26, in the red carpet premiere of the second season, at New York City's AMC Lincoln Square.|$|E
5|$|Zito faced {{off against}} the Reds in Game 4 of the National League Division Series (NLDS) on October 10 and struggled, being pulled {{in the third}} inning after {{allowing}} two runs. However, the Giants went on to win 8–3. The Giants, after losing the first two games of the series, became the first team to rally from a 2–0 deficit in an NLDS, winning the series in five games. On October 19, 2012, Zito rebounded and pitched arguably the best game of his career, tossing 7 shutout innings against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), earning the win. It was his first postseason win since 2006 and according to Zito himself, was the biggest win of his career. That same day, Zito inspired the Twitter <b>hashtag</b> #rallyzito, which, behind the efforts of Giants fans, was trending worldwide on the social networking site. The Giants, after trailing 3–1 in the series, prevailed in seven games.|$|E
