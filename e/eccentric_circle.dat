60|$|We {{had little}} time to watch them, however, for in an instant they had {{overtaken}} the fugitives and were making a dire slaughter among them. Their method was to fall forward with their full weight upon each in turn, leaving him crushed and mangled, to bound on after the others. The wretched Indians screamed with terror, but were helpless, run as they would, before the relentless purpose and horrible activity of these monstrous creatures. One after another they went down, and there were not half-a-dozen surviving {{by the time my}} companion and I could come to their help. But our aid was of little avail and only involved us in the same peril. At the range of a couple of hundred yards we emptied our magazines, firing bullet after bullet into the beasts, but with no more effect than if we were pelting them with pellets of paper. Their slow reptilian natures cared nothing for wounds, and the springs of their lives, with no special brain center but scattered throughout their spinal cords, could not be tapped by any modern weapons. The most that we could do was to check their progress by distracting their attention with the flash and roar of our guns, and so to give both the natives and ourselves time to reach the steps which led to safety. But where the conical explosive bullets of the twentieth century were of no avail, the poisoned arrows of the natives, dipped in the juice of strophanthus and steeped afterwards in decayed carrion, could succeed. Such arrows were of little avail to the hunter who attacked the beast, because their action in that torpid circulation was slow, and before its powers failed it could certainly overtake and slay its assailant. But now, as the two monsters hounded us to the very foot of the stairs, a drift of darts came whistling from every chink in the cliff above them. In a minute they were feathered with them, and yet with no sign of pain they clawed and slobbered with impotent rage at the steps which would lead them to their victims, mounting clumsily up for a few yards and then sliding down again to the ground. But at last the poison worked. One of them gave a deep rumbling groan and dropped his huge squat head on to the earth. The other bounded round in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle</b> with shrill, wailing cries, and then lying down writhed in agony for some minutes before it also stiffened and lay still. With yells of triumph the Indians came flocking down from their caves and danced a frenzied dance of victory round the dead bodies, in mad joy that two more of the most dangerous of all their enemies had been slain. That night they cut up and removed the bodies, not to eat--for the poison was still active--but lest they should breed a pestilence. The great reptilian hearts, however, each as large as a cushion, still lay there, beating slowly and steadily, with a gentle rise and fall, in horrible independent life. It was only upon the third day that the ganglia ran down and the dreadful things were still.|$|E

In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, pneumatic clamps, hydraulic fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, screw clamp, <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle</b> clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle</b> clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle</b> with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|E

But <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle</b> method has the virtue of being easier to implement and can be used without restriction of R/D, so it is an ideal method of finite element modeling for unequal wall thickness elbows.

40|$|AbstractA simple {{implementation}} on {{vector processors}} of the SOR method for solving a linear {{system of equations}} arising from the discretization of partial differential equations changes the SOR method into another, which, though, looks like the SOR method. In this paper, the efficiency of this SOR-like method (pseudo-SOR method) is investigated. For the Poisson equation in a rectangular region, in both five-point and nine-point discretization, we prove analytically that the optimal acceleration parameter is smaller and the optimal convergence rate is lower in the pseudo-SOR method. Comparison on several vector computers was made between the SOR method vectorized with the hyperplane technique and the pseudo-SOR method. It {{turned out that the}} hyperplane SOR is superior to the pseudo-SOR method although the latter is easily vectorizable on vector processors. We also tested an example of the Poisson equation discretized in curved coordinates in a region bounded by two <b>eccentric</b> <b>circles</b> and found numerically that the optimal acceleration parameter becomes small and the convergence becomes slow in the pseudo-SOR method, while the optimal acceleration parameter in the SOR method does not change appreciably.

The problem consists in solving the Poisson's problem in the two-phase domain and assuring the continuity of the velocity and stress fields everywhere. Annular and stratified flow patterns of two immiscible viscous fluids are investigated by imposing different interface shapes, e. g. concentric or <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle,</b> arc segment (lunar), chord. The non-orthogonal grid for numerical computations is generated algebraically in curvilinear coordinates for each interface. The flux-spline method is observed to be conceptually superior to standard finite volume methods since it automatically assures the continuity of stress at the interface. Comparisons of the volumetric flow rates calculated by this method with published analytical results using the bi-polar coordinate system are made.

It has the following features: (i) assuming no prior knowledge, (ii) providing more information of the roundness profile than the sequential three-point (S 3 P) method, (iii) reconstructing the roundness profile including sharp features.

40|$|In the {{solution}} of the Saint Venant problem for composite sections, the general method of attack is the introduction of the conjugate torsion and flexure functions and the reduction of the problem to a Dirichlet type problem. For the orthotropic portion of the section this first involves a transformation of variables and the definition of function harmonic over the transformed variables;In the flexure problem the concept of the center of elasticity is introduced. This center of elasticity plays the same role in the flexure problem as the geometric centroid for the completely isotropic section. It has been pointed out that loading along a geometric axis of symmetry of the section does not insure the absence of a twisting effect. The Young 2 Ì† 7 s moduli in the z direction of the respective portions of the section are the only elastic constants entering into the definition of the center of elasticity. If the portions of the section have the same Young 2 Ì† 7 s modulus in the z direction regardless of what the other elastic properties of the isotropic or orthotropic portion may be, the center of elasticity will correspond to the geometric center;Solutions have been obtained for composite sections whose boundaries are concentric circles, similar ellipses, confocal ellipses, <b>eccentric</b> <b>circles</b> and rectangles.

40|$|With its fluid boundaries, the Bloomsbury Group {{was first}} and {{foremost}} a circle of friends who shared a similar social background and progressive political views. Named after the small neighbourhood in London where some of its members settled as young adults, the Group included some of the leading artists and writers of the interwar period â€“ from Virginia Woolf to E. M. Forster, from Vanessa to Clive Bell, from Roger Fry to Lytton Strachey, among others â€“ as well as John Maynard Keynes, {{one of the most influential}} economists of the twentieth century. Variously considered an elitist coterie and a democratic avant-garde, the Group not only left behind an intellectual legacy as impressive as it was diverse, but also introduced a new way of living and working that helped to mark a definitive break with Victorian tradition and paved the way to modernity in British culture.

40|$|This work is an {{outreach}} {{approach to}} an ubiquitous recent problem in secondary-school education: how to face back the decreasing interest {{in natural sciences}} shown by students under â€˜pressureâ€™ of convenient resources in digital devices/applications. The approach rests on two features. First, empowering of teen-age students to understand regular natural events around, as very few educated people they meet could do. Secondly, an understanding that rests on personal capability to test and verify experimental results from the oldest science, astronomy, with simple instruments as used from antiquity down to the Renaissance (a capability restricted to just solar and lunar motions). Because lengths in astronomy and daily life are so disparate, astronomy basically involved observing and registering values of angles (along with times), measurements being of two types, of angles {{on the ground and}} of angles in space, from the ground. First, the gnomon, a simple vertical stick introduced in Babylonia and Egypt, and then in Greece, is used to understand solar motion. The gnomon shadow turns around during any given day, varying in length and thus angle between solar ray and vertical as it turns, going through a minimum (noon time, at a meridian direction) while sweeping some angular range from sunrise to sunset. Further, the shadow minimum length varies through the year, with times when shortest and sun closest to vertical, at summer solstice, and times when longest, at winter solstice six months later. The extreme directions at sunset and sunrise correspond to the solstices, swept angular range greatest at summer, over 180 degrees, and the opposite at winter, with less daytime hours; in between, spring and fall equinoxes occur, marked by collinear shadow directions at sunrise and sunset. The gnomon allows students to determine, in addition to latitude (about 40. 4 Â° North at Madrid, say), the inclination of earth equator to plane of its orbit around the sun (ecliptic), this fundamental quantity being given by half the difference between solar distances to vertical at winter and summer solstices, with value about 23. 5 Â°. Day and year periods greatly differing by about 2 Â½ orders of magnitude, 1 day against 365 days, helps students to correctly visualize and interpret the experimental measurements. Since the gnomon serves to observe at night the moon shadow too, students can also determine the inclination of the lunar orbital plane, as about 5 degrees away from the ecliptic, thus explaining why eclipses are infrequent. Independently, earth taking longer between spring and fall equinoxes than from fall to spring (the solar anomaly), as again verified by the students, was explained in ancient Greek science, which posited orbits universally as circles or their combination, by introducing the <b>eccentric</b> <b>circle,</b> with earth placed some distance away from the orbital centre when considering the relative motion of the sun, which would be closer to the earth in winter. In a sense, this can be seen as hint and approximation of the elliptic orbit proposed by Kepler many centuries later...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{critical}} re-evaluation of politics and ideology {{in the work of}} D. H. Lawrence. The thesis brings a number of authors (including the Marquis de Sade, Robert Louis Stevenson, H. G. Wells and Raymond Chandler) into dialogue with Lawrence - fIrstly in order to interrogate Lawrentian assumptions, but also to relocate a writer often seen as being <b>eccentric</b> to literary <b>circles</b> and to society generally. My Introduction surveys two broad schools of Lawrence criticism: first, the 'Lawrentian' kind, which inspects Lawrence's fiction through an often uncritical appreciation of the non-fictional writings - his 'philosophy' - and consequently is often reduced to an echo of the primary material. While recognising, in the manner of my second, socialist school of criticism, Lawrence's philosophy as ideology, a challenge is also made to the conventional left-wing judgement that such ideology indicates Lawrence's political 'failure'. Chapters One and Two provide extended analyses of, respectively, the novels Women in Love and Kangaroo: the first of these novels sees Lawrentian individuals attempting to 'solve' the problem of an oppressive industrial society by escaping it; the second shows the shortcomings of the 'freedom' won by such a supposed escape. Examining the contradictions of Lawrence's individualism, I argue the case that these texts present a rich commentary upon the economic and social contradictions of capitalism. My third chapter takes a broader view of Lawrence's shorter, ironical and satirical works, and argues that an openly satirical mode allowed Lawrence to break free from his contradictory 'philosophy' and engage in a critical dialogue with his own work that is much more penetrating than any critique by his Lawrentian admirers. Finally, the conclusion looks at the persisting problem of the 'Lawrentian' attitude in Lawrence studies, and at the enduring significance of Lawrence to our postmodem world...|$|R
