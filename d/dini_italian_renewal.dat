He became leader of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> in the Chamber of Deputies. During the term, however, he departed from the movement of Dini and approached UDR reconstituting with 2 other members (Giuseppe Bicocchi and Elisa Pozza Tasca) the subgroup of The Pact inside of the Mixed group (with the name [...] "Pact-UDR-Liberal"). In the D'Alema government he was appointed Undersecretary of the Interior. But soon he distanced himself from the center and the Government and adhered to the Pole of Freedoms, joining the group of Forza Italia.|$|R

50|$|The {{party was}} formed in 2000 by the merger of Integral Autonomy (led by Sergio Casagranda and Caterina Dominici), the provincial section of <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> (led by Sergio Muraro, {{a former member of}} Lega Nord Trentino) and {{splinters}} from the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (Dario Pallaoro).|$|R

50|$|The party, whose current {{leader is}} Italo Tanoni, traces {{its roots in}} <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal,</b> which was folded into Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy in 2002. <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal's</b> and the Liberal Democrats' leader was Lamberto Dini, who had {{previously}} served as Director-General of the Bank of Italy (1979-1994) under Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Minister of the Treasury (1994-1995) under Silvio Berlusconi, Prime Minister (1995-1996) and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1996-2001) under Romano Prodi, Massimo D'Alema and Giuliano Amato. In the run-up of {{the foundation of the}} Democratic Party in 2007, Dini and his group quit and formed the Liberal Democrats, which would temporarily join The People of Freedom. In 2008 Dini stayed in that party, partying ways from his Liberal Democrats, who continued to be active as an autonomous party.|$|R

When DL was {{transformed}} into a party in 2002, Mastella refused to join and the UDEUR remained an independent party within the centre-left.|$|R
50|$|When the Segni Pact entered The Olive Tree centre-left {{coalition}} {{in the run-up}} for the 1996 general election (through <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal),</b> the RS gained some independence from the mother-party, and, when at the 1999 European Parliament election Segni formed a joint electoral list with National Alliance, some of their members looked closer to Forza Italia.|$|R
50|$|For {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1996, the Italian Socialists joined {{the list of}} <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal,</b> a newly formed liberal-centrist party led by Lamberto Dini, within The Olive Tree coalition, acquiring in total 7 deputies (Giuseppe Albertini, Enrico Boselli, Vincenzo Ceremigna, Giovanni Crema, Sergio Fumagalli, Paolo Manca and Roberto Villetti) and 5 senators (Livio Besso Cordero, Ottaviano Del Turco, Giovanni Iuliano, Maria Rosaria Manieri and Cesare Marini).|$|R
50|$|After the election, the {{alliance}} was disbanded. The PPI suffered a split {{of those who}} wanted to join Berlusconi's centre-right (the United Christian Democrats of Rocco Buttiglione) and {{those who wanted to}} ally with the left-wing Democratic Party of the Left. Segni Pact become a minor force and formed a joint list, within the centre-left coalition The Olive Tree, with <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> and the <b>Italian</b> Socialists for 1996 general election called the Pact of Democrats.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 Romano Prodi, {{a former}} {{minister}} of Industry {{on behalf of}} the left-wing faction of Christian Democracy (DC), entered politics and founded The Olive Tree (L'Ulivo), a centre-left coalition including the PDS, the Italian People's Party (PPI), the Federation of the Greens (FdV), <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> (RI), the <b>Italian</b> Socialists (SI) and Democratic Union (UD). The coalition, in alliance with the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), won the 1996 general election and Prodi became Prime Minister.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 the PATT {{entered into}} an {{alliance}} with the Daisy-dominated centre-left coalition. Consequently, Carlo Andreotti was appointed President of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol {{at the head of}} a coalition comprising the SVP, the Daisy, the Democrats of the Left and the Greens. Contextually, the Trentino Autonomists (AT), formed by the merger of AI with the provincial section of <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> and additional PATT splinters led by Dario Pallaoro in 2000, joined forces with the PATT.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2013 general {{election}} the LD externally supported Mario Monti's Civic Choice and, after the election, Melchiorre {{returned to her}} job as magistrate and, having consequently resigned from party president, she was replaced by Tanoni. In the 2016 constitutional referendum the party {{was part of the}} [...] "yes" [...] camp, that was soundly defeated, and organised a committee presided by Tiziano Treu, a former minister and senator for <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> and DL.|$|R
50|$|A long-time Christian Democrat, he {{was first}} elected to the Regional Council of Veneto in 2000 for Together for Veneto, a centrist {{alliance}} comprising the Italian People's Party, The Democrats and <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal.</b> In 2005 he was re-elected for Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy and then joined the Democratic Party.

2500|$|Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy ( [...] , DL), {{commonly}} {{known simply as}} The Daisy (La Margherita), was a centrist political party in Italy. The party was formed from the merger of three parties: the Italian People's Party, The Democrats and <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal.</b> The party president and leader was Francesco Rutelli, former mayor of Rome and prime ministerial candidate during the 2001 general election for The Olive Tree coalition, within which The Daisy electoral list won 14.5% of the national vote.|$|R
50|$|A {{few months}} later the party formed a {{federation}} with the United Christian Democrats and in the run-up of the 1996 general election it was finally merged with <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> (RI), led by another former minister under Berlusconi, Lamberto Dini. In the election two MID members, Aldo Brancati and Giovanni Bruni were elected to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, respectively, but both of them soon left RI (Brancati finally joined the Democrats of the Left, while Bruni Forza Italia).|$|R
50|$|Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy (Democrazia è Libertà - La Margherita, DL), {{commonly}} {{known simply as}} The Daisy (La Margherita), was a centrist political party in Italy. The party was formed from the merger of three parties: the Italian People's Party, The Democrats and <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal.</b> The party president and leader was Francesco Rutelli, former mayor of Rome and prime ministerial candidate during the 2001 general election for The Olive Tree coalition, within which The Daisy electoral list won 14.5% of the national vote.|$|R
50|$|In April, 1996, {{a general}} {{election}} was called, in which Berlusconi's House of Freedoms coalition, minus the Lega Nord, was pitted against that of Romano Prodi, The Olive Tree. Relations between Dini and Berlusconi had seriously soured by then, and Dini chose to join The Olive Tree with his own centrist party, <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal.</b> <b>Dini</b> {{was elected to the}} Italian Chamber of Deputies, and served for the entire term as Minister of Foreign Affairs in four successive centre-left governments, under Prodi, Massimo D'Alema in two separate, successive cabinets, and finally Giuliano Amato.|$|R
5000|$|The Alliance {{suffered}} a huge {{defeat in the}} 1994 general election by the Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government centre-right coalitions led by Silvio Berlusconi. For the 1996 general election the Alliance was succeeded by The Olive Tree coalition, which included the Italian People's Party (diminished by the split of the United Christian Democrats in 1995), <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> and Segni Pact, and excluding the Communist Refoundation Party, which was an external ally and presented its candidates under the [...] "Progressives" [...] banner in single-seat constituencies in Central Italy.|$|R
50|$|It {{was formed}} for the 2000 {{regional}} election {{by the local}} sections of three national parties: the Italian People's Party, The Democrats and <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal.</b> Under the leadership of Massimo Cacciari, who was also candidate for President for the whole The Olive Tree coalition, the joint centrist list won 13.6% and elected ten regional deputies: six Populars and three Democrats, plus Massimo Cacciari, a Democrat himself, who was soundly defeated by Giancarlo Galan (Forza Italia, House of Freedoms). Since then the group became the largest centre-left party in Veneto as the Democrats of the Left stopped at 12.3%.|$|R
50|$|For the 2001 general {{election}} the PPI formed a joint list with Dem, the Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR) and <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> (RI). The list, named Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy (DL), won 14.5% of vote. In 2002 DL {{was transformed into}} a full-fledged party, the PPI was merged into it and a cultural association named The Populars was formed. DL would later be merged, along with the Democrats of the Left (DS) and minor centre-left parties, into the Democratic Party (PD), of which The Populars became a faction. Two members of the PPI and DL, Enrico Letta and Matteo Renzi, would successively serve as Prime Ministers in 2013-2016.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2000 Parisi {{asked the}} Democrats of the Left, then led by Walter Veltroni, to {{dissolve}} {{into a new}} [...] "Democratic Party". The proposal was not received, thus in October 2000 The Democrats agreed with the PPI, <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> and the Union of Democrats for Europe to form a joint list for the 2001 general election, {{under the leadership of}} Rutelli, who was also The Olive Tree's [...] "candidate for Prime Minister". The list, which gained a considerable success (14.5%), was transformed into a party in March 2002 under the name of Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy. This party, led by Rutelli, would be eventually merged into the Democratic Party in October 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} founded on 18 September 2007 as a right-wing split from Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy (DL), in {{opposition}} to the formation of the Democratic Party (PD), of which Lamberto Dini had originally been a founding member. The new party was a sort of continuation of the defunct <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> party, which had been merged into DL in 2002, but had continued to be active as liberal-centrist faction within it. The party was joined by three senators (Natale D'Amico, Giuseppe Scalera and Dini himself), a deputy (Italo Tanoni), an under-secretary (Daniela Melchiorre) and two regional councillors (Rosario Monteleone in Liguria and Antonio Verini in Abruzzo). Dini was elected party president, Tanoni coordinator and Scalera leader in the Senate, where Liberal Democrats were able to form a sub-group within the Mixed Group.|$|R
50|$|During his job Ravenna {{constantly}} {{contributed to}} several magazines with texts and designs. Also {{he helped the}} <b>Italian</b> editorial <b>renewal</b> and looked after the printing of some books. With the help of Egidio Bonfante in 1943, he published the book 50 disegni di Picasso, and the book Arte Cubista, two years later.|$|R
25|$|The idea of uniting the centrist {{components}} of The Olive Tree coalitions, which were divided in many parties, was discussed {{at least since}} 1996. In the 1996 general election there were actually two centrist lists within the Italian centre-left: the Populars for Prodi, including the Italian People's Party (PPI), Democratic Union (UD), the Italian Republican Party (PRI) and the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP), and that of <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> (RI), including the Italian Socialists (SI), which later merged into the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) in 1998, and the Segni Pact (PS). In 1998 splinters from the centre-right coalition formed the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR), later transformed into Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), {{in order to support}} the D'Alema I Cabinet. In 1999 splinters of PPI, UD and other groups formed The Democrats (Dem).|$|R
50|$|The PD {{was founded}} on 14 October 2007 upon the merger of various centre-left parties which {{had been part of}} The Olive Tree list and The Union {{coalition}} in the 2006 general election. They notably included: the social-democratic Democrats of the Left (DS), successors of the Italian Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left, which was folded with several social-democratic parties (Labour Federation, Social Christians, etc.) in 1998; and the largely Catholic-inspired Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy (DL), merger of the Italian People's Party (heir of the defunct Christian Democracy party's left-wing), The Democrats and <b>Italian</b> <b>Renewal</b> in 2002. The PD's main ideological trends are thus social democracy and the Italian Christian leftist tradition. The party has been also influenced by social liberalism, which was already present in some of the founding components of the DS and DL, and more generally by a Third Way progressivism.|$|R
5000|$|Filippo Mancuso (22 July 1922 - 30 May 2011) was an Italian {{judge and}} politician. In 1995 he was Italy's Minister of Justice in the {{government}} of Lamberto <b>Dini.</b> The <b>Italian</b> Senate voted a motion of no confidence against him and this fact was the first time during the republican period. The left wing and Lega Nord complained about the review of the Mani pulite pool during Tangentopoli. He was elected {{for the first time as}} deputy in Italian general election, 1996 with Forza Italia party and he was confirmed in the 2001 general elections. He left Forza Italia in 2002, because he was not elected to the Constitutional Court of Italy because of opposition of the left wing. Mancuso agreed with Silvio Berlusconi to nominate another person for the Supreme Court, possibly Mario Serio, but then Forza Italia denoted Romano Vaccarella, a close friend of Cesare Previti. After 2006 Mancuso retired to private life until his death ...|$|R
