40|$|<b>End-pipe</b> {{corrections}} seldom {{come to mind}} as a suit-able {{topic for}} an introductory physics lab. Yet, the <b>end-pipe</b> correction formula can be verified in an engaging and inexpensive lab that requires only two sup-plies: plastic-tube toys called boomwhackers 1 and a meter-stick. This article describes a lab activity in which students model data from plastic tubes {{to arrive at the}} end-correction formula for an open pipe. Students also learn the basic mathematics behind the musical scale, and come to appreci-ate the importance of <b>end-pipe</b> physics in the engineering design of toy musical tubes. Goals Authors have addressed measuring frequencies of cor-rugated tubes 2 and PVC pipes. 3 - 6 Some of these authors 2, 5, 6 incorporate <b>end-pipe</b> corrections in their discussions. The majority of prior literature has focused on corrugated tubes or plumbing pipes. In contrast, this paper focuses on th...|$|E
40|$|Along with China's modern industrialization, {{challenges}} on smog crisis are raising {{dramatically in the}} past decade. The sources of municipal smog are multiple and complex, {{one of which is}} construction dust emission due to the rapid urbanization. In literature, there are studies focusing on the <b>end-pipe</b> treatment of construction dust; however, very little research has been conducted from the perspective of dust mitigation in developing countries. To fill in this research gap, this paper investigates the current situation of construction dust prevention and control in China, with the aim of providing insights for mitigating dust pollution caused by the construction industry. Through a combination of the content analysis, on-site observation, questionnaire survey and interviews with experienced professionals, a total of 11 related regulations are thoroughly reviewed, and the main sources of construction dust production are identified. A case study is further presented to demonstrate the prevailing dust control measures on site. Recommendations are proposed in order to increase the awareness of related stakeholders, including formulation of targeted regulations, establishment of an appropriate charging scheme, development of a feasible monitoring system, and enhancement of training and dissemination.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are {{a series of}} {{organic compounds}} that readily vaporize at room temperature. When emitted into the environment can affect climate change and plants growth, and cause long term human health risks. Absorption abatement technique has been the most preferred to reduce VOCs from contaminated gaseous streams, hence the need for a polymeric solvent with a greater affinity for <b>end-pipe</b> inventory. This phase equilibrium study investigated the ability of diisononyl phthalate (DINP) as an absorbent to 80 selected VOCs at infinite dilution. The solvent-solute(s) interactions were studied using modified UNIFAC Lyngby and Dortmund group contribution methods, with the latter being consistent and reliable, as its results are related to literature. Alkanes, alkanes, aldehydes and cyclo-alkanes with shorter carbon-chain length are highly soluble in DINP, with their solubility decreasing with increasing molecular weight or size, at infinite dilution. Alkynes, ketones, alcohols and carboxylic acids are less soluble in DINP, {{as a result of their}} dominating polarity compared to the DINP non-polarity structure. However, results could be improved with further studies and publication of solvent-solute(s) sub-groups interaction parameters, and thus further development of modified UNIFAC Lyngby model. DINP is a good absorbent for short-chained non-polar VOCs...|$|E
