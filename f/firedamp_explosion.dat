500|$|Coal {{had been}} mined {{for several hundred}} years in {{numerous}} shallow shafts and adits, but took on greater importance when in 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton leased the coal rights to Thomas Guest from Leigh and John Fletcher from Bolton. In 1845 the era of deep mining arrived with the sinking of Fletcher's Lover's Lane pit at Howe Bridge. The Crombouke Day-Eye, a drift mine accessing the shallow Brassy and Crombouke mines, opened in 1870 and closed in 1907. (A coal seam {{was referred to as}} a [...] "mine" [...] in this part of Lancashire.) By the early 1870s Fletcher, Burrows and Company's Howe Bridge Colliery, the biggest of the three Howe Bridge pits, was sunk to the Black & White, or Seven Foot mine. It pit closed in 1959. Gibfield Colliery, situated alongside the Bolton and Leigh Railway, was working in 1829, coal was mined from the Trencherbone mine. Forty years later a [...] shaft was sunk to Arley Mine. The pit closed in 1963. In September 1913 the first pit head baths in the country were opened at Gibfield. Chanters Colliery was in Hindsford, where [...] shafts were sunk to the Trencherbone mine in 1854. In the late 1890s shafts were deepened to [...] to reach the Arley mine. Atherton had its share of mining disasters, on 11 February 1850 five men died in a gas explosion caused by a lighted candle at Gibfield and 27 men died at Lovers Lane Colliery after a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> caused by blown-out shot on 28 March 1872. On 6 March 1957 eight men died at Chanters Colliery after an explosion of gas.|$|E

50|$|Firedamp is {{explosive}} at concentrations between 4% and 16%, {{with most}} explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused much {{loss of life}} in coal mines before {{the invention of the}} Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. Even after the safety lamps were brought into common use, <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions</b> could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of <b>explosion</b> with <b>firedamp,</b> and indeed could cause explosions itself. The Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites, and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions,</b> including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor long, {{very large}} {{accidents}} occurred in explosive factories. Later, accidents {{were reported in}} flour mills (end of 18 th Century), in mines (coal dust and <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions),</b> in chemical plants, during the transportation of dangerous goods such as fertilizers, explosives [...] . or even with very common substances such as fuels or grain...|$|R
25|$|<b>Firedamp</b> <b>explosions</b> {{can trigger}} the much-more-dangerous coal dust explosions, which can engulf an entire pit. Most of these risks can be greatly reduced in modern mines, and {{multiple}} fatality incidents are now rare {{in some parts}} of the developed world. Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per year due to mine accidents.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] Udston mining {{disaster}} {{occurred in}} Hamilton, Scotland on Saturday, 28 May 1887 when 73 miners {{died in a}} <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> at Udston Colliery.

2500|$|Spedding {{invented a}} [...] "steel mill", {{in which a}} flint was held against a rapidly rotated steel disc, {{producing}} a stream of sparks giving some illumination. A second worker was needed to operate the mill, since the disc was rotated by a hand crank, and its operation was tiring. The use of the mill as a safer alternative to naked flame spread to other coalfields; prior {{to the introduction of}} the Davy lamp, up to a hundred steel mills were in daily use at one Tyneside colliery despite a fatal <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> at Wallsend colliery in 1785 ignited by a steel mill[...]|$|E
2500|$|He wrote Miners {{in under}} {{an hour in}} {{response}} to the Minnie Pit Disaster of 12 January 1918 in which 156 men and boys lost their lives {{as a result of a}} <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion,</b> including 40 pit-lads under 16. Owen was unusually well-acquainted (for someone with a grammar school education) with working-class miner types. Aged nineteen, he had met a Northumberland pit-lad who made a particular impression on him at a nonconformist convention in Keswick in 1912. Also, many of the men in his platoon had worked down the Lancashire pits before the war: in 1916, Owen had described his men as"hard-handed, hard-headed miners, dogged, loutish, ugly. (But I would trust them to advance under fire and to hold their trench;) blond, coarse, ungainly, strong, 'unfatiguable', unlovely, Lancashire soldiers, Saxons to the bone. In addition Owen was a keen geologist who had collected rocks and minerals since his youth, and in Miners he uses phrases like [...] "smothered ferns" [...] and [...] "frond-forests", redolent of the imprints of fossil plants in coal.|$|E
50|$|In later times, {{a fire at}} {{the base}} of a shaft was used to create an updraught, but just like fire-setting, it was a {{hazardous}} and dangerous procedure, especially in collieries. As the number and complexity of the underground workings increased, care was needed to channel the air draught to all parts of the tunnels and faces. It was usually achieved by installing doors at key points. Most of the deaths in coal mine disasters were caused by inhalation of the toxic gases produced by <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Coal mining {{was very}} {{dangerous}} {{owing to the}} presence of firedamp in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in 1816 by Sir Humphry Davy and independently by George Stephenson. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. <b>Firedamp</b> <b>explosions</b> continued, often setting off coal dust explosions, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.|$|R
2500|$|The {{people of}} the Tyneside area, called [...] "Geordies", have a {{reputation}} for their distinctive dialect and accent. Tynesiders may have been given this name, a local diminutive of the name [...] "George", because their miners used George Stephenson's safety lamp (invented in 1815 and called a [...] "Georgie lamp") to prevent <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions,</b> rather than the Davy lamp used elsewhere. An alternative explanation relates that during the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 the Tynesiders declared their allegiance to the Hanoverian kings of Great Britain George I and George II; whereas the rest of the county of Northumberland, to the north, stood loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart.|$|R

50|$|On 17 February 2014 a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> in the Pivnichna Saltivka mine (in Donetsk Oblast), killed seven workers 815 meters underground.|$|E
5000|$|Two further coal shafts were in {{development}} when a fatal <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> occurred in 1811, {{after which the}} mine was closed.|$|E
50|$|Davy {{conceived}} of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamp's flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing {{out to the}} general atmosphere. Although {{the idea of the}} safety lamp had already been demonstrated by William Reid Clanny and by the then unknown (but later very famous) engineer George Stephenson, Davy's use of wire gauze {{to prevent the spread of}} flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs. George Stephenson's lamp was very popular in the north-east coalfields, and used the same principle of preventing the flame reaching the general atmosphere, but by different means. Unfortunately, although the new design of gauze lamp initially did seem to offer protection, it gave much less light, and quickly deteriorated in the wet conditions of most pits. Rusting of the gauze quickly made the lamp unsafe, and the number of deaths from <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions</b> rose yet further.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{increase}} in accidents was the unreliability of the lamps themselves. The bare gauze was easily damaged, and once just a single wire broke or rusted away, the lamp became unsafe.Work carried out by a scientific witness and reported by the Select Committee showed that the Davy lamp became unsafe in airflows so low that a Davy lamp carried at normal walking pace against normal airflows in walkways was only safe if provided with a draught shield (not normally fitted), and the Committee noted that accidents had happened when the lamp was [...] "in general and careful use; no one survived {{to tell the tale}} of how these occurrences took place; conjecture supplied the want of positive knowledge most unsatisfactorily; but incidents are recorded which prove what must follow unreasonable testing of the lamp; and your Committee are constrained to believe that ignorance and a false reliance upon its merits, in cases attended with unwarrantable risks, have led to disastrous consequences" [...] The [...] "South Shields Committee", a body set up by a public meeting there (in response to an explosion at the St Hilda pit in 1839) to consider the prevention of accidents in mines had shown that mine ventilation in the North-East was generally deficient, with an insufficient supply of fresh air giving every opportunity for explosive mixtures of gas to accumulate. A subsequent Select Committee in 1852 concurred with this view; <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosions</b> could best be prevented by improving mine ventilation (by the use of steam ejectors: the committee specifically advised against fan ventilation), which had been neglected because of over-reliance on the safety of the Davy lamp.|$|R
50|$|Despite its profitability, Minnie was a {{dangerous}} pit because it had <b>firedamp.</b> Two other <b>explosions</b> had already happened before the 1918 disaster. A blast killed all the pit ponies but no miners on 6 February 1898. Nine miners - including the colliery engineer, a Mr. John White - were killed by an explosion on 17 January 1915. As both explosions had happened on Sundays, it had resulted in a relatively low loss of life. The prevalence of firedamp affected all the Podmore Hall Combine collieries. It caused a number of explosion at the Burley Pit: 23 killed, 23 March 1878; 9 killed June 1878; 10 killed, 2 April 1891.|$|R
5000|$|Senghenydd {{colliery}} disaster, a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> at the pit near Caerphilly, Glamorgan, killed 439 {{miners and}} one rescuer on 14 October 1913. It remains Britain's worst mining disaster.|$|E

50|$|On 2 August 1869, {{there was}} a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> in the pits of Segen-Gottes-Schaft and Neuhoffnungschacht in the Burgk coal mines, in which 276 miners died. This {{disaster}} is recalled by a recalled a monument at the Segen-Gottes-Schaft near the Windberg.|$|E
50|$|In January 1868 an {{extraction}} cage detached {{and damaged}} the guide ropes, {{which led to}} a two-week layoff for the miners. On 24 January 1868, the mine suffered a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> that left eight dead and damaged 250 m of its structural timbers.|$|E
50|$|The Udston mining {{disaster}} {{occurred in}} Hamilton, Scotland on Saturday, 28 May 1887 when 73 miners {{died in a}} <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> at Udston Colliery.

50|$|In 2010, {{there was}} a mining {{disaster}} in Zonguldak Province {{which resulted in the}} deaths of 30 workers in a coal mine. The explosion was caused by a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion.</b> Previous mining disasters have also occurred here, one in 1992 resulted in the deaths of 270 workers. This was the worst mining disaster until the Soma mine disaster.|$|E
5000|$|The causes are uncertain. A <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion,</b> likely of {{hydrogen}} sulfide, that triggered off a coal dust explosion is most likely. The mine {{had been just}} re-opened following a strike, leading to a buildup of [...] "foul air." [...] A coroner’s inquest ruled that the fire had followed {{from the use of}} gunpowder in the mine.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, this {{prediction}} was not fulfilled: {{in the next}} thirty years, firedamp explosions in Whitehaven pits cost 137 lives. More generally, the Select Committee on Accidents in Mines reported in 1835 that {{the introduction of the}} Davy lamp had led to an increase in mine accidents; the lamp encouraged the working of mines and parts of mines that had previously been closed for safety reasons. For example, in 1835 102 men and boys were killed by a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> in a Wallsend colliery working the Bensham seam, described at the subsequent inquest by John Buddle as [...] "a dangerous seam, which required the utmost care in keeping in a working state", which could only be worked with the Davy lamp. The coroner noted that a previous <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> in 1821 had killed 52, but directed his jury that any finding on the wisdom of continuing to work the seam was outside their province.|$|E
50|$|The Lundhill Colliery {{explosion}} was a {{coal mining}} accident {{which took place}} on 19 February 1857 in Wombwell, Yorkshire, UK in which 189 men and boys aged between 10 and 59 died. It {{is one of the}} biggest industrial disasters in the country's history and it was caused by a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion.</b> It was the first disaster to appear on the front page of the London Illustrated Times.|$|E
50|$|The village {{once had}} several coal mines {{as part of}} the now closed Somerset coalfield. Just north of Coleford there were the collieries of Newbury and Mackintosh. Mackintosh opened in 1867 but closed in 1919, due to flooding. The Natural Stone Products factory is built on the site of Newbury Colliery. This pit started around the {{beginning}} of the 19th century and closed in 1927. The Coal Barton mine was the scene of a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> which killed nine miners in 1869.|$|E
50|$|The club's origins {{date back}} to 1922 when VfR Heessen was formed. VfR competed {{on a number of}} {{occasions}} unsuccessfully for promotion to the Gauliga Westfalen, the highest tier of football in Westphalia after 1933. The club continued play during the Second World War until 1944. VfR profited from the availability of workers from local coal mines to play for the club. A <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> at the Zeche Sachsen mine in 1944 however which claimed 169 lives, including 113 foreign workers, brought play to a halt.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1978 he {{traveled}} to Maputo where he signed an agreement to send more East German mining experts to Mozambique. Since January 1978 East Germans had {{been working in the}} Bituminous coal mine at Moatize, following a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> that had taken the lives of more than 100 Mozambican miners. [...] As head of the East German side in the joint East German/Mozambique Economic Committee, Siebold visited Mozambique two more times in 1978, and was on each occasion received by President Samora Machel.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the surface}} the only {{possible}} rescue was held to be via Mamonster. A heading was driven towards Beaujone with all possible speed, including blasting. The trapped miners heard the rescuers, the rescuers heard the trapped miners. Five days after the accident communication was possible and the rescuers worked in darkness to avoid {{the risk of a}} <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion.</b> By 7pm that evening an opening was made, [...] of tunnel had been dug by hand in five days. All of the 74 miners in Goffin's part survived and were brought to the surface.|$|E
50|$|Another of the museum’s {{displays}} {{is based}} on coal mining. Before the late 19th century coal mining had not fully developed as an industry in Hamilton, but due to the mining boom in 1874 the prominence of coal mining in the area grew: there were 22 collieries in just the Hamilton Parish. The display in the museum looks at this period in South Lanarkshire’s coal mining history and also holds a small exhibit on the Blantyre Mining Disaster of 1877 where 207 miners {{were killed in a}} <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion.</b> This disaster is still Scotland’s most fatal mining disaster to date.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{the safety}} lamps were found, however one {{was found that}} was unlocked. Smoking {{materials}} including matches {{were found in the}} clothes of the deceased, one man was found with a half full pipe in his hand. Several men had unofficial (and therefore illegal) lamp-keys on them. In the immediate vicinity of the seat of the explosion little burning was seen, the supposition was that a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> had raised dust in the passageways and the coal dust had exploded. The official investigation tentatively suggested that shot firing had displaced the gas towards the area where men were smoking and that a naked flame there triggered off the explosion.|$|E
50|$|During {{its first}} hundred years, St George's had four incumbents. Jacob Robson {{came to the}} church as curate in 1825, {{becoming}} vicar in 1842, although Tyldesley was made a parish in 1829. He died in 1851. His successor was George Richards who was vicar from 1851 to 1884, during which time 14 of the 25 victims of the Yew Tree Colliery <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> in 1858 were buried in the churchyard. John Lund was the next incumbent. He oversaw {{the extension of the}} east end of the church in 1886 and the building of the vicarage in 1902. He was vicar for 36 years until 1920 when he was replaced by Samuel Fleming who was vicar until 1948.|$|E
50|$|One {{day there}} is a <b>firedamp</b> <b>explosion</b> in the mine; Mestral helps rescue a dozen trapped miners by {{blasting}} through a rock wall with a phaser. Eventually, a Vulcan vessel signals that it will arrive to retrieve the crew. Before leaving, T'Mir learns a human lesson in compassion, and travels by train to Pittsburgh where she 'sells' the rights to Velcro. The money she receives {{is more than enough}} to ensure the 's son's future education. As the Vulcan ship nears, Mestral announces that he intends to stay on Earth and observe the great advances he knows lie ahead. T'Mir reluctantly agrees, and tells the rescuers that Mestral had died along with the captain. The story ends with Archer and Tucker not sure whether to believe T'Pol's story, but the final scene of the episode is of T'Pol returning to her quarters and retrieving T'Mir's 1950s-era handbag.|$|E
