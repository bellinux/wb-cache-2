500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{says that}} the trust that he, Levine and Lawrence have built in seven years of working {{together}} is essential. He added [...] "I may say, 'Yo, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> song,' but if Ari or Phil say it's the corniest shit they've ever heard, I trust them. And the other way around. We all know when we're onto something...We also know when something's not jelling. And that's the thing you pray you will always have. You can't believe that everything you do is hot." [...] Nevertheless, Levine points to the musical influences {{the three of them}} share completing his idea [...] "It's about finding ways to mix the classic we all love with modern songs. That's why people connect to the music on multiple levels: It's familiar-sounding but new-classic songwriting and instrumentation with a little twist".|$|E
500|$|Grant {{developed}} a reputation as the [...] "most proficient" [...] horseman and set a high-jump record at the academy that stood for 25 years. Seeking relief from military routine, he also studied under Romantic artist Robert Walter Weir and produced nine surviving artworks. He spent more time reading books from the library than his academic texts, frequently reading works by James Fenimore Cooper and others. [...] Initially Grant was indifferent to military life, but within a year he reexamined his desire to leave the academy and later wrote, [...] "on the whole <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> place very much". [...] Quiet by nature, Grant established a few intimate friends among fellow cadets, including Frederick Tracy Dent and James Longstreet. He was inspired both by the Commandant, Captain Charles F. Smith, and by General Winfield Scott, who visited the academy to review the cadets. Grant later wrote of the military life, [...] "there is much to dislike, but more to like." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Lukasz Gottwald (Dr. Luke) {{had just}} {{finished}} producing tracks for Kelly Clarkson's album Breakaway (2004) and was looking to expand further on his writing and producing credits. Luke solicited around to different people {{in the music business}} asking for demos from unknown artists. Two of the demos he received were from Katy Perry and Kesha. He was particularly taken with Kesha's demos which consisted of a self-penned country ballad and trip-hop track. The latter of the demos caught Luke off guard when she ran out of lyrics and started to rap, [...] "I'm a white girl/From the 'Ville/Nashville, bitch. Uhh. Uhhhhh." [...] The improvisation made her stand out from other artists that Luke had listened to, which he recalled: [...] "That's when I was like, 'OK, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> girl's personality. When you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of bravado and chutzpah stand out." [...] Following this, at the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs.|$|E

However, Maeda designed the Angel Beats visual novel and partially wrote its scenario, in addition to providing the original concept for Summer Pockets. Na-Ga, Key's main artist, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but was first given the position of co-art director with former Key artist Itaru Hinoue with Little Busters!.

I was assuming that she would spend only an hour or two in the studio per day and come and see where we were and say, [...] "Ok <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I don't like that. I'll sing this. Bye!" [...] And absolutely not... I mean we co-produced the track and it's not just written on the credits [...] "co-produced by Martin Solveig and Madonna", we literally co-produced the tracks.

Nathan Rabin of The Onions A.V. Club stated that the film [...] "succeeds largely through sheer excess", albeit within a context that [...] "plods along mechanically through its first hour." [...] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave a mildly positive review, saying that [...] "anyone in the market for an overblown and totally mindless adventure-comedy will certainly get his money's worth." [...] Dallas movie reviewer Casey C. Corpier said that the film was almost as enjoyable as the original and liked the fact that it delivered what it advertised.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Haggard and {{his third}} wife Leona Williams {{divorced}} after five stormy years of marriage. The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who {{spent much of the}} next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or [...] "male menopause," [...] around this time. He said in an interview from this period: [...] "Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war with yourself as to what's happening. [...] 'Why don't I like that anymore? [...] Why do <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> now?' And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another.... Your body is getting ready to die and your mind doesn't agree." [...] He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine, but managed to kick the habit. Despite these issues, he won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his 1984 remake of [...] "That's The Way Love Goes." ...|$|E
