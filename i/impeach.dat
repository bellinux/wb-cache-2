5|$|Article IV {{establishes}} {{the basic structure}} and authority of the Virginia legislature. The legislative {{power of the state}} is vested in the Virginia General Assembly, which consists of the Virginia Senate and the Virginia House of Delegates. §17 of Article IV gives the legislature the power to <b>impeach</b> members of the executive and judicial branches.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of a coalition government between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, following the 2008 general election which resulted in a hung parliament where PPP had secured the largest seats in the National Assembly and PML (N), second largest, Dar was inducted into the cabinet of Yousaf Raza Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was re-appointed as the Minister for Finance. However, his tenure was short-lived after PML (N) left the PPP led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to <b>impeach</b> Pervez Musharraf and to restore judiciary.|$|E
50|$|On 1 February 2011, 147 out of 234 Members of Parliament gave {{a vote of}} no {{confidence}} to Behbahani and <b>impeached</b> him for falsely claiming to hold a doctoral degree. He is the second minister to be <b>impeached</b> by the Parliament after Ali Kordan who was <b>impeached</b> in 2008.|$|R

25|$|Blagojevich was {{the sixteenth}} {{governor}} in the United States and the first Illinois governor to be <b>impeached.</b> Seven of the fifteen <b>impeached</b> governors were removed from office.|$|R
5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to <b>impeach</b> Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt {{confident}} that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to <b>impeach</b> Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} <b>impeach</b> malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
50|$|In March 2011, the House of Representatives <b>impeached</b> Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez, {{becoming}} {{the second person}} to be <b>impeached.</b> In April, Gutierrez resigned prior to the Senate's convening as an impeachment court.|$|R
50|$|Two {{presidents have}} been <b>impeached</b> since the {{foundation}} of the Sixth Republic of Korea and adoption of the new Constitution of South Korea in 1987. Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 was <b>impeached</b> by the National Assembly but was overturned by the Constitutional Court. Park Geun-hye in 2016 was <b>impeached</b> by the National Assembly, and the impeachment was confirmed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, 2017.|$|R
50|$|Claiborne {{became the}} 14th federal {{official}} to be <b>impeached</b> by the U.S. House {{and the first}} to be <b>impeached</b> on a unanimous roll-call vote. While his impeachment was historic, the debate and final action on July 22 was anticlimactic. No on really doubted that Claiborne would be <b>impeached</b> or that it would be unanimous. On August 6, 1986 the U.S. House presented articles of impeachment to the U.S. Senate.|$|R
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} <b>impeach</b> Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
5|$|The liberal {{views of}} Wang Yangming were {{opposed by the}} Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of {{orthodox}} Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to <b>impeach</b> members of the other faction from court.|$|E
5|$|The king's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, and Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, {{became known}} as the Lords Appellant when they sought to <b>impeach</b> five of the king's favourites and {{restrain}} what was increasingly seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. Later they were joined by Henry Bolingbroke, the son and heir of John of Gaunt, and Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. Initially, they were successful in establishing a commission to govern England for one year, but they were forced to rebel against Richard, defeating an army under Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, at the skirmish of Radcot Bridge.|$|E
5000|$|A {{referendum}} on <b>impeaching</b> President Traian Băsescu {{was held in}} Romania on 29 July 2012. The referendum was required after Parliament voted in favour of <b>impeaching</b> Băsescu on 6 July, and had to take place within a month. [...] It was the second {{referendum on}} <b>impeaching</b> Băsescu, the first having been held in May 2007, in which 74% of voters chose {{to keep him in}} office. Băsescu was later narrowly re-elected in 2009.|$|R

50|$|Holden was {{the second}} {{governor}} in American history to be <b>impeached,</b> {{and the first to}} be removed from office. He is the only North Carolina governor to have been <b>impeached.</b> In 2011, Holden was posthumously pardoned by the North Carolina Senate.|$|R
5|$|After Sharif's {{return to}} Pakistan from exile in 2007, Abbasi joined him {{and ran for}} {{a seat in the}} National Assembly in the 18 February 2008 general {{election}} as a candidate of the PML (N), and was successfully re-elected for the fifth time with 99,987 votes from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi). The election resulted in a hung parliament where PPP had secured the most seats in the National Assembly and PML (N) the second most. After the formation of a coalition government between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, Abbasi was inducted into the federal cabinet of Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was appointed as the Minister for Commerce. However, he resigned from the ministerial office after PML (N) left the PPP-led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to <b>impeach</b> Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to <b>impeach</b> Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to <b>impeach</b> the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and replace it with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E
50|$|In {{the history}} of the state, only two {{officials}} have been <b>impeached,</b> both judges. In 1790, Justice Woodbury Langdon was <b>impeached</b> for neglecting his duties, but resigned after the trial was delayed. In 2000, Chief Justice David A. Brock was <b>impeached</b> by the House on four counts of maladministration or malpractice, and knowingly lying under oath. Brock was later acquitted by the Senate on a vote of seven to convict and fifteen for acquittal, with two-thirds of the twenty-four members needed for conviction.|$|R
25|$|The Philippine Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez was <b>impeached</b> by the House of Representatives {{on charges}} of the office's alleged {{underperformance}} and failure to act on several cases during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. She became the second official after President Joseph Estrada in 2000 to be <b>impeached.</b>|$|R
50|$|Renato Corona, the 23rd Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, was <b>impeached</b> on December 12, 2011. Corona was {{the third}} official, after former President Joseph Estrada in 2000 and Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez in March 2011, to be <b>impeached</b> by the House of Representatives.|$|R
5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares {{that they had been}} allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to <b>impeach</b> Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E
5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may <b>impeach</b> a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October 1920, the Oklahoma State militia was {{organized}} as the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard and organized with troops from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The division {{was organized}} and federally {{recognized as a}} US Army unit on 3 August 1923 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Prior to World War II, the division was called on many times to maintain order in times of disaster and to keep peace during periods of political unrest. Oklahoma Governor John C. Walton used division troops to prevent the State Legislature from meeting when they were preparing to <b>impeach</b> him in 1923. Governor William H. Murray called out the guard {{several times during the}} depression to close banks, distribute food and once to force the State of Texas to keep open a free bridge over the Red River which Texas intended to collect tolls for, even after federal courts ordered the bridge not be opened.|$|E
50|$|On Sept.18, 1998 Rep. Alcee Hastings, {{who himself}} had been <b>impeached</b> and removed as a federal judge, {{introduced}} H.RES.545 <b>impeaching</b> Kenneth Starr, whose investigation was leading to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Two days later, the House voted to table the bill 340 - 71.|$|R

50|$|The President of Iran can be <b>impeached</b> {{jointly by}} the members of the Assembly (Majlis) and the Supreme Leader. A new presidential {{election}} is then triggered. Abolhassan Banisadr, Iran's first president, was <b>impeached</b> in June 1981 and removed from the office. Mohammad-Ali Rajai was elected as the new president.|$|R
5|$|The Diet {{responsibilities}} {{includes the}} making of laws, {{the approval of the}} annual national budget, the approval of the conclusion of treaties and the selection of the Prime Minister. In addition, it has the power to initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, are to be presented to the people for ratification in a referendum before being promulgated by the Emperor, {{in the name of the}} people. The Constitution also enables both houses to conduct investigations in relation to government, demand the presence and testimony of witnesses, and the production of records, as well as allowing either house of the Diet to demand the presence of the Prime Minister or the other Minister of State, in order to give answers or explanations whenever so required. The Diet is also able to <b>impeach</b> Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.|$|E
5|$|The English Parliament distrusted Charles's motivations when {{he called}} for funds {{to put down the}} Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons {{suspected}} that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. Pym's Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into anarchy, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to <b>impeach</b> his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action.|$|E
5|$|The Long Parliament proved just as {{difficult}} for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to <b>impeach</b> the king's leading counsellors of high treason. Strafford {{was taken into}} custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to the Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, {{judges and}} state {{attorneys}} may be <b>impeached,</b> {{by a simple}} majority vote of a quorum of the General Assembly, for crimes or misconduct committed solely in their official capacity. Then, the lower house appoints three members to prosecute the <b>impeached</b> and the senate, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court, convenes to try the <b>impeached.</b> Conviction requires only a two-thirds supermajority {{of the number of}} senators [...] "sworn to try the impeachment," [...] which may be less than a [...] "constitutional" [...] supermajority (Article V).|$|R
