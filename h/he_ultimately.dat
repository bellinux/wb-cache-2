5|$|During the campaign, Biden {{focused on}} his plan to achieve {{political}} success in the Iraq War through a system of federalization. He touted his record in the Senate {{as the head of}} several congressional committees and experience in foreign policy. Despite a few notable endorsements, Biden failed to garner significant support in opinion polls, and was marred by controversial comments made while campaigning. <b>He</b> <b>ultimately</b> dropped out of the race on January 3, 2008, after capturing less than 1% of the vote in the Iowa caucus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Second World War, Savige {{commanded}} the 17th Infantry Brigade in the North African Campaign, the Battle of Greece and Syria–Lebanon Campaign.

5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead {{a greater emphasis on}} Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> repudiated his beliefs.|$|E

5|$|After {{qualifying}} {{fifth in}} Bahrain, Webber {{had been as}} high as third place in the race but <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> finished sixth, taking his points tally to 7 for the season. He followed this up by qualifying fourth and finishing a disappointing 10th after twice running wide off the track in the , although his position was revised to 7th after the disqualification of the BAR team and a resulting penalty to Ralf Schumacher.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is growing}} {{increasingly}} jealous of Gabe's relationship with Erin. While observing Gabe's room, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{tells him that}} a Chinese virility supplement that Gabe keeps in his room is incredibly potent. Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out if she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> retreats to Gabe's room and vomits on the bed.|$|E
5|$|At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly {{resisted}} {{the advance of}} General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, they and the other colonial forces {{were lost in the}} smoke and retreated.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{controversially}} {{excluded from}} Italy's 2002 World Cup squad by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who believed him {{to not have}} fully recovered from the serious injury he had sustained during the season. Although he was initially keen to include Baggio in the final 23-man list, <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> excluded him from the squad; Baggio had made a direct appeal to him prior to the tournament by writing him a letter. Fans and pundits criticised the omission, as Italy were eliminated by co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, <b>he</b> <b>ultimately</b> lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E
