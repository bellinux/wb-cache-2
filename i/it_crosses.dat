5|$|Shortly thereafter, <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> and {{interchanges}} with Dixon Road and Airport Road, between {{which it}} forms the demarcation line. Several ramps diverge {{at this point}} to provide access to Pearson Airport, and the freeway narrows to eight lanes.|$|E
5|$|The road {{passes over}} the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-476) and PA563 turns east and {{heads into the}} {{community}} of Tylersport, where <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> Allentown Road. After leaving Tylersport, the route heads northeast into more rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} nerves {{supplying}} the larynx, {{the right and}} left RLNs lack bilateral symmetry. The left RLN is longer than the right, because <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> under the arch of the aorta at the ligamentum arteriosum.|$|E
50|$|Running north-south between Gartsherrie and Whifflet, and to {{the west}} of the M&KR line, the new route opened in July 1845. <b>It</b> <b>crossed</b> the Monkland Canal and Bank Street in Coatbridge by a bridge, and <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> the M&KR Rosehall branch on the level. There was a new Coatbridge station, which much later became Coatbridge Central.|$|R

Station, <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> an access {{road in the}} Adventureland section, travels over a small bridge, enters a small tunnel, then crosses a second access road in the Frontierland section. After going through a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, the train stops at Frontierland Station.|$|E
5|$|As M-85 {{approaches}} downtown, <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> {{over the}} Canadian Pacific-owned Michigan Central Railway Tunnel. Several blocks later, the highway passes over M-10 (Lodge Freeway) without an interchange near Joe Louis Arena. Fort Street continues carrying the M-85 designation as far east as the intersection with Griswold Street, one block west of Campus Martius Park.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> Eglinton, the {{expressway}} {{passes a}} business park {{to the west}} and the Concorde Place commercial and condominium development to the east. The expressway begins to descend back into the East Don Valley. It passes beneath Wynford Drive and two railways (the CPR Midtown line and the CNR/Richmond Hill GO line) before reaching Lawrence Avenue East, {{one of the few remaining}} cloverleaf interchanges in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the {{converter}} station {{next to the}} Radisson substation, the HVDC line heads south and roughly parallels the six 735kV power lines some distance to the west. It traverses {{the same type of}} terrain as the other six lines; the land is replete with lakes, wetlands, and forested rolling hills. Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> under several 735kV power lines.|$|E
5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|From Rosendale, NY32 {{climbs up}} out of the Rondout valley and veers east into the hamlet of Maple Hill, where <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> over the Thruway once again. It resumes a northerly course through Bloomington, and several miles further on crosses the Kingston city line. This entire segment of NY32 is also {{concurrent}} with New York State Bicycle Route32.|$|E
50|$|As proposed, I-78 {{would have}} four other {{interchanges}} as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> Manhattan (New York County).|$|R
50|$|The park {{is popular}} with hikers. The Wapack Trail runs through <b>it,</b> <b>crossing</b> Pack Monadnock.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>crossed</b> the Main South Line at Goodwood by a flat crossing, not an overpass.|$|R
5|$|Harveys Creek {{begins in}} Harveys Lake in the {{community}} of Harveys Lake. The creek flows southwest and soon enters Lake Township. A short distance downstream, it picks up the tributary Bear Hollow Creek and turns south for several miles. The creek receives the tributary Paint Spring Run during this stretch. It eventually enters Lehman Township and turns southeast, crossing Pennsylvania Route 118. Slightly more than a mile (two kilometers) downstream, the creek turns south again. It eventually enters Jackson Township, where <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> Pennsylvania Route 29 and picks up the tributary Pikes Creek. It then turns southeast and enters a valley, where it flows roughly parallel to Pennsylvania Route 29 for a number of miles. The creek enters Plymouth Township and soon afterwards turns abruptly southwest. Several miles downstream it enters the community of West Nanticoke. Here, <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> U.S. Route 11 and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{begins at}} Exit 116 from I-70 in Glenwood Springs, just 300ft (100 m) {{east of the}} Roaring Fork's {{confluence}} with the Colorado River. It follows Laurel Street north for one block, then turns east on Sixth Street for another block, after which it turns south on Grand Avenue. From there <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> both I-70 and the Colorado River on a viaduct past the train station into downtown Glenwood Springs.|$|E
5|$|Highway33, {{known as}} the Loyalist Parkway {{throughout}} its length, begins in the west at the southern terminus of Highway62, west of which the parkway continues as Prince Edward County Road33 to Trenton. The route begins within the community of Bloomfield. To the east <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> several creeks then intersects Prince Edward County Road1 at the first modern provincially maintained roundabout. East of this, the highway enters into the city of Picton.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> then <b>crossed</b> Metropolitan Avenue, Grand Street, and {{a portion}} of Newtown Creek, the South Side Railroad's Bushwick branch.

5|$|I-96 {{passes through}} {{an area with}} several lakes as <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> into Oakland County. This area {{includes}} the Island Lake State Recreation Area {{to the south and}} the Kensington Metropark {{to the north of the}} freeway in an area where <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> the Huron River. The Interstate runs through Wixom into Novi, where it passes to the south of the Twelve Oaks Mall. Southeast of the mall, I-96 enters a complex interchange on the border between Novi and Farmington Hills that connects it to M-5 (Haggerty Connector), I-275 and I-696 (Reuther Freeway). The trunkline drops a lane in each direction as it enters the interchange and turns southward. The freeway then merges into I-275 and increases to four lanes in each direction running south in Farmington Hills.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>crosses</b> the Rideau River {{and enters}} the City of Ottawa. Aside from {{the first couple of}} {{kilometres}} north of the Rideau River, the majority of the freeway cuts through swaths of farmland which fill the Ottawa Valley. The median also becomes narrower. The freeway encounters an interchange with Dilworth Road and thereafter with Roger Stevens Drive, the latter providing access to North Gower.|$|E
5|$|M-13 {{angles to}} the {{northwest}} briefly before returning to a due north course along East Road. The highway crosses the Flint River in another area of farm fields. As the road approaches Saginaw, <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> the Cass River and runs {{to the east of}} it as it merges with the Shiawassee River and the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River. M-13 follows Washington Avenue in the city of Saginaw inland from, but parallel to, the Saginaw River through downtown. The trunkline intersects M-46, which follows Rust Avenue, and passes Hoyt Park. Washington Avenue runs by the campus of St. Mary's of Michigan Medical Center. As the highway passes out of downtown, <b>it</b> <b>crosses</b> or runs alongside lines of the Saginaw Bay Southern and Lake State railways.|$|E
