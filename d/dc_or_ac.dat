2500|$|The {{table below shows}} various data {{including}} both {{the resistance of the}} various wire gauges and the allowable current (ampacity) based on a copper conductor with plastic insulation. The diameter information in the table applies to solid wires. Stranded wires are calculated by calculating the equivalent cross sectional copper area. Fusing current (melting wire) is estimated based on 25°C ambient temperature. The table below assumes <b>DC,</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> frequencies equal to or less than 60Hz, and does not take skin effect into account.

2500|$|In general a {{wireless}} power system {{consists of a}} [...] "transmitter" [...] connected to a source of power such as a mains power line, which converts the power to a time-varying electromagnetic field, and one or more [...] "receiver" [...] devices which receive the power and convert it back to <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> electric current which is used by an electrical load. [...] At the transmitter the input power is converted to an oscillating electromagnetic field by some type of [...] "antenna" [...] device. [...] The word [...] "antenna" [...] is used loosely here; {{it may be a}} coil of wire which generates a magnetic field, a metal plate which generates an electric field, an antenna which radiates radio waves, or a laser which generates light. [...] A similar antenna or coupling device at the receiver converts the oscillating fields to an electric current. [...] An important parameter that determines the type of waves is the frequency, which determines the wavelength.|$|E

50|$|The Mosquito was {{released}} to the mainstream market in 2005, through Stapleton's company Compound Security Solutions.

30|$|Since {{the output}} of {{renewable}} energy sources and micro sources are mainly <b>dc</b> <b>or</b> non-utility-grade <b>ac,</b> power electronic converters are critical to interface the energy source to the grid in these DG systems. In the DG interfacing power electronic converters, the requirements related to the energy source characteristics, the energy storage system, the distribution system configuration, voltage levels, power quality, etc. need to be considered.|$|R

They can use either direct (<b>DC)</b> <b>or</b> alternating (<b>AC)</b> current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|R
50|$|The 481 series trains were {{introduced}} in 1964 for use on Hokuriku Line limited services, and were capable of operating under 1,500 V <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> 20 kV <b>AC</b> (60 Hz) overhead wire power supplies. These train were subsequently operated by JR-West and JR Kyushu.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In recent years, hybrid {{microgrid}} comprises of dc and ac subgrids interconnected by {{power electronic}} interfaces unlike in existing microgrids which are purely <b>ac</b> <b>or</b> <b>dc.</b> The main {{objective is to}} manage the power flow among all sources distributed throughout {{the different types of}} subgrids. The hybrid grid reduces the process of multiple dc-ac-dc or ac-dc-ac conversions in an individual grid and reduces the number of converter stations for converting <b>ac</b> to <b>dc</b> <b>or</b> <b>dc</b> to <b>ac</b> power. This hybrid can operate in both grid connected and standalone mode. The proposed grid can operate in both standalone and grid connected mode. Proportional integral controller is used for smooth power transfer...|$|R
5000|$|Without any loss of generality, {{we shall}} {{consider}} {{the study of}} the effective conductivity (which can be either <b>dc</b> <b>or</b> <b>ac)</b> for a system made up of spherical multicomponent inclusions with different arbitrary conductivities.

5000|$|In both AC and DC fields, the {{reluctance}} is {{the ratio of}} the [...] "magnetomotive force" [...] (MMF) in a magnetic circuit to the magnetic flux in this circuit. In a pulsating <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> field, {{the reluctance}} also pulsates (see phasors).|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC.</b> The similar Sony flash sync terminal and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> only.|$|E
50|$|The 483 series trains were {{introduced}} in 1965 for use on Tohoku Main Line limited express services, and were capable of operating under 1,500 V <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> 20 kV <b>AC</b> (50 Hz) overhead wire power supplies. The non-powered trailer cars used in these sets were classified 481 series.|$|R
50|$|The ISO 10330 {{specification}} {{allows for}} a trigger voltage of 24 volts. Some manufacturers, particularly Canon, ask {{for no more than}} 6 volts. Some older flashes may have significantly high voltages, sometimes in the several hundreds of volts. Some of them may also use negative DC polarity, and some studio flashes may even provide AC voltages. Whilst no problem for electromechanical trigger contacts in older cameras, not all electronically controlled trigger circuits in newer cameras are designed to work with inverse <b>DC</b> polarity <b>or</b> <b>AC.</b>|$|R
50|$|A third {{strategy}} is to use small capacitors to couple a modulated high-frequency carrier; the capacitors can stand off large <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> power frequency <b>AC</b> voltages but provide coupling for the much higher frequency carrier signal. Some models on this principle can stand off 3.5 kilovolts and provide up to 70 kHz bandwidth.|$|R
5000|$|Power source - may {{consist of}} an {{internal}} combustion engine that can be powered by LP gas, CNG, gasoline or diesel fuel. Electric forklifts are powered by either a battery or fuel cells that provides power to the electric motors. The electric motors used on a forklift may be either <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> types.|$|E
50|$|CNT {{solutions}} {{can form}} VANTAs through alignment along <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> electric field lines. The CNTs are polarized in the suspension by the electric field because of dielectric mismatch between CNTs and the liquid. The polarization moment rotates the CNTs toward {{the direction of}} electric field lines, therefore aligning them in a common direction. After being aligned, the CNTs are taken out with the substrates and dried to form functional VANTAs.|$|E
50|$|An AC motor is an {{electric}} motor driven by an alternating current (AC). The AC motor commonly consists of two basic parts, an outside stator having coils supplied with alternating current to produce a rotating magnetic field, and an inside rotor attached to the output shaft producing a second rotating magnetic field. The rotor magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets, reluctance saliency, or <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> <b>AC</b> electrical windings.|$|E
50|$|A {{large signal}} is a <b>DC</b> signal (<b>or</b> an <b>AC</b> signal {{at a point}} in time) that is one or more orders of {{magnitude}} larger than the small signal and is used to analyse a circuit containing non-linear components and calculate an operating point (bias) of these components.|$|R

25|$|The {{quadrupole}} {{ion trap}} {{works on the}} same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to <b>DC</b> <b>or</b> auxiliary <b>AC</b> potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, {{in which case the}} ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.|$|R
