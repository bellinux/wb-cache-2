25|$|In 1902, Sharrer's landholdings in Cholo {{district}} {{were sold}} to the British Central Africa Company Ltd. For the first two decades of the 20th century, the area remained undeveloped and relatively under-populated. Small amounts of cotton, sisal and tobacco were grown but the tobacco was hit by disease, the value of sisal was low and the cool weather was unsuitable for cotton. With {{the construction of the}} Shire Highlands Railway from Port Herald to Blantyre, which opened in 1908, the estates began to grow <b>Flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and The British Central Africa Company Ltd was able to interest the Imperial Tobacco Company in Nyasaland tobacco. The company imported good quality seed and brought in experts, at first aiming to produce cigar leaf, but later concentrating on flue-cured leaf for cigarettes. By 1907, the British Central Africa Company had 14 barns for flue-curing tobacco, {{out of a total of}} 119 such barns in the protectorate. At the end of the First World War, the company started a scheme for settling ex-servicemen on its undeveloped land as tobacco growers. About 50 men took up farms, usually of 1,000 acres. Many failed in the period from 1920 to 1924, as none had a farming background or any farming training. Some survived until a drastic fall in prices for <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> after 1927, but then took up whatever employment they could find. After 1927, the production of dark-fired tobacco by African farmers, either estate tenants or on Crown lands, overtook that of <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and the British Central Africa Company, which already had a scheme for its tenants to grow tobacco under supervision, became mostly a broker for the tobacco those tenants produced.|$|E

50|$|Burley {{contains}} little sugar, and {{has generally}} been cased (sweetened) with humectants, sugars, or other flavors for uses such as in American blend cigarettes. As a result, a broad ban enacted by Canada and proposed in many other countries would block the import of nearly all tobacco products containing burley. The situation resembles a dispute between Asian producers and the United States, which banned clove cigarettes. For each nation, banning components typical of tobacco manufactured abroad provides a powerful trade advantage, but may be prohibited by GATT trade agreements. The effect on American producers is limited, but not negligible, as most Canadian imports were already of <b>flue-cured</b> Virginia <b>tobacco.</b>|$|R

Although the First World War boosted production of estate grown, flue-cured Virginia tobacco, post-war competition from the United States Virginia made the low-grade tobacco produced by many European growers in Nyasaland unsalable and by 1925 {{the high cost of}} flue-curing and overproduction led to reduced sale prices making <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|As {{the demand}} for direct labour on tobacco estates {{declined}} with collapse {{in the market for}} <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco,</b> the estate owners claimed that they had insufficient work for their labour tenants to meet their obligations under the thangata system and that they had become rent-free squatters who should be liable to be evicted. The owners also complained of the significant numbers resident on their estate who paid no rent under non-disturbance clauses. To meet some of the estate owners’ demands but also give some protection to tenants the protectorate government introduced the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928, which abolishing all rights under non-disturbance clauses, but gave tenants tenancies with a five-year term and with maximum rents fixed by District Rent Boards. Rents could be satisfied in cash, by labour or by selling economic crops to the owner. Blantyre and East Africa Ltd accepted tobacco in lieu of cash rents on some estates but others had become crowded and during the 1930s it obtained cash rents from subsistence farmers on these instead. The company ceased direct operations on its estates in Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, and in 1929 there were no Europeans resident on its estates in those districts, only an agent living in Zomba who visited them periodically.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the First World War, Major Sanderson became W J Livingstone’s {{eventual}} successor {{as manager}} and pioneered growing <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> at Magomero. In 1914, Magomero had 5,000 acres under cotton, but by 1918 it was becoming less profitable, because African growers on Native Trust Land could produce cotton more cheaply. Even after Livingstone’s killing, the thangata obligation on the A L Bruce Estates was little modified, sometimes amounting to six months work a year. However, as the Crown land nearest to the estates was already crowded, and as most estate tenants had no claim to settle there, they had little option but to stay. The A L Bruce Estates Ltd accounts first showed a deficit in 1920, and Sanderson attempted to stop further settlement, claiming there was insufficient work for tenants to meet their labour obligations or to pay rent. In part, this was because only 15,000 acres of Magomero’s of 162,000 acres were farmed directly by the owner or sharecroppers in 1920. Sanderson argued that such tenants become rent-free squatters, and wanted to use the threat of eviction to compel them to grow saleable economic crops. However, it was more profitable for African farmers to grow dark-fired tobacco on Crown land, and from 1925 A L Bruce Estates was permanently in deficit.|$|E
30|$|Selection of optimal primer pairs in 16 S rRNA gene {{sequencing}} is a pivotal issue in microorganism diversity analysis. However, limited {{effort has been}} put into investigation of specific primer sets for analysis of the bacterial diversity of aging <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobaccos</b> (AFTs), as well as prediction of {{the function of the}} bacterial community. In this study, the performance of four primer pairs in determining bacterial community structure based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences in AFTs was assessed, and the functions of genes were predicted using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). Results revealed that the primer set 799 F– 1193 R covering the amplification region V 5 V 6 V 7 gave a more accurate picture of the bacterial community structure of AFTs, with lower co-amplification levels of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and more genera covered than when using the other primers. In addition, functional gene prediction suggested that the microbiome of AFTs was involved in kinds of interested pathways. A high abundance of functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism was detected in AFTs, reflecting a high level of bacteria involved in degrading harmful nitrogen compounds and generating nitrogenous nutrients for others. Additionally, the functional genes involved in biosynthesis of valuable metabolites and degradation of toxic compounds provided information that the AFTs possess a huge library of microorganisms and genes that could be applied to further studies. All of these findings provide a significance reference for researchers working on the bacterial diversity assessment of tobacco-related samples.|$|R

25|$|Although tea {{had been}} {{exported}} since 1904, the real {{growth of the}} tea industry in Cholo and Mlanje districts occurred after 1922 and was promoted by the collapse the <b>Flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> market. The estate companies including Blantyre and East Africa Ltd owned land {{that they needed to}} put into productive use, and chose tea planting. Even by the very poor standards of southern Africa, Nyasaland's tea wages in the 1920s and 1930s were low. The tea growers argued that the quality of the tea produced and the productivity of the workers were both also low. On the three Blantyre and East Africa estates in Mlanje (Lauderdale, Glenorchy and Limbuli), workers were paid a basic wage of 6 shillings, or 30 pence in 1941 and a bonus for large amounts picked. These very low wages caused incidents on the Limbuli Estate in 1942, where the manager was censured for his behaviour towards tenants. Very few women worked at picking tea until the early 1970s but in 1973 at Glenorchy women picked approximately 2/5 of the crop. There were major slumps the world tea industry in 1919-20 and 1928-32 as more efficient planting and expansion in the areas planted created a “tea mountain”. In 1933 an International Tea Agreement scheme introduced export quotas and virtually prohibited new areas of tea planting and the selling or leasing of further land for tea growing. The Blantyre and East Africa estates were allowed to grow 2,964 acres of tea in 1939 and 3,810 acres in 1945, about 17% of total area if tea planted in Cholo and Mlanje districts in 1935, reducing to 13% in 1945.

25|$|Following this {{check to}} {{its attempt to}} create a {{workforce}} that would enable it to exploit its estates directly, Blantyre and East Africa Ltd explored alternative methods of utilising its land. The company did continue to grow tea and some tobacco using the direct labour of tenants under the thangata system or by wage labour. The tobacco produced by direct labour was <b>Flue-cured</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which was cured in brick barns by hot air conducted through metal flues, without smoke coming into contact with the leaf. Its final colour was yellowish brown and it was normally used for cigarettes or as pipe tobacco. This became a significant export for the company from 1907. Although in 1901 it had owned 157,000 acres, the company’s first alternative strategy was to sell or lease some of its land, particularly after the First World War to small planters, which reduced this to 119,500 acres by 1925. Most of the sales and leases were in Blantyre District, the most developed part of the protectorate. Secondly, on its smaller remaining estates in the Shire Highlands and beyond, it ceased to provide supervision but sought to obtain cash rents from African tenants, as it had no need for their labour. Finally, on its largest remaining estate in Zomba District, Blantyre and East Africa Ltd pioneered African tobacco production from 1901. This was of fire-cured tobacco, also known also as dark-fired tobacco, which is cured over open fires, so the leaf absorbs various flavours from the smoke, and substantial acreages were set aside for tobacco growing by African tenants. At first, success was limited, but from 1916, the company increased African production by allocating land, supplying seed, giving instruction and providing suitable storage barns for its tenants. The tobacco they produced is described as of good saleable quality.|$|E

5000|$|More unprotonated {{nicotine}} {{in tobacco}} smoke increases smoke [...] "strength", [...] "impact", or [...] "kick". However, the irritation and harshness of smoke at higher pH {{makes it harder}} for smokers to inhale it. Cigarette design ensures that the smoke has enough unprotonated nicotine to rapidly transfer nicotine into the brain but not so much of it as to be too harsh for the smoker. Variability in the acid-base nature of tobacco leaf is considerable. <b>Flue-cured</b> ("bright") <b>tobacco</b> typically produces acidic smoke, whereas air-cured ("burley") tobacco typically produces basic smoke. The natural acids in tobacco smoke (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid) can protonate nicotine, while the natural bases (e.g., ammonia) tend to neutralize the acids and keep more nicotine in the unprotonated form. Acidic tobacco additives such as levulinic acid are used as [...] "smoothing" [...] agents to reduce smoke harshness.|$|R
40|$|Summary. -The topical {{carcinogenicity}} to mouse skin {{of smoke}} condensates ob-tained from a tobacco substitute (NSM), {{alone or in}} combination with tobacco, has been compared with condensate from tobacco and with acetone, the solvent used. Sixteen different types of cigarette were {{used to make the}} condensates, and the age-standardized results have been analysed according to the Weibull distribution model. The results show that NSM condensate has less than 25 % of the potency of tobacco condensate (37 0 at 95 0 upper confidence limit), and that condensates from blends of NSM and tobacco are similarly reduced in activity. General pathology analysis failed to reveal abnormalities due to NSM. THE chemical complexity of cigarette smoke precludes the precise attribution of the known carcinogenic effects to a single component or group of components, and animal models are therefore required to assay carcinogenic activity. A model commonly used is the topical application of smoke condensates to mouse skin, and measurement of the incidence of tumours which result. The method has been much used to monitor attempts at reduction of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, and although there is as yet no evidence equating mouse skin response with the human lung response, it is assumed that a direct relationship exists between the ability to induce tumours in mouse skin and in the human bronchial tract. The experiments described were de-signed to determine the carcinogenic potential of smoke condensate from a substitute smoking material and from blends of this material with conventional tobacco.

30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the primers V 3 F and V 4 R, covering the V 3 V 4 amplification region, should be the preferred primer set for future studies to achieve accurate bacterial community diversities, and a large number of studies have focused on this region (Castelino et al. 2017; Cai et al. 2013; Parulekar et al. 2017; Takahashi et al. 2014). Analogously, for plant samples, not including subterranean plant parts but only above-ground parts such as shoot-tip, leaves, etc., the V 3 V 4 regions has been used predominantly for identifying 16 S rRNA gene sequences (Thomas and Sekhar 2017; Tyx et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018). Nevertheless, due to the homology between bacterial 16 S rRNA genes and plant chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA, plant DNA may be coextracted during bacterial DNA extraction from various plant samples, which can cause contaminating sequences (Dyall et al. 2004; Raven 1970). Usually, a high abundance of Cyanobacteria at the phylum level, unidentified at the genus level, present in raw sequencing results indicates the occurrence of contaminating sequences from an organellar origin such mitochondrial and/or chloroplast DNA (Beckers et al. 2016). To exclude the interference of contaminating sequences, a common method is to filter out the chloroplast DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and other unknown sequences during data processing. However, this might not reveal the real microbiome structures of samples. To date, although several studies have focused on characterization of bacterial communities in different tobaccos using 16 S rRNA gene sequences with the V 3 V 4 and V 5 V 6 V 7 primers (Huang et al. 2010; Tyx et al. 2016), few report have showed optimized primers for bacterial microbiome investigation of tobaccos, while there are as many as 10, 000 chloroplast DNA copies in tobacco leaf cells (Shaver et al. 2006). Microorganisms from aging <b>flue-cured</b> <b>tobaccos</b> (AFTs) would be useful in producing valuable products, treating wastewater, and creating biofuels and a wide range of chemicals and enzymes. There is, therefore, an urgent need to investigate the perfect primers for tobacco bacterial microbiome research.|$|R

Before 1920, only about 5% of the crop marketed was dark-fired tobacco produced by African farmers, but this rose to about 1 million pounds or 14% by 1923.
