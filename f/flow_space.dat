50|$|One type of BAL {{is similar}} to kidney {{dialysis}} systems that employ a hollow fiber cartridge. Hepatocytes are suspended in a gel solution, such as collagen, which is injected {{into a series of}} hollow fibers. In the case of collagen, the suspension is then gelled within the fibers, usually by a temperature change. The hepatocytes then contract the gel by their attachment to the collagen matrix, reducing the volume of the suspension and creating a <b>flow</b> <b>space</b> within the fibers. Nutrient media is circulated through the fibers to sustain the cells. During use, plasma is removed from the patients blood. The patient's plasma is fed into the space surrounding the fibers. The fibers, which are composed of a semi-permeable membrane, facilitate transfer of toxins, nutrients and other chemicals between the blood and the suspended cells. The membrane also keeps immune bodies, such as immunoglobulins, from passing to the cells to prevent an immune system rejection.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} {{is to develop a}} probability distribution for <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing.</b> A <b>flowing</b> interval is defined as a fractured zone that transmits flow in the Saturated Zone (SZ), as identified through borehole flow meter surveys (Figure 1). This analysis uses the term ''flowing interval spacing'' as opposed to fractured spacing, which is typically used in the literature. The term fracture spacing was not used in this analysis because the data used identify a zone (or a flowing interval) that contains fluid-conducting fractures but does not distinguish how many or which fractures comprise the flowing interval. The <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> is measured between the midpoints of each <b>flowing</b> interval. Fracture <b>spacing</b> within the SZ is defined as the spacing between fractures, with no regard to which fractures are carrying flow. The Development Plan associated with this analysis is entitled, ''Probability Distribution for Flowing Interval Spacing'', (CRWMS M&O 2000 a). The parameter from this analysis may be used in the TSPA SR/LA Saturated Zone Flow and Transport Work Direction and Planning Documents: (1) ''Abstraction of Matrix Diffusion for SZ Flow and Transport Analyses'' (CRWMS M&O 1999 a) and (2) ''Incorporation of Heterogeneity in SZ Flow and Transport Analyses'', (CRWMS M&O 1999 b). A limitation of this analysis is that the probability distribution of <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> may underestimate the effect of incorporating matrix diffusion processes in the SZ transport model because of the possible overestimation of the <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing.</b> Larger <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> results in a decrease in the matrix diffusion processes. This analysis may overestimate the <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> because the number of fractures that contribute to a flowing interval cannot be determined from the data. Because each flowing interval probably has more than one fracture contributing to a flowing interval, the true <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> could be less than the spacing determined in this analysis. Therefore, in terms of repository performance the results of this analysis may underestimate the effect of matrix diffusion processes in SZ transport models. In summary, performance analysis will be conservative if the <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> determined by this study is used in the simulation of mass transport in the saturated zone instead of the fracture spacing...|$|R

40|$|Fracture spacing {{is a key}} hydrologic {{parameter}} in {{analyses of}} matrix diffusion. Although the individual fractures that transmit flow in the saturated zone (SZ) cannot be identified directly, {{it is possible to}} determine the fractured zones that transmit flow from flow meter survey observations. The fractured zones that transmit flow as identified through borehole flow meter surveys have been defined in this report as flowing intervals. The <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> is measured between the midpoints of each flowing interval. The determination of <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> is important because the <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> parameter is a key hydrologic parameter in SZ transport modeling, which impacts the extent of matrix diffusion in the SZ volcanic matrix. The output of this report is input to the ''Saturated Zone Flow and Transport Model Abstraction'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 170042]). Specifically, the analysis of data and development of a data distribution reported herein is used to develop the uncertainty distribution for the <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> parameter for the SZ transport abstraction model. Figure 1 - 1 shows the relationship of this report to other model reports that also pertain to flow and transport in the SZ. Figure 1 - 1 also shows the flow of key information among the SZ reports. It should be noted that Figure 1 - 1 does not contain a complete representation of the data and parameter inputs and outputs of all SZ reports, nor does it show inputs external to this suite of SZ reports. Use of the developed <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> probability distribution is subject to the limitations of the assumptions discussed in Sections 5 and 6 of this analysis report. The number of fractures in a flowing interval is not known. Therefore, the flowing intervals are assumed to be composed of one flowing zone in the transport simulations. This analysis may overestimate the <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> because the number of fractures that contribute to a flowing interval cannot be determined from the data. In terms of repository performance, the results of this analysis may underestimate the effect of matrix diffusion processes in SZ transport models. Underestimation of matrix diffusion in the transport modeling would result in more rapid simulated migration of radionuclide mass to the accessible environment and correspondingly higher simulated dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual in the Total System Performance Assessment-License Application (TSPA-LA) analyses. The <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> is appropriate for use in the SZ site-scale transport abstraction model because the 500 m grid block size in the numerical transport model is more than an order of magnitude larger than the expected <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> (BSC 2004 [DIRS 170042], Section 6. 3. 1). Therefore, the use of the developed <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> parameter is limited to a numerical grid spacing that is at least an order of magnitude greater than the average <b>flowing</b> interval <b>spacing</b> to ensure a reasonable description of transport behavior in a grid. This analysis report supports several features, events, and processes (FEPs) and contributes to the characterization of the SZ as a natural barrier, which provides evidence related to the capability of the SZ to delay movement of radionuclides through the SZ to the accessible environment...|$|R

This demonstrates that for any system with prescribed damping, the power flow of the system is determined if the velocity is derived analytically, numerically or experimentally without requiring force information. Two distinct examples are provided to demonstrate applicability and generality of the theory. This power flow mathematical model allows development of guidelines for the design of dynamic systems based on knowledge of the damping distribution in the system...|$|E
