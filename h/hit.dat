5|$|After {{the game}} resumed, Labine scored on {{back-to-back}} singles by Reese and Snider. The Giants then {{came up to}} bat, failing to earn a <b>hit</b> as the score became 6–0 after six innings. To start the seventh inning, Al Corwin replaced Bill Rigney for the Giants, who had pinch <b>hit</b> for Spencer. Andy Pafko <b>hit</b> a home run to start the inning, and Hodges walked; he later scored on the fifth and final error made by the Giants to make the score 8–0. The bottom of the seventh and the eighth inning passed without a <b>hit.</b> In the ninth inning, Walker <b>hit</b> a home run, the fourth of the game, to make the score 10–0. The Giants failed to get a <b>hit</b> {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, ending the game. Labine pitched a six-hit shutout, not allowing a <b>hit</b> in the final four innings as the series went to a deciding third game.|$|E
5|$|No {{player has}} ever <b>hit</b> a cycle {{in both the}} Central and Pacific Leagues; however, after Alex Ochoa <b>hit</b> his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, he became the only player to <b>hit</b> a cycle in both MLB and NPB. Ochoa <b>hit</b> his first and only cycle in the MLB eight years prior on July 3, 1996, while playing for the New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to <b>hit</b> for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, hitting one in game2 of the 1992 series. Furuta's cycle is not {{considered}} an official NPB cycle as it occurred during an exhibition game. Inaba is the only player to <b>hit</b> for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple {{in the first inning}} and hitting a home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have <b>hit</b> a grand slam as the home run of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2010, Ramirez {{recorded}} his 2,500th career base <b>hit</b> with an infield single against the Florida Marlins. On April 18 against the San Francisco Giants, Ramirez <b>hit</b> his 548th career home run to tie Mike Schmidt for the 14th {{place on the}} all-time home run list. He <b>hit</b> his 549th to pass Schmidt on May 28 against the Colorado Rockies. On June 19, he <b>hit</b> a home run in his second game back at Fenway Park.|$|E

50|$|From December 1995, BMG and Warner Music partnered for a {{new series}} of <b>Hits</b> albums, and <b>Hits</b> 96 was the first release of the relaunched brand. This was a very {{successful}} relaunch, and once again the <b>Hits</b> series started to rival the success of the contemporaneous Now releases of the time. Unlike the earlier <b>Hits</b> albums, there were up to five compilations a year, and instead of a volume number, the titles of this series had varied titles: <b>Hits,</b> New <b>Hits,</b> Fresh <b>Hits,</b> Big <b>Hits</b> and Huge <b>Hits</b> - this title is then always followed by the year of release; for example, Fresh <b>Hits</b> 1997.|$|R
5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career <b>hit,</b> {{a home run}} off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th <b>hit</b> (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to <b>hit</b> a home run for his 3,000th <b>hit,</b> Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning <b>hit.</b> He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 <b>hit</b> club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th <b>hit.</b> MLB and HBO produced Derek Jeter 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.|$|E
5|$|When Ochoa <b>hit</b> his cycle {{with the}} Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, {{he became the}} only player to <b>hit</b> a cycle in both Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball. Eight years earlier, Ochoa had {{accomplished}} the same feat on July 3, 1996, while playing for MLB's New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to <b>hit</b> for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, doing so in game 2 of the 1992 series. Inaba is the only player to <b>hit</b> for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple {{in the first inning}} and hitting a home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have <b>hit</b> a grand slam as the home run of the cycle. Hiroshi Ohshita and Kazuhiko Kondo are the only two players to have <b>hit</b> a walk-off home run to win the game as the final <b>hit</b> of their cycles.|$|E

5000|$|These were 'year-end' collections, {{combining}} the biggest <b>hits</b> of previous volumes. There {{was not an}} edition of Huge <b>Hits</b> 2001 or Huge <b>Hits</b> 2002, although Huge <b>Hits</b> 2000 was released in 2000 and Huge <b>Hits</b> 2003 was released in 2002, making 2001 the only year without a Huge <b>Hits</b> between the 1996 and 2004 volumes.|$|R

5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did not <b>hit</b> his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} <b>hit</b> the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted to <b>hit</b> the ball with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch <b>hit</b> or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects {{the location of the}} off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} <b>hit</b> {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is <b>hit</b> into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have <b>hit</b> for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who <b>hit</b> 67 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|A {{home run}} is a <b>hit</b> {{in which the}} player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball <b>hit</b> to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who <b>hit</b> 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never <b>hit</b> for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who <b>hit</b> for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>hits</b> (sometimes {{also called}} variety <b>hits)</b> is a radio format that draws {{from a wide}} variety of {{different}} musical genres. Most adult <b>hits</b> stations play a mix of rock, pop, pop rock, soft rock, classic rock, adult contemporary, and new wave <b>hits</b> as well as select oldies <b>hits,</b> predominantly drawing on music from the late 1960s through the present day. Adult <b>hits</b> is akin to classic <b>hits,</b> although the classic <b>hits</b> format uses a slightly older and often narrower playlist (1960s to 1980s).|$|R
50|$|<b>Hits</b> is {{the first}} of three {{greatest}} <b>hits</b> compilations by Spice 1, <b>Hits</b> II: Ganked & Gaffled and <b>Hits</b> 3, were released in 2001 and 2002, respectively.|$|R

5|$|A {{new video}} review slot was also {{introduced}} hosted by Ball called <b>Hit,</b> Miss Or Maybe in which three celebrities would review {{three of the}} latest pop videos and decide whether they {{thought they would be}} a <b>hit,</b> a miss or a maybe.|$|E
5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball <b>hit</b> there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually <b>hit</b> into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball <b>hit</b> by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were <b>hit</b> into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} the {{argument}} that the virus helped tip {{the balance of power in}} the later days of the war towards the Allied cause.

50|$|There was not {{a release}} {{entitled}} <b>Hits</b> '98. This {{is due to the}} compilers adding the Big <b>Hits</b> name to the brand; the first of the <b>Hits</b> series to be called Big <b>Hits</b> was issued in December 1997 which is when the <b>Hits</b> '98 volume would have normally been released. The next Big <b>Hits</b> was issued in September 1998, therefore, a <b>Hits</b> 99 followed in December as per the release pattern established in 1995.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 {{the station}} {{actually}} became 828 2XS and later Classic <b>Hits</b> 2XS followed by Classic <b>Hits</b> 828. In 1993 the station began broadcasting on 98.6FM and was renamed to Classic <b>Hits</b> 828 & 98.6FM. The renaming to Classic <b>Hits</b> {{was in no}} way connected to radio stations around New Zealand rebranding to Classic <b>Hits</b> FM as it was radio stations operated by Radio New Zealand that were affected by this change. However, with the station named Classic <b>Hits</b> 828 this prevented local Radio New Zealand station 98FM (formally 2ZA) from rebranding as Classic <b>Hits</b> and instead became Greatest <b>Hits</b> 98FM using the Classic <b>Hits</b> logo.|$|R

5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being <b>hit</b> in the head two days prior.

However, while Pipp was <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{systematic}} review, people with <b>HIT</b> treated with lepirudin showed a relative risk reduction of clinical outcome (death, amputation, etc.) to be 0.52 and 0.42 {{when compared to}} patient controls.

5|$|Adrián Beltré {{became the}} fourth player to <b>hit</b> for the cycle {{three times in}} his career and the second three-cycle player to <b>hit</b> for the cycle with two {{different}} teams (one with the Seattle Mariners and two with the Texas Rangers). Even though Beltre <b>hit</b> his cycles with two different teams, all the cycles occurred in the same ballpark, Globe Life Park. Beltre's third cycle on August 3, 2015 only took 5 innings, it was the fastest cycle since 1974 at the time.|$|E
