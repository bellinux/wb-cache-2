Non-linear mathematical programming techniques are normally used to optimize {{this sort of}} problems. Some problems need not only optimum component size but also optimum shapes.

As change of shape relates directly to change of geometry, the rules of geometric variation need {{to be set up}} which in this case is the variation of geometric boundary shapes.

40|$|The {{inspection}} {{design for}} the Air Force’s Retirement For Cause (RFC) program uses automated eddy current and ultrasonic inspection systems to detect flaws in the compressor and turbine components of the F 100 engine. The requirements of the program include the <b>inspection</b> of bolt <b>holes,</b> cooling holes, and oil drain holes in the various engine components. The hole diameters range from 0. 060 ″ to 0. 600 ″ {{with many of the}} components having 60 to 70 holes of a given size. The spacing between holes is fairly accurate; in general, variations are less than 0. 010 ″. Since the initial system accomodates approximately 20 different engine components, the only practical method of clamping the components to the systems’ turntable utilizes a set of jaws that clamp outwards on a component’s bore or rim. This method requires the operator to first align the part on the turntable. Accuracies on the order of 1 to 2 degrees are expected (0. 200 ″ at a 7 ″ radius). The <b>inspection</b> of <b>holes</b> is accomplished using rotating eddy current probes having a diameter 0. 010 ″ less than the hole diameter.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper was initiated by recent efforts to use circumferential creeping waves for ultrasonic nondestructive testing of inaccessible airframe structures for fatigue cracking. One particular such application of great interest in the aerospace industry is the <b>inspection</b> of weep <b>holes</b> drilled through vertical stiffeners in wet-wing structures (used as fuel tanks) of both military and civilian aircraft in order to permit remnant fuel to be evenly distributed during flight. Unfortunately, they can become the sites from which fatigue cracks often originate. A new split-aperture technique was recently suggested for the <b>inspection</b> of these <b>holes</b> [1]. The outstanding sensitivity of the split-aperture circumferential creeping wave technique in dry weep holes was well demonstrated on both simulated and real fatigue cracks. However, the presence of fuel or even its residues in the weep hole significantly affects the behavior of the circumferential creeping wave. It causes the creeping wave echo to split into a rather weak Rayleigh-type surface wave signal and a much stronger but somewhat slower halo signal [2]. In order to adapt the circumferential creeping wave inspection technique to the case of fluid-filled cavities {{it is important to understand}} the adverse effects of fluid loading on the Rayleigh- type circumferential surface wave, which is the only mode sensitive to such cracks...|$|R

This investigation has been concerned with the application of image processing techniques and the leakage light detection method.

Image processing techniques are found to be capable of discriminating copper-plated and unplated surfaces using the difference in reflectance between the surfaces. This suggests the possibility of applying such techniques to assess the quality of through-hole plating. The leakage light detection method can be implemented to assess the plating coverage of plated-through holes. A low cost inspection system demonstrating the principle of leakage light detection has been constructed.

The primary objectives {{of this research}} were to examine how reinforcing steel influences water jetting and to evaluate how jetting pressures and standoff distance from the material surface affect water jetting of concrete type materials and PVC tubing. The experimental work consisted of water blasting submerged test specimens using rotary jets, nozzles, pumping equipment, and testing procedures currently used in construction practice. The concrete test specimens were comprised of ring- and cylinder-shaped samples, containing materials with compressive strengths of approximately 160 and 3, 600 psi.

Reinforcing steel bars in CIDH piles do interfere with the jet path and will locally influence material erosion and water-jetting effectiveness. For a relatively weak material, water-jetting pressures between 10, 000 and 11, 000 psi produced erosion up to a radial distance of approximately 12 inches from the water jet.

40|$|Abstract: A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} nondestructive evaluation {{is the ability}} to discern signals, originating from a crack and a geometric feature in a part, that are either closely spaced or superimposed in time. An example problem is the ultrasonic <b>inspection</b> of aircraft <b>holes</b> in vertical riser structures with limited accessibility for a transducer from an external wing surface. Characteristics of the path of the ultrasonic signal and the contact condition between the fastener and hole can hinder the use of traditional amplitude dynamics for signal classification and crack detection. A local correlation method was developed to detect the relative shift of signals in time for adjacent transducer locations due to the varying echo dynamics from crack and part geometries. This approach analyzes a series of signals from a moving transducer by first accurately aligning the signals to the primary part signal feature and subsequently measuring the shifting of secondary signals of interest within multiple time windows. A methodology is proposed that supplements amplitude dynamic measures with both the change in time and signal variation measures. Feature maps of these dynamic measures are presented to demonstrate the methodology and provide a practical means for classification. Experimental and simulated studies are presented that validate this methodology for several ultrasonic NDE applications...|$|R

Subsurface science is an important activity that may be uniquely enabled by human crews. DOMEX provides an opportunity to plan and execute planetary mission science activities without the expense and overhead of a planetary mission. Objectives: The objective of this {{first in a series}} of DOMEX missions were to 1) explore the regional area to understand the geologic context and determine stratigraphy and geologic history of various geologic units in the area. 2) Explore for and characterize sites for deploying a deep (10 m depth) drilling system in a subsequent field season. 3) Perform GPR on candidate drill sites. 4) Select sites that represent different geological units deposited in different epochs and collect soil cores using sterile procedures for mineralogical, organic and biological analysis. 5) Operate the MUM in 3 different sites representing different geological units and soil characteristics. 6) Collect rock and soil samples of sites visited and analyze them at the habitat. Results: At mission start the crew performed a regional survey to identify major geologic units that were correlated to recognized stratigraphy and regional geologic maps. Several candidate drill sites were identified. During the rest of the mission, successful GPR surveys were conducted in four locations. Soil cores were collected in 5 locations representing soils from 4 different geologic units, to depths up to 1 m. Soil cores from two locations were analyzed with PCR in the laboratory. The remainder were reserved for subsequent analysis. XRD analysis was performed in the habitat and in the field on 39 samples, to assist with sample characterization, conservation, and archiving. MUM was deployed at 3 field locations and 1 test location (outside the habitat) where it operated autonomously for 2 - 4 hours at each site.

Simulations therefore stand to {{play a significant role in}} the design and optimization of inspection strategies for those conditions that can be accurately mod-eled. Moving from benchmark studies for relatively simple geometries toward more realistic conditions creates significant challenges. For shear-wave <b>inspections</b> of fastener <b>holes</b> these challenges include the complex energy field in the thin plates, reflections off the borehole, the complexity of making measurements in the near-field, material anisotropy, cracks as small as 1 mm square, and a sealant layer between aluminum sheets. To achieve comparable modeling and simulation data requires a very accurate experimental setup that allows the probe angle, probe height and scan path to be precisely set. For the modeling, care must be taken to match the applied gain and gates used during acquisition of the experimental data.

This work focuses on the numerical modelling aspects of eddy current testing for the bolt <b>hole</b> <b>inspections</b> of wing box structures typical of the Lockheed Martin C- 130 Hercules and P- 3 Orion aircraft, found in the air force inventory of many countries. Boundary element-based numerical modelling software was employed to predict the eddy current signal responses when varying inspection parameters related to probe characteristics, crack geometry and test piece properties. Two demonstrator exercises were used for eddy current signal prediction when lowering the driver probe frequency and changing the material's electrical conductivity, followed by subsequent discussions and examination of the implications on using simulated data in the PoD analysis. Despite some simplifying assumptions, the modelled eddy current signals were found to provide similar results to the actual inspections. It is concluded that physics-based numerical simulations have the potential to partially substitute or complement inspection data required for PoD studies, reducing the cost, time, effort and resources necessary for a full empirical PoD assessment. 9 2011 Taylor & Francis.

The evaluation of drilled circuit board holes has traditionally involved examining the cross-section of a hole using an optical or scanning electron microscope. The objective of this thesis was to compare the use of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and a Scanning White Light Interference Microscope (SWLIM) for use in drilled circuit board <b>hole</b> <b>inspection.</b> The thesis had two experiments to complete the objective. The first experiment evaluated drilled holes using both a scanning electron microscope and a scanning white light interference microscope (SWLIM) in order to-directly compare the two methods. The second experiment related the quantitative surface texture measurements given by the SWLIM to the drilling factors speed, chip load, number of panels in a stack. number of hits and head height (indicative of time between drilling holes).,Experiment I addressed the first objective and showed that the SEM is an excellent instrument for initially locating defects in drilled circuit board holes, but falls short in providing quantitative depth measurements of the defects. The SWLIM provides more quantitative data on defects, but can require more work to initially identify defects. Experiment 2 statistically related surface texture measurements to drilling parameters using analysis of variance techniques. The experiment showed that chip load, number of panels, and number of hits were significant factors for the arithmetic mean value (R,) and the root-mean-square average (Rq). Speed, number of panels, and number of hits were significant for peak-to-valley roughness (R). Overall, the scanning white light interference microscope was found to be superior to the SEM in providing quantitative measurements of a drilled hole's surface. The experiments showed that the SWLIM is a viable inspection tool for drilled circuit board holes...|$|R
