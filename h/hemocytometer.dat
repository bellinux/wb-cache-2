25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} <b>hemocytometer),</b> is a microscope slide that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The <b>hemocytometer</b> has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special glass slide when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by capillarity. Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. Cell viability can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E
25|$|Platelet {{concentration}} is measured either manually using a <b>hemocytometer,</b> or by placing blood in an automated platelet analyzer using electrical impedance, {{such as a}} Coulter counter. The normal range (99% of population analyzed) for platelets in healthy Caucasians is 150,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter (a mm3 equals a microliter). or 150–400 × 109 per liter.

25|$|Cytopathology (examination under a microscope) {{of either}} a {{tracheal}} wash or a BAL sample can determine whether EIPH has occurred. The number of {{red blood cells}} present can be quantified using a <b>hemocytometer.</b> A normal lung wash sample contains fewer than 10 red blood cells/μl of fluid. In the case of EIPH, the numbers will be several magnitudes or more higher. The presence of high numbers of hemosiderophages indicate that hemorrhage {{has occurred in the}} lung at some time in the past. Hemosiderophages are alveolar macrophages that have ingested and digested red blood cells from previous episodes of EIPH. The end product of the digestion of the red blood cells is an iron-storage complex known as hemosiderin.|$|E

This work is tedious and can be automated using image processing. An algorithm based on Fourier transform filtering and the Hough transform was developed for Malassez blade grid extraction.

40|$|International audienceIn biology, <b>hemocytometers</b> such as Malassez slides {{are widely}} used and are {{effective}} tools for counting cells manually. In a previous work, a robust algorithm was developed for grid extraction in Malassez slide images. This algorithm was evaluated {{on a set of}} 135 images and grids were accurately detected in most cases, but there remained failures for the most difficult images. In this work, we present an optimization of this algorithm that allows for 100 % grid detection and a 25 % improvement in grid positioning accuracy. These improvements make the algorithm fully reliable for grid detection. This optimization also allows complete erasing of the grid without altering the cells, which eases their segmentation...|$|R

This report presents the adverse effect of phosphate buffered saline as a diluent on cell viability when used in combination with an automated cell counter. The reduced cell viability was attributed to shear stress introduced by the automated cell counter. Furthermore, length of time samples were incubated in phosphate buffered saline also contributed to the observed drop in cell viability. Finally, as erroneous viability measurements can severely impact process decisions and product quality, this report identifies several alternative diluents that can maintain cell culture viability over time in order to ensure accurate representation of cell culture conditions...|$|R
40|$|Sorting and {{enumeration}} of {{immune cells}} from blood are critical operations involved in many clinical applications. Conventional methods for sorting and counting immune cells from blood, such as flow cytometry and <b>hemocytometers,</b> are tedious, inaccurate, and difficult for implementation for point-of-care (POC) testing. Herein {{we developed a}} microscale centrifugal technology termed Centrifugal Microfluidic Chip (CMC) capable of sorting immune cells from blood and in situ cellular analysis in a laboratory setting. Operation of the CMC entailed a blood specimen layered on a density gradient medium and centrifuged in microfluidic channels where immune cell subpopulations could rapidly be sorted into distinct layers according to their density differentials. We systematically studied effects of different blocking molecules for surface passivation of the CMC. We further demonstrated the applicability of CMCs for rapid separation of minimally processed human whole blood without affecting immune cell viability. Multi-color imaging and analysis of immune cell distributions and enrichment such as recovery and purity rates of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) were demonstrated using CMCs. Given its design and operation simplicity, portability, blood cell sorting efficiency, and in situ cellular analysis capability, the CMC holds promise for blood-based diagnosis and disease monitoring in POC applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{leukocyte}} depletion {{capacity and}} performance of 5 filters designed for filtration of red cell concentrates (RCC) were compared by counting leukocytes, measuring red cell volumes and by histological examination of the filters after use. To eliminate interdonor differences, 5 buffy-coat-poor RCC were pooled (in each of 10 experiments) and subsequently split up into the original bags. The RCC were passed over the Cellselect filter, a column filled with cellulose acetate, and over flat-bed polyester filters: the Cellselect Optima, the Pall RC 50, the Leukostop and the Sepacell R- 500. The filtration was shortest with the Pall RC 50 (p less than 0. 001 {{compared to the other}} 4 filters). Leukocyte removal was most effective with the cellulose acetate filter (p less than 0. 01 compared to the other 4 filters) followed by the Cellselect Optima polyester filter (p less than 0. 02 compared to the remaining 3 filters). Residual leukocytes did not exceed 50 x 10 (6) for any brand of filter. Red cell recovery was similar for all 5 filters with mean values from 86. 1 to 89. 2 %. The leukocyte numbers, counted in Türk's solution or in propidium iodide, gave comparable values in <b>hemocytometers</b> applying light microscopy or fluorescent microscopy, respectively.

40|$|Concentration {{measurement}} of particles in suspension {{is an important}} procedure performed in biological and clinical laboratories. Existing methods based on instruments such as <b>hemocytometers,</b> coulter counters, and flow cytometers are often laborious, destructive, and incapable of in vivo measurements. An ultrasound-based method has several unique advantages. It can be nondestructive and noninvasive, which allows a much larger portion of the sample to be analyzed, improving the accuracy and decreasing required sample volume. Also, ultrasound methods {{have the potential for}} in vivo measurement in the clinical setting, where cell concentration in liquids such as cerebrospinal fluid can be measured noninvasively without requiring a lumbar puncture. In this work, a new method is presented that estimates absolute particle concentration from high frequency B-mode ultrasound images. The method is based on the detection and characterization of the echoes from individual particles to estimate the effective slice thickness of the image. Prior characterization of the sample is not required because the estimation relies only on parameters that are measured directly from the image. The particle type differential is also performed by using the backscatter coefficient. The method is demonstrated by measuring microsphere suspensions as well as human T cell suspensions using a mechanically scanned single element transducer imaging system and a VisualSonics Vevo 2100. The proposed method has a wide range of potential clinical applications including noninvasive {{measurement of}} cell concentration in biological fluids. by John Haeseon Lee. Thesis: Ph.

5000|$|A low MCHC can be {{interpreted}} as identifying decreased production of hemoglobin. MCHC can be normal even when hemoglobin production is decreased (such as in iron deficiency) due to a calculation artifact.

Thus, our objectives were to evaluate methods to estimate European eel sperm density including spermatocrit, computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and flow-cytometry (FCM), using Neubauer Improved <b>hemocytometer</b> as benchmark. Initially, relationships between spermatocrit, <b>hemocytometer</b> counts, and sperm motility were analyzed, {{as well as the}} effect of sperm dilution on <b>hemocytometer</b> counts. Furthermore, accuracy and precision of permatocrit, applying a range of G-forces, were tested and the best G-force used in method comparisons.

Results from all techniques, spermatocrit, CASA and FCM, showed significant positive correlations with <b>hemocytometer</b> counts. The best correlation between spermatocrit and <b>hemocytometer</b> counts was obtained at 6000 × g (r = 0. 68). Out of two CASA variants, one or three photographic fields (CASA- 1 and CASA- 2), CASA- 2 showed a very high accuracy to <b>hemocytometer</b> counts (r = 0. 93), but low precision (CV: CASA- 2 = 28. 4 %).
