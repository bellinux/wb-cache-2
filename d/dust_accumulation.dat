In this work, we develop a numerical method, using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics, to investigate self-ignition behaviour of coal <b>dust</b> <b>accumulations</b> with a main emphasis on the roles of oxygen, diluent gas and dust volume. A one-step 2 nd-order reaction kinetic model consid- ering both coal density and oxygen density is used to estimate reaction rate using the kinetic parameters from previously conducted hot-oven tests. This model is validated to predict the transient temperature and concentration profiles of South African coal dusts until ignition. The computed self-ignition temperatures of dust volumes show a good agreement with experimental results. In addition, it is found that the inhibiting effect of carbon dioxide is comparatively small and oxygen consumption increases dramatically after ignition. Parameter analysis shows that the heating value and kinetic parameters have a comparatively pronounced effect on self-ignition temperature. The model provides a satisfactory explanation for the dependence of self-ignition behaviour on gas atmospheres, thus helping to further understand the fire risk of self-ignition in oxy-fuel combustion systems. status: publishe...|$|R

Local dust clouds appear up to 40 K cooler than the surrounding region in the daytime and appear warm at night. In contrast to their well-developed and consistent thermal signatures, local dust clouds exhibited little albedo contrast.

Local dust clouds are common along the receding edge of the south polar cap (observed primarily for orbiter imaging) and in the restricted area - 10 deg to - 30 deg, 80 deg to 125 deg W (observed primarily by the infrared thermal mapper); several of the latter occurred over a ridge in Claritas Fossae, indicating strong topographic control.

50|$|Reflective foil, bubble foil insulations, and radiant {{barriers}} are noted {{for their ability}} to reflect unwanted solar radiation in hot climates, when applied properly. Reflective foils are fabricated from aluminum foils with a variety of backings such as roofing paper, craft paper, plastic film, polyethylene bubbles, or cardboard. Reflective bubble foil is basically a plastic bubble wrap sheet with a reflective foil layer and belongs to a class of insulation products known as radiant foils. Reflective bubble/foil insulations are primarily radiant barriers, and reflective insulation systems work by reducing radiant heat gain. To be effective, the reflective surface must face an air space, also <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> on the reflective surface will reduce its reflective capability.

50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> {{caused by}} static cling is a {{significant}} issue for computers and other electronic devices with heat generating components {{that need to be}} cooled by airflow. Dust is carried into the computer by the airflow created by case- and component fans. The accumulated dust covers metal surfaces and clogs the empty space between the fins of heatsinks, diminishing the dissipation of heat and interrupting the outward flow of warm air. Especially for critical components such as microprocessors and memory banks, this raises the risk of them overheating which can ultimately damage or destroy them. To compensate, automatically controlled fans will raise their speed, generating more noise and shortening their lifespan. An additional risk is the (small) electrical conductivity of dust which, given enough accumulation of dust, can cause critical damage to the device's internal components. <b>Dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> grows exponentially, since the accumulated dust creates new static surfaces and physical bloccades for new dust to cling to.|$|E

An extensive experimental programme is presented to this end. The mechanisms of dissipation of the mechanical energy into heat during friction has been studied with rubbing machines in which a slider equipped with temperature sensors rubs against a rotating wheel.

40|$|Community-based {{research}} between Memorial University of Newfoundland and the Indigenous Sorowako Association (KW AS) {{assessed the}} environmental and potential human health impacts of an operational three-decades old laterite nickel mine and smelter in Sorowako, Indonesia. An active air sampler and health questionnaire were {{used in this study}} to assess seasonal and diurnal patterns of air quality and prevalent health conditions. Air was sampled {{with the use of a}} high volume air sampler to determine average total suspended particulates (TSP) and airborne metal concentrations. Twelve-hour air samples were collected over approximately five days and five nights during both the dry and rainy seasons in six communities. The six communities were located at different distances and directions from the nickel mines and smelter. Air samples were also collected at a reference site located further away from the smelter during the rainy season only. The composition of various metals was analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Twenty-four hour <b>dust</b> fall <b>accumulation</b> in approximately 20 households in the seven communities previously mentioned, as well as in 20 homes located on Lake Matano were recorded with an area standardized Kim wipe swipe. Communities closer to and downwind from the smelter had significantly higher mean TSP values in the day of the dry season than communities further away from the smelter. Average concentrations of nickel, cobalt and chromium were higher in the day than in the night in the dry season in communities closer to and downwind from the smelter. There was only a slight significant regression of airborne nickel concentration with increasing distance from the smelter in the day of the dry season (Linear r²= 0. 276, p= 0. 006, Linear r²= 0. 066, p= 0. 207) but not in the night of the dry season. <b>Dust</b> fall <b>accumulation</b> did not vary significantly among the communities, except in Kampung Baru, a site also exposed to sawmill dust. A confidential health questionnaire administered by community volunteers assessed potential links between prevalent health conditions and mining and smelting in the area. Twenty households were selected in a convenience sampling in the eight communities where <b>dust</b> fall <b>accumulation</b> was also studied. Adult and child versions of the questionnaire focused on respiratory and skin health conditions but also surveyed prevalence of other illnesses, and health determinants. Questionnaire responses showed that some health conditions typical of exposure to airborne particulates and nickel, such as asthma, rhinitis, and skin tumours, were more prevalent in areas closer to and downwind from nickel mining and smelting compared to Malili, a community located further away from the mines and smelter. Several positive correlations between ambient air pollution levels, <b>dust</b> fall <b>accumulation</b> in households, and health conditions typically found in nickel industrial areas suggested a potential human health impact of mining and smelting.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this study was the {{determination}} of the safety conditions to avoid the presence of explosive atmospheres in the wastewater industry. Eight Spanish plants located in Madrid, Barcelona and Málaga were considered and several sludge samples were taken in different seasons. The base for the assessment of the spontaneous ignition behaviour of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulations</b> is the experimental determination of the self-ignition temperature under isothermal conditions. Self-ignition temperatures at four volumes were obtained for one sample of sewage sludge, allowing their extrapolation to large storage facilities. A simple test method, based also on an isothermal study of samples, is the UN classification of substances liable to spontaneous combustion. Two different samples were so tested, obtaining unlike results if transported in packages of different volumes. By means of thermogravimetric techniques it is possible to analyse the thermal susceptibility of dried sewage sludge. Apparent activation energy can be obtained from the rate of weight loss. It is also applied to the study of self-ignition susceptibility by modifying test conditions when oxygen stream is introduced. As a consequence of this oxidant contribution, sample behaviour can be very different during testing and a step drop or sudden loss of weight is observed at a characteristic temperature for every substance, associated to a rapid combustion. Plotting both the activation energy and the characteristic temperature, a map of self-ignition risk was obtained for 10 samples, showing different risk levels for samples taken in different locations and at different seasons. A prediction of the self-ignition risk level can be also determined...|$|R

40|$|Mine explosions {{remain a}} threat to {{underground}} coal miners, requiring constant vigilance to prevent accumulations of combustible gasses and dusts and to limit sources of ignition. <b>Accumulations</b> of combustible <b>dust</b> in coal mines create the risk of large-scale explosions that can result in multiple deaths and traumatic injuries. The explosion hazard can be effectively controlled {{through the application of}} rock dust, such as limestone dust, to render inert the combustible coal dust generated during the mining and transport of coal (see publication 2011 - 196 at www. cdc. gov/niosh/docs/impact). Traditionally, determining when additional rock dust should be applied or evaluating the effectiveness of existing rock dust application has been limited to a subjective visual evaluation or to the collection and laboratory analysis of dust samples - a process that requires days or weeks to identify a hazard. For decades, miners have been able to monitor the concentrations of methane and other combustible gasses using handheld, direct reading gas detectors. These detectors have allowed miners to take immediate action to dilute gasses and prevent explosions. With this same purpose in mind, researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a real-time dust explosibility measuring instrument to provide instant feedback to miners on the relative hazard of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulations</b> in the mine and the effectiveness of their rock dusting practices. This instrument, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM), is a simple-to-use handheld device that provides a pass/fail assessment of coal mine dust samples.

The compilation of the DIRTMAP (Dust Indicators and Records from Terrestrial and MArine Palaeoenvironments) paleodust data sets in the last 2 decades provided a benchmark for paleoclimate models that include the dust cycle, following a time slice approach. We propose an innovative framework to organize a paleodust data set that builds on the positive experience of DIRTMAP and takes into account new scientific challenges by providing a concise and accessible data set of temporally resolved records of <b>dust</b> mass <b>accumulation</b> rates and particle grain size distributions. We consider data from ice cores, marine sediments, loess–paleosol sequences, lake sediments, and peat bogs for this compilation, with a temporal focus on the Holocene period. This global compilation allows the investigation of the potential, uncertainties, and confidence level of <b>dust</b> mass <b>accumulation</b> rate reconstructions and highlights the importance of dust particle size information for accurate and quantitative reconstructions of the dust cycle. After applying criteria that help to establish that the data considered represent changes in dust deposition, 45 paleodust records have been identified, with the highest density of dust deposition data occurring in the North Atlantic region. Although the temporal evolution of dust in the North Atlantic appears consistent across several cores and suggests that minimum dust fluxes are likely observed during the early to mid-Holocene period (6000 – 8000 years ago), the magnitude of dust fluxes in these observations is not fully consistent, suggesting that more work needs to be done to synthesize data sets for the Holocene.
