25|$|The {{situation}} of Lithuanian schools and Rytas society began deteriorating when 44 {{schools and the}} teachers' seminary was closed on 4–5 October 1927. At the same time, seminary director Kristupas Čibiras, Rytas chairman , and 23 other Lithuanian teachers and activists were arrested. It was a retribution for the Lithuanian decision to close more than 60 Polish schools in Lithuania. In 1928, Rytas maintained the gymnasium in Vilnius with 366 students, a vocational evening school, teachers' courses, 103 schools with 3,560 students, and 80 <b>evening</b> <b>courses</b> for adults with 1,765 students. Of the schools, only 52 had official permits. Some of the closed or non-certified schools continued to operate illegally. In 1931, with funding from Lithuania, Rytas purchased Vileišis Palace and moved its headquarters to the first floor. The second floor and the attic was rented by the Lithuanian Scientific Society.|$|E

500|$|In April 1937 Caltech {{mathematician}} Qian Xuesen (a Chinese citizen) {{joined the}} Group. Several months later Weld Arnold, a Caltech laboratory assistant {{who worked as}} the Group's official photographer, also joined. The main reason for Arnold's appointment to this position was his provision of a donation to the Group on behalf of an anonymous benefactor. They became well known on campus, earning the moniker of the [...] "Suicide Squad" [...] for the dangerous nature {{of some of their}} experiments and attracting attention from the local press. Parsons himself gained further media publicity when he appeared as an expert explosives witness in the trial of Captain Earl Kynette, the head of police intelligence in Los Angeles who was accused of conspiring to set a car bomb in the attempted murder of private investigator Harry Raymond, a former LAPD detective who was fired after whistleblowing against police corruption. When Kynette was convicted largely on Parsons' testimony, which included his forensic reconstruction of the car bomb and its explosion, his identity as an expert scientist in the public eye was established despite his lack of a university education. While working at Caltech, Parsons was admitted to <b>evening</b> <b>courses</b> in chemistry at the University of Southern California (USC), but distracted by his GALCIT workload he attended sporadically and received unexceptional grades.|$|E
