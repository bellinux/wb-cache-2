500|$|During {{his initial}} audition, Johnston {{claimed that he}} was bullied and victimised {{from the age of}} six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated [...] "I carry on singing." [...] There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's {{producers}} had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a [...] "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would help people who were going through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as {{successful}} as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Okajima has a {{distinctive}} pitching {{form in which}} he turns his head downwards just before he releases the ball and after release jerks it hard towards third base. These extra movements appear to give Okajima some added velocity to his pitches as they torque his body towards home plate and reportedly disguise his pitches and cause batters to swing early. Okajima {{is said to have}} mimicked the pitching form of a pitcher in Yoichi Takahashi's manga [...] who torqued his head so much after every pitch that his hat came flying off. Okajima admits, [...] "I was trying to copy the motion. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would make me throw harder." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 25 and 26, 2008, several {{scholars}} {{and family members}} published multiple critical articles in The New Republic, the first article using Waltzer's research, and the second adding their own research on top of Waltzer's. On December 27 Rosenblat finally confessed the truth to the producer of his movie, Harris Solomon, and his literary agent, Andrea Hurst. He stated that the apple-tossing part of his backstory was something he only imagined, while stating {{that the rest of}} his Holocaust experiences were accurate, however other falsehoods and discrepancies in his remaining story have been discovered since then. Rosenblat has apologized and claimed that [...] "It was my imagination, and in my mind, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> Even now, I believe it.", and he also said that he did it to bring happiness and hope to people.|$|E
2500|$|Also at Cannes, McKellen {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "While I was reading the book <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> entirely. Clever Dan Brown twisted my mind convincingly. But when I put it down I thought, 'What a load of [...] {{potential}} codswallop." [...] During a May 17, 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. (Some high-ranking Vatican cabinet members had called for a boycott of the film.) McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes[...] [...] an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it." ...|$|E
