[...] This work also discusses potential application of sophorolipids (and their derivatives) as well as the potential for genetic engineering strains to enhance sophorolipid yields. Researchers have focused on optimization of sophorolipid production in submerged fermentation, but some efforts have also investigated the possibility of sophorololipid production using solid state fermentation (SSF). The production process can be significantly impacted by the specific properties of the carbon and oil substrates used; and several inexpensive alternatives to more traditional substrates have been investigated. These potential substrates include: biodiesel by-product streams, waste frying oil, restaurant waste oil, <b>industrial</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> residues, mango seed fat, and soybean dark oil. The use of most of these substrates have resulted in lower yields compared to traditional fermentation substrates.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this work is to {{synthesize}} Brassylic Acid (BA) using oxidative cleavage of Erucic Acid (EA). Crambe (Crambe abyssinica) is an industrial oilseed grown in North Dakota. Crambe has potential as an <b>industrial</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> feedstock {{as a source of}} Erucic acid (EA). It has approximately 50 - 60 % of EA, a C{sub 22 } monounsaturated fatty acid. Oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids derived from oilseeds produces long chain (9, 11, and 13 carbon atoms) dibasic and monobasic acids. These acids are known commercial feedstocks for the preparation of nylons, polyesters, waxes, surfactants, and perfumes. Other sources of EA are Rapeseed seed oil which 50 - 60 % of EA. Rapeseed is grown outside USA. The oxidative cleavage of EA was done using a high throughput parallel pressure reactor system. Kinetics of the reaction shows that BA yields reach a saturation at 12 hours. H{sub 2 }WO{sub 4 } was found to be the best catalyst for the oxidative cleavage of EA. High yields of BA were obtained at 80 C with bubbling of O{sub 2 } or 10 bar of O{sub 2 } for 12 hours...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the primary}} storage {{nutrients}} in diatoms consist of lipid, they are {{potential for the}} <b>industrial</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> production. High value fatty acids include arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. This study aimed to analyze fatty acid synthesis by Chaetoceros gracilis diatom during growth. There was a large increase in lipid yield from 4 pg cell− 1 mass of lipid per cell at the exponential phase to 283 pg cell− 1 at stationary phase. The lipid concentrations also increased significantly from the stationary phase to the death phase, but not significantly from the end exponential phase to the stationary phase. The relative percentage of saturated fatty acid (SAFA) of the total fatty acid was {{higher than that of}} monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) at all of growth phase. The highest PUFA was found at stationary phase at the same time when SAFA was being the lowest. The majority of SAFA was palmitic acid (24. 03 – 40. 35 %). MUFA contained significant proportion of oleic acid (19. 6 – 20. 9 %). Oleic acid, linoleic acid and á-linolenic acid were found at every stage growth. These fatty acids are considered as precursor for production of long chain PUFA-Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA/ 22 : 6 ù 3) through series of desaturation and elongation step with all of desaturase enzyme (Ä 8 -D, Ä 9 -D, Ä 12 -D, Ä 15 -D, Ä 17 -D, Ä 6 -D, Ä 5 -D, and Ä 4 -D) and elongase enzyme (E) ...|$|E

Before induction, the lytic system did not significantly arrest essential physiological parameters in the recombinant E. coli (ECPi) and P. putida (JBOi) strain such as specific growth rate and biomass yield under standard growth conditions. A different scenario was observed in the recombinant JBOi strain when subjected to PHA-producing conditions, where biomass production was reduced by 25 % but the mcl-PHA content was maintained at about 30 % of the cell dry weight. Importantly, the genetic construct worked well under PHA-producing conditions (nitrogen-limiting phase), where more than 95 % of the cell population presented membrane disruption 16 h post induction, with 75 % of the total synthesized biopolymer recovered {{at the end of}} the fermentation period.

Con-taminated feed was distributed to various poultry and pig fattening farms as well as laying hen and milk production farms and fed to animals. The control authorities of the Federal States have analysed the dioxin concentrations of meat, egg and milk samples from the farms in question. Only few samples of pork, meat of laying hens and eggs contained dioxin concentrations that exceed the maximum levels per-mitted by the European Union. In milk and meat of fattening poultry maximum levels were not exceeded. Based on its risk assessment, BfR concludes that neither acute nor long-term adverse health effects are expected for consumers even if eggs or pork with the highest measured concentrations are consumed {{over an extended period of}} time. In regard to dioxin, it is not the daily intake of dioxin that is critical for its effects on human health, but rather the amount present in the human body – the body burden. Dioxins accu-mulate in the human body over time. As a result of background exposure, every human be-ing takes in traces of dioxins through foods on a daily basis. Due to the fact that in recent decades the primary sources of dioxins in the environment were eliminated, the dioxin con-tamination of food has decreased considerably. Official controls in food and feed in regard to compliance with maximum levels are carried out on a regular basis. Information gained by the results of the official controls provides options and strategies for a reduction of the human dioxin body burden by identification and elimina-tion of the source of contamination...|$|R

40|$|The omega- 3 {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (LC-PUFA) {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are strongly recommended {{to be part}} of a normal diet due to the many positive health effects in humans. Health authorities in many countries recommend an average daily intake of 0. 25 – 0. 5 grams of EPA and DHA by eating fish at least twice a week or alternatively, consume fish oil supplements. The unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in native marine and vegetable lipids are all present as cis-isomers while trans-isomers are found in industrially hydrogenated oils and in minor amounts in fat from ruminants. The intake of large amounts of trans-fatty acids is considered to have serious negative health effects and the advices are to reduce the consumption as much as possible. 	Several processing steps are necessary to produce high quality fish oil supplements, including concentrated forms of EPA and DHA. These steps include high temperature processes that might induce transformation of cis-double bonds to trans-double bonds in the unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The objectives of this thesis was determine if the processing conditions used at Nordic Pharma Inc. resulted in the formation of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in both natural “ 1812 ” fish oils (18 % EPA, 12 % DHA) and EPA/DHA concentrates and to investigate how time and temperature used in the processing steps affected the formation of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fish oil concentrates. Initially, a method for the analysis of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fish oils was established. Methylated standards of trans EPA and DHA were produced using p-toluenesulfinic acid as catalyst and separating the different isomers on high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates impregnated with silver nitrate. A 100 meter SLB-IL 111, the most polar gas chromatography (GC) column commercially available, was used to analyze the samples. The preparation and the separation of the trans standards on HPTLC plates was successful and gave sufficient amounts to optimize a temperature program for GC separation. The results from samples of processed fish oil showed that only minor amounts of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were formed during the processing conditions applied at Nordic Pharma Inc. The content of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was far below the amount allowed for such products. The SLB-IL 111 column worked well as a tool for analysis of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fish oil, but some further investigations are needed for this analysis system to be optimized. The temperature experiment showed that 200 °C for more than an hour was needed for the formation of larger amounts of trans LC-PUFA to occur.

The results on the TFA content of 268 samples acquired between October and December 2013 are reported. Samples were categorized as margarines and shortenings (n =  16), spreadable chocolate fats (n =  6), fried potatoes and chips (n =  25), industrial bakery (n =  4), breakfast cereals (n =  3), pastry products (n =  120), seasonings (n =  5), instant soups (n =  5), instant desserts (n =  6), chocolate snacks (n =  4), microwave popcorn (n =  4), cookies, biscuits and wafers (n =  53), and fast-food (n =  13), with butter (n =  4) included for comparison purposes. TFA were quantified by gas chromatography. Total TFA content in the fat ranged from 0. 06 % to 30. 2 % (average 1. 9 %), with the highest average values in the “biscuits, wafers and cookies” group (3. 4 % TFA), followed by the pastry group (2. 0 %). Fifty samples (19 %) had TFA superior to 2 % in the fat.

40|$|Increased {{consumption}} of trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (TFA) {{is associated with}} increased risk of cardio-vascular disease (CVD). The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) organised a workshop on the 9 th and 10 th April in Zagreb, Croatia entitled 'Trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in diets: health and legislative implications'. The workshop brought together around 30 European experts on fats, food science and technology, public health and nutrition and aimed to 1) present and discuss recent data {{on the presence of}} TFA in food and their consumption in Europe and 2) to exchange ideas and practices on how to reduce exposure to TFA. This report summarises the data presented and the discussions held at this workshop. The known negative health implications of <b>industrial</b> trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (iTFA) consumption were further stressed but it was also made clear that in contrast with the worrying situation seen in many European countries ten to fifteen years ago, {{the vast majority of the}} food products analysed for TFA content in recent years, and for which data is available, do not contain high levels of TFA. This improved situation is likely due to efforts from several stakeholders in reducing iTFA levels in foods, both voluntarily or enforced in some member states by regulatory measures. Nevertheless, data presented at the workshop showed that products with high levels of TFA can still be found on the market in some countries and depending on their frequency of consumption these may represent a cause for public health concern. The participants also discussed the need for further data collection on the presence of TFA in foods and how to best collect these data as well as the different technological options to reduce and replace iTFA in foods along with their costs and health benefits. Participants also noted that any TFA public health related-measures in this regard must not neglect the health implications of over{{consumption of}} other nutrients such as saturated fats (SFA), salt (sodium) and sugars. On the last session of the workshop, the participants discussed different public health approaches to further reduce TFA intake in Europe, such as legislative limits on TFA content in foodstuffs, mandatory and voluntary TFA labelling schemes and voluntary food reformulation pledges. The outcome of this session is presented in this report in the form of a table including relevant criteria to be considered when comparing these different approaches. JRC.

40|$|The {{type and}} amount of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> uptaken by cells are of vital {{importance}} for health. In this study we investigated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake by cells in context with <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation. Due to cell incubation the concentration of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the culture medium was dwindled, as expected. We observed that <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> prominent in the culture medium were diminished to a much greater extent than <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> contained in the medium in marginal amounts. The supplemented <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were incorporated into the cells regardless {{of the type of}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> added. Beyond that, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from the n 3 and the n 6 family were metabolized, resulting in an increase of their desaturation and elongation products. The supplementation of the culture medium with a special <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> did not affect the incorporation rates of the remaining <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> contained in the culture medium. Thus, an increased supply of unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is not sufficient to lessen the uptake of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> by cells...|$|R
