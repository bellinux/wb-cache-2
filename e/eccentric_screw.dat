50|$|The {{design of}} M1910/37 was typical for World War I era howitzer. The gun had short (12 calibers) barrel with <b>eccentric</b> {{interrupted}} <b>screw</b> breechblock; hydraulic recoil buffer and pneumatic recuperator were both mounted under the barrel. The carriage was of single trail type with limited traverse and, typically, unsprung wooden wheels (some pieces received metal wheels with solid rubber tires). The gun was typically towed by a horse team (eight horses) {{by means of}} a limber. For each gun three horse-drawn ammunition boxes were issued; each box held 22 projectiles and 24 propellant charges.|$|R
30|$|Forearm nonunions are {{uncommon}} but challenging. Operative {{treatment with}} adequate debridement, eradication of infection and stable fixation using compression (using lag <b>screws,</b> <b>eccentric</b> drilling and/or AO tensioner device) {{will lead to}} high predictable rates of healing. For the diaphyseal nonunion, longer plates with a high plate-span/screw ratio are preferred to achieve a more stable fixation. Segmental defects up to 6  cm can be successfully reconstructed with autogenous corticocancellous bone grafts while larger defects may require free tissue transfer. For the distal radius nonunions, placement of an opening wedge will not only correct deformity but also provide intrinsic stability. Locking plate technology has facilitated fixation of the small distal radius nonunion fragments.|$|R

50|$|The rotor takes a form {{similar to}} a corkscrew, and this, {{combined}} with the off-center rotary motion, leads to the alternative name: <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> pump.|$|E
50|$|For highly viscous {{material}} {{follower plate}} pumps are connected with an <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> pump or a scooping piston pump. Metering is controlled for mass, time, and volume {{to determine the}} amount of resin dispensed.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{on how the}} {{displacement}} principle is implemented, a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating pumps. The rotary circulation pumps includes <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> pumps, centrifugal pumps, and squeezed tube (peristaltic) pumps. Reciprocating pumps include plunger, diaphragm, and piston pumps.|$|E
50|$|After a {{personal}} bankruptcy Nordenfelt {{was forced out}} of the Nordenfelt-Maxim company in 1890 and left England for France, where his new company, Société Nordenfelt, designed the <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> breech used on the French 75. Legal action followed (Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd) over a non-compete clause Nordenfelt had signed.|$|E

This made the Model 1901 Norway's first quick-firing gun. The 1,000 kg gun's range was 10000 m, firing a standard 6.5 kg shell. The Model 1901 was 2.235 m long, with a barrel length of 2.167 m. The gun shields of the Model 1901 were detachable.|$|E
50|$|A {{progressive}} {{cavity pump}} {{is a type of}} positive displacement pump and is also known as a progressing cavity pump, progg cavity pump, <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> pump or cavity pump. It transfers fluid by means of the progress, through the pump, of a sequence of small, fixed shape, discrete cavities, as its rotor is turned. This leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate (bidirectionally) and to low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped fluid. Hence these pumps have application in fluid metering and pumping of viscous or shear-sensitive materials. The cavities taper down toward their ends and overlap with their neighbours, so that, in general, no flow pulsing is caused by the arrival of cavities at the outlet, other than that caused by compression of the fluid or pump components.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{proposed}} with {{the ideology of}} zone-energy method to precisely analyze the optimal driving location of novel ultrasonic actuator. This actuator is designed with the piezoelectric buzzer to act as its actuating component. It is formed a 3 -phase continuous traveling wave by using the asymmetric framework within the metal plate, it is therefore accessible to actuate the shaft. In order to produce the congruent driving force caused by 3 -phase continuous traveling waves within a periodic pulse, the optimal driving location must be situated on the eccentric location of buzzer instead of its core. The zone-energy method, {{in view of the}} energy balance, is available to find out the location of <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw.</b> By using this method, it is aimed to precisely solve out the optimal driving location that is situated on the a-third wavelength distance away from the circle center and the offset angle of 30 ºC apart from a certain screw on the Ni-alloy plate...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vascular injury during {{minimally}} invasive {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) is uncommon, yet a well-recognized and serious issue. It emerges because of non-visibility of vascular structures proximal to the pelvic bone during reaming, drilling holes, and fixing of screws. Numerous {{studies have found that}} screw fixation during cementless THA is beneficial for the initial stability of cup; yet, no anatomical guidelines support angular <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> fixation. Materials and Methods: In this study, we obtained the pelvic arterial-phase computed tomographic data of thirty eight humans and reconstructed the three-dimensional models of osseous and vessel structures. We performed the surgical simulation to fix these structures with cementless cups and screws with angular eccentricities. Results: The effect of screw eccentricities (angular eccentricities of ± 17 ° and ± 34 °) on the vascular injury was determined. Measurement between screw and adjoining vessels was performed and analyzed statistically to ascertain a comparative risk study for blood vessels that are not visible during surgery. Conclusion: Authors similarly discussed the significant absence of appreciation of quadrant systems proposed by Wasielewski et al. on eccentric screws. Adjustment of quadrant systems provided by Wasielewski et al. is required for acetabular implants with eccentric holes for fixation of acetabular screws...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental engineeringThe {{production}} of petroleum resources includes co-producing water. This water contains oil products {{and needs to}} be treated before discharge to sea or re-injection into the reservoir. The amount of produced water increases with the age of a field, as does often the amount of solids. The pressure of the reservoirs will decrease with time. The primary equipment for treating produced water is the hydro cyclone. It’s operated with a lower limit with regards to oil droplet size of ~ 10 μm although smaller oil droplets have been experienced to separate. The hydro cyclone requires a certain differential pressure to perform at its maximum efficiency, and it is sensitive to solids. To protect the hydro cyclone a desanding cyclone could be installed upstream the hydro cyclone. A pump is often used to pressurize the water if necessary. The effect that this equipment has on the oil-water separation is a topic being discussed in the industry. The development in the industry, with increasing the life lengths of the fields and the need for development in areas of more stringent requirements, will benefit more knowledge regarding the effect of pumps and desanding cyclones on the oil- water separation. This thesis deals with these issues and presents the knowledge that exists with regards to pumps and desanding cyclones and their effect on oil droplet coalescence and break-up. This research has been done through contacts with suppliers, literature studies and evaluation of available test data related to this equipment. The literature survey and contacts with pump suppliers reveal that little work has been done to identify any effect of the pumps on the oil droplets. Both the literature survey and the suppliers agree that the <b>eccentric</b> <b>screw</b> pump generates the least droplet break-up, and that the centrifugal pump creates more shearing than other pump types. The offshore tests of centrifugal pumps and twin screw pumps indicate that the twin screw pump is gentler to the oil droplets than the centrifugal pump. While the tests of the centrifugal pumps indicate that increasing differential pressure increases droplet break-up, the twin screw pumps do not show such correlation. This indicates that the twin screw pump is more suitable, with regards to oil droplet sizes, for boosting the produced water to a hydro cyclone. The literature survey and the contacts with the desanding cyclone suppliers reveal that little work has been done to identify any effect of the desanding cyclone on the oil droplets. The experience of the suppliers is that the desanding cyclone gives coalescence, while the one revealed test show that the desanding cyclone isn’t damaging to the downstream separation. The offshore tests indicate that the desanding cyclone create coalescence or an insignificantly degree of break up and will not damage the oil removal performance of the downstream equipment...|$|E
