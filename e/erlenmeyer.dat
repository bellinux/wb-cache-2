25|$|The first {{description}} of phenylalanine {{was made in}} 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, <b>Erlenmeyer</b> and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, two {{separate}} reports described a white solid with a pungent odor {{derived from the}} distillation of coal tar. In 1821, John Kidd cited these two disclosures and then described many of this substance's properties and the means of its production. He proposed the name naphthaline, {{as it had been}} derived from a kind of naphtha (a broad term encompassing any volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture, including coal tar). Naphthalene's chemical formula was determined by Michael Faraday in 1826. The structure of two fused benzene rings was proposed by Emil <b>Erlenmeyer</b> in 1866, and confirmed by Carl Gräbe three years later.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} blood banks was established by Frederic Durán-Jordà during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Duran joined the Transfusion Service at the Barcelona Hospital {{at the start of}} the conflict, but the hospital was soon overwhelmed by the demand for blood and the paucity of available donors. With support from the Department of Health of the Spanish Republican Army, Duran established a blood bank for the use of wounded soldiers and civilians. The 300–400ml of extracted blood was mixed with 10% citrate solution in a modified Duran <b>Erlenmeyer</b> flask. The blood was stored in a sterile glass enclosed under pressure at 2°C. During 30 months of work, the Transfusion Service of Barcelona registered almost 30,000 donors, and processed 9,000 liters of blood.|$|E

500|$|... "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask" [...] {{introduced}} {{several new}} plot elements which would continue in later seasons and featured {{the death of}} recurring character [...] "Deep Throat" [...] (Jerry Hardin). Carter described {{the inspiration for the}} episode as [...] "the result of a year-long learning experience".|$|E
500|$|Deep Throat is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the American science fiction television series The X-Files. He {{serves as an}} informant, leaking information to FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder to aid Mulder's investigation of paranormal cases, dubbed X-Files. Introduced in the series' second episode, also named [...] "Deep Throat", the character was killed off during the first season finale [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask"; however, he later made several appearances in flashbacks and visions.|$|E
500|$|X, {{sometimes}} referred to as Mr. X, is a fictional character on the American science fiction television series The X-Files. He serves as an informant, leaking information to FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to aid their investigation of paranormal cases, dubbed X-Files. The character serves as a replacement for Deep Throat, who had been killed off in the first season finale, [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask". X himself would be killed off after appearing in several seasons, eventually being replaced by Marita Covarrubias.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{ends with}} the tagline [...] "The Truth Is Out There", which {{is used for the}} majority of the episodes. The tagline changes in specific episodes to slogans that are relevant to that episode. The first of these was [...] "Trust No One" [...] in [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask". Other examples include: [...] "Deny Everything" [...] in [...] "Ascension", [...] "Éí 'Aaníígóó 'Áhoot'é" [...] in [...] "Anasazi", [...] "Everything Dies" [...] in [...] "Herrenvolk", [...] "Believe to Understand" [...] in [...] "Closure", [...] "They're Watching" [...] in [...] "Trust No 1", and [...] "This Is the End" [...] in [...] "My Struggle II".|$|E
500|$|... "Fallen Angel" [...] {{was written}} by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa, and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. The episode foreshadows {{the closing of the}} X-Files, which would occur in the season finale of the first season, [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask". The UFO fanatic character Max Fenig also laid the template for the introduction of The Lone Gunmen in the later first season episode [...] "E.B.E.". Scott Bellis would reprise his role as Max in the fourth season episodes [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] and [...] "Max", which explained the fate of the character after his disappearance in this episode. Max's NICAP baseball cap would make a brief appearance in Mulder's office in [...] "Beyond the Sea", later in the first season.|$|E
500|$|... "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask" [...] is the 24th episode and {{the first}} season finale of the science fiction {{television}} series The X-Files. Written by executive producer Chris Carter, and directed by R. W. Goodwin, the episode continues with the mythology story arc which started with [...] "Pilot". The episode first aired in the United States on May 13, 1994 on the Fox network. With 8.3 million households turning in during its initial broadcast, the episode was the most-viewed episode of the show's first season. The episode received an Edgar Award nomination in the Best Episode in a TV Series category, and has, since broadcast, received positive responses from both critics and crew members.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} season finale of The X-Files, [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask", Mulder was taken hostage {{by a group of}} Men in Black operatives, {{following}} his investigation into an [...] alien-human hybrid program. Fearing for Mulder's life, Deep Throat helped Scully gain access to a high containment facility, where she managed to secretly remove a cryogenically-preserved alien fetus for use as collateral in saving Mulder. In the subsequent meeting between the operatives and Deep Throat, he was gunned down by an assassin, the Crew Cut Man. Deep Throat was buried at the Arlington National Cemetery. The character later appeared in dreams and visions experienced by Mulder during his recuperation on a Navajo reservation, and again years later while being experimented on by The Smoking Man.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the crime scene, Mulder finds an <b>Erlenmeyer</b> flask labeled [...] "Purity Control". Scully takes the flask to Georgetown University, where Dr. Anne Carpenter (Anne De Salvo) helps her analyze its contents. Meanwhile, Mulder heads to Berube's home and finds keys for a storage facility. Secare calls Berube's home office and Mulder answers, {{pretending to be}} Berube. Secare tells whom he believes to be Berube that he's been in the water for three days, and is hurt. Meanwhile, the Crew Cut Man eavesdrops on the conversation. Secare collapses due to blood loss before he can tell Mulder where he is. While he is driven away in an ambulance, a poisonous gas is emitted from Secare's body when the paramedics perform a needle decompression. Secare recovers and flees from the ambulance.|$|E
500|$|Crew {{members have}} also reacted {{positively}} towards the episode. Carter {{said of the}} episode: The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask' brings back nothing but good memories. It just has terrific images in it; it really brought the series {{in its first year}} full circle. It was successful in doing what we wanted to do, which was to close down the X-Files. It shocked a lot of people". Goodwin commented: [...] "Everything about that episode is absolutely first class. The acting, the art direction, the camera work. There's nothing in it that isn't the best you can get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E
500|$|The season {{introduced}} the character X, played by Steven Williams, who replaced Deep Throat as Mulder's informant, following Deep Throat's assassination in the first-season finale, [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask". X was {{originally intended to}} be a woman with Natalija Nogulich already cast in the role, but was replaced by Williams as the writers did not believe she had the [...] "right chemistry" [...] with her co-stars. X was written to be different than Deep Throat; Deep Throat had been selfless, while X was intended to be selfish and scared. Nicholas Lea, who had previously appeared in a small part in the season one's [...] "Gender Bender", was cast as Alex Krycek. Krycek was originally intended as a temporary replacement for Scully when she was abducted, but grew into a character who would last seven seasons on the show.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, Carter and his staff had come up with many of the general {{concepts}} of the mythology that would last throughout all nine seasons. The first season introduced the series' primary antagonist, Cigarette Smoking Man, and gave early insight into the disappearance of Mulder's sister Samantha, whose abduction provided one of the main plot threads of the series as a whole. The emergent mythology was further solidified in the Carter-penned, Edgar Award-nominated season finale [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask". The episode was written in early 1994 before it was known whether or not the series would be renewed for a second season, and featured the closure of the X-Files unit and the reassignment of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to new jobs within the FBI. The finale was the first episode directed by R. W. Goodwin, who had served as producer for the series.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{earned a}} Nielsen rating of 8.8, with a 16 share. It was viewed by 8.3 million households, {{making it the}} most viewed episode of the first season. The Mystery Writers of America {{nominated}} [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask" [...] for an Edgar Award in the Best Episode in a TV Series category; the eventual recipient of the award was [...] "Simone Says" [...] of NYPD Blue. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 9 out of 10, saying it was [...] "the perfect ending to the first season" [...] and a good introduction to The X-Files mythology. Manuel Medoza from The Dallas Morning News said the episode was able to blend [...] "absolutely chilling" [...] moments with [...] "completely silly" [...] moments [...] "at the same time". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts concluded that the death of [...] "Deep Throat" [...] made the character [...] "very real".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the plot}} {{elements}} are self-referential to other episodes of the series. Fort Marlene's presence is {{a reference to the}} first season finale [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask," [...] when the alien fetus was first introduced; the term [...] "purity control" [...] is also a reference to this episode. The references to MUFON were purposely placed in the episode to connect to the story-arc involving Scully's cancer, which had been discovered during the show's fourth season. The episode also references and mirrors elements of popular culture. Fowley's apartment was purposely located in the Watergate complex, a hotel notorious as the location of the 1970s Watergate scandal. The scenes featuring Mulder and Scully being decontaminated were based on a similar scene in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, according to Spotnitz. He felt that the scene successfully played upon the sexual tension between the two lead characters.|$|E
500|$|From the outset, viewing {{figures for}} the series were good, with the initial {{broadcast}} of [...] "Pilot" [...] being watched by 7.4million households, which constituted 15percent of the viewing audience at the time. The series was broadcast directly after episodes of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., and saw a decline in viewing figures when that series began to falter. The season—and series as a whole—reached a low with [...] "Fallen Angel", which was viewed by only 5.1 million households. However, after the episode aired, the numbers began to rise steadily once again, reaching a peak for the season with [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask", which was viewed by 8.3million households, 16 percent of the available audience. At {{the conclusion of the}} 1993–94 television season, The X-Files ranked 105th out of 128 shows. The ratings were not spectacular, but the series had attracted enough fans to be classified as a [...] "cult hit", particularly by Fox standards, and was subsequently renewed for a second season.|$|E
500|$|Carter {{was drawn}} to actor Jerry Hardin after seeing him in 1993's The Firm. Hardin {{believed}} his initial appearance would be a one-time role, although he soon found himself regularly commuting to the series' Vancouver filming location on short notice. Producer Howard Gordon has spoken of the elusiveness of the character's allegiances, stating that during production, it was often left ambiguous whether he was [...] "ally or foe". After filming the character's death in the first season finale, [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask", Hardin was toasted with champagne, and told by Carter that [...] "no one ever really dies on X-Files". As such, Hardin made several more appearances as Deep Throat after this—seen in visions in the third season's [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and the seventh season's [...] "", in flashbacks in the fourth season's [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", and {{as one of the}} guises assumed by a shapeshifting alien in the third season's finale, [...] "Talitha Cumi".|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} of The X-Files debuted with [...] "Little Green Men" [...] on September 16, 1994. The episode earned a Nielsen {{household}} rating of 10.3, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.3 {{percent of all}} television-equipped households, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was viewed by 9.8 million households, an increase from the first season's finale, [...] "The <b>Erlenmeyer</b> Flask", which was viewed by 8.3 million households. [...] "Little Green Men" [...] was, at the time, the highest-rated episode of The X-Files to air. As the season continued, ratings began to grow. The season hit a high with the fifteenth episode, [...] "Fresh Bones", which was viewed by 10.8 million households. The season hit a low with the twenty-first episode, [...] "The Calusari", which was viewed by 7.9 million households and received a rating of 8.3/16. The season finale, [...] "Anasazi", earned a Nielsen rating of 10.1, with an 18 share, and was viewed by 9.6 million households, marking a 13.5 percent increase in households {{when compared to the}} previous season finale. The series was ranked as number 63 during the 1994–95 television season, a significant increase in ratings when compared to the first season, which finished at number 111.|$|E

Pencils are always used to point at key elements of the experiments, as the 'scientists' do not speak: this is sometimes taken to ridiculous levels—pointing out pencils using a pencil; pointing at chocolates and then at a person to show they are a gift.
