500|$|Karthi {{has been}} {{involved}} in several charities and social service activities. On his 31st birthday, he inaugurated the Makkal Nala Mandram, in order to encourage his fans to become involved in welfare activities. During the event, Karthi donated blood, donated bicycles to handicapped people, sewing machines to women and schoolbags to children. He presented a cheque of [...] 50,000 to YRG Care Centre, which helps AIDS affected children. In 2011, Karthi became a cause ambassador for promoting awareness of lysosomal storage disease. He had also adopted a white tiger cub at Vandalur Zoo and contributed [...] 72,000 to protect and preserve the animal. On his birthdays, Karthi visits orphanages and donates funds to them. He told Indiaglitz; [...] "When I see people in need, I make sure <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> help. If I am going on birthdays to reach out to kids in orphanages, it is for my own satisfaction. I feel happier to be with them and it's nice to make them smile on that particular day." ...|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{has often}} been {{regarded}} as one of country music's most influential female vocalists and most beloved entertainers. She is highly credited for remaining one of country's most popular female artists for nearly four decades, maintaining her success by continually incorporating contemporary musical sounds without changing her traditional vocal style. For many new artists, she has been credited as the inspiration to their careers in country music, including Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, and LeAnn Rimes. She has also been credited as an inspiration to other performers such as Sara Evans, Kelly Clarkson, Lee Ann Womack, Terri Clark, Taylor Swift, and Carrie Underwood, The Net Music Countdown second-handedly reported, [...] "That influence has manifested itself in many ways. As a role model, she's shown others how to handle fame with grace and good humor while never backing down from her values or goals. Just as importantly, she's shown others to refuse to accept limitations on what she can do or how much she can achieve." [...] McEntire also explained to the online website, [...] "Whatever I'm doing, I feel like I'm representing country music". [...] "It's always been my main career, and it's where my loyalties lie. I feel like I'm waving the flag of country music wherever <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> I couldn't be prouder to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{and other}} {{radicals}} were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, [...] "Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon". In April 1862, Stevens {{wrote to a}} friend, [...] "As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody." [...] The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: [...] "Stevens, Sumner and [...] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour [...] has not yet come." [...] The President stated that {{if it came to}} a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them [...] "the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with" [...] but [...] "with their faces... set Zionwards". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. [...] Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them [...] "flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying, [...] "The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war." ...|$|E

She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. 6 She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. [...] "This is one of the Hebrew babies", she said. [...] 7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{home for}} Easter in early April, Darwin told his cousin Fox of [...] "a scheme I have almost hatched" [...] {{to visit the}} Canary Islands and see Tenerife as {{recommended}} by Humboldt. On returning to Cambridge, {{he wrote to his}} sister that [...] "my head is running about the Tropics: in the morning <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> gaze at Palm trees in the hot-house and come home and read Humboldt: my enthusiasm is so great that I cannot hardly sit still on my chair. Henslow & other Dons give us great credit for our plan: Henslow promises to cram me in geology". He was studying Spanish language, and was in [...] "a Tropical glow".|$|E
2500|$|... "He (Steve) became {{another person}} {{to cope with}} the pressures, he would say things like, [...] "Please tell me that you'll leave me if I go on tour again because if you say that I’ll have {{justification}} not to go, if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> have to be that other person again I'll just go mad." [...] This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off.... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace." [...] – Jenny Rylance ...|$|E

60|$|I {{knew the}} hands was aboard, and arter {{watching}} 'is cabin-skylight until {{the light was}} out, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> undressed.

60|$|Every sin is not easy. My {{sense of}} honour arose against this temptation. I struggled, but I was mastered. <b>I</b> would <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see the trial.

2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it would, if you'd let a feller alone.
