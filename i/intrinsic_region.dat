The Controlled Avalanche Transit-time Triode (CATT), designed for microwave amplification, has a quite large lightly-doped region between the base and the collector regions, giving the device a collector-emitter breakdown voltage [...] fairly high compared to bipolar transistors of the same geometry. The current amplification mechanism is the same of the avalanche transistor, i.e. carrier generation by impact ionization, {{but there is also a}} transit-time effect as in IMPATT and [...] TRAPATT diodes, where a high-field region travels along the avalanching junction, precisely in along the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region.</b> The device structure and choice of bias point imply that ...|$|E

Electrons from the valence band of the p-type region tunnel into the conduction band of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> and current can flow across the device. As the gate bias is reduced, the bands becomes misaligned and current can no longer flow.|$|E

The wide <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> makes the PIN diode an inferior rectifier (one typical function of a diode), but it makes it suitable for attenuators, fast switches, photodetectors, and high voltage power electronics applications.|$|E

The feasibility for high-speed applications is demonstrated by a time constant limited impulse response of 200 ps (full width at half-maximum) when excited near the band edge with 100 ps optical pulses. The theory-predicted and recently verified voltage tunability of the band edge with clearly resolved excitonic resonances was observed. The responsivity {{was measured to be}} 0. 2 A/W...|$|R
3000|$|The best fitting of the PAL spectra was {{achieved}} via mixed channels of trapping, which occurs through defect-related positron trapping sites and bound positron-electron (positronium Ps) states.

50|$|The basic TFET {{structure}} {{is similar to}} a MOSFET except that the source and drain terminals of a TFET are doped of opposite type (see figure). A common TFET device structure consists of a P-I-N (p-type, intrinsic, n-type) junction, in which the electrostatic potential of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> is controlled by a gate terminal.|$|E
50|$|The diode {{design has}} some design trade-offs. Increasing the {{dimensions}} of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> (and its stored charge) allows the diode to look like a resistor at lower frequencies. It adversely affects the time needed to turn off the diode and its shunt capacitance. It is therefore necessary to select a device with the appropriate properties for a particular use.|$|E
40|$|Employing a {{recently}} developed efficient cellular automaton technique for solving Boltzmann’s transport equation for realistic devices, {{we present a}} detailed study of the carrier dynamics in GaAs avalanche p-i-n (IMPATT) diodes. We find that the impact ionization in reverse bias p-i-n diodes with ultrathin (less than 50 nm) <b>intrinsic</b> <b>regions</b> is triggered by Zener tunneling rather than by thermal generation. The impact generation of hot carriers occurs mainly in the low-field junction regions {{rather than in the}} high field intrinsic zone.

5000|$|A PIN diode is a diode with a wide, undoped <b>intrinsic</b> {{semiconductor}} <b>region</b> {{between a}} p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor region. The p-type and n-type regions are typically heavily doped {{because they are}} used for ohmic contacts.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigation}} of the photovoltaic effect observed at room temperature are presented.

50|$|The double {{heterostructure}} {{is a very}} useful structure in optoelectronic devices and has interesting electronic properties. If one of the cladding layers is p-doped, the other cladding layer n-doped and the smaller energy gap semiconductor material undoped, a p-i-n structure is formed. When a current {{is applied to the}} ends of the pin structure, electrons and holes are injected into the heterostructure. The smaller energy gap material forms energy discontinuities at the boundaries, confining the electrons and holes to the smaller energy gap semiconductor. The electrons and holes recombine in the intrinsic semiconductor emitting photons. If the width of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> is reduced to the order of the de Broglie wavelength, the energies in the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> no longer become continuous but become discrete. (Actually, they are not continuous but the energy levels are very close together so we think of them as being continuous.) In this situation the {{double heterostructure}} becomes a quantum well.|$|E
50|$|In a PIN diode, the {{depletion}} region exists almost completely within the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region.</b> This depletion region {{is much larger}} than in a PN diode, and almost constant-size, independent of the reverse bias applied to the diode. This increases the volume where electron-hole pairs can be generated by an incident photon. Some photodetector devices, such as PIN photodiodes and phototransistors (in which the base-collector junction is a PIN diode), use a PIN junction in their construction.|$|E
50|$|The PIN diode obeys the {{standard}} diode equation for low frequency signals. At higher frequencies, the diode {{looks like an}} almost perfect (very linear, even for large signals) resistor. There {{is a lot of}} stored charge in the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region.</b> At low frequencies, the charge can be removed and the diode turns off. At higher frequencies, there is not enough time to remove the charge, so the diode never turns off. The PIN diode has a poor reverse recovery time.|$|E

40|$|How to {{suppress}} the performance deterioration of thermoelectric materials in the <b>intrinsic</b> excitation <b>region</b> remains a key challenge. The magnetic transition of permanent magnet nanoparticles from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism provides an effective approach to finding {{the solution to this}} challenge. Here, we have designed and prepared magnetic nanocomposite thermoelectric materials consisting of BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles and Ba 0. 3 In 0. 3 Co 4 Sb 12 matrix. It was found that the electrical transport behaviours of the nanocomposites are controlled by the magnetic transition of BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism. BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles trap electrons below the Curie temperature (TC) and release the trapped electrons above the TC, playing an ‘electron repository’ role in maintaining high figure of merit ZT. BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles produce two types of magnetoelectric effect—electron spiral motion and magnon-drag thermopower—as well as enhancing phonon scattering. Our work demonstrates that the performance deterioration of thermoelectric materials in the <b>intrinsic</b> excitation <b>region</b> can be suppressed through the magnetic transition of permanent magnet nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and {{validate}} (using simulations) a novel design of silicon tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET), {{based on a}} reverse-biased p+-p-n-n+ structure. 2 D device simulation results show that our devices have significant improvements of switching performance compared with more conventional devices based on p-i-n structure. With independent gate voltages applied to two gated <b>intrinsic</b> <b>regions,</b> band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) could {{take place at the}} p-n junction, and no abrupt degenerate doping profile is required. We developed single-side-gate (SSG) structure and double-side-gate (DSG) structure. SSG devices with HfO 2 gate dielectric have a point subthreshold swing of 9. 58 mV/decade, while DSG devices with polysilicon gate electrode material and HfO 2 gate dielectric have a point subthreshold swing of 16. 39 mV/decade. These DSG devices have ON-current of 0. 255 μA/μm, while that is lower for SSG devices. Having two nano-scale independent gates will be quite challenging to realize with good uniformity across the wafer and the improved behavior of our TFET makes it a promising steep-slope switch candidate for further investigations...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{proposal for a}} microwave device of the IMPATT type was made by Read. The Read diode consists of two regions (i) The Avalanche region (a region with relatively high doping and high field) in which avalanche multiplication occurs and (ii) the drift region (a region with essentially intrinsic doping and constant field) in which the generated holes drift towards the contact. A similar device can be built with the configuration in which electrons generated from the avalanche multiplication drift through the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|MQW devices must be {{operated}} at high reverse bias fields to achieve good contrast ratios. In perfect quantum well material {{this is not}} a problem, but the presence of a defect in the semiconductor crystal can cause the device to break down at voltages below those necessary for operation. Specifically, a defect will cause an electrical short that prevents development of the necessary electrical field across the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> of the PIN diode. The larger the device the higher the probability of such a defect. Thus, If a defect occurs in the manufacture of a large monolithic device, the whole shutter is lost.|$|E
50|$|The same {{mechanism}} {{applies to}} the PIN structure, or p-i-n junction, of a solar cell. In this case, the advantage of using a PIN structure over conventional semiconductor p-n junction is the better long wavelength response of the former. In case of long wavelength irradiation, photons penetrate deep into the cell. But only those electron-hole pairs generated in and near the depletion region contribute to current generation. The depletion region of a PIN structure extends across the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region,</b> deep into the device. This wider depletion width enables electron-hole pair generation deep within the device. This increases the quantum efficiency of the cell.|$|E
30|$|Except for surface passivation, {{enhancing}} {{light absorption}} {{in the active}} regions is also an effective method to improve the conversion efficiency, which facilitates the electron–hole separation. For NW solar cells with pn junctions, the optimized efficiency {{can be achieved by}} placing the junction near the position where the most carriers are generated [10 – 12], while for pin junction solar cells, higher efficiency can be achieved if more carriers can be generated in the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>regions</b> [13 – 17]. What is more, by suppressing the optical generation in regions near the contacts, the number of photogenerated minority carriers that diffuse into the contacts can be decreased [14, 17]. There are many methods to enhance light absorption in active regions, such as adjusting junction positions or lengths [13, 14], employing inclined NWs [15], decorating the active region with metal particles [16], or fabricating the heavily doped regions with high bandgap materials [17]. For GaAs NW solar cells, the usage of AlGaAs shells as passivation layers has been widely reported. However, the ability of AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures to confine photogenerated carriers in the active regions has been paid less attention.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The small-signal voltage {{and current}} {{distributed}} effects in the polysilicon and <b>intrinsic</b> base <b>regions</b> of long stripe bipolar junction transistors (BJT’s) at high frequencies are in-vestigated, and simple analytic equations describing the {{voltage and current}} distribution in these regions are derived. It is shown that the frequency-dependent debiasing effects in the polysilicon contacts and <b>intrinsic</b> base <b>region</b> change the current behavior and modulate the input admittance. The current and voltage distributions in the polysilicon region are nonuniform and vary with frequency. Conventional two-dimensional (2 -D) device sim-ulations cannot accurately predict this three-dimensional (3 -D) effect. A quasi- 3 D simulation scheme combining a 2 -D device simulator and the distributed model is presented to properly and efficiently describe the input characteristics of the device at high frequencies. It is also shown the use of various polysilicon sheet resistances, geometry sizes, and layout structures changes the distributed characteristics and modulates device performance at high frequencies. The impact of the layout structure and geometry size on RF circuit design due to the distributed effects is also studied.

50|$|Germanium {{detectors}} {{are mostly}} used for gamma spectroscopy in nuclear physics, {{as well as}} x-ray spectroscopy. While silicon detectors cannot be thicker than a few millimeters, germanium can have a depleted, sensitive thickness of centimeters, and therefore {{can be used as}} a total absorption detector for gamma rays up to few MeV.These detectors are also called high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) or hyperpure germanium detectors. Before current purification techniques were refined, germanium crystals could not be produced with purity sufficient to enable their use as spectroscopy detectors. Impurities in the crystals trap electrons and holes, ruining the performance of the detectors. Consequently, germanium crystals were doped with lithium ions (Ge(Li)), in order to produce an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> in which the electrons and holes would be able to reach the contacts and produce a signal.|$|E

50|$|Semiconductor {{detectors}} utilise the semiconducting element germanium. The germanium {{is processed}} {{to form a}} p-i-n (positive-intrinsic-negative) diode, and when cooled to ~77 K by liquid nitrogen to reduce dark current and detector noise, produces a signal which {{is proportional to the}} photon energy of the incoming radiation. There are two types of germanium detector, the lithium-drifted germanium or Ge(Li) (pronounced ‘jelly’), and the high-purity germanium or HPGe.The semiconducting element silicon may also be used but germanium is preferred, as its higher atomic number makes it more efficient at stopping and detecting high energy gamma rays. Both Ge(Li) and HPGe detectors have excellent sensitivity and resolution, but Ge(Li) detectors are unstable at room temperature, with the lithium drifting into the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> ruining the detector. The development of undrifted high purity germanium has overcome this problem.|$|E
5000|$|A PIN diode {{operates}} {{under what}} is known as high-level injection. In other words, the intrinsic [...] "i" [...] region is flooded with charge carriers from the [...] "p" [...] and [...] "n" [...] regions. Its function can be likened to filling up a water bucket with a hole on the side. Once the water reaches the hole's level it will begin to pour out. Similarly, the diode will conduct current once the flooded electrons and holes reach an equilibrium point, where the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes in the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region.</b> When the diode is forward biased, the injected carrier concentration is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration. Due to this high level injection, which in turn is due to the depletion process, the electric field extends deeply (almost the entire length) into the region. This electric field helps in speeding up of the transport of charge carriers from the P to the N region, which results in faster operation of the diode, making it a suitable device for high frequency operations.|$|E
50|$|Quantum wells {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to increase the efficiency}} of solar cells. The theoretical maximum efficiency of traditional single-junction cells is about 34%, {{due in large part to}} their inability to capture many different wavelengths of light. Multi-junction solar cells, which consist of multiple p-n junctions of different bandgaps connected in series, increase the theoretical efficiency by broadening the range of absorbed wavelengths, but their complexity and manufacturing cost limit their use to niche applications. On the other hand, cells consisting of a p-i-n junction in which the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>region</b> contains one or more quantum wells, lead to an increased photocurrent over dark current, resulting in a net efficiency increase over conventional p-n cells. Photons of energy within the well depth are absorbed in the wells and generate electron-hole pairs. In room temperature conditions, these photo-generated carriers have sufficient thermal energy to escape the well faster than the recombination rate. Elaborate multi-junction quantum well solar cells can be fabricated using layer-by-layer deposition techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition. It has also been shown that metal or dielectric nanoparticles added above the cell lead to further increases in photo-absorption by scattering incident light into lateral propagation paths confined within the multiple-quantum-well intrinsic layer.|$|E
