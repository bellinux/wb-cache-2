25|$|The first {{designs were}} criticized {{as having a}} slow and {{cumbersome}} firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork winding mechanism removed, the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> {{has been replaced by}} an automatic ejection system and in the rod's place is a cocking lever that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round magazine capacity and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolver}} {{featured a}} counter-clockwise rotating cylinder, {{which could be}} opened for loading and ejection by simply pulling back on a catch mounted {{on the left side}} of the frame behind the recoil shield. It was easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder could be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases were removed by simply pushing back on an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> to activate a star extractor. The six-shooter could then be quickly reloaded and the cylinder clicked back into place.|$|E
2500|$|The Single Action Army became {{available}} in standard barrel lengths of 4¾ inch, 5½ inch, {{as well as}} the Cavalry standard, original 7½ inch. The shorter barrelled revolvers are sometimes called the [...] "Civilian" [...] or [...] "Gunfighter" [...] model (4¾ inch) and the Artillery Model (5½ inch). There was also a variant with a sub-4-inch barrel, without an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod,</b> unofficially called the [...] "Sheriff's Model", [...] "Banker's Special", or [...] "Storekeeper".|$|E
50|$|Transition {{from the}} First to Second Series was gradual, with some post-WWII Second Series guns {{retaining}} short <b>ejector</b> <b>rods</b> and checkered hammers. Because of this, assigning a given revolver {{to a particular}} issue is best done by serial number.|$|R
50|$|For 15 years, their {{managers}} {{maintained the}} patent exclusive of fluted by compression. This technique, originally as Halcon, served {{to execute the}} bordered ones of the guns of its arms. For such action four operations were required. The advantage consisted of granting major hardness to the steel and obtaining one more polished surface, avoiding therefore the heating of the guns, considering the smaller friction produced by {{the passage of the}} projectiles, mainly in the automatic weapons. The pieces that composed its rifles and machine guns were schemed or executed by winches or drop hammers, except for the marks of the pistols gas release devices, that were of smelting. For the preparation of the butts, walnut, original of the provinces of San Luis and Mendoza were used. This wood remained in the same plant for four or five years before they were utilized. The factory produced for its arms, the complementary accessories: magazines for machine guns (opened or closed), canvas covers and leather slings for firearms such as rifles and submachine guns, cleaning <b>rods</b> and <b>ejector</b> <b>rods</b> made of iron and bronze, brushes of several classes for cleaning of guns, anticorrosives. Inclusively, it got to make a shelf wood gunsmith.|$|R
50|$|The M1870 Gasser was a {{revolver}} chambered for 11.3×36mmR and {{was adopted by}} the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry in 1870. It was an open-frame model, with the barrel unit attached to the frame by a screw beneath the cylinder arbor. The arbor pin was screwed into the barrel unit and fitted into a recess in the standing breech. The cylinder was gate-loaded from the right side, and a <b>rod</b> <b>ejector</b> was carried beneath the barrel. A unique safety bar will usually be found on the right of the frame, below the cylinder. This carries pins which pass through holes in the frame to engage the lock mechanism. Slightly retracting the hammer allows one of these pins to move inward, preventing the hammer moving forward again when released. The pistol can thereafter be carried safely when loaded. Pressure on the trigger withdraws the pin from the path of the hammer before firing. The M1870 Gasser became the Austro-Hungarian cavalry revolver. It chambered a long 11.25mm centerfire cartridge which had earlier been used in Fruwirth carbines.|$|R
2500|$|Cimarron was {{the first}} company to offer a direct copy of the Colt Single Action Army Revolver in {{stainless}} steel that maintained the size and dimensions of the original. Some critics {{have pointed out that}} the front sight blade is slightly wider and the rear sight notch is slightly narrower than the original Colt's, but that these changes make for a more accurate and easier to sight revolver. Cimarron designed the first sub-4" [...] barrel single-action revolver that used an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> when it introduced the Cimarron Lightning SA model.|$|E
2500|$|Cimarron {{offers a}} version of the Colt Buntline {{revolver}} named the [...] "Wyatt Earp Buntline" [...] styled after the Uberti version used by Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp in 1993's Tombstone with a 10" [...] barrel and a silver badge inlaid on the right grip panel. Other movie replicas include the [...] "Holy Smoker" [...] based on the [...] "Hand of God" [...] revolver used by Russell Crowe's character Ben Wade in [...] and a copy of Clint Eastwood's [...] "Man With No Name" [...] revolver. Critics point out that from a historical perspective this type of conversion had no loading lever and included an ejector rod; however, Cimarron was faithful to the movie version which had a loading lever and lacked an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Colt tasked its {{superintendent}} of engineering, Charles Richards, {{to come up}} with a solution. The Richards conversion was performed on the Colt 1860 Army revolver. The caliber was [...]44 Colt and the loading lever was replaced by an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b> This conversion added a breechplate with a firing pin and a rear sight mounted on the breechplate. Cartridges were loaded into the cylinder one at a time via a loading gate. Colt manufactured 9000 of these revolvers between 1873 and 1878. In 1873, Colt performed the same conversion on the M1851 and M1861 revolvers for the US Navy in [...]38 rimfire. [...] Another of Colt's engineers, William Mason, improved this conversion by placing the rear sight on the hammer and, along with Richards, he was granted patents in 1871 to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic-cartridge revolvers. Those converted revolvers are identified as the [...] "Richards-Mason conversion". There were approximately 2100 Richards-Mason M1860 Army conversions made from 1877 to 1878 in a serial-number range 5800 to 7900.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-1980s, Ruger {{began to}} have reports of {{failures}} in the Redhawk revolvers. [...] Some Redhawks were reported to be separating at the junction between barrel and frame. [...] It was not known at the time why this was happening; the Redhawk {{had been on the}} market for years with no reported problems, but Ruger decided to address the issue by extending the frame 2.5inches past the cylinder face, {{all the way to the}} end of the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod,</b> to provide a massive surface into which to thread the barrel. [...] The extended frame also provided enough length to allow scope bases to be mounted on the frame, rather than on the barrel as was done on the scoped versions of the Redhawk. [...] It was determined that the barrel separations on the Redhawks were due to a change in the lubricant used when attaching the barrels to the frames, but by that time the new Super Redhawk design was already well underway and the extended frame was kept.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, Colt {{introduced}} the Model 1889, the first truly modern double action revolver, which differed from earlier double action revolvers {{by having a}} [...] "swing-out" [...] cylinder, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "top-break" [...] or [...] "side-loading" [...] cylinder. Swing out cylinders quickly caught on, because they combined the best features of earlier designs. Top-break actions gave the ability to eject all empty shells simultaneously, and exposed all chambers for easy reloading, but having the frame hinged into two halves weakened the gun and negatively affected accuracy, due to lack of rigidity. [...] "Side-loaders", like the earlier Colt Model 1871 and 1873, gave a rigid frame, but required the user to eject and load one cylinder at a time, as they rotated the cylinder to line each chamber up with the side-mounted loading gate. Smith & Wesson followed 7 years later with the Hand Ejector, Model 1896 in [...]32 S Long caliber, followed by the very similar, yet improved, Model 1899 (later known as the Model 10), which {{introduced the}} new [...]38 Special cartridge. The Model 10 {{went on to become the}} best selling handgun of the 20th century, at 6,000,000 units, and the [...]38 Special is still the most popular chambering for revolvers in the world. These new guns were an improvement over the Colt 1889 design since they incorporated a combined center-pin and <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> to lock the cylinder in position. [...] The 1889 did not use a center pin and the cylinder was prone to move out of alignment.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the onset}} of the American Civil War he {{returned}} to Colt in 1861, eventually becoming Superintendent of Engineering at the factory in Hartford, Connecticut. Richards' first major post Civil War design was Colt's second attempt at metallic cartridge conversion known as the [...] "Richards Conversion". Colt's revolvers to this point had been black powder percussion pistols, where the shooter had to pour black powder into each of the six chambers, ram a bullet on top and place a percussion cap on the nipple at the rear of each of the chambers. However, the US Army wanted a revolver that held metallic cartridges, which Colt could not produce because the Rollin White patent was still held by rival Smith & Wesson. Colt's only solution would be to bore through the rear of their cylinders and devise a new method of ignition and case extraction. The Richards Conversion was performed on the Colt 1860 Army revolver. The caliber was [...]44 Colt and the loading lever was replaced by an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b> This conversion added a breechplate with a firing pin and a rear sight mounted on the breechplate. Colt manufactured 9000 of these revolvers between 1873 and 1878. [...] In 1873 Colt performed the same conversion on the M1851 and M1861 revolvers for the US Navy in [...]38 rimfire. [...] Along with William Mason he was granted patents from 1871 to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic cartridges revolvers. Those converted revolvers are nowadays identified as the [...] "Richards-Mason Conversion". There were approximately 2100 Richard-Mason M1860 Army Conversions made from 1877 to 1878 in a serial number range 5800 to 7900.|$|E
5000|$|The M1877 {{was offered}} {{from the factory}} in two basic finishes: {{nickel-plated}} or a case-hardened frame with a blue barrel and cylinder. The revolver was available in barrel lengths from 2.5" [...] to 7.5" [...] and was available {{with or without the}} <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> and housing. The shorter barreled versions without the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> were marketed as [...] "shopkeeper's specials".|$|E

5000|$|New Model Super Blackhawk: Produced in blued and stainless, with {{or without}} a rib for {{mounting}} a scope. The Super Blackhawk is built on the same frame, but with a larger grip (in the 7.5" [...] and 10.5" [...] barrels) and unfluted cylinder (except for the 5.5" [...] barrel), in order to more effectively deal with the [...]44 Magnum's recoil. Also, the grip frames are made of steel, versus aluminium for those same components in the Blackhawk. <b>Ejector</b> <b>rod</b> housings were originally steel on old model Super Blackhawks. The new model stainless steel versions have steel <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> housings.|$|E
50|$|The {{revolver}} was a six-shot open-framed design, {{which was}} loaded via a hinged gate {{on the right}} side of the frame, through which empty cartridges were also ejected via an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> running along the barrel.|$|E
50|$|To {{unload the}} M1898, the hammer is rotated back {{slightly}} {{until it is}} in the half-cock position. The loading-gate is opened and the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> is pulled back to eject either spent casings or unused cartridges.|$|E
50|$|Loading was {{accomplished}} via a groove {{in the frame}} rearward of the cylinder and early models incorporated an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> until 1874. After that, a shooter would need to remove the cylinder to empty the brass casings.|$|E
50|$|A {{tactical}} laser projector {{is available}} that mounts on an accessory rail under the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> shroud. It {{is turned on}} and off via a pressure switch that can be attached on the grip; the operator just squeezes the grip and the projector goes on or off.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1872 and 1872/78 revolvers {{operated}} in both single action and double action, with empty cartridges individually ejected by an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b> They {{were very similar}} in design to the French military MAS 1873 Chamelot-Delvigne revolver. The 1872 revolver used 10.4mm (.41 Swiss) rimfire cartridges.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the British Bull Dog {{revolver}} had been in existence since 1868, but Henry Webley registered the trademark in 1878. From that time to the present, the term has come to mean any short barrelled double-action revolver with a swing-out <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> and a short grip.|$|E
50|$|An {{extractor}} also {{performs the}} function of an ejector in revolvers. When the striking force applied to the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> is hard and fast enough, the extractor will typically eject the empty case(s) from the cylinder. Some break-action shotguns {{are also designed to}} eject empty shells completely out of the chamber when the barrel is opened.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 {{a limited}} run of 500 guns in {{stainless}} steel and 500 guns in blue with color case hardened frames were offered by Davidson's with a 3+3/4 in barrel and a shortened <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> and housing. These were called the [...] "Sheriff's Model". In 2005, this barrel was added {{as a standard}} option to the catalog.|$|E
5000|$|The Lawman was a [...]357 Magnum 'service grade' or 'police issue' {{version of}} the Trooper, {{equipped}} with smaller 'Magna Service' type stocks, a standard hammer, fixed sights, and barrel lengths of two inch and four inch only. The two inch barrel has an attribute unique to the Lawman, the only Lawman barrel equipped with shrouded <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Model 1878 was {{chambered}} {{specifically for}} a centerfire cartridge. Its mechanism is the Warnant {{system with a}} rebounding hammer modified by Lieutenant-Colonel Rudolf Schmidt. In contrast with the Model 1872, it has no loading gate but is designed to index the chambers of the cylinder with an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b> They were manufactured in Switzerland by Waffenfabrik Bern. After 1882, they were replaced by the Schmidt M1882 service revolver.|$|E
5000|$|Colt was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} to produce a revolver with a swing-out cylinder. Smith & Wesson followed seven years later with the Hand Ejector, Model 1896 in [...]32 S&W Long caliber. This was an improvement over the Colt 1889 design since it used a combined center-pin and <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> to lock the cylinder in position.

There was also a variant with a sub-4-inch barrel, without an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod,</b> unofficially called the [...] "Sheriff's Model", [...] "Banker's Special", or [...] "Storekeeper".|$|E
5000|$|The Cloverleaf Model {{was more}} {{produced}} by far, {{and had two}} different variants, depending on the barrel length: 1-1/2" [...] and 3". The 1-1/2" [...] barrel length variant had an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> contained within the center pin of the cylinder, allowing to reload while keeping the cylinder in the gun. The 3" [...] barrel length variant of the Cloverleaf had the ejector in the same axis of the cylinder center pin and, thus, the cylinder needed {{to be removed from}} the frame when loading.|$|E
50|$|The {{revolver}} {{featured a}} counter-clockwise rotating cylinder, {{which could be}} opened for loading and ejection by simply pulling back on a catch mounted {{on the left side}} of the frame behind the recoil shield. It was easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder could be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases were removed by simply pushing back on an <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> to activate a star extractor.

5000|$|The Remington Model 1890 New Model Army was a {{revolver}} by the Remington Arms. It was a {{based upon the}} successful Remington Model 1875 and the lesser known Model 1888 with both revolvers having the same size, appearance, and the removable cylinder. The 1890 Remington single-actions kept the solid frame and similar styling of the 1875 model, but lacking the large web under the <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> housing and equipped with checkered rubber grips. Like the 1875 model, the 1890 was suitably made for metallic cartridges, but only issued in [...]44-40 caliber.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of this design is that Nagant revolvers were laborious and time-consuming to reload, {{with the need}} to manually eject each of the used cartridges, and reload one cartridge at a time through a loading gate. At the time the revolver was designed, this system was obsolete. In England the Webley revolver used a break action that simultaneously ejected all six spent cartridges; and in America the swinging crane and star ejector had replaced the loading gate and <b>ejector</b> <b>rod</b> system. However, the Nagant design did have the advantage of requiring less machining than more modern designs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1902 the [...]38 Military & Police (2nd Model) was introduced, {{featuring}} substantial changes. These included major modification and simplification of {{the internal}} lockwork {{and the addition of}} a locking underlug on the barrel to engage the previously free-standing <b>ejector</b> <b>rod.</b> Barrel lengths were 4, 5, 6, and 6.5 inches with a rounded butt. Serial numbers for the Military & Police ranged from number 1 in the series to 20,975. Most of the early M&P revolvers chambered in [...]38 Special appear to have been sold to the civilian market. [...] By 1904, S&W was offering the [...]38 M&P with a rounded or square butt, and 4-, 5-, and 6.5-inch barrels.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, S&W also shipped the Model 17 {{featuring}} a 4", 6" [...] or 8 3/8" [...] full under lug barrel.
