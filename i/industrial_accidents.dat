Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption. However, wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired. The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged, the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{who work}} at night and attempt to sleep during the day suffer because {{the timing of the}}ir sleep/wake {{schedule}} remains out of phase with the timing of the environmental light. Night workers are particularly prone to vehicle accidents, and their decreased alertness, performance, and vigilance are likely to blame for a higher rate of <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents</b> and quality control errors on the job, injuries and a general decline in work productivity rate. Recent information also suggests that as the body normally releases melatonin when it is dark, working under artificial like at night suppresses the released of melatonin, which may increase the risk of developing cancer.|$|E

Along {{the north shore of}} Contra Costa County, substantial amounts of pressurized liquid gas, flammable liquids, caustic materials, and various toxics are stored temporarily in bulk railcars adjacent to passenger and freight traffic mainlines, with great potential hazards should a derailment occur. Derailments have often occurred during major earthquakes, both directly by tipping and by roadbed failures; <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents</b> involving these materials have caused extensive health hazards in the mixed residential–industrial areas of Richmond.|$|E
25|$|To assist family {{planning}} and marriage and family guidance, the government allocated DM 2 232 000 in 1973 for the payment and for the basic and further training of staff. A special effort was also made in 1973 to organize the recreation of handicapped persons, with a holiday guide for the handicapped issued {{with the aid of}} the Federal Ministry of Family and Youth Affairs and Health in order to help them find suitable holiday accommodation for themselves and their families. From 1972 to 1973, the total amount of individual aids granted by Guarantee Fund for the integration of young immigrants increased from 17 million DM to 26 million DM. Under a law passed in April 1974, the protection hitherto granted to the victims of war or <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents</b> for the purpose of their occupational and social reintegration was extended to all handicapped persons, whatever the cause of their handicap, provided that their capacity to work had been reduced by at least 50%.|$|E

25|$|Green's Mill, a {{red brick}} tower mill, was built around 1807 {{on the site}} of a {{previous}} smaller post mill. When the founder of the mill died, his son, renowned mathematician George Green, inherited and operated it until his death in 1841. Near Green's Mill stood the imposing Nottingham Lunatic Asylum, the first County Asylum to open in England, which existed from 1812 to 1902. It was later converted into a boarding school named King Edwards, governed by the infamous head master Alfred Tanner and his wife Mary. Children were killed in <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents</b> at the school. It has since been demolished and is now the location of King Edward Park. At the end of the Nineteenth century, the Third Earl Manvers sold off the remainder of the Pierrepont family land to developers, who subsequently build all of the Victorian housing on the slopes of Sneinton Dale. This housing was of a higher standard than the previous development, and still stands to this day. The population then grew to a peak of 23,093 in 1901, as lace and textile manufacturing expanded along with heavy industry.|$|E
25|$|In July, the Permanente Foundation {{formed to}} operate Northern California {{hospitals}} {{that would be}} linked to the outpatient health plans, followed shortly thereafter by the creation of Northern Permanente Foundation for Oregon and Washington and Southern Permanente Foundation for California. The name Permanente came from Permanente Creek, which flowed past Henry Kaiser's first cement plant on Black Mountain in Cupertino, California. Kaiser's first wife, Bess Fosburgh, liked the name. An abandoned Oakland facility was modernized as the 170-bed Permanente Hospital opened on August 1, 1942. Three weeks later, the 71-bed Richmond Field Hospital opened. Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents</b> and minor illness. Each first aid station had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required. Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care. The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver, Washington. Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage; and within a year the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month. These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers. In 1944, Kaiser decided to continue the program after the war and to open it up to the general public.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} causes of TBI in the U.S. include violence, {{transportation}} accidents, construction, and sports. Motor bikes are major causes, increasing in significance {{in developing countries}} as other causes reduce. The estimates that between 1.6 and 3.8million traumatic brain injuries each year {{are a result of}} sports and recreation activities in the US. In children aged two to four, falls are {{the most common cause of}} TBI, while in older children traffic accidents compete with falls for this position. TBI is the third most common injury to result from child abuse. Abuse causes 19% of cases of pediatric brain trauma, and the death rate is higher among these cases. Although men are twice as likely to have a TBI. Domestic violence is another cause of TBI, as are work-related and <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents.</b> Firearms and blast injuries from explosions are other causes of TBI, which is the leading cause of death and disability in war zones. According to Representative Bill Pascrell (Democrat, NJ), TBI is [...] "the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom, cotton mills were water-powered, and {{therefore}} sprang up where water power was available. [...] When, as {{was often the}} case, there was no ready source of labour in the neighbourhood, the workforce had to be imported. [...] A cheap and importable source of labour was 'parish apprentices' (pauper children, whose parish was supposed to see them trained to a trade or occupation [...] ); millowners would reach agreement with distant parishes to employ, house and feed their apprentices. In 1800 there were 20,000 apprentices working in cotton mills,. The apprentices were vulnerable to maltreatment by bad masters, to <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents,</b> to ill-health from their work, ill-health from overwork, and ill-health from contagious diseases such as smallpox, typhoid and typhus, which were then widespread. The enclosed conditions (to reduce the frequency of thread breakage, cotton mills were usually very warm and as draught-free as possible) and close contact within mills and factories allowed contagious diseases such as typhus and smallpox to spread rapidly. [...] Typhoid (like cholera, which did not reach Europe until after the Napoleonic wars) is spread not by poor working conditions but by poor sanitation, but sanitation in mills and the settlements round them often was poor.|$|E

2500|$|Animal {{attacks and}} work-related {{injuries}} such as <b>industrial</b> <b>accidents</b> are other causes. [...] Vehicular trauma {{is one of}} the leading causes of facial injuries.

In addition, airbags can cause corneal abrasions and lacerations (cuts) to the face when they deploy.|$|E
