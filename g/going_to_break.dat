5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
25|$|Some skirmishing {{occurred}} between the Arabs and the mission's African forces before Joubert {{could reach the}} scene. The Arabs tried {{to negotiate with the}} missionaries, saying they would not harm the mission if the priests abandoned Joubert. Bridoux refused. It seemed that serious fighting was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out, when a storm arose that destroyed some of the Arab fleet and forced them to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Stewart Brand {{said when}} {{introducing}} {{the work of}} Philip Tetlock that Brand's partner had given a talk in the 1980s to top Central Intelligence Agency people {{about the future of}} the Soviet Union. One scenario he raised was that the Soviet bloc might break up; a sign of this happening would be the rise of unknown Mikhail Gorbachev through the party ranks. A CIA analyst said that the presentation was fine, but there was no way the Soviet Union was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up in his lifetime or his children's lifetime. The analyst's name was Robert Gates.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, a sequel, titled Old School Dos, {{was written}} by Scot Armstrong but was turned down by {{original}} stars, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. The story concerned the aging fraternity <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Spring <b>Break.</b> While promoting Semi-Pro in 2008, Ferrell {{had this to say}} about the defunct project: “I read script. Some super funny set pieces, but I don’t know. I think Vince Vaughn had the same reaction. We’re just kind of doing the same thing again. It was like us <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Spring <b>Break,</b> but we’ve got to find this guy who’s the head of a fraternity. Once again, funny things but it’s just us once again back in a fraternity setting. It just felt like it was repeating. But watch, I’m over-thinking it.” ...|$|R
25|$|The lightly {{armoured}} Turkish, Egyptian and Bedouin cavalry repeatedly charged. However, when it {{was evident}} that the Crusaders were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> ranks, they veered away from the spears without coming to blows. Each Ayyubid attack lost heavily to the barrage of missiles from the many crossbows. The armour of the Christians proved better able to withstand the arrows of the Saracens than the armour of the Saracens could withstand crossbow bolts. Also, being entirely cavalry, the many horses of Saladin's force were particularly vulnerable to missile fire. After a few hours' onslaught, both sides began to tire. Having suffered considerably from the barrage of crossbow bolts without having been able to dent the Crusaders' defences, Saladin's cavalrymen were in a demoralised state and their mounts were exhausted. They were put to flight by a charge of the knights, only 10 to 15 of whom were mounted, and spearmen led by the king himself.|$|E
500|$|Presley began {{speaking}} to the audience between songs about various different things. During one live performance, he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was [...] "strung out" [...] because of his alleged drug problem, he got angry and said: [...] "Well by God, I'll tell you something, I have never been strung out in my life, except on music [...] [...] [...] If I find the individual who said that about me, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> your neck, you son-of-a-bitch.

500|$|On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two {{teammates}} threw {{a perfect}} {{game against the}} Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3–1. [...] "I was just telling myself, 'Don't walk him,'" [...] Feldman said. [...] "Once it got to 3–1, I threw it right down the middle. [...] If they got a hit, they got a hit. [...] But they're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up a perfect game on a walk." [...] The batter grounded out. [...] On July 31, the three pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.|$|E

[...] Some reviews of the song were negative, with Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stating that Gomez [...] "brings nothing in the way of personality to her songs", adding that [...] "the swaggering 'sex' song 'Whiplash' would be comical if it wasn't so tedious." [...] In another broadly negative review, PopMatters writer John Bergstrom suggested that Spears did not write any songs on Femme Fatale [...] "to avoid the embarrassment of overwrought, fake-British-accent-flaunting would-be come-ons like 'Whiplash'.|$|E
500|$|On January 10, 1868, the Senate Committee on Military Affairs {{voted to}} {{recommend}} reinstatement of Stanton to office.

[...] Grant hurried to the White House and told Johnson he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> federal law. [...] Johnson told Grant he would pay the fine and go to prison in Grant's place, but Grant found Johnson's answer preposterous. On Monday, January 13, the Senate voted to reinstate Stanton to office 35 to 6.

[...] One hour later, when Stanton arrived at the War Department office, Townsend gave Stanton the key, witnessed by welcoming onlookers.|$|E
500|$|At No Way Out, Big Show made {{a return}} to the company after taking time off for {{injuries}} beginning in December 2006. In his return promotional interview, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a chokeslam. Professional boxer and WBC Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. After Big Show dropped to his knees, Mayweather attacked him with a combination of punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The following night on Raw, Big Show challenged Mayweather to a wrestling match, which Mayweather accepted. As part of the storyline, Big Show arranged an exhibition match with fighter Brandon Hill, who was similar in size and stature to Mayweather. Unimpressed with Show's display of dominance over Hill, Mayweather told Show that [...] "at WrestleMania, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> your jaw". At their weigh-in for their WrestleMania match, Show threw Mayweather into a crowd of wrestlers to emphasise the disparity in size.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 the Conservatives {{unexpectedly}} won {{control of}} the Inner London Education Authority and the party leadership was horrified to discover that their newly elected councillors were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up comprehensive schools {{and replace them with}} secondary modern and grammar schools. Chataway, with relevant ministerial experience, was persuaded to take over. He was elected an Alderman and appointed Leader of the Education Committee. Eventually cajoling his colleagues into a more moderate line, he avoided a head-on collision with Edward Short (the Labour Education Secretary) and proceeded with those schemes for secondary reorganisation that he regarded as well founded.|$|R
5000|$|Before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{commercial}} <b>breaks,</b> {{the show}} also featured {{a piece of}} football trivia, again often relating to statistics or records broken in recent football matches.

500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> it from me because I know I'm not any big deal".|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant to seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [...] compels you forward with {{a new understanding of}} what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page." [...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by [...] "open a new chapter" [...] for the new season, which included Peter having never existed. Its futuristic storyline was meant to [...] "inform the present of the show with some thematic elements," [...] establishing to viewers that [...] "our world is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] {{was written}} by McCartney as a {{pastiche}} of ska music. The track took a surprising {{amount of time to}} complete, with McCartney demanding perfectionism that annoyed his colleagues. Jimmy Scott, a friend of McCartney, suggested the title and played bongos on the initial take. He demanded a cut of publishing when the song was released, but the song was credited to [...] "Lennon-McCartney". After working for three days on the backing track, the work was scrapped and replaced with a new recording. Lennon hated the song, calling it [...] "granny music shit", while engineer Richard Lush recalled that Starr disliked having to record the same backing track repetitively, and pinpoints this session as a key indication that the Beatles were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up. McCartney attempted to remake the backing track for a third time, but this was abandoned after a few takes and the second version was used as the final mix. The group, save for McCartney, had lost interest in the track by the end of recording, and refused to release it as a single. Marmalade recorded a version that became a number one hit. In 2004, an online survey of 1,000 people in the UK by Mars ranked the song as the worst ever.|$|E

500|$|Donovan {{commented that}} Scott loved Charlene, {{so when he}} saw she was in danger, he forgot to think about himself and he just went in to rescue her. Donovan added that Scott was [...] "devastated" [...] when he saw Charlene had been injured. At the hospital, Scott gave Charlene the {{friendship}} ring and declared that they would live together. Minogue told Bourne that Charlene was flattered by the gift, while Donovan stated that it proved that they loved each other and were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up again. Minogue agreed with Donovan, saying [...] "There is that underlying love whether they are together or not." [...] After learning about the couple's plans to move in together, their friends and neighbours expressed their shock at how serious the couple had become. When Charlene showed the ring to Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) and told her how she and Scott wanted to live together, Daphne was taken back. Scott's friend Mike Young (Guy Pearce) also voiced his opposition, but Scott was determined {{that no one would}} stop them from moving in together. Bourne noted that Daphne's shock at the couple's plans was [...] "the start of a major controversy, splitting apart the inhabitants of Ramsay Street." ...|$|E
500|$|The remark {{is usually}} invoked {{to signal the}} {{conflicts}} that arose when bandleader and composer Brian Wilson began subverting the formula that brought the Beach Boys their initial success: songs with lyrics that embraced girls, cars, and surfing. The departure was represented by the band's 1966 album Pet Sounds and reached a tipping point one year later with Smile, which was abandoned and left unfinished. At the time, Anderle was a portrait artist and talent manager who Wilson recently befriended and employed {{as the head of}} the Beach Boys' new label, Brother Records. [...] Anderle later said that his original statement about the [...] "formula" [...] was [...] "taken slightly out of context", explaining that Love was not as concerned with the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business as he was with the [...] "bottom line". On those albums, instead of collaborating with Love, Wilson sought lyrics from jingle writer Tony Asher and multi-instrumentalist Van Dyke Parks. According to various reports, some of which have been disputed, the band resisted the new direction and were worried that Wilson was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> away as a solo artist. The band, including Wilson, were also anxious about whether their new [...] "arty" [...] approach would amount to record sales.|$|E
500|$|Spears's {{relationship}} {{of three years}} with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors {{that she had been}} unfaithful to him. [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is often credited as being the song that propelled the album into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted to become a backing vocalist for Spears's 2001–2002 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well {{by the end of the}} tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up, to which Spears responded, [...] "Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, [...] "Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [...] Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like—I think we kind of needed each other." [...] Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, [...] "It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well".|$|E
