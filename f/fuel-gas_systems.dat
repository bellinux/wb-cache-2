5000|$|In the U.S., anyone, {{including}} the city issuing building permits, may face a civil liability lawsuit for negligently creating {{a situation that}} results in loss of life or property. Those who fail to adhere to well known best practices for safety have been held negligent. This liability {{and the desire to}} protect residents has motivated cities to adopt and enforce building codes that specify standards and practices for electrical systems (as well as other departments such as water and <b>fuel-gas</b> <b>systems).</b> This creates a system whereby a city can best avoid lawsuits by adopting a single, standard set of building code laws. This has led to the NEC becoming the de facto standard set of electrical requirements. [...] A licensed electrician will have spent years of apprenticeship studying and practicing the NEC requirements prior to obtaining his or her license.|$|E

However, great amount of coalmine methane is released during coal exploitation, which runs up to over 3. 5 billion cubic meters. To minimize environmental pollution caused by coalmine methane and to promote resource utilization, various systems for utilizing coalmine methane energy are developed in China. Common types of such systems include power generation system utilizing coalmine methane, combined-heat-and-power system of coalmine methane, thermal energy provision system of coalmine methane, and <b>fuel-gas</b> provision <b>system,</b> etc. This paper describes elements, characteristics, and applicability of these systems and presents thermal economy analysis to specific system. Thermal economic indexes, such as exergic efficiency and exergic losses of specific coalmine methane energy utilization system are obtained. These data are very useful in finding the way to make further progress in improving thermal economy of coalmine methane energy utilization systems {{as well as providing}} technical support to make tradeoffs among those systems. In addition, the possibility of serving coalmine methane energy utilization systems as distributed energy resource is discussed and potential problems summarized. Generally speaking, these efforts are practical to promote coalmine methane energy utilization in China...|$|R
