The Estonian register of wills (the Succession Register) was established on 1 October 1996 under the first Estonian Succession Law Act, which also provided for the publishing of notices <b>of</b> succession <b>proceedings,</b> an operation that started on 1 January 1997. Succession proceedings conducted by Estonian notaries are readily accessible and observable by all interested persons through the Succession Register and the electronic database of notices <b>of</b> succession <b>proceedings</b> published in Official Announcements. From the data available in the Succession Register, {{it is possible to}} obtain complete information about the succession proceedings: not only data about the testaments and succession contracts entered in it but also information about which notary is conducting the succession proceedings for any given deceased person, information about estate-management measures, and succession certificates. Everyone, including those persons entitled to inherit and the creditors of the deceased, has since the end of 2013 had access to information about the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> succession <b>proceedings</b> and about the notary conducting them, just as much as about the general state <b>of</b> succession <b>proceedings,</b> directly through the Succession Register data from the e-state portal. The Estonian Succession Register belongs to the European Network of Registers of Wills (ENRW or RERT). The information in the second electronic database, Pärimisteated, can be divided into three types: notices related to the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> succession <b>proceedings,</b> notices <b>of</b> the calling <b>proceedings</b> for identification <b>of</b> heirs, and notices <b>of</b> calling <b>proceedings</b> conducted for purposes of determining the obligations incurred by the deceased and applying to the estate...|$|R

If the crime committed at present and bodily injury, the victim is exposed to other factors such as long-term sick leave, which can result in disability pension, and not least the reduction of social applications.

50|$|In the report, the Law Reform Commission {{noted that}} {{while there is a}} real {{question}} as to whether blasphemy still exists in the criminal law of New South Wales, even if it was “received” as law in colonial times, given the long period of disuse, Section 49 of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) abolished the common law misdemeanour of criminal libel, but expressly left in operation “the law relating to blasphemous, seditious or obscene libel”. Schedule 1 of that Act inserted section 574A into the Crimes Act, relating to the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> for blasphemous libel giving recognition to the continued existence of the common law offence of blasphemous libel. Section 574A has since been repealed.|$|R
