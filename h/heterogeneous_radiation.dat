A high spatial overlap between PET and histology is necessary to justify the usage of a new PET-tracer in diagnosis and treatment planning of primary PCa. Additionally, the implemented MI coregistration step led to enhanced accuracy compared to purely CT-based coregistration. Precise coregistration between PET and histopathology enables voxel-based evaluation steps, like ROC analyses [16]. The concept of focal radiotherapy, have gained of interest for patients with primary [17] and recurrent PCa [18]. A voxel-wise examination of the tracer’s performance within the prostate is the door opener for dose-painting by numbers, which enables a <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> dose distribution to a voxel-level by mathematical transformations of the image information of individual voxels [3] [...].|$|E

Unfortunately, current medical techniques are unable to deduce clinically relevant information about tumor heterogeneity by means of non-invasive methods. As a consequence, when radiotherapy is used as a treatment of choice, radiation dosimetries are prescribed under the assumption that the malignancy targeted is of a homogeneous nature. In this work we discuss the effects of different radiation dose distributions on heterogeneous tumors by means of an individual cell-based model. To that end, a case is considered where two tumor cell phenotypes are present, which we assume to strongly differ in their respective cell cycle duration and radiosensitivity properties. We show herein that, as a result of such differences, the spatial distribution of the corresponding phenotypes, whence the resulting tumor heterogeneity can be predicted as growth proceeds. In particular, we show that if we start from a situation where a majority of ordinary cancer cells (CCs) and a minority of cancer stem cells (CSCs) are randomly distributed, and we assume that the length of CSC cycle is significantly longer than that of CCs, then CSCs become concentrated at an inner region as tumor grows. As a consequence we obtain that if CSCs are assumed to be more resistant to radiation than CCs, heterogeneous dosimetries can be selected to enhance tumor control by boosting radiation in the region occupied by the more radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. It is also shown that, when compared with homogeneous dose distributions as thosebeing currently delivered in clinical practice, such <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> dosimetries fare always better than theirhomogeneous counterparts. Finally, limitations to our assumptions and their resulting clinical implications will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Radioimmunotherapy for non-Hodgkin’s {{lymphoma}} often re-sults in surprisingly high {{response rates}} {{compared with those}} expected from estimated absorbed radiation doses. Several factors, including radiobiologic response, selective targeting, and <b>heterogeneous</b> absorbed <b>radiation</b> within the lymphoma, are likely {{to contribute to the}} lack of a dose–response relation-ship. This article investigates the impact of nodal regression on absorbed radiation dose and applies a correction factor to account for its effect. Methods: The radioactivity in and regres-sion of 37 superficial lymph nodes were measured in 7 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients treated with 775 – 3, 450 MBq/m 2 of 131 I-Lym- 1 monoclonal antibody. Nodal dimensions were measured with calipers and radioactivity was quantitated using gamma-camera imaging on multiple days after 131 I-Lym- 1 injec-tion. Both nodal regression and radioactivity were fit with mono...|$|R

40|$|The gamma-irradiation of 0. 8 mol dm- 3 aqueous, oxygen-free {{acetic acid}} {{solutions}} {{was investigated in}} {{the presence or absence}} of Na-montmorillonite. H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2, and several polycarboxylic acids were formed in all systems. The primary characteristics observed in the latter system were: (1) Higher yield of the decomposition of acetic acid; (2) Lower yield of the formation of polycarboxylic acids; (3) No effect on the formation of methane; (4) Higher yield of the formation of carbon dioxide; and (5) The reduction of Fe 3 + in the octahedral sites of Na-montmorillonite. A possible reaction scheme was proposed to account for the observed changes.

40|$|Because {{activities}} in space necessarily involve chronic {{exposure to a}} <b>heterogeneous</b> charged particle <b>radiation</b> field {{it is important to}} assess the influence of dose-rate and the possible modulating role of heavy particle fragmentation on biological systems. Using the well-studied cataract model, mice were exposed to plateau 600 MeV/amu Fe- 56 ions either as acute or fractionated exposures at total doses of 5 - 504 cGy. Additional groups of mice received 20, 360 and 504 cGy behind 50 mm of polyethylene, which simulates body shielding. The reference radiation consisted of Co- 60 gamma radiation. The animals were examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy over their three year life spans. In accordance with our previous observations with heavy particles, the cataractogenic potential of the 600 MeV/amu Fe- 56 ions was greater than for low-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation and increased with decreasing dose relative to gamma rays. Fractionation of a given dose of Fe- 56 ions did not reduce the cataractogenicity of the radiation compared to the acute regimen. Fragmentation of the beam in the polyethylene did not alter the cataractotoxicity of the ions, either when administered singly or in fractions...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{rationalize}} soot formation in two-phase combustion, the related dynamics can be conveniently studied in simpler systems. In the latest twenty years, experimental activity in drop towers {{and in the}} outer space have allowed to investigate the combustion of isolated droplets in microgravity conditions, i. e. spherically symmetric systems where buoyancy effects and slip velocity are absent, yet still containing the major phenomena affecting real combustion (unsteady evolution, convection, gas and soot <b>radiation,</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> properties and so on). In such conditions, it had been speculated [1] that {{a key role in}} soot formation is played by thermophoretic effect, because of which solid particles are transported towards the droplet surface, thus increasing their residence times in the fuel-rich area, where soot growth is kinetically favoured. The spherical symmetry also allows to numerically study these systems with a relatively low computational weight. The importance of thermophoresis in the dynamics of soot formation can thus be investigated in a variety of operating conditions (droplet size, pressure, composition, etc.), which {{is the subject of this}} work. Starting from a description of the constitutive parts of the isolated-droplet model, the transient dynamics of soot formation in n-heptane droplets is analysed. The impact of the submodel describing thermophoresis is considered in detail, and indications about its possible refinements are provided...|$|R
