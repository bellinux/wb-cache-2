500|$|During the Confessions Tour in 2006, Madonna {{sat down}} on the middle of the stage and {{performed}} an acoustic, stripped-down version of the song. She was joined by Yitzhak Sinwani of the London Kabbalah Centre, who had also been present earlier in the show for the performance of the song [...] "Isaac". Writing for Pitchfork Media, Stephen Deusner complimented Madonna's singing, saying that [...] " [...] she's got a deeper, heartier range that works best on ballads like 'Drowned World'". The song was not included on the NBC special, The Confessions Tour: Live from London, which aired on November 22, 2006, but it was present on the full-length DVD release. The track was performed on the London stop of the Rebel Heart Tour, on December 2, 2015, at The O2 Arena, in memory of Collins, who had <b>died</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The following year, it was included on the setlist of her [...] show in Melbourne, Australia. The show started with Madonna appearing onstage, in a clown's costume consisting of a billowing dress, pink and yellow stalkings, riding a tricycle and circled round it.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher, a fifteen-year-old {{boy with}} an autism {{spectrum}} condition, {{lives with his}} father, who has {{told him that his}} mother, Judy, <b>died</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The boy discovers the dead body of the neighbour's dog, Wellington, speared by a garden fork. Mrs Shears, the dog's owner, calls the police, and Christopher comes under suspicion. When a policeman touches him, he hits the policeman, and is arrested, then released with a police caution. He decides to investigate the dog's death, despite his father's orders to stay out of other people's business. He is severely limited by his fears and difficulties when interpreting the world around him. Throughout his adventures, Christopher records his experiences in a book, which he calls a [...] "murder mystery novel". During his investigation, Christopher meets people whom he has never before encountered, even though they live on the same street, including the elderly Mrs Alexander, who informs Christopher that his mother had an affair with Mr Shears and had been with him for a long time.|$|E

She had a hard life of it with Mr. Pryor, and she thought it was a punishment on her for running away. So she made Miranda promise she would never, for any reason whatever, do it.|$|E

60|$|Sara sighed again. She {{was only}} eighteen, {{but she felt}} very old. Willard was nineteen, and Willard {{had never had a}} chance to be young. His father had died when he was twelve, and he had run the farm since then, he and Sara {{together}} indeed, for Sara was a capital planner and manager and worker. The little mother had <b>died</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and the household cares had all fallen on Sara's shoulders since. Sometimes, as now, they pressed very heavily, but a talk with Willard always heartened her up. Willard had his blue spells too, but Sara thought it a special Providence that their blue turns never came together. When one got downhearted the other was always ready to do the cheering up.|$|E

You can {{understand}} that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion." ...|$|R

"That is Robert Gregory, my dear, {{the son of}} Mr. Gregory, the hop-factor, who <b>died</b> about <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> He {{was thought}} to have been a wealthy man, but he died worth next to nothing. It was {{supposed}} that this son of his--who is, I am told, one of the most idle and worthless young men in the country--squandered it all away. He was absent some years in London, and went on terribly there, and it is said that his poor old father was silly and weak enough to ruin himself paying the worthless fellow's debts. I am surprised to meet such a person in respectable society; but I suppose Mr. Harmer knew nothing about him, and only invited him as the son of a man who stood well in the town." ...|$|R

50|$|During {{an archaeological}} dig in Israel, American college student Stephen Cornelius Foxx discovers {{the remains of}} a man who {{seemingly}} <b>died</b> about <b>two</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Among the dead man's belongings is a small linen bag that holds the user manual for a digital video camera. Foxx and his mentor, Professor Wilford-Smith, later find out that this particular model will not be released by its producer, Sony, for another three years. Soon they begin to speculate that the dead man may have been a time traveller from the future, who went back in time to film a significant event two millennia ago—and of course, the most significant thing to film during that era was Jesus Christ.|$|R
40|$|In Newfoundland, {{the last}} Beothuk <b>died</b> nearly <b>two</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and both European {{settlers}} and Mi'kmaq have {{been blamed for}} their demise. This history is contentious, as {{is the way the}} demise of the Beothuk is represented in museums, literature and the arts, which may be regarded as public acts of remembering. Indigeneity debates here relate to other identity issues linked to resisting the subsumation of Newfoundland into Canada since confederation in 1949. Drawing on postcolonial literature studies, this chapter investigates how the theme of ‘unsettled natives’ – referring to both the subject (contemporary Newfoundlanders) and the object (Beothuk) – is portrayed in literature and art where the presence of the extinct Beothuk haunts the Newfoundland imaginary...|$|R

This book of his Collected Poems is welcome as a neccessary {{corrective}} to that. Gallery Books has recently enchanced its canon-making tendancy by publishing handsome "collecteds" of our senior contemporary poets: Derek Mahon, John Montague, Richard Murphy. The Hartnett volume appears posthumously, but such was not the intention when the book was planned by Hartnett himself and his editor and publisher Peter fallon. It was published at the time envisaged, which would have been Hartnett's sixtieth birthday. Circumstances have meant that this volume takes on a more definitive cast than it otherwise would have, and it is good to have such a span of Hartnett's poems, covering forty years, between a single set of covers...|$|R
