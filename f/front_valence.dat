50|$|A fauteuil {{is made of}} wood, and {{frequently}} with carved relief ornament. It is typically upholstered on the seat, the seat back and on the arms (manchettes). Some fauteuils have a <b>valenced</b> <b>front</b> seat rail which is padding that extends slightly over the apron. The exposed wooden elements are often gilded or otherwise painted.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear wing}} {{remained}} a controversial feature for several years. Its appearance was often criticized,and it {{was accused of}} forcing cars to become airborne in high-speed spins {{such as the one}} experienced by Carl Edwards during the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. In 2010 NASCAR decided to replace the wing with the original spoiler. The switch began with the 2010 Goody's Fast Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway.In 2011, NASCAR altered the nose of the car once more, with the splitter being reduced in size and the braces being replaced by a solid <b>front</b> <b>valence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When the Porsche 911 Turbo {{debuted in}} August 1974, with large, flared, rear spoilers, they were {{immediately}} dubbed whale tails. Designed to reduce rear-end lift and so keep the car from oversteering at high speeds, the rubber-edges {{of the whale}} tail spoilers {{were thought to be}} [...] "pedestrian friendly". The Turbo, with its whale tail was popular. It also became one of the world's most recognizable sports cars, remaining in production for the next two decades in one form or another, with more than 23,000 sold by 1989, although from 1978, the rear spoiler was redesigned and dubbed 'teatray' on account of its raised sides. The Porsche 911 whale tails were used in conjunction with a chin spoiler attached to the <b>front</b> <b>valence</b> panel, which, according to some sources, did not enhance aerodynamic stability. It {{has been found to be}} less effective in multiplying downforce than newer technologies like an airfoil, [...] "rear wing running across the base of the tailgate window", or [...] "an electronically controlled wing that deploys at about 50 mph". (80 km/h).|$|E
