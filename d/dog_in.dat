40|$|Histological lesions and the {{presence}} of Leishmania spp. amastigotes in claw tissues were investigated <b>in</b> 40 <b>dogs</b> with leishmaniosis, with (16 / 40 - group A) or without (24 / 40 - group B) generalized onychogryphosis. Following euthanasia, the entire third phalanx with intact claw was amputated, formalin fixed, decalcified in a formic acid solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned longitudinally and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and acid orcein-Giemsa. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of Leishmania amastigotes. Lichenoid mononuclear infiltration (all <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group A, 21 of 24 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group B), basal keratinocyte vacuolation (nine of 16 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group A, 15 of 24 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group B) and dermoepidermal clefting (13 of 16 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group A, 18 of 24 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group B) were the most prominent histopathological findings. There was no difference in the frequency and severity of these lesions between the two groups. Leishmania amastigotes could not be visualized in the dermis of any of the H&E sections, but their presence was demonstrated by nested PCR in three of 16 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group A and two of 24 <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group B. However, the frequency of positive nested PCRs was not significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, claw histopathology <b>in</b> symptomatic <b>dogs</b> with leishmaniosis, either with or without onychogryphosis is mainly characterized by mononuclear lichenoid dermatitis with or without interface dermatitis and dermoepidermal clefting, and is not accompanied by substantial local parasitism...|$|R

5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest <b>Dog</b> <b>in</b> the World.|$|E

40|$|Dogs (N = 108) in {{an animal}} shelter {{received}} {{one of four}} enrichment programs: twice daily walking alone (walking) or in combination with a daily fooddispensing toy (toy), a daily session of standardized human contact (petting), or daily obedience training (obedience). We evaluated the effects of enrichment on: a) cortisol concentrations intermittently sampled across approximately days 2 - 10 in the shelter; b) behavior during an in-shelter mock adoption session; c) adoptability; d) behaviors in the adoptive homes; and e) frequency of retention up to 6 months post-adoption. Within enrichment groups, blood cortisol concentrations did not change from approximately day 2 to day 6 of residence in the shelter, but decreased significantly from approximately day 6 to day 10 only <b>in</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the walking group. Among groups, changes in blood cortisol concentrations did not differ across sampling days. During an in-shelter mock adoption session, {{there were no differences}} among groups in attention-seeking behaviors, time sitting or lying, or time to approach the mock adopters. <b>Dogs</b> <b>in</b> the petting and obedience groups performed more ambivalent behaviors during the session on approximately days 9 - 10 of residence in the shelter than did <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the walking group. There were no differences <b>in</b> proportions of <b>dogs</b> adopted or on time to adoption among enrichment groups. However, more adopters of <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the toy and obedience groups selected their dogs because the dogs "did not bark" than did adopters of <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the walking group. At 1 month post-adoption, <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the obedience group displayed "hyperactive" behaviors more frequently than <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the walking and toy groups. Furthermore, <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the walking and petting groups displayed more annoying barking at 1 month post-adoption than <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the toy group. Seventeen percent of dogs were returned by 6 months post-adoption: four in the walking group, two in the toy group, one in the petting group, and four in the obedience group. The reasons for returning and the time to return did not vary among enrichment groups...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{epidemiological}} survey of Anaplasma platys {{was carried out}} in rural and urban areas of three distinct regions of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. EDTA blood samples were collected during the dry season from dogs living on farms with an attempt to resample the same <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent rainy season. Samples were also taken from <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> urban areas. DNA was extracted from blood samples for real time PCR. Risk factors, such as age, breed, sex, presence of ticks, and packed cell volume were analyzed. During the rainy season, the prevalence of infection by A. platys <b>in</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the rural areas was significantly higher (13. 9 %) than that observed <b>in</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the urban areas (5. 1 %). <b>Dogs</b> <b>in</b> the Nanuque region were 3. 74 times (p= 0. 001) more likely to be real-time PCR positive than <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> the other two studied regions. Dogs infested with ticks showed higher rates of positivity. The results showed that in rural areas of Minas Gerais A. platys infection is influenced by climatic conditions. In areas of higher temperature and higher humidity, transmission occurs during both the dry and rainy seasons, while in areas with lower temperature and humidity transmission occurs mainly during the dry season...|$|R
