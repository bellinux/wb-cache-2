5|$|All the <b>jewellery</b> in the hoard is gold, and all gold {{items in}} the hoard, other than coins, are <b>jewellery.</b> None of the <b>jewellery</b> is {{unequivocally}} masculine, although several pieces, like the rings, might have been worn by either gender. There is one body chain, six necklaces, three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold <b>jewellery</b> is about , and the average metal content of the <b>jewellery</b> pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 carat), with small proportions in the metal of silver and copper.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} from the Gem & <b>Jewellery</b> Export Promotional Council, {{synthetic}} diamonds accounted for 0.28% of diamond produced for use as gem stones in 2014. Lab diamond <b>jewellery</b> is sold in the United States by brands including Pure Grown Diamonds (formerly known as Gemesis) and Lab Diamonds Direct; and in the UK by Nightingale online jewellers.|$|E
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial <b>jewellery</b> is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the <b>jewellery</b> are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the <b>jewellery.</b>|$|E
5|$|A parure {{is a set}} of {{matching}} <b>jewellery</b> to be used together which first became popular in 17th-century Europe.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} <b>jewellery</b> or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the <b>jewellery</b> or the implanted tube into which the <b>jewellery</b> is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the <b>jewellery</b> to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the {{importance}} of iron's symbolic role may be found in the German Campaign of 1813. Frederick William III commissioned then the first Iron Cross as military decoration. Berlin iron <b>jewellery</b> reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver <b>jewellery</b> for military funding. The inscription Gold gab ich für Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.|$|E
5|$|Corals from seamounts {{are also}} vulnerable, {{as they are}} highly valued for making <b>jewellery</b> and {{decorative}} objects. Significant harvests have been produced from seamounts, often leaving coral beds depleted.|$|E
5|$|Glass beads for <b>jewellery</b> have {{traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's <b>jewellery</b> was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the <b>jewellery</b> of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|Its {{physical}} characteristics and chemical stability make it useful for industrial applications. Its {{resistance to wear}} and tarnish is well suited to use in fine <b>jewellery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manufacturing {{accounted}} for 8% of employment within Birmingham in 2012, a figure beneath {{the average for}} the UK as a whole. Major industrial plants within the city include Jaguar Land Rover in Castle Bromwich and Cadbury in Bournville, with large local producers also supporting a supply chain of precision-based small manufacturers and craft industries. More traditional industries also remain: 40% of the <b>jewellery</b> made in the UK is still produced by the 300 independent manufacturers of the city's <b>Jewellery</b> Quarter, continuing a trade first recorded in Birmingham in 1308.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in <b>jewellery,</b> usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. <b>Jewellery</b> trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels {{are only}} worn at coronations (StEdward's Crown {{being used to}} crown the monarch) and the annual State Opening of Parliament (the Imperial State Crown). At other formal occasions, such as banquets, the Queen wears the <b>jewellery</b> in her collection. Elizabeth owns more than 300 items of <b>jewellery,</b> {{including}} 98 brooches, 46 necklaces, 37 bracelets, 34 pairs of earrings, 15 rings, 14 watches and 5 pendants, the most notable of which are detailed in this article.|$|E
5|$|The ear {{has been}} adorned by {{earrings}} and other <b>jewellery</b> in numerous cultures {{for thousands of}} years, and {{has been subjected to}} surgical and cosmetic alterations.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial <b>jewellery</b> to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial <b>jewellery</b> to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. <b>Jewellery</b> is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the <b>jewellery</b> is left behind.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and <b>jewellery.</b> They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in <b>jewellery</b> as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost <b>jewellery</b> and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E
5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained <b>jewellery,</b> including a gold pendant, silver brooch, and glass beads. It is thought that the occupant may have had a close connection with the woman in the bed burial– perhaps a relative or a lady-in-waiting who was buried with her mistress.|$|E
5|$|According to 2006's Tattoos and Body Piercing, {{corporate}} dress codes {{can also}} strictly limit piercing displays. At that time, Starbucks limited piercings to two per ear and <b>jewellery</b> to small, matched earrings. Employees of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts were {{not permitted to}} display piercings at all.|$|E
5|$|All 29 {{items of}} gold <b>jewellery</b> were analysed, with silver and copper {{found to be}} present. Results were typical for Roman silver in hoards of the period, {{in terms of the}} {{presence}} of copper alloyed with the silver to harden it, and trace elements. One repaired bowl showed a mercury-based solder.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} <b>jewellery</b> {{should be}} hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of <b>jewellery</b> is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|Chandni Chowk, a 17th-century market, {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{shopping}} areas in Delhi for <b>jewellery</b> and Zari saris. Delhi's arts and crafts include, Zardozi an embroidery done with gold thread and Meenakarithe art of enamelling.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Kioe Lie and Houw Nio's {{marriage}} is failing. Owing to poor investments (some made with embezzled money), Houw Nio's gambling, and Kioe Lie's keeping of a mistress, {{they have lost}} their fortune. Kioe Lie tries to convince his wife to sell her <b>jewellery,</b> thus allowing him to return the stolen money. Houw Nio, however, refuses, tells him {{to sell the house}} and his mistress' <b>jewellery,</b> and then leaves. Soon afterwards, Kioe Lie's friend Tan Tiang An warns him that he will be arrested by the police unless he flees the colony. Together they rent a car and Kioe Lie heads for the port at Batavia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to painting and stained glass, Burne-Jones {{worked in a}} variety of crafts; including designing ceramic tiles, <b>jewellery,</b> tapestries, mosaics and book illustration, most famously designing woodcuts for the Kelmscott Press's Chaucer in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong is well {{renowned for}} its cheese, noodles and lollipops. Kalimpong exports {{a wide range of}} {{traditional}} handicrafts, wood-carvings, embroidered items, bags and purses with tapestry work, copper ware, scrolls, Tibetan <b>jewellery</b> and artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} do {{not believe}} that Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavych, whose Christian name was Demetrius, first built the Saint Demetrius's Monastery and Church in the Uppertown of Kiev near Saint Sophia Cathedral in the 1050s. Half a century later, his son, Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych, is recorded as commissioning a monastery church (1108–1113) dedicated to his own patron saint, Michael the Archangel. One reason for building the church may have been Svyatopolk's recent victory over the nomadic Polovtsians, as Michael the Archangel was considered a patron of warriors and victories. In 1906, a medieval hoard of silver and gold <b>jewellery</b> was discovered in a metal casket on Trekhsvyatytelska Street (Street of the Three Saints), opposite the gates of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. Gold <b>jewellery</b> from the hoard is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York while the silver <b>jewellery</b> and two ingots are in the British Museum, London. The hoard is dated to the 11th-12th centuries and was probably hidden {{at the time of the}} Tartar invasions and the Sack of Kiev in 1240.|$|E
5|$|The dermal punch: A dermal punch is used {{to remove}} a {{circular}} area of tissue, into which <b>jewellery</b> is placed, and may be useful for larger cartilage piercings. They are popular for use in ears, though not legal for use by nonmedical personnel {{in some parts of}} the United States.|$|E
5|$|The <b>jewellery</b> {{consists}} of three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of <b>jewellery,</b> as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|The medalet {{is part of}} {{the only}} late-6th or early-7th century find of gold <b>jewellery</b> in a grave in a churchyard. All of the coins in the hoard were {{probably}} part of a necklace that was buried in a woman's grave. The medalet itself is the earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon coin.|$|E
5|$|To {{raise the}} funds for ships and weaponry, Monmouth pawned many of his belongings. His wife Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, and her mother also pawned their <b>jewellery</b> to hire the Dutch warship Helderenberg.|$|E
5|$|Wasps {{have been}} {{modelled}} in <b>jewellery</b> {{since at least}} the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings. A fashion for wasp waisted female silhouettes with sharply cinched waistlines emphasizing the wearer's hips and bust arose repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Well-to-do men {{wore the}} Petha or Kulavi, a tall turban made of silk and {{decorated}} with gold. As in most Indian societies, <b>jewellery</b> was used {{by men and women}} and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk or sandalwood. In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine <b>jewellery,</b> their daily duties being light.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{made her}} Broadway {{debut in the}} revival of Cabaret, {{in the role of}} Sally Bowles. The {{production}} opened on April 24, 2014 and she ended her run on November 9, 2014. Also in 2014, she became the face of Louis Vuitton <b>Jewellery</b> collection.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, <b>jewellery</b> and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} robbery attempt, Mauboussin's <b>jewellery</b> firm opened a branch in New York City on 1 October 1929, {{only to be}} met by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{at the end of}} October. To {{compound}} matters, the same gang of international robbers tried to steal the Nassak Diamond again in May 1930, but once again missed it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} of August begins, special stalls, fun fairs and shops are set up across {{the country for the}} sale of {{national}} flags, buntings, banners and posters, badges, pictures of national heroes, multimedia and other celebratory items. Vehicles, private buildings, homes, and streets are decorated with national flags, candles, oil lamps, pennants and buntings. Businesses engage in rigorous marketing, as do leading designer fashion outlets which stock independence-themed clothing, <b>jewellery</b> and self-adornments.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{architecture}} of the European countries at the Mediterranean Sea, the 1979 planning report for the park suggested it would be home to a shirt and sweater store with the option for screen printed customization, a shop of hats featuring Hanna Barbera characters, a magic and novelty shop, and a store of Mediterranean decorative gifts and <b>jewellery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Birmingham Museums Trust runs other {{museums in}} the city {{including}} Aston Hall, Blakesley Hall, the Museum of the <b>Jewellery</b> Quarter, Soho House and Sarehole Mill. The Birmingham Back to Backs are the last surviving court of back-to-back houses {{in the city}}. Cadbury World is a museum showing visitors the stages and steps of chocolate production {{and the history of}} chocolate and the company. The Ikon Gallery hosts displays of contemporary art, as does Eastside Projects.|$|E
