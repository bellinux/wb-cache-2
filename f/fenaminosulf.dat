40|$|The {{percentage}} of azygospores of Gigaspora margarita with zoosporangia of chytridiaceous fungi (CF) was reduced significantly after agitating them in <b>fenaminosulf</b> before incubation in soil. <b>Fenaminosulf</b> {{did not affect}} zoosporangia development on chlamydospores of Glomus fasciculatum. Metalaxyl and ethazol were not effective against CF on spores of either mycorrhizal fungus. Azygospores of G. margarita were treated with <b>fenaminosulf</b> and used as the inoculum for pot cultures. After 19 weeks, the {{percentage of}} azygospores containing CF was reduced significantly by this treatment, whereas root colonization and sporulation by the mycorrhizal fungus were unaffected. Pot cultures of G. margarita, either drenched with <b>fenaminosulf</b> or not, {{did not differ in}} the percentage of azygospores containing CF. However, root colonization and sporulation by the mycorrhizal fungus was temporarily delayed when pots were drenched with <b>fenaminosulf...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Microbial {{transformation}} of N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine (DMPDA), a microbial product formed from the fungicide <b>fenaminosulf</b> (p-dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate) was studied by enriching microbes in soils {{treated with the}} amine. Microorganisms isolated from DMPDA-treated soil belonged to the genera of Micrococcus, Alcaligenes, and Corynebacterium. Of the various isolates, Alcaligenes DM 4 showed maximal growth on DMPDA utilizing it as sources of carbon and nitrogen. When grown in mineral salts basal medium containing 0. 05 % DMPDA to serve as carbon and nitrogen sources, Alcaligenes DM 4 grew exponentially up to 18 h. Even though the characterization of the complete pathway of microbial degradation of DMPDA could not be carried out due to the auto-oxidation of the compound, the initial transformation product of DMPDA by Alcaligenes DM 4 {{has been identified as}} a dimer. The dimer is generated into the culture medium presumably by the extra-cellular oxidase of Alcaligenes DM 4. It is suggested that the risk-benefit evaluation on the use of <b>fenaminosulf</b> is to be made taking into consideration the microbial transformations of the fungicide...|$|E
40|$|The {{carcinogenicity}} of the fungicide <b>fenaminosulf</b> (I) [140 - 56 - 7] {{and one of}} its bacterial metabolites dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPDA) [99 - 98 - 9] {{was evaluated}} in rats. Over 17 mo, rats fed with 250 mg of the compound/kg of feed (in {{the presence or absence of}} nitrite) did not develop tumors. Phenols were detected in the urine and feces of rats receiving either I or DMPDA suggesting possible detoxification of these compound...|$|E
40|$|Numerous turf {{fungicides}} {{were tested}} {{under various conditions}} for possible deleterious effects upon the earthworm Eisenla foetida. Earthworms treated by immersion for one minute in 0. 1 % solutions of 10 different fungicides died insignificant numbers after benomyl and thiophanate methyl treatments. After 1 % fungicide treatments, there was significant mortality from benomyl, ethazole, Kromad, and thiophanate methyl fungicides. With 2 % fungicide solutions, significant numbers died after benomyl, cadmium succinate, ethazole, thiophanate methyl, and thiram treatments. Earthworms fed bermudagrass clippings treated with 10 different fungicides showed {{a significant decrease in}} longevity from clippings treated with benomyl, dinocap, ethazole, and thiophanate methyl. Earthworms reared for 84 days in soil treated with 15 different turf fungicides showed a significant decrease in longevity from soil treated with aniyaline, benomyl, chlorothalonil, Duoson, ethazole, <b>fenaminosulf,</b> Kromad, mancozeb, PCNB, thiabendazole, thiophanate methyl, and thiram. Cadmium succinate, dinocap, and RP 26019 did not cause a decrease in longevity. There was no reproduction by worms in soil treated with Duosan, PCNB, thiophanate methyl, and thiram, and only trace amounts in soil treated with chlorothalonil, ethazole, and Kromad. The toxicity of benomyl, thiabendazole, and thiophanate methyl to earthworms was confirmed in the present study, and additional fungicides used for turf disease control were also found to cause significant amounts of mortality...|$|E
