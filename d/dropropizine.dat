50|$|Levodropropizine is a cough suppressant. It is the levo isomer of <b>dropropizine.</b> It {{acts as a}} {{peripheral}} antitussive, with no action in the central nervous system. It does not cause side effects such as constipation or respiratory depression which can be produced by opioid antitussives such as codeine and its derivatives.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{antitussive}} activity of the ethanolic extract of Paederia foetida (P. foetida) in conscious cats by mechanical stimulation of laryngopharyngeal (LP) and tracheobronchial (TB) mucous areas of airways. The results showed that the ethanolic extract of P. foetida at the oral dose of 200 mg·kg- 1 b. w. had a cough-suppressive effect. It caused a significant (p < 0. 05) decrease of the number of cough efforts (NE) and frequency of cough (NE. min- 1) from both LP and TB areas. The intensity of a cough attack was significantly decreased only during inspirium (IA-). Also a significant (p < 0. 05) decrease was observed of the intensity of maximal effort in expirium (IME+) from TB area and inspirium (IME-) from both LP and TB areas. The antitussive activity of the ethanolic extract of P. foetida was lower than that of the classical narcotic antitussive drug- codeine, but similar to that of the non-narcotic antitussive agent <b>dropropizine.</b> The antitussive activity of the ethanolic extract of P. foetida may be connected with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity.

40|$|Different {{plants have}} been {{reported}} {{to be a source of}} polysaccharides that possess a great variety of biological activities, including cough suppression. The experiments were aimed on the influence of two polysaccharides isolated from the gel (A, HF 1 -Z) and one from the epidermis (SL- 1) of Aloe vera leaves, characterized by chemical composition and structural properties, on the cough reflex. The method of mechanically induced cough was used in conscious cats. A nylon fibre directed individually into the mucous area of the laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial airways via endotracheal cannula elicited the cough reflex. Statistical evaluation registered cough reflex indicators (number of cough efforts- NE, cough frequency – NE·min– 1 intensity of cough attacks during expiration and inspiration- IA+ and IA-, intensity of maximal inspiratory and expiratory cough efforts- IME- and IME+) showed that gel polysaccharide HF 1 -Z possessed higher cough-suppressing activity than <b>dropropizine,</b> a non-narcotic peripheral cough suppressant. Their antitussive activity was accompanied mainly with a decrease of NE, IA+ and IA- from both laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial mucous area...|$|E
40|$|To a large extent, organic {{building}} blocks are today obtained from petroleum-based products. From an environmental point of view, biomass-derived compounds are more sustainable alternatives to such oil-derived molecules. The 12 principles of green chemistry describe how chemical processes {{can be improved}} in terms of sustainability. With some of these principles as guidelines, this thesis considers the upgrading of renewable glycerol- and amino acid-derived compounds using two different atom economic catalytic reactions: the hydrogen borrowing reaction, and the ruthenium-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction. First, the glycerol derivatives solketal and 1, 3 -propanediol were investigated as starting materials in organic transformations using hydrogen borrowing methodology. Solketal was aminated {{with a set of}} secondary amines as well as sterically hindered primary amines, yielding the corresponding amino glycerol derivatives in good to excellent yields, using [Ru(p -cymene) Cl 2] 2 as the catalyst. Deprotection of the acetal gave the free amino diol, and this reaction sequence was used to synthesise the antitussive agent <b>dropropizine</b> in two steps from solketal. Furthermore, the iridium-catalysed α-alkylation of acetophenone with 1, 3 -propanediol was investigated. A mixture of products was obtained in moderate yields when using [Ir(cod) Cl] 2 as the catalyst, while the selectivity could be improved by instead utilising an iridium-carbene complex as the catalyst. Hydrogen transfer methodology was also employed in the synthesis of chromanone scaffolds from 2 ’-hydroxyacetophenone and an alcohol. Brief mechanistic insight was gained considering the two reaction types via deuterium-labelling experiments and computational techniques, respectively. In addition, chiral triazole δ-amino acids were constructed via a RuAAC reaction for the construction of foldamers. Eight chiral triazoles were synthesized in good yields. Computational conformational studies revealed that the synthesised monomers had several low energy conformations that could be part of a well-defined three-dimensional foldameric structure. Finally, the RuAAC reaction was used in combination with a hydrogen borrowing cyclisation reaction for the construction of 1, 5 -fused triazole piperazines from a simple amino acid derived azide. A set of 14 different triazoles were synthesised in moderate to excellent yields, and 7 of these triazoles were successfully cyclised to give the desired 1, 5 -fused triazoles in two steps...|$|E
