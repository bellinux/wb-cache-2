40|$|<b>The</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> organic grown cereals {{has increased}} the need for variety tests under organic <b>growing</b> systems and/or <b>the</b> knowledge on whether growth characteristics describe yield differently under conventional and organic conditions. This paper is a contribution to that question by examining the relationships between some important growth characteristics in barley trials in both systems in Northern Sweden and in Denmark. Mixed model analyses were used for regressions of growth characteristics (or transformations of those) on yield (and log-transformed yield), allowing the slope to depend on <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> system. <b>The</b> analyses showed that diseases {{seemed to have a}} less negative effect on yield <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organic <b>growing</b> system than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>growing</b> system if pesticides were not applied. For other characteristics the effect depended on the country. This was the case for grain characteristics where the effect of volume weight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish trials was much larger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>growing</b> system than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organic <b>growing</b> system, while a non-significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction was found for the trails from Denmark. For the trials from Denmark the effect of grain weight was much larger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organic <b>growing</b> system than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>growing</b> system, but there was only a small and non-significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish trials. <b>In</b> both countries there was a significant interaction between the two grain characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a quid pro quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden.

Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases.

40|$|Since late 1970 s, {{climate warming}} {{has been widely}} recognized. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Midwest, farmers cannot rely on the normal {{calendar}} anymore, {{and it has become}} critically necessary to evaluate the most recent climate trends relative to growing season in order to conduct adaptation efforts for agriculture. Based on the homogenized historical monthly temperature and precipitation records during the period of 1980 – 2013 from 302 observing stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 Midwestern US states, we investigate the climate trends on four timescales: monthly, early growing season, late <b>growing</b> season, and <b>the</b> entire <b>growing</b> season. <b>The</b> climate metrics include maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, diurnal temperature range, and precipitation. Nonparametric Sen’s Slope together with the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test is used to estimate the decadal trend and to detect the statistical significance. The results show that growing season average temperature has increased at a rate of 0. 15 °C decade– 1 over the Midwest United States. Within <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season, minimum temperature is increasing faster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>growing</b> season, especially in June, while maximum temperature is increasing faster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>growing</b> season, especially in September.
