500|$|In Chapter III, Darwin {{asks how}} {{varieties}} [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> incipient species" [...] become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls [...] "natural selection"; {{in the fifth}} edition he adds, [...] "But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." ...|$|E

500|$|Strontium {{is named}} after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic Sròn an t-Sìthein), where it was {{discovered}} in the ores of the lead mines. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged {{in the preparation of}} barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other [...] "heavy spars" [...] sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 [...] "...it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined." [...] The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also {{came to the conclusion that}} it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name [...] strontites. [...] He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: [...] "...Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion." [...] The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly's {{document}} was first called the [...] "Jerilderie Letter" [...] by author Max Brown in his 1948 biography of Kelly called Australian Son.

2500|$|... “This {{work has}} also a second object in view: It seeks to explain certain obscure figures which {{occur in the}} Prophets, and are not {{distinctly}} characterized as being figures. Ignorant and superficial readers take them in a literal, not in a figurative sense. Even well informed persons are bewildered if they understand these passages in their literal signification, but they are entirely relieved of their perplexity when we explain the figure, or merely suggest that the terms are figurative. For this reason <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> this book Guide for the Perplexed”.|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> it an {{artificial}} famine: {{that is to}} say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a [...] "dispensation of Providence;" [...] and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.|$|E

In Rabbinic literature, [...] "secular knowledge" [...] is usually referred to as chokhmah [...] The first book in Maimonides' compendium of Halakha, the Mishneh Torah, is entitled [...] "Madda" [...] - there, though, the term refers to knowledge of the fundamentals of Judaism.

Duckworth defeated former Deputy Treasurer of Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi for the Democratic nomination on March 20, 2012, then faced incumbent Republican Joe Walsh in the general election. Duckworth received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald. Walsh generated controversy when in July 2012, at a campaign event, he accused Duckworth of politicizing her military service and injuries, saying [...] "my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, {{the men and women}} who served us, it's the last thing in the world they talk about."

2500|$|Commenting on {{this first}} edition of The United Irishman, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, {{maintained}} that the paper pursued [...] "the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty's subjects in Ireland... it is language used in no common way, {{and for this reason}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the attention of her Majesty's Government to it. This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper—it is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being {{to do everything possible to}} drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. I hope, my Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|E
2500|$|From 1975, Professor Pocock began {{advocating the}} {{development}} of a new subject which he called [...] "British History" [...] (also labelled [...] "New British History", a title that Pocock has expressed his wish to shake off). Pocock coined the term Atlantic archipelago as a replacement for British Isles: [...] "We should start with what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the Atlantic archipelago—since the term [...] "British Isles" [...] is one which Irishmen reject and Englishmen decline to take quite seriously". He also pressed his fellow historians to reconsider two issues linked to the future of British history. First, he urged historians of the British Isles to move away from histories of the Three Kingdoms (Scotland, Ireland, England) as separate entities, and he called for studies implementing a bringing-together or conflation of the national narratives into truly integrated enterprises. It has since become the commonplace preference of historians to treat British history in just that fashion. Second, he prodded policymakers to reconsider the Europeanisation of the UK still underway, via its entry into the European Union. In its abandonment of a major portion of national sovereignty purely from economic motives, that decision threw into question the entire matter of British sovereignty itself. What, Pocock asks, will (and must) nations look like if the capacity for and exercise of national self-determination is put up for sale to the highest bidder? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} 'the classic' was {{a theme of}} [...] T.S. Eliot's {{literary}} criticism as well. [...] In The Sacred Wood he thought {{that one of the}} reasons [...] "Dante is a classic, and Blake only a poet of genius was [...] "because of [...] "the concentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy". [...] (In commenting about Eliot's influence, Professor Jan Gorak stated that [...] "the idea of a canon has become intertwined with the idea of the classic, an idea that T.S. Eliot tried to revitalize for the 'modern experiment'".) [...] In echoes of Sainte-Beuve, Eliot gave a speech to the Virgil Society concerning himself with the very same question of [...] "What is a Classic?" [...] In his opinion, there was only one author who was 'classic': [...] "No modern language can hope to produce a classic, in the sense <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> Virgil a classic. [...] Our classic, the classic of all Europe, is Virgil." [...] In this instance, though, Eliot said that the word had different meanings in different surroundings and that his concern was with [...] "one meaning in one context". [...] He states his focus is to define only [...] "one kind of art" [...] and that it does not have to be [...] "better...than another kind". [...] His opening paragraph makes a clear distinction between his particular meaning of classic having Virgil as the classic of all literature and the alternate meaning of classic as [...] "a standard author".|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Isaac deduced from [...] that we {{must not}} appoint a leader over a {{community}} without first consulting the community. In [...] Moses said to the Israelites: [...] "See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri."

God told Moses nonetheless to go and consult the Israelites. Moses asked the Israelites whether they considered Bezalel suitable. And they replied that if God and Moses considered him suitable, surely they had to, as well. Rabbi Johanan taught that God proclaims three things for God's Self: famine, plenty, and a good leader. 2 Kings [...] shows that God proclaims famine, when it says: [...] "The Lord {{has called for a}} famine."

[...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that Bezalel ( [...] , whose name can be read , betzel El, [...] "in the shadow of God") was so called because of his wisdom. When God told Moses (in [...] ) to tell Bezalel to make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels, Moses reversed the order and told Bezalel to make an ark, vessels, and a tabernacle. Bezalel replied to Moses that as a rule, one first builds a house and then brings vessels into it, but Moses directed to make an ark, vessels, and a tabernacle. Bezalel asked where he would put the vessels. And Bezalel asked whether God had told Moses to make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels. Moses replied that perhaps Bezalel had been in the shadow of God ( [...] , betzel El) and had thus come to know this.|$|E
