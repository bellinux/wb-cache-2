40|$|This note {{argues that}} a {{representation}} of the epistemic state of the individual through a non-additive measure provides a novel account of Keynes’s view of probability theory proposed in his Treatise on Probability. The paper shows, first, that Keynes’s “non-numerical probabilities” can be interpreted in terms of decisional weights and <b>distorsions</b> <b>of</b> the probability priors. Second, that the degree of non-additivity of the probability measure can account for the confidence in the assessment without any reference to a second order probability. And, third, that the criterion for decision making under uncertainty derived in the non-additive literature incorporates a measure of the degree of confidence in the probability assessment. The paper emphasises the Keynesian derivation of Ellsberg’s analysis: the parallel between Keynes and Ellsberg is deemed to be significant since Ellsberg’s insights represent the main starting point of the modern developments of decision theory under uncertainty and ambiguity. uncertainty, probabilities, Keynes. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{believed}} that the geo-dynamo of the Earth or more generally of other planets, is created by the convective fluid motions inside their molten cores.

We show in particular that an imposed magnetic field is distorted by the spin- over mode generated by the elliptical instability. In our experiment, the field is weak (20 Gauss) and the Lorenz force is negligible compared to the inertial forces, therefore the magnetic field does not modify the fluid flow and the pure hydrodynamics growth rates of the instability are recovered through magnetic measurements...|$|R

XRD data, thermogravimetric and dilatometric analyses associated with Young's modulus measurements give {{a better understanding}} and a qualitative description of the mechanical behaviour of the perovskite materials {{as a function of}} temperature. First, a decrease of Young's modulus from room temperature to 300 - 400 ◦C is attributed to FeO 6 octahedrons <b>distorsions</b> <b>of</b> the monoclinic (or orthorhombic) phase. After phase transition, the rhombohedral phase exhibits a higher TEC and a stiffening of the perovskite structure probably due to less distorted FeO 6 octahedrons. Finally, at higher temperatures (T > 800 ◦C), thermogravimetric data show a weight loss attributed to oxygen departure from the perovskite structure leading to a large cell expansion.

40|$|Abstract. Nonintrusive {{measurements}} of the streamwise velocity in turbulent round jets in air are performed by recording short-time displacements and <b>distorsions</b> <b>of</b> very thin tagging lines written spanwise into the flow. The lines are written by Raman Exciting oxygen molecules and are interrogated by Laser Induced Electronic Fluorescence (RELIEF). This gives access to the spatial structure of transverse velocity increments without recourse to the Taylor hypothesis. The resolution is around 25 μm, less than twice the Kolmogorov scale η for the experiments performed (with R_λ≈ 360 - 600). The technique is validated by comparison with results obtained from other techniques for lon-gitudinal or transverse structure functions up to order eight. The agreement {{is consistent with the}} estimated errors–a few percents on exponents determined by Extended-Self-Similarity–and indicates significant departures from Kolmogorov 1941 scaling. Probability distribution functions of transverse velocity increments u over separations down to 1. @η are reported for the first time. Violent events, with u comparable to the rms turbulent velocity fluctuation, are found to take place with statistically significant probabilities. The shapes of the corresponding lines suggest the effect of intense slender vortex filaments. 1...|$|R

I offer it to those enthusiastic admirers of Wagner {{who are unable to}} follow his ideas, and do not in the least understand the dilemma of Wotan, though they are filled with indignation at the irreverence of the Philistines who frankly avow that they find the remarks of the god too often tedious and nonsensical. Now to be devoted to Wagner merely as a dog is devoted to his master, sharing a few elementary ideas, appetites and emotions with him, and, for the rest, reverencing his superiority without understanding it, is no true Wagnerism. Yet nothing better is possible without a stock of ideas common to master and disciple. Unfortunately, the ideas of the revolutionary Wagner of 1848 are taught neither by the education nor the experience of English and American gentlemen-amateurs, who are almost always political mugwumps, and hardly ever associate with revolutionists. The earlier attempts to translate his numerous pamphlets and essays into English, resulted in ludicrous mixtures of pure nonsense with the absurdest <b>distorsions</b> <b>of</b> his ideas into the ideas of the translators.
