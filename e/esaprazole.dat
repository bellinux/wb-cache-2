40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>esaprazole</b> on gastric {{secretion}} (volume, pepsin and acid output) were investigated on animal models, both in vivo and in vitro. In conscious rats whose vagal activity was stimulated by pylorus ligation, <b>esaprazole</b> decreased volume, acid output and pepsin secretion. In anaesthetized stomach-perfused rats, <b>esaprazole</b> inhibited gastric acid secretion evoked by both vagus nerve stimulation or bethanechol infusion. By contrast, on isolated guinea-pig gastric fundus, <b>esaprazole</b> failed {{to counteract the}} acid output stimulated by histamine, bethanechol or pentagastrin. In addition to this, phasic contractions evoked by acetylcholine on isolated guinea-pig ileum were antagonized by <b>esaprazole</b> only at high concentrations. The present {{results suggest that the}} inhibitory actions of <b>esaprazole</b> on secretory parameters involve the cholinergic parasympathetic pathway, probably through both direct and indirect mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>esaprazole,</b> a novel antiulcer drug, on gastric acid {{secretion}} and plasma gastrin levels were investigated in dogs {{provided with a}} gastric fistula or Heidenhain pouch. <b>Esaprazole</b> affected in a different extent the tests performed on dogs with a gastric fistula. The greatest inhibitory effect was obtained against 2 -deoxy-D-glucose-induced acid output and gastrin release. An intermediate inhibition by <b>esaprazole</b> was detected on bethanechol-evoked secretion, and the lowest activity was found versus histamine-stimulated secretion. All these responses were strongly inhibited by the antimuscarinic drug pirenzepine used as reference drug. Moreover, both <b>esaprazole</b> and pirenzepine prevented the acid secretory response to a test meal in dogs with a Heidenhain pouch, without significantly affecting plasma gastrin levels. The present {{results suggest that the}} depressant action of <b>esaprazole</b> on gastric secretion depends on its peripheral anticholinergic activity, consisting of a partial blockade of acid output and a main reduction of vagally mediated gastrin release. On the basis of these findings, the antiulcer activity of <b>esaprazole</b> might be in part ascribed to its inhibitory effects on gastric secretion...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of <b>Esaprazole,</b> a new antiulcer drug, on acid, peptic and {{alkaline}} secretion a modified gastric acid test was performed in 18 duodenal ulcer patients. Pentagastrin was administered as bolus 30 ' and 75 ' after {{the beginning of the}} test, followed by <b>Esaprazole</b> 300 mg i. v. at 90 ', Gastric juice was collected every 15 ' for determination of: total volume, volume of non parietal secretion, acid, bicarbonate and pepsin output. Serum pepsinogen group I was determined by radioimmunoassay. <b>Esaprazole</b> had a significant inhibitory effect on the total volume of gastric secretion and on volume of non parietal secretion. Pepsin output and serum pepsinogen group I were not affected by <b>Esaprazole,</b> while bicarbonate secretion was reduced. Antiulcer activity of <b>Esaprazole</b> seems to be due to the reduction of total volume of gastric secretion...|$|E
