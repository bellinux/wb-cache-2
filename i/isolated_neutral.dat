50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of the system is}} that it does not require a neutral to eliminate the earth-fault current. Therefore, the VSS has been implemented especially in networks which were operated with <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral.</b> During an earth fault in the network, the system eliminates earth-fault current. The function is in principle similar to an arc-suppression coil. In comparison to the arc-suppression coil, VSS eliminates earth-fault current more efficiently, even in unbalanced or extremely unbalanced networks.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the energy}} formula of Rydberg series {{is a result}} of hydrogen-like atom structure, Rydberg states are also present in molecules. Wave {{functions}} of high Rydberg states are very diffused and span diameters that approach infinity. As a result, any <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral</b> molecule behaves like hydrogen-like atoms at the Rydberg limit. For molecules with multiple stable monovalent cations, multiple Rydberg series may exist. Because of the complexity of molecular spectra, low-lying Rydberg states of molecules are often mixed with valence states with similar energy and are thus not pure Rydberg states.|$|E

In the past, {{it was necessary to}} operate such networks with an <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral,</b> solid grounding or with a significantly untuned arc-suppression coil. VSS can also substitute for an arc-suppression coil or it can complement it parallelly.

In a TN-C system, they would also be very vulnerable to unwanted triggering from contact between earth conductors of circuits on different RCDs or with real ground, thus making their use impracticable. Also, RCDs usually <b>isolate</b> the <b>neutral</b> core. Since it is unsafe to do this in a TN-C system, RCDs on TN-C should be wired to only interrupt the line conductor.|$|R

5|$|These data clearly {{indicate}} {{the stability of}} neutral ferrocene and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating {{that it is more}} readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier polarographic investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral pH showed a cathodic wave peak at −1.53V (versus SCE) at the dropping mercury electrode, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to <b>isolate</b> the <b>neutral</b> product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated pH. These data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{grounding}} methods for distribution systems and the characteristics and behavior of earth fault currents. At First different existing grounding methods such as <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral,</b> solidly grounded, Resonant grounding, low and high impedance groundings are introduced. Secondly, focus is placed on further describing these methods and the viability {{of each of these}} methods in different scenarios. Then these methods are further analyzed by using equivalent circuit designs. Using the equivalent circuit helps to derive the formulations and equations. It is shown that the designing of these systems in fact follows basic electrical properties such as voltage dividing and current dividing principles. The derived equations are further tested experimentally to prove the characteristics and behavior of these methods. Finally, the report is concluded by testing some of these methods (<b>isolated</b> <b>neutral</b> and grounding via resistor methods) in the laboratory and the results obtained are analyzed with the theoretical results to determine the characteristics and behavior of these methods. In this manner it is shown experimentally that in case of <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral</b> systems the summation of currents through all the phases (current flow through the line model) is zero when there is no earth fault. In case of an earth fault occurring across one of the phases the neutral-to-ground voltage becomes equal to the voltage across the faulted phase and also the sum of currents passing through the healthy phases is equal to the current flowing through the faulted phase. This phenomenon is proved in the second experiment. The third experiment proves the relation between the earth fault current and current via the resistor and the currents via the healthy phases whereby it is shown that the fault current is equal to the root square summation of currents of resistor and healthy phases. This is one of the characteristics of grounded via resistor system. The next experimental setup also {{focuses on the}} characteristics of grounded via resistor system whereby it is shown that the fault current and the total phase current are independent of any external load. The last experiment proves the phenomenon that phase-to-phase voltage remains intact during times of earth fault and the system continues the operation uninterrupted as it should be in case of <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral</b> grounding system...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogenous {{disinfection}} byproducts (N-DBPs) such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs) {{are formed}} during water chlorination. Preozonation is sometimes applied to control trihalomethane (THM) formation, {{but this may}} risk promoting the formation of HNMs and HANs. The role of ozone {{in the formation of}} HANs and HNMs in natural waters remains unclear. The nitrogen sources involved in HAN and HNM formation during the chloramination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with and without preozonation were evaluated using N- 15 -labeled monochloramine. The origin of the nitrogen involved in HAN formation was found to depend on the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen. In nitrogen-rich solutions HAN nitrogen was mainly from DOM constituents. The formation of IN-labeled dichloroacetontrile (DCAN) accounted for approximately 30 % of the DCAN produced from all hydrophilic acidic and <b>neutral</b> <b>isolates,</b> which have low carbon to nitrogen ratios, while it reached over 50 % for the hydrophobic acidic, basic, and <b>neutral</b> <b>isolates</b> with high carbon to nitrogen ratios. Unlabeled trichloronitromethane (TCNM) accounted for over 90 % of the total TCNM produced from most of the isolates. The remaining less than 10 % of the TCNM was probably generated through an aldehyde pathway. Preozonation reduced DCAN but enhanced the yield of TCNM.
