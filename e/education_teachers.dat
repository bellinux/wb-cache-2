25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience sexual harassment in school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their words and actions, and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> special <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education. In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities. This law was very important for Mexico education, however, {{there have been}} issues in implementing it {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E
500|$|Using a large cast of characters—a wide {{assortment}} of personalities and cultures—allows Lat {{to comment on}} {{a wider range of}} topics than is possible {{with a small group of}} characters. [...] Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Muhamood commented that the humour in Lat's cartoons is evoked through graphical and textual means; [...] "short, compact dialogues" [...] and puns form the text while [...] "facial expressions and actions" [...] of the characters help to bring out the funny side of things. [...] Muliyadi further stated that Lat's works offer many levels of interpretation; one reader would laugh at Lat's cartoon for its slapstick, while another would find the same work hilarious for its subtle critique of society. [...] As an example, Muliyadi referred to a Keluarga Si Mamat strip published in 1972. [...] Malaysia was facing a shortage of qualified physical <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> then, and such duties were often placed on the shoulders of teachers of other faculties. [...] Lat illustrated an obese teacher who conducted a physical education session to his eventual collapse. [...] Muliyadi suggested that the cartoon could be interpreted as a simple tease of the teacher's plight, a suggestion to examine the curriculum taught (change physical education to an informal session), a remark on the shortage of teachers, or more extremely, a criticism of the government's failure to prevent the situation from happening.|$|E
