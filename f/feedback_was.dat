25|$|Several studies over {{recent decades}} {{have looked at}} the neural {{mechanisms}} underlying birdsong learning by performing lesions to relevant brain structures involved in the production or maintenance of song or by deafening birds before and/or after song crystallization. Another recent experimental approach was recording the bird's song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed auditory feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable). After Nordeen & Nordeen made a landmark discovery as they demonstrated that auditory <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> necessary for the maintenance of song in adult birds with crystallized song, Leonardo & Konishi (1999) designed an auditory feedback perturbation protocol in order to explore the role of auditory feedback in adult song maintenance further, to investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure to perturbed auditory feedback, and to examine the degree to which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure. This study offered further support for role of auditory feedback in maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance of crystallized birdsong is dynamic rather than static.|$|E

40|$|<b>Feedback</b> <b>is</b> a {{commonly}} used concept in today’s society, {{as well as}} a central part of management accounting in organizations. It is also a powerful tool to achieve learning. Feedback, which also goes under the name performance evaluation, deals with evaluation of previous performances in order to provide information about the performances. The purpose of giving <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> to enable improvement of the performance of the recipient, this by changing the recipient’s behavior. In what way <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> given, as well as by whom it is given, affects how <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> perceived and what effects it has. There are, in other words, many circumstances that affect feedback and its effects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to create an understanding of how task complexity affects how <b>feedback</b> can <b>be</b> given in order to result in positive effects on the feedback-recipient’s performance, and also to examine if there were potential differences. To find out how <b>feedback</b> can <b>be</b> given in order to have the desired effects, depending on the task complexity, a qualitative method was applied through case studies of two organizations where <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> commonly occurring.

25|$|The {{project was}} largely {{reported}} by the press {{to have been a}} flop: badly thought-out, badly executed, and leaving the government with the embarrassing question {{of what to do with}} it afterwards. During 2000 the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, more cash from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. Numerous changes at management and Board level, before and during the exhibition, had only limited, if any, results. Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome's opening. Press reports suggested that the then Prime Minister Tony Blair personally placed a high priority on making the Dome a success. But part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the 12 months it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 held in Glasgow attracted more than 12 million visitors being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> extremely positive.

25|$|The use {{of virtual}} {{feedback}} {{has been seen}} scattered throughout history for quite some time. However, though the <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> virtual, the performances were not widely virtual until the 1990s. With the early-stage experimentation, not many positive results were found causing some doubt of the systems. Some even found that too much virtual feedback increased poor performance outside of the controlled environment. As virtual reality systems and virtual environments became more accessible and affordable, though, so too did the implementations of and research on them. The use of these systems in positive motor skill development began somewhere in the late 1990s as more researchers realized the benefit of internal, corrective feedback in such environments. Additionally, at the same time, researchers across the world began experimenting with the effect of virtual reality in therapeutic measures for anxiety disorder and phobias. With positive results, such as better motor control and lower anxiety in relation to phobias, coming from these experiments, researchers began looking into virtual reality systems {{as a form of}} rehabilitation in the early 2000s, and the research has expanded since. Now, common gaming consoles such as the Wii and Kinect allow researchers to use cheaper, more readily available systems in their labs, as well, opening up new possibilities for games and rehabilitation options. Case studies and use of systems in actual therapy offices have suggested that this field has the potential to impact therapy outside the lab setting, as well, making it a rapidly growing field of interest. Currently, several reviews of the findings have also suggested positive effects of this form of rehabilitation, garnering support for this field as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} haptic {{feedback}} system for an arm {{in order to}} obtain the sensation of stiffness and the boundary of virtual objects. Powerful haptic displays are large and heavy, interfering with movement in the virtual environment. Here, we focus on an illusion called pseudo-haptic feedback, which provides the results of haptic feedback using only visual impressions. Since pseudo-haptic <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> known to be inappropriate for applications requiring strong force, a combination of pseudo-haptic feedback and real haptic <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> proposed for a compact haptic display. This study examines the effectiveness of this combination by comparing the stiffness of two walls. Pseudo-haptic and real haptic <b>feedbacks</b> <b>are</b> applied to one wall, and only real haptic <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> applied to the other wall. The results verify that the magnitude of the force perceived with the application of a combination of pseudo-haptic and real haptic <b>feedbacks</b> <b>is</b> greater than that of the force perceived by the application of only real haptic feedback...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For {{bi-directional}} communication, {{the most}} general form of encoders {{should consider the}} signals received {{in the past as}} inputs. However, in practice, it would also be highly desirable if <b>feedback</b> could <b>be</b> ignored for encoding purposes since this would lead to a simple system design. In this work, we investigate the question of whether and how much loss in secrecy rate would be incurred, if such an approach were taken. To do so, we investigate the role of feedback in secrecy for two three-node two-way channel models. First, we show that <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> indeed useful for a class of full-duplex two-way wire-tap channels. In this case, when <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> ignored, the channel is equivalent to a Gaussian degraded relay channel with confidential messages to the relay. The usefulness of <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated by deriving an upper bound for this channel when <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> ignored, and then proving that, when <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> used, a secrecy rate higher than this upper bound is achievable. Secondly, we consider the half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel where there is an eavesdropper co-located with the relay node, and find that the impact of <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> less pronounced compared to the previous scenario. Specifically, the loss in secrecy rate, when ignoring the <b>feedback,</b> <b>is</b> quantified to be less than 0. 5 bit per channel use when the power of the relay goes to infinity. We also show that this rate region is achievable under a simple time sharing scheme with cooperative jamming, which, with its simplicity and nearoptimum performance, is a viable alternative to an encoder using feedback.
