5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of <b>her</b> <b>thick,</b> heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
25|$|Halfway {{through the}} series, Kilala {{experiences}} a hair style change {{thanks to her}} mother. Her hair is thinner and longer, contrasting to <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> hair before. Kilala's three curls are looser, and the braid at the back is replaced with red beads.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the popular Mother Gothel Classic Doll and appearing alongside Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus in the Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set, the character's likeness has since been adapted and modified by Disney into a much more glamorous doll for sale alongside several re-imagined Disney villainesses {{as part of the}} company's Disney Villains Designer Collection, released in 2012. Costumed in a long burgundy gown made of satin, Gothel wears <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> black hair in [...] "a theatrical up-do." ...|$|E
60|$|Her trunks {{had been}} taken down already. She chose the little hat that he liked her best in, and over it {{fastened}} <b>her</b> <b>thickest</b> veil. Then, putting on her travelling coat and gloves, {{she looked in the}} long mirror, and seeing that there was nothing more to keep her, lifted her dressing bag, and went down.|$|R
60|$|Mary Margaret {{laughed and}} {{switched}} <b>her</b> long, <b>thick</b> braid {{of black hair}} from one shoulder to the other.|$|R
5000|$|Fr. De Marchi {{described}} her {{features in the}} following manner: [...] "She was not a pretty child. The only attractions of her face — which {{was not on the}} whole repellent — were her two great black eyes which gazed out from under <b>thick</b> eyebrows. <b>Her</b> hair, <b>thick</b> and dark, was parted in the center over her shoulders. Her nose was rather flat, <b>her</b> lips <b>thick</b> and <b>her</b> mouth large." ...|$|R

2500|$|Thickness is {{a literal}} {{translation}} of the Japanese word [...] and connotes the position of power and impregnability conferred by the thickness of medieval castles' stone walls. [...] A group is thick when it has developed beyond the level of stability in its local area without accruing significant weaknesses, and consequently projects power at a distance, especially over vacant or unsettled areas of the board. [...] Such positions have a profound influence on {{the flow of the}} game. [...] In the diagram, though white has about 10 points of territory in the corner, black can expect the power projected outward by <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> position to more than make up for this. Note that her result would not be as good if white had a settled position in the direction black's influence is facing.|$|E
2500|$|... 'The {{pavement}} {{and the road}} are crowded with purchasers and street-sellers. The housewife in <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> shawl, with the market-basket on her arm, walks slowly on, stopping now {{to look at the}} stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch of greens. Little boys, holding three or four onions in their hand, creep between the people, wriggling their way through every interstice, and asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the tumult of the thousand different cries of the eager dealers, all shouting {{at the top of their}} voices, at one and the same time, is almost bewildering. [...] "So-old again," [...] roars one. [...] "Chestnuts all'ot, a penny a score," [...] bawls another. [...] "An 'aypenny a skin, blacking," [...] squeaks a boy. [...] "Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy-- bu-u-uy!" [...] cries the butcher. [...] "Half-quire of paper for a penny," [...] bellows the street stationer. [...] "An 'aypenny a lot ing-uns." [...] “Twopence a pound grapes." [...] “Three a penny Yarmouth bloaters." [...] “Who'll buy a bonnet for fourpence?" [...] “Pick 'em out cheap here! three pair for a halfpenny, bootlaces." [...] “Now's your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot." [...] “Here's ha'p‘orths," [...] shouts the perambulating confectioner. [...] "Come and look at 'em! here's toasters!" [...] bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater stuck on a toasting-fork. [...] "Penny a lot, fine russets," [...] calls the apple woman: and so the Babel goes on.' ...|$|E
50|$|Katherine Parr {{was born}} in London, England in 1921, where she grew up, giving <b>her</b> a <b>thick</b> cockney accent.|$|R
6000|$|... "You trust a {{woman who}} puts forth [...] <b>Her</b> {{blossoms}} <b>thick</b> as summer's? [...] You think she dreams what love is worth, [...] Who casts it to new-comers? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{daughter}} was fourteen. <b>Her</b> hair, <b>thick</b> and dark like her mother's, fell {{over her shoulders}} in fine profusion, {{and she had the}} same kindly expression and sedate, untroubled eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{tendered}} a coin, smiling boldly, holding <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> wrist out.|$|E
6000|$|I'd looked on, unknowing, and {{witnessed}} [...] Her jests with the tapsters, Her liquor-fired face, <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> accents [...] In naming her fee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I find {{it rather}} cold," [...] said Mrs. Heatherstone, drawing <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> {{sealskin}} mantle tighter round her figure. [...] "We are detaining Mr. West, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Holy Mother!" [...] said Monna Lisa, in <b>her</b> meek, <b>thick</b> tone, {{letting the}} spoon fall from her hands. [...] "Where were you, then? I {{thought you were}} there, and had your eye on him." ...|$|R
50|$|Song-yi's {{childhood}} friend {{who has an}} unrequited love for her. He believes one day she will love him, but decides to back down for a while, supporting <b>her</b> through <b>thick</b> and thin as a true friend.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{knew that}} some hours must elapse {{before she could}} venture to make the attempt. She remembered to have read in some book that the sleep {{of a human being}} was usually deepest about two in the morning, so she had chosen that hour for her enterprise. She had put on her strongest dress and <b>her</b> <b>thickest</b> shoes, but had muffled the latter in cloth, so that they should make no sound. No {{precaution}} which she could think of had been neglected. There was now nothing to be done but to spend the time as best she might until the hour of action should arrive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you love}} him, dear?" [...] said Miss Frost with emphasis, {{knitting}} <b>her</b> <b>thick,</b> passionate, earnest eyebrows. [...] "Do {{you love him}} sufficiently? That's the point." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ''Sorry,' {{she said}} in <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> schoolboy-like voice. 'I'm sorry for what I said to you about verifying quotations. I didn't know you well enough and--anyhow, I oughtn't to have.' ...|$|E
60|$|Thus she lay, {{during the}} greater part of the day. Not quite fully conscious, not quite awake to the awful {{memories}} which anon would crowd upon <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> and fast.|$|E
60|$|Poor Lucy! She's borne up wonderfully. She'll {{stick to}} <b>her</b> father through <b>thick</b> and thin.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Say Mrs. Sapsea. <b>Her</b> wall’s <b>thicker,</b> but say Mrs. Sapsea. Durdles taps, {{that wall}} {{represented}} by that hammer, and says, after good sounding: “Something betwixt us!” Sure enough, some rubbish {{has been left}} in that same six-foot space by Durdles’s men!’ ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} before Millicent Leslie had thought all this out, but when once her way seemed clear, {{exhausted}} by conflicting emotions, she sank into heavy slumber, {{and the sun}} was high before she awakened. Leslie had gone to his office, and she ate a little, chose <b>her</b> <b>thickest</b> furs, and waited for noon in feverish suspense. Her husband might return and prevent her departure by force. She feared that, should he guess her intention, a special locomotive might be hired, even after the train had started. It was, therefore, necessary to slip away without word or sign, unless, indeed, she could mislead him, and, smiling mirthlessly, she laid an open letter inside her writing-case.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{does work}} hard," [...] said {{the young woman}} on horseback, looking up at Gabriel through <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> woollen veil. [...] "I wish he was {{shepherd}} here. Don't any of you know his name." ...|$|E
6000|$|King Grumpy {{went out}} to meet her, but when he saw her, with a skin like a tortoise's, <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> eyebrows meeting above her large nose, and her mouth from ear to ear, {{he could not help}} crying out: ...|$|E
60|$|She was muffled up in rich brown furs, {{and almost}} invisible, but {{her dark eyes}} flashed into his from {{underneath}} <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> veil. After the first greeting she scarcely noticed Arthur; it was Paul upon whom her eyes were bent.|$|E
60|$|There {{were but}} {{few people in}} the streets through which they passed, the whole {{population}} having flocked either to the streets through which the procession was to pass, or to the cathedral or churches it was to visit on its way. Gerald had told Inez at their interview that, although he had made arrangements for carrying her off by force on the journey to or from Seville, he should, if possible, take advantage of the crowd at the function to draw her away from her companions. She had, therefore, put on <b>her</b> <b>thickest</b> lace mantilla, and this now completely covered her face from the view of passersby. Several times she glanced back.|$|R
60|$|Annabel {{clutched}} her sister's hands. The tears were {{streaming down her}} face, <b>her</b> voice was <b>thick</b> with sobs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dat's so! dat's so!" [...] exclaimed Grandison. [...] "You can't go agin de Scripters. Truf is mighty, an' 'tain't fur pore human critters {{like us to}} try to upsot her. Wot we're got ter do is ter {{stick to}} <b>her</b> through <b>thick</b> an' thin." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Sandgate neither affirmed nor denied; {{she only}} {{turned on him}} <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> lustre. [...] "I {{wanted to see how}} much you'd tell." [...] She waited even as for more, but this not coming she helped herself. [...] "Once again at dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clump, clump, {{came the}} heavy {{feet of a}} laggard, her head bent over her book, <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> lips vainly conning the unlearned task, unaware of the {{presence}} of the young lady, till Lucilla touched her, saying, 'What, Martha, a ten o'clock scholar?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Francine was constitutionally impenetrable to reproof of this sort; <b>her</b> <b>thick</b> {{skin was}} not even tickled. [...] "Why are you not helping them," [...] she went on; [...] "you who have the clearest head among us and {{take the lead in}} everything?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went to his}} desk, {{and searching}} a while found a paper, which be {{unfolded}} and brought to <b>her.</b> A <b>thick</b> cross appeared in ink at the bottom--evidently from the hand of Grammer. Grace put the paper in her pocket {{with a look of}} much relief.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I, Sir Marmaduke, {{have been}} {{brought up in the}} idea that when a man has won the {{affections}} of a woman, it is the duty of that man,--as a man,--to stick to <b>her</b> through <b>thick</b> and thin; and I mean to do my duty, according to my idea." ...|$|R
