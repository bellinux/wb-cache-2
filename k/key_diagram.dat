Model based design is one potential methodology to meet these challenges.

This paper shows how {{to make use of}} those <b>key</b> <b>diagram</b> types to enable automotive engineers to model both architecture and functionality of the automotive electronic system.

In this paper, we introduce and develop several new combinatorial models for Schubert polynomials that relate them to other known bases including key polynomials and fundamental slide polynomials. We unify these and existing models by giving simple bijections between the combinatorial objects indexing each. In particular, we give a simple bijective proof that the balanced tableaux of Edelman and Greene enumerate reduced expressions and a direct combinatorial proof of Kohnert's algorithm for computing Schubert polynomials. Further, we generalize the insertion algorithm of Edelman and Greene to give a bijection between reduced expressions and pairs of tableaux of the same <b>key</b> <b>diagram</b> shape and use this to give a simple formula, directly in terms of reduced expressions, for the key polynomial expansion of a Schubert polynomial.

40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{quality of}} the intermountain area in Inagawa-cho, Hyogo Prefecture was monitored from April in 1981 to April in 1982. The samples were obtained from 22 shallow wells and 4 deep ones. The seasonal fluctuation of concentrations of Soluble SiO_ 2, Ca, Na and HCO_ 3 was generally little, especially in deep well, but that of K and Fe showed remarkable change. Noticeable correlations between concentration of major components and change of water level could not be observed. This may lead {{to suggest that the}} concentration of major dissolved components in the groundwaters may be possible to use in knowing characteristics of groundwater quality. On the other hand, a <b>Key</b> <b>diagram</b> which gives the relationships among major elements indicate us (1) that in the igneous bedrock area the composition of shallow groundwaters is dominated by alkali cations, and (2) that other bedrock area produces groundwater of variable composition dominated by alkaline earth cations and HCO_ 3. Further, the total dissolved solid concentrations of groundwater were found to be varied according to the geology of the respective area. That is, it gave lowest value in igneous rock, highest in Alluvium area, and between value in other area. Also, in spite of the geological feature is uniform, the concentration of major elements was found to be double to four times higher in the bore rock well than in bore soil one, and double higher in the deep well than in the shallow one. From these facts, it seems that the groundwater quality in mountainous area may be closely related with runoff path way and storage time of groundwater even in the bedrock or soil layer. 兵庫県川辺郡猪名川町の山地部において, 1981 年 4 月から 1982 年 4 月まで毎月ほぼ 1 回,民家の生活用水として用いられている 22 点の浅井戸水,及び 4 点の深井戸水を採水・分析し,水質の季節変動・水位変化に伴なう水質変化及び水質と地質との関係などについて検討した。主要成分の一部,例えばKやFeなどはかなり大きな季節変動を示していたが,その他の主要成分の季節変動は両井戸水とも小幅であり,特に深井戸水で小さかった。又,KやFeを含む主要成分の濃度変化と水位変化との間に相関関係は認められなかった。これらのことから,山地地下水の特徴を知る上で主要成分濃度が指標的なものとして考えられることを示唆する。一方,キーダイアグラムによって山地地下水の主要成分間の関係を調べたところ,花崗岩質地域の地下水は中間区にあり,その他の地域の地下水はアルカリ土類重炭酸塩区に属していることが判った。さらに,これらの溶存成分を濃度の観点からみると,採水点の地質条件によっても異なっていた。即ち,花崗岩質地域で濃度は最も低く,沖積層地域で高い傾向を示し,その他はこれらの中間にあった。また,主要成分濃度は,岩盤掘削井が土壌層掘削井より 2 ～ 4 倍,そして深井戸が浅井戸より約 2 倍高い値を示したことから判るように,地下水の水質は井戸の構造及び深さによっても大きな違いを示しており,この違いは井戸のある場所の地質的条件の違いによると考えられるより大きいものであった。従って,山地地下水の水質の違いは,夫々の場所における岩石・土壌内での水の流出経路や,滞留時間の違いによってもたらされるものと考えられる...|$|E
