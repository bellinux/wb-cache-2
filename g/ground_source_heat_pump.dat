2500|$|Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Leeds Metropolitan University have collaborated in {{building}} the Headingley Carnegie Pavilion, which replaced 'The Shed' to the northern side of the Cricket Ground (which, dating from the early 1970s, was the oldest surviving structure). The new pavilion replaces 'The Winter Shed' and 'The Media Centre' at the Kirkstall Lane end of the ground, which had become obsolete, according to Yorkshire County Cricket Club, no longer meeting the requirements of modern broadcasting. The changing facilities are replaced by 'state of the art' changing facilities, designed specifically for cricket, while the new executive boxes will provide the expected level of service. [...] Yorkshire County Cricket Clubs offices will also be relocated into the pavilion, which boasts environmentally friendly features such as a <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> and solar hot water heating.|$|E
2500|$|Geothermal {{heat pumps}} or ground-source heat pumps use shallow {{underground}} heat exchangers as a heat source or sink, and water as the heat transfer medium. [...] This is possible because below ground level, {{the temperature is}} relatively constant across the seasons, and the earth can provide or absorb {{a large amount of}} heat. Ground source heat pumps work {{in the same way as}} air-source heat pumps, but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground. Ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside. Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.|$|E

50|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} {{are used to}} provide {{interior}} space heating and cooling even in colder climates, {{and can be used}} efficiently for water heating in milder climates. A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer, though it is not true air conditioning without a facility to adjust the humidity of the inside air. Though the cost of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> because a <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions.|$|E
