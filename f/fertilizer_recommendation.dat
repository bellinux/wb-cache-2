The objective of this study was parameterization of a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>recommendation</b> system for melon (Ferticalc-melon) based on nutritional balance. To estimate <b>fertilizer</b> <b>recommendation,</b> the system considers the requirement subsystem (REQ), which includes the demand for nutrients by the plant, and the supply subsystem (SUP), which corresponds to the supply of nutrients through the soil and irrigation water. After determining the REQtotal and SUPtotal, the system calculates the nutrient balances for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S, recommending fertilizer application if the balance is negative (SUP < REQ), but not if the balance is positive or zero (SUP &# 8805; REQ). Simulations were made for different melon types (Yellow, Cantaloupe, Galia and Piel-de-sapo), with expected yield of 45 t ha- 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{literature}} on fertilization for carrot growing usually recommends nutrient application rates for yield expectations {{lower than the}} yields currently obtained. Moreover, the recommendation only considers the results of soil chemical analysis and does not include effects such as crop residues or variations in yield levels. The {{aim of this study}} was to propose a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>recommendation</b> system for carrot cultivation (FERTICALC Carrot) which includes consideration of the nutrient supply by crop residues, variation in intended yield, soil chemical properties, and the growing season (winter or summer). To obtain the data necessary for modeling nutritional requirements, 210 carrot production stands were sampled in the region of Alto Paranaíba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The dry matter content of the roots, the coefficient of biological utilization of nutrients in the roots, and the nutrient harvest index for summer and winter crops were determined for these samples. To model the nutrient supply by the soil, the literature was surveyed in regard to this theme. A modeling system was developed for recommendation of macronutrients and B.

In present research, an attempt was made for carrying out nutrient budgeting, which includes the calculation of nutrient balance at micro (plot / field) and meso (farm) level and evaluation of trends in nutrient mining / enrichment. A nutrient budget is an account of inputs and outputs {{of nutrients}} in an agricultural system. NUTrient MONitoring (NUTMON) is a multiscale approach that assess the stocks and flows of N, P and K in an well defined geographical unit based on the inputs viz., mineral fertilizers, manures, atmospheric deposition and sedimentation and outputs of harvested crop produces, residues, leaching, denitrification and erosion losses. The nutrient budgeting research in an irrigated farm at Coimbatore district revealed that the nutrient management practices are not appropriate and sustainable. Soil nutrient pool has to offset the negative balance of N and K, hence there is an expected mining of nutrient from the soil reserve in the research area.

The World Phosphorus Institute (IMPHOS) agreed to finance a 3 -year program to test various Hungarian <b>fertilizer</b> <b>recommendation</b> systems (the new RISSAC-RIA [Research for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry‐Research Institute for Agriculture] system, the Talajerőgazdálkodás integrated soil fertility management system, and the intensive MÉM NAK [Department of Plant Protection and Agricultural Chemistry of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture] system) when applied to three major crops grown on three characteristic Hungarian soils. The first five treatments in the experiment represented a classical deficiency experiment, aimed at checking the correctness of the NPK supply categories determined by the various systems. On all three soils and for all three crops the IMPHOS experiments confirmed the basic principles of the new cost-saving, environmentally friendly <b>fertilizer</b> <b>recommendation</b> system and the correctness of the methods used for calculating fertilizer rates. In this article, diagnostic plant analysis, soil analysis data, and NPK balances obtained in the different recommendations are discussed.

Crop NPK contents in Talajerőgazdálkodás and MÉM NAK treatments (with greater recommended NPK doses) were most cases better than in the RISSAC-RIA treatments; however, the better crop NPK status did not result in extra grain yield in the former treatments. Taking into account that similarly high yields were obtained using the RISSAC-RIA system and the Talajerőgazdálkodás integrated system with much smaller NPK doses than those recommended by the intensive MÉM NAK system, it was more advantageous from agronomic, environmental protection, and economic points of view.
