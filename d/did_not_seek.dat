Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining {{support for the president}} amongst elements of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other {{disadvantaged}} Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{suggests}} thatunlike Wagner, Alkan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> to refashion {{the world}} through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music {{at the service of}} literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.|$|E
5|$|The Corporation {{stipulated that}} several {{manufacturing}} industries should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it {{set out to}} create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms {{to build their own}} premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.|$|E

5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming {{that it was too}} close to the working title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, as soon as the name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change by claiming that the Jedi <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> revenge, only the Sith.|$|E
5|$|As {{chair of}} the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Howard {{supported}} Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made Howard a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated for Open Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada.

Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to Touch and Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E

Moreover, Ingram did not provide the Canadian military with a situation report until after the sinking of U-518. However, aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) flew offensive patrols in support of the American effort, and the RCN and RCAF intensified their patrols of inshore waters around Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts {{were made to}} clarify that the movement <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E

During the Forty-fourth Congress, he chaired the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> reelection at the end of his term. In the disputed 1876 presidential election, he was one of the visiting statesmen who went to New Orleans, Louisiana, and concluded that the election had been fairly conducted in that state.|$|E
