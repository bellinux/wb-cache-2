40|$|We {{report on}} illegal {{international}} trade in <b>Indian</b> <b>Star</b> <b>Tortoises</b> (Geochelone elegans), with a particular focus on India and Thailand. Within India, this species has received protection as a Schedule IV list species of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 for over 40 years. This study documents the illegal trade of 55, 000 individuals poached from just one 'trade hub' in India. Although domestic demand persists, these individuals {{appear to have been}} primarily sourced to satiate international demand for pets in other Asian countries (e. g. Thailand and China). Since 1975, this species has been included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) that regulates all commercial trade. However, an analysis of the CITES trade records relating to Thailand imports (between 2004 and 2013) found large discrepancies indicating potential illegal activity which question the legitimacy of its founding captive stock. Given its role as a major hub of illegal trade activity, both as a consumer and a country of transit, we support calls for Thailand to prohibit private ownership by extending its domestic legislation to also cover non-indigenous tortoise species. In consideration of conservation and animal welfare concerns, we also call for more field research to determine the impacts of illegal trade on wild populations, an updated assessment of its conservation status, increased cooperation between national enforcement agencies, and the implementation of targeted human behaviour change initiatives to help reduce consumer demand for this species...|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} this {{creature}} {{is presumed to}} be specially adapted to naturally assist it {{to return to a}} stable stance after it has been turned over. Mathematicians Gábor Domokos of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and Péter Várkonyi of Princeton University designed a homogeneous object called a gömböc that has exactly one unstable balance point and exactly one stable balance point. Just as a bottom-weighted (nonhomogeneous weight distribution) sphere would always return to the same upright position, they found it was possible to construct a shape that behaves the same way. After that, they noted the similarity to the <b>Indian</b> <b>star</b> <b>tortoise</b> and subsequently tested 30 turtles by turning them upside down. They found many of them to be self-righting.|$|E
50|$|Reptiles include toads, spotted leaping frog and Leith's leaping frog, black torrent frogs, tree frogs, pythons, cobras, kraits, vipers, grass snakes, forest cane turtles, Travancore <b>tortoises,</b> flapshell turtless, <b>star</b> <b>tortoises,</b> flying lizards, {{chameleons}} {{and forest}} lizards.|$|R
