5000|$|Whilst {{making his}} way lower, Vattic {{suddenly}} finds himself experiencing a series of flash-forwards to the future, in which Wilde reveals in a telepathic message the reason {{he was on the}} mission with WinterICE and the truth behind his ability to flashback to the past and change history. What Vattic had thought was the present was in reality a possible future that he was experiencing, one of many that were manifesting from the use of one of his most important psychic abilities he hadn't realised was active the whole time - precognition. In truth, everything he thought had happened six months ago, is still ongoing with the mission yet to be completed. Wilde further reveals in her message that the children had been the reason for him being in Siberia in the first place, as they had helped him throughout the mission to stop Hanson's plan. Now knowing the truth of his situation, Vattic confronts Hanson in research lab to stop the future he experienced from happening, but is once again placed in a seemingly unwinnable situation due to Hanson securing himself behind a window impervious to both bullets and psionic powers. As Hanson's men come to deal with him, Vattic releases Grienko's original test subjects, referred to as the [...] "Zener children", to aid him with their psychic powers and defeat them. After a long shootout, the children eventually use their powerful telekinesis abilities to pull away the <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> {{the only part of the}} window that was not impervious to psychic abilities, before attacking and killing Hanson. Vattic eventually returns to the surface, exhausted, as WinterICE and American troops arrive to secure the facility, while Starke and Wilde help Vattic into a helicopter as it takes them away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Approximately 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly people, {{over age}} 65, suffer from {{one kind of}} {{dementia}} such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia and AIDS dementia. It is estimated population of senior citizens {{all over the world}} will almost double in the next 25 years. Accordingly, prevalence of dementia in aging generation increases essential need in resources dedicated to caretaking of senior citizens, such as facilities, financial and human resources. It opens doors to emergence of new semantic technologies, which aim to assist senior citizens in daily life tasks. The systems should be safe, effective and patient-centered, and they must provide timely, efficient and equitable care to patients. Focuses on health, physical condition monitoring and assistive navigation technologies are the main categories to improve life quality of senior citizens. This study is dedicated to introducing a Head Mounted Display system to assist senior citizens in daily navigational tasks. In addition, usability test infrastructure is explained to evaluate system usability and improve the system in iterative test plans. The main research question clarifies main objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study as an investigation on usability of HMD system through several sub-questions evaluating various factors in the system and customers’ preferences. HMD system consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indicator-based Smart <b>Glasses</b> and Bluetooth headset. Set of LED indicators is implanted around the lenses in <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smart <b>Glasses.</b> LED cues are supposed to convey navigational commands to users. Design science method with applied qualitative and quantitative approaches defines research method while Goal Question Metrics forms <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study to improve <b>the</b> usability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Satisfaction level and various metrics in the system are evaluated via unstructured interviews, Bayesian analysis and measuring quantitative variables. Furthermore, severity of dementia is assessed through questionnaires in MMSE from. Evaluating different factors and metrics in the system through iterative usability tests lead to improvement in design and defining optimized blinking patterns in LED indicators configurations to convey navigational commands. Blinking patterns in <b>the</b> Smart <b>Glasses</b> include localizing indicators, blinking duration time, frequency and brightness. Usability tests with senior citizens as subject demonstrates that severity level of dementia could strongly affect users’ performance. Senior citizens who are suffering from severe and moderate dementia fail to accomplish the tasks in using the assistive tool. Accordingly, senior citizens, who are suffering from mild dementia and are in <b>the</b> initial stage <b>of</b> dementia, should be considered as <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> future usability tests...|$|R

The director shoots several minutes of extra footage to be used as test strips. The matte painter then develops a test strip (with the blacked out areas in the shot) and projects a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'Matted' shot onto <b>the</b> easel mounted <b>glass.</b> This test footage clip is used as the reference to paint the background or scenery to be matted in on a new piece <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> <b>The</b> live action part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> is painted black, more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test footage is then exposed to adjust and confirm color matching and edge line up. Then <b>the</b> critical parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matted live action scene (with the desired actions and actors in place) are threaded up for burning the painted elements into the black areas. The flat black paint put on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> blocks light from <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film it covers, preventing double exposure over the latent live action scenes from occurring.|$|R
