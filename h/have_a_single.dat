5|$|Matrices which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> row {{are called}} row vectors, and those which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> column are called column vectors. A matrix {{which has the}} same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} number of rows or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E

5000|$|There is <b>a</b> {{correlation}} between <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> yolk sac and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> amniotic sac. However, {{it is difficult}} to detect the number of yolk sacs, because the yolk sac disappears during embryogenesis.|$|R

5|$|Monotrysian: Primitive groups <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> genital {{aperture}} {{near the}} end of the abdomen through which both copulation and egg laying occur. This character is used to designate the Monotrysia.|$|E
5|$|Most Demospongiae have {{silicate}} spicules or spongin fibers or {{both within}} their soft tissues. However a few also have massive external skeletons made of aragonite, {{another form of}} calcium carbonate. All the cells <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> nucleus and membrane.|$|E
5|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} cell types usually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> nucleus, but some have no nuclei, {{while others have}} several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.|$|E

50|$|Euacanthellinae is a {{subfamily}} of leafhoppers, {{native to}} Australia, New Caledonia and Madagascar, and adventive in New Zealand. There are 11 described species in 4 genera. 10 species in 3 genera are native to Australia, Madagascar <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> endemic genus/species, and New Caledonia <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> undescribed species of uncertain generic placement. New Zealand <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> species, Euacanthella palustris, adventive from Australia. There {{are two very}} different tribes, Euacanthellini (containing just Euacanthella), and Sagmatini. See Wikispecies link for details.|$|R
5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs {{have at least}} two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E
5|$|Archaea usually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many}} as 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, {{the largest}} known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon black truffle, {{is roughly}} similar in appearance, habitat, and growing season, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its darker (charcoal black) peridium. Microscopically, the spores of Leucangium are larger (60–90μm) and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> large oil droplet. L.carthusianum is also edible and prized for its taste and aroma.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the whitetip reef shark is viviparous; once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment {{for the remainder of}} gestation. Mature females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> functional ovary, on the left side, and two functional uteruses. The reproductive cycle is biennial.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> type of melanin and the hairs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split could only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> funnel {{to allow the}} guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the lower {{respiratory}} tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of most {{reptiles}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> bronchus {{running down}} the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In tuataras, snakes, and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, {{similar to that of}} typical amphibians.|$|E

5|$|The {{putative}} anamorph form of C.dentatus {{has been}} described as Tricladiopsis flagelliformis. Grown on 2% malt agar at standard conditions, it forms black-centered colonies that have a growth rate of 7cm per week. The conidia produced are thin and curved with a whip-like shape. They have 13–20 septa, measure 65–135 by 2–3.5μm, and usually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> branch (typically about 45μm long) that appears before cells are released.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara is {{considered}} the most unspecialised living amniote; the brain and mode of locomotion resemble those of amphibians and the heart is more primitive than {{that of any other}} reptile. The lungs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> chamber and lack bronchi.|$|E
5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
