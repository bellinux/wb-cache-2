500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies {{because that was the}} one thing that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then and there I decided that I wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|E
2500|$|Moriarty has {{respect for}} Holmes's intelligence, stating that [...] "It {{has been an}} {{intellectual}} treat <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the manner in which}} you [...] have grappled with this case" [...] and that [...] "it would be a grief for me to take an extreme measure." [...] Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted and he is placed [...] "in positive danger of losing my liberty" [...] as well as furiously elbowing aside passengers in the train station in his pursuit of the disguised Holmes. Moriarty also shows a fiercely independent streak, pursuing Holmes to Switzerland alone, while by contrast Holmes takes Watson with him everywhere he goes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's high time, Miss Withersteen," [...] he replied. [...] "Will {{you come}} into the grove? It ain't jest exactly safe <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody {{is after}} him," [...] he muttered. [...] "I reckon it's time I cleared out. It won't do <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> in this neighborhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. It's {{bad enough}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> in your company," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Aaron Woodward, {{with just a}} trace of his former lofty manner.|$|R
2500|$|Paul {{refers to}} his {{background}} as an obstetrician as being influential on his view, recalling inadvertently witnessing a late-term abortion performed {{by one of}} his instructors during his residency, [...] "It was pretty dramatic <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a two-and-a-half-pound baby taken out crying and breathing and put in a bucket." [...] During a May 15, 2007, appearance on the Fox News talk show Hannity and Colmes, Paul argued that his pro-life position was consistent with his libertarian values, asking, [...] "If you can't protect life then how can you protect liberty?" [...] Furthermore, Paul argued in this appearance that since he believes libertarians support non-aggression, libertarians should oppose abortion because abortion is [...] "an act of aggression" [...] against a fetus, which he believes is alive, human, and in possession of legal rights.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{civilian}} {{inhabitants of}} Khanasor, meanwhile, expressed frustration and {{anger at the}} clashes, saying that both groups should focus on expelling ISIL from southern Sinjar rather than fighting each other. Some locals even said both groups should simply retreat from the Sinjar Mountains, and leave the Yezidi civilians alone. Both Mir Tahsin Beg, leader of the Yezidi community, as well as Nadia Murad, female Yezidi activist and UN Goodwill ambassador, called on both sides to stop the fighting. Murad said that [...] "it is deeply saddening <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> once again victims of Genocide become victims of an internal conflict, it is painful to see the Yezidi women again are suffering from fear after all that happened to them". An expert also warned that both the Sinjar Resistance Units {{as well as the}} Rojava Peshmerga had been very effective at [...] "keeping IS at bay" [...] and that the fighting among these anti-ISIL forces [...] "would slow the process to liberate the remaining territory from IS".|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. It's best <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{him before}} to-night. I'm glad he's come.|$|E
60|$|What {{was to be}} done? It {{would never}} do <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen.</b> Nothing short of arrest would follow. I must {{get out of the}} way as quickly as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} any {{particular}} reason <b>for</b> wishing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, I will. It {{will be all right}} if I have a message from you. Shall I call on him? It will be no trouble to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{but this}} is--such--such a fresh {{experience}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> hear--to <b>see</b> something--genuine and human. Ah! ah! {{one would think}} they had waited all their lives for this opportunity--ah! ah! ah! All their lives--for this! ah! ah! ah!" ...|$|R
60|$|I thought, {{after all}} you've told me, {{you might not}} care <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her.|$|E
60|$|It {{needed only}} a glance <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Colonel Sampson's ranch {{was on a}} scale fitting the country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Miss Havisham {{had sent}} <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{if she could}} take a fancy to me. But she couldn't,--at all events, she didn't." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{postscript}} gave me {{the excuse}} that I wanted. I knew perfectly well {{that it would be}} better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her--and I went to London, for the sole purpose of seeing her, by the first train.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand to take leave. How could I reply? If I had been a {{resolute}} man, I might have remembered that it would be best <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> too much of her. But I am a poor weak creature--I accepted her invitation for the next day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Live for that, then; live <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> Eugene; live <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{how hard}} I {{will try to}} improve myself, and never to {{discredit}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [With a grim smile.] Say I'm {{very busy}} to-day, and I regret {{exceedingly}} {{that it will}} be quite impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} that," [...] replied Harold gloomily. [...] "But you must arrange <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her right away, this {{afternoon}} or to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|I tore a leaf from my note-book, {{and went}} to the window, where it was barely light enough <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how to write.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt it was}} {{unnecessary}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> just then, and I vanished guiltily round the corner into the West Wood, and so to love-dreams and single-handed play, wandering along one of those meandering bracken valleys that varied Bladesover park. And that day and for many days that kiss upon my lips was a seal, and by night the seed of dreams.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm off to my room, at any rate, old chap," [...] he said. [...] "Groves {{is going}} abroad for a month's holiday, {{and he has}} brought some papers <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> look through. <b>See</b> you some time to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who will blame you?" [...] asked Bob, {{though he}} knew well enough. Then he added, seeing {{that she did not}} answer: [...] "I don't at all agree with you that it is best <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you. I know of nobody in the world it does <b>me</b> more good <b>to</b> <b>see</b> than yourself. Let's sit down and talk it all over," [...] he said, for she still {{remained}} standing uncompromisingly by the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, dear," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, {{seeming to}} rouse herself, and {{beginning}} to take off her dress. [...] "It is always enough <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to lose her in the darkness, after all," [...] {{announced}} the lumberman, at about eight o'clock. [...] "It's hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her, even now." ...|$|E
6000|$|She nodded acquiescence, {{trying to}} appear content. Then she pleaded once again, dry-eyed and broken-voiced: [...] "You {{will try and}} get {{permission}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lord Radclyffe, won't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I sold a sheep as {{they had}} said, [...] And bought my little {{children}} bread, [...] And they were healthy with their food; [...] <b>For</b> <b>me</b> it never did me good. [...] A woeful time it was <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> [...] <b>To</b> <b>see</b> {{the end of all}} my gains, [...] The pretty flock which I had reared [...] With all my care and pains, [...] <b>To</b> <b>see</b> it melt like snow away! [...] <b>For</b> <b>me</b> it was a woeful day.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] said he, [...] "it {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{solutions}} which occurred <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I was soon able to corroborate the doctor's tale. This young man has left prints upon the stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those which he had made in the room. When I tell you that his shoes were square-toed instead of being pointed like Blessington's, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctor's, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality. But we may sleep on it now, for I shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from Brook Street in the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gerald {{forced a}} nervous smile. [...] "The reason {{ought to be}} obvious, sir; I might be brought back. We must get over the need <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go. You <b>see,</b> the bill must be met. If it's dishonored, {{everybody}} who knows us will have something to talk about." ...|$|R
60|$|All that he suppressed, {{all that}} would have been passion had the man's spirit not been broken, lay bare <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> I had now the secret of his bitterness.|$|E
60|$|Therese {{elevated}} {{her right}} hand <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> It was broad and short with blunt fingers, as usual. The pressure of Captain Blunt’s handshake had not altered its unlovely shape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It was {{necessary}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her somewhere, so I {{asked her to}} come here. Perhaps the Duke has found out and stopped her. Anyhow, call me if she comes." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the {{following}} people for their parts in this dissertation: Kyle Lewis, <b>for</b> inspiring <b>me,</b> guiding me, and encouraging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> work to my full potential. Janet Dukerich, <b>for</b> helping <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the bigger picture at every turn. Caroline Bartel, <b>for</b> keeping <b>me</b> mindful that doing good work requires a deep understanding of the work of others. George Huber, for offering suggestions and improvements that never would have occurred <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Bill Swann, <b>for</b> working with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> navigate the sometimes-murky waters. And finally my wife Tanis, for her endless patience and tireless support...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{that may}} be a {{promising}} sign: I'll call. Or no; just you go up and ask first if she can find room <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> one or two persons on another matter. You will find me down at the carrier's.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{thing to}} do," [...] said Mrs. Tolbridge, closing her desk, at {{which she was}} writing, [...] "is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>see</b> Mrs. Drane immediately, and for you to send Cicely home {{and give her a}} lot of work to do at Cobhurst. They should go there this afternoon." ...|$|R
