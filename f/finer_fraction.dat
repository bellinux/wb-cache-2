40|$|The process {{conditions}} and fractionation efficiency of two hydrocyclone designs, a novel and a conventional conical design, were evaluated. The novel design comprised a modified inlet section, where the pulp suspension {{had to pass}} a narrow ring-shaped opening, and a very compact fractionation zone. The influence of feed concentration and <b>fine</b> <b>fraction</b> mass ratio was studied. The trials were performed with never-dried, unrefined bleached chemical softwood pulp. Fractionation efficiency was evaluated in terms of change of surface roughness of handsheets made out of the fractions and the feed pulp respectively. The fractionation efficiency increased considerably with decreasing <b>fine</b> <b>fraction</b> mass ratio, especially at higher feed concentrations. This finding prompted a hypothesis {{on the existence of}} a radial gradient in the composition of the suspension inside the novel hydrocyclone. Using the novel hydrocyclone in a feed-forward fractionation system would therefore prove to be more favourable as a larger total <b>fine</b> <b>fraction</b> of better properties can be obtained. A three-stage feed-forward fractionation system was evaluated in laboratory scale. Here, it was indeed possible to extract <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> with improved surface properties {{in each of the three}} consecutive stages. All three <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> had about the same surface roughness. The fractionation performance of the novel design was benchmarked against that of a conventional, best available technology (BAT) design. In terms of fractionation efficiency, the BAT design performed better. However, the fractions produced with the novel hydrocyclone had a much smaller difference in concentration, implying a much less pronounced enrichment of fines in the <b>fine</b> <b>fraction.</b> It is unclear, to what extent the lower share of latewood fibres and the increased fines content, respectively, contributed to the improved surface roughness of the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions.</b> However, it is clear that the lower enrichment of fines in the novel hydrocyclone makes it easier to install it in industrial applications without a need for auxiliary equipment to redistribute large water flows.   QC 20101014 </p...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of lunar softs {{are different than}} those of rocks from which they are derived. As a consequence of lunar space weathering, soils are darker and exhibit a distinctive red-sloped continuum and weaker mineral absorption bands. The accumulation of dark glass-welded aggregates (agglutinates) has been thought to account for these optical effects of space weathering on lunar soils. Spectroscopic analyses of agglutinate separates and size fractions for a suite of lunar softs presented here indicate that the agglutinate paradigm is insufficient to fully account for lunar optical alteration. It is the <b>finest</b> <b>fraction</b> of lunar soils (< 25 gm which constitute- 25 wt %) that dominates the {{optical properties}} of the bulk soil. Unlike size fractions of most silicates for which the <b>finest</b> <b>fraction</b> is the brightest, the lunar soil size fractions all have comparable albedos in the short-wavelength visible. In the near infrared, however, it is the <b>finest</b> <b>fraction</b> that exhibits the steep red continuum and weak absorption bands. The properties of the <b>finest</b> <b>fraction</b> cannot be duplicated by preparing a <b>fine</b> <b>fraction</b> by grinding larger agglutinate-rich soil particles. These results suggest space weathering on airless bodies is dominated by surface correlated processes (perhaps associated {{with the development of}} fine-grained Fe ø on or near the surface of grains), and the accumulation of the larger agglutinates is not necessarily required to account for lunar optical alteration...|$|R
50|$|The {{drainage}} {{water of the}} Panasqueira Mine is conducted to the surface through the Salgueira Gallery. This water has a pH of about 4 and contents heavy metals above the emission limit values. In the decade of 1950 a wastewater treatment plant was installed which through alkalization with addition of lime, treats the water until it precipitates the heavy metals into sludge which is then stored in the tailings dams. The treated water is pumped for use as industrial water in both the plant and the mine. Since the 50s, the mine has expanded and the effluent flow increased proportionally. In 2011 the water treatment plant was expanded and improved to treat all the water coming from the mine, the plant and the runoff of tailings dam. The effluent resulting from the treatment which is not reusable is discharged to the Bodelhão Stream, complying with the monitoring program defined in Environmental License, with monthly reporting to the competent authorities. The plant reutilizes almost all the water that it uses, due {{to the use of}} several thickners installed for this purpose.The slimes resulting from water treatment, as well as the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> of the plant tailings are stored together in tailings dams. Any effluent from these dams is returned to the water treatment plant. The tailings in granulometry of sand and gravel are sold as inert materials for civil construction.

40|$|Internal {{instability}} {{is a form}} {{of internal}} erosion in broadly graded cohesionless soils in which fine particles can be eroded at lower hydraulic gradients than predicted by classical theory for piping or heave. A key mechanism enabling internal instability is the formation of a stress-transmitting matrix dominated by the coarse particles, which leaves the finer particles under lower effective stress. In this study, discrete element modeling is used to analyze the fabric and effective stress distribution within idealized gap-graded samples with varying potential for internal stability. The reduction in stress within the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> of the materials is directly quantified from grain-scale data. The particle-size distribution, percentage <b>finer</b> <b>fraction,</b> and relative density are found to influence the stress distribution.

40|$|Mechanical pulping, {{also called}} high-yield pulping processes, are pulping systems where {{a great deal}} of effort is taken with regards to the {{fractionation}} in screens and cleaners as well as to optimize process conditions to refine the rejected fractions. The fraction that is rejected for further treatment can vary from 10 to 50 % depending on process strategy and final product which can be from printing paper, writing paper, paperboard middle layer and tissue. In practice, it is common that approximately 10 % of the pulp fibres and also {{a large part of the}} <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> have properties that are unsatisfactory in relation to the final products. Part of the less useful <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> could instead be used to produce nano-ligno-cellulose (NLC) of high value either in the main product or used for completely different purposes. In order to study the potential of this concept, treatment of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) <b>fines</b> <b>fractions</b> were studied by means of homogenization. It seems possible to homogenize fine particles of thermo-mechanical pulp (1 % w/v) to NLC. A corresponding <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> from bleached kraft pulp (BKP) was tested as a reference at 0. 5 % w/v concentration. This <b>fines</b> (BKP) <b>fraction</b> was very difficult to homogenize at a higher concentration (1 % w/v).

Fibre length-weighteddistribution plays a vital role with respect to both pressure fluctuations and clogging during treatment in the homogenizing equipment. ...|$|R

40|$|Internal {{instability}} {{is a form}} {{of internal}} erosion that can occur in embankment dams or flood embankments where the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> of the material is washed out under the action of seepage flow; if undetected this process can progress to cause embankment collapse. Gap-graded materials are particularly susceptible. Skempton and Brogan [1] proposed that a key contributor to instability is the reduced stress transmitted by the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> and that the magnitude of this reduced stress could be inferred from the hydraulic gradients observed at the initiation of particle migration in experiments. Here Skempton and Brogan’s hypothesis is assessed at the particle scale using a discrete element method (DEM) model coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This contribution discusses validation of the coupled DEM-CFD software prior to describing the simulation of a permeameter experiment. The simulation generated particlescale data at the initiation of instability by considering a gap-graded sample subject to at a hydraulic gradient of 1. 0 (upward flow). The results provide insight into the instability mechanism, most notably showing that while the particles that move under seepage flow do indeed transmit relatively small effective stress, a finite proportion of the particles that move transfer relatively large stresses...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{stability}} {{describes the}} ability of the coarse fraction of a broadly or gap-graded cohesionless soil to prevent the erosion of the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> under seepage. Two conditions for internal instability are that: (i) the fine particles carry a lower stress than the coarse particles (hydromechanical condition) and (ii) the fine particles should be small enough to pass through the void constrictions between the coarse particles (geometric condition). A complete understanding of each of these mechanisms requires consideration of the fundamental particle-scale mechanics. Discrete element modelling (DEM) uses simplified particle geometries and ideal contact models to enable systems of particles to be modelled. This paper discusses the use of DEM to look at both the hydromechanical and geometrical conditions. The discussion on the hydromechanical condition considers the hypothesis of Skempton and Brogan (1994), i. e. that a prerequisite for internal instability is a reduction of the effective stress in the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> of the soil. Particular emphasis is placed on the influnce of relative density. To assess the geometric condition a constriction size distribution (CSD) must be derived from the DEM analysis results.

40|$|In {{respect to}} a sieving study of sediments in three {{different}} sediment locations (Wadden Sea (A), river Elbe-Aestuar (B), Baltic Sea (C)) a determination of selected organic compounds were carried out to study {{the influence of the}} sieving process on the variance of cofactors and analytical results. The organic pollutants PCB, Organochlorpesticides (OCP) and PAH were investigated in three <b>fine</b> sediment <b>fractions</b> and < 63 #mu#m of the locations by accredited and standardised methods. At the same time the cofactor Organic Carbon (TOC) as well as Total Carbon (TC) and Total Nitrogen (TN) were determined in the <b>fine</b> sediment <b>fractions.</b> The endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A could be detected in the sediment locations B and C. The comparison of TOC, TC and TN average values by t-test showed significant differences between the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> of location B and C. Because of low TOC values no signification was detectable in sediment A. The results show that the TOC values in fine sediments are affected by sieving. An enrichment of carbon was detected in the < 63 #mu#m fraction in consideration of variance. A correlation between the cofactor TOC and the organic pollutant values could only be detected in the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> of location B. The enrichment of pollutant values in the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> was here analogue of TOC. For a comprehensive evaluation of the cofactor TOC no sufficient sieving sample materials were available in this study for location A and C.
