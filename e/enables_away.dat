Central to this is the use of actions that are contrary to those forming the baseline plot within a principled mechanism for their semi-automatic production. It is important that such newly created domain content should still be human-readable and to this end labels for new actions and predicates are generated automatically using antonyms selected from a range of on-line lexical resources.

We identify the limits of understanding EM though the framework of ecological modernization, and show how political ecology and work- place studies provide important departures towards a more critical approach. Developing these further, into a cosmopolitical direction, we propose studying EM as sets of socially and materially situated practices. This <b>enables</b> a shift <b>away</b> from established approaches which treat EM either as a toolbox whose efficiency has to be assessed, or as simply the implementation of dominant projects and the materialisation of hegemonic discourse.

40|$|Many exotic {{phenomena}} in strongly correlated electron systems {{emerge from the}} interplay between spin and motional degrees of freedom. For example, doping an antiferromagnet gives rise to interesting phases including pseudogap states and high-temperature superconductors. A promising route towards achieving a complete understanding of these materials begins with analytic and computational analysis of simplified models. Quantum simulation has recently emerged as a complementary approach towards understanding these models. Ultracold fermions in optical lattices offer the potential to answer open questions on the low-temperature regime of the doped Hubbard model, which is thought to capture essential aspects of the cuprate superconductor phase diagram but is numerically intractable in that parameter regime. A new perspective is afforded by quantum gas microscopy of fermions, which allows readout of magnetic correlations at the site-resolved level. Here we report the realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a 2 D square lattice of approximately 80 sites. Using site-resolved imaging, we detect (finite-size) antiferromagnetic long-range order (LRO) {{through the development of}} a peak in the spin structure factor and the divergence of the correlation length that reaches the size of the system. At our lowest temperature of T/t = 0. 25 (2) we find strong order across the entire sample. Our experimental platform <b>enables</b> doping <b>away</b> from half filling, where pseudogap states and stripe ordering are expected, but theoretical methods become numerically intractable.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine why large, complex private and public {{organizations}} often fail to develop and implement innovation. This study identifies barriers that deter innovation in six areas: bureaucratic structures; leadership; mindsets; organizational culture; core capabilities and market/environment conditions. The study builds a conceptual model of the barriers to innovation, and suggests a number of structural, leadership and "corporate camouflage" strategies that innovators and intrapreneurs can use to overcome the "innovation killers" inherent in large bureaucracies. The paper focuses on both the barriers that prevent unique innovation stages and a range of innovation types that includes process, complex, radical and disruptive innovation. The study examines both internal and external inhibitors of innovation and their inter-dependencies. A comprehensive literature review provides the basis for a detailed discussion of the characteristics of large organizations and the barriers to innovation. Innovation, with the exception of limited process innovation, faces significant if not insurmountable barriers in large organizations. No single cause prevents the innovation process. The barriers and the reasons for the barriers are varied. Rigid organizational structures reinforced by a rules-based culture and risk-adverse leadership focus on short-term results, efficiency, current core capabilities, and existing market dominance. The outcomes provide poor soil for innovation. The characteristics of an organization’s leadership and the cultural and mindset dynamics that result may enable or inhibit creativity and innovation, but often reflect an organizational intolerance of "change agents" and innovators. Markets, the structure of competition and high barriers to entry also play a significant role acting as “deterring” barriers for organizations seeking to take innovation beyond marginal improvements. The strategies recommended for diluting and overcoming barriers to innovation include internal or independent innovation capabilities, new models of creativity that enable leaders to innovate, raising the entrepreneurial calibre of leadership, strengthening the motivation of innovators, and <b>enabling</b> shifts <b>away</b> from current core capabilities.

The critical cytoskeletal rearrangements underpinning these mutual repulsion events are currently unknown. We found that during fibroblast cell–cell collisions, microtubules at the region of contact increase their frequency of catastrophe, their rates of shrinkage and growth, and concomitantly, a new microtubule array is established at a new leading edge. We show that Rho and ROCK activity is necessary for this repulsion response, and we observed increased microtubule stabilisation {{as a consequence of}} ROCK inhibition. Importantly, partial destabilisation of microtubules, by co-treatment with a low dose of nocodazole, restored microtubule dynamics to that of untreated cells and rescued contact inhibition of locomotion in ROCK-inhibited cells. Although there was an increase in microtubule growth or shrinkage rates in Y 27632 cell–cell collisions, these failed to reach the same level of dynamicity compared with untreated collisions.
