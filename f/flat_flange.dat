40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} cold-formed steel channel columns with complex stiffeners {{is performed using}} finite element analysis. An accurate and reliable finite element model {{is used for the}} parametric study in which different sizes of complex stiffeners are investigated. Column strengths predicted by the finite element analysis are compared with the unfactored design column strengths calculated using the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths obtained from the specification and standard are generally conservative for fixed-ended cold-formed steel channel columns with complex stiffeners for the more slender sections having a plate thickness of 1 mm with the <b>flat</b> <b>flange</b> width to thickness ratio of 57, but unconservative for sections having a plate thickness of 2 mm with the <b>flat</b> <b>flange</b> width to thickness ratio of 27.

40|$|Concentric {{installation}} of a pilot fuel assembly in an opening in a gas turbine combustor casing is achieved by providing a boss having at least two flat surfaces which are perpendicular {{to each other on}} the combustor casing surrounding the opening and a mounting flange having at least two flat surfaces which are perpendicular to each other on the pilot fuel assembly. The pilot fuel assembly is concentrically installed to the combustor casing by inserting the assembly into the combustor casing opening, and moving the pilot fuel assembly as far as it will go in a first direction substantially parallel to one of the flat boss surfaces. The distance between the other flat boss surface and one of the <b>flat</b> <b>flange</b> surfaces is then taken. Next, the pilot fuel assembly is moved in the direction opposite the first direction, at which point, the distance between the same two flat surfaces is again measured. Lastly, the pilot fuel assembly is located at a position where the distance between the two measuring surfaces is equal to the average of the first and second measurements. If desired, these steps can be repeated back and forth along an axis perpendicular to the first and second directions...|$|E
40|$|The pH {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} {{that determine}} heavy metal mobility and fate in soils and sediments. It is well known that the resistance of soil to a change in pH strongly affects the mobilization of heavy metals in the soil. Different single and sequential extraction tests and pHstat leaching tests (at constant pH) have been developed for the study of the influence of a pH-decrease on the heavy metal release from the soil. Nevertheless, the acid-base reactions in a soil-water mixture are not as fast as those that take place in the aqueous phase. This kinetic control makes that the determination of the buffer capacity of the soil (usually the acid neutralization capacity, ANC) cannot be obtained as straightforward as an acid-base titration. The buffer capacity of a soil is usually determined by the addition of different amounts of acid to several aliquots of a soil-water mixture. The slurries pHs and heavy metal concentration in the aqueous phase are determined after a nominal time at which the equilibrium is assumed to be reached (from 24 to 72 hours). As for the pHstat leaching test, the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) corresponds to the amount of acid added to a soil-water suspension to keep the pH at a predefined constant value, so an ANC is obtained for each reference pH. The main inconvenience of the latter approach is that the acid neutralization can be slow at certain pH values and therefore, the acid addition rate should be adequately modified, leading to longer tests (from 24 to 96 hours) This work aims the study of the influence of the pH on the retention of lead in a soil from the mining district of Linares (Spain) contaminated by heavy metals. The methodology used here is similar to the aforementioned ones, but in this case, the acid addition rate is predefined to a value more than 3 times higher than a threshold value above which the pH versus time curve is independent of the rate of acid addition. The feasibility of the electrokinetic technique for the remediation of this soil is assessed from the results obtained with three different acid solutions (nitric, acetic or EDTA) and the lead fractionation in the soil, according to the BCR method, at the end of each experiment. The experimental system used basically consists of a 2 L reaction vessel with <b>flat</b> <b>flange</b> and mechanical agitator that contains the initial water/soil mixture (1. 2 L/ 0. 4 kg). The reactor is closed with a glass lid with <b>flat</b> <b>flange</b> and 5 ground-glass necks. Two of these necks allow the assembling of a pH electrode and of a sampling system for the withdrawal of aqueous samples. Through a third neck of the reactor lid, the desired reagent solution is added at the predefined rate, while the evolution over time of pH values in the water-soil mixture is registered. At selected times; samples of 10 mL were withdrawn for the determination of Pb concentrations in the aqueous phase. The results indicate that the solubilization of the 40 % of the lead present in the soil is achieved at pH values of about 6. 5, 5 and 2. 5 for Na 2 EDTA, acetic- and nitric- acid respectively. 12 th International Symposium on Electrokinetic Remediation, EREM 2013 by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and the FEDER fund of the EU through the Research Project ERHMES, CTM 2012 - 16824 and the UE project Electroacross IRSES-GA- 2010 269289...|$|E

40|$|Series of {{manufacturing}} {{processes such as}} coiling-uncoiling, cold forming and hole cutting processes involved {{in the making of}} truck frame rail sections leave certain amount {{of manufacturing}} imperfections into the frame rail. As the manufacturing imperfections in the form of residual stresses {{play a significant role in}} determining the dynamic structural behavior of truck frame rail members, a careful assessment of residual stresses resulting from coiling-uncoiling and cold forming processes is needed. In the present investigation, non-linear Finite Element (FE) simulation of coiling-uncoiling and cold forming processes were carried out and the resulting residual stresses in frame rail corner, <b>flat</b> web and <b>flange</b> sections were compared with the experimentally measured residual stress values using X-ray diffraction technique. It is observed that in corner sections, the numerically predicted residual stresses are in close agreement with the experimentally measured residual stresses in forming (transverse) direction. In the direction perpendicular to forming (longitudinal direction), while the trends of numerical and experimental residual stresses are observed to follow the same pattern, some deviation in stress values are observed in the inner half of the corner sections. As the coiling-uncoiling process is the main cause for the residual stress presence in <b>flat</b> web and <b>flange</b> sections, the computed coiling-uncoiling residual stresses in longitudinal directions are compared with experimentally measured residual stresses in frame web sections and the trends are observed to be in good agreement...|$|R

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} a new docking system to support future space exploration missions to low Earth orbit, the Moon, and other destinations. A key component of this system is the seal at the main docking interface which inhibits the loss of cabin air once docking is complete. Depending on the mission, the seal {{must be able to}} dock in either a seal-on-flange or seal-on-seal configuration. Seal-on-flange mating would occur when a docking system equipped with a seal docks to a system with a <b>flat</b> metal <b>flange.</b> This would occur when a vehicle docks to a node on the International Space Station. Seal-on-seal mating would occur when two docking systems equipped with seals dock to each other. Two types of seal designs were identified for this application: Gask-O-seals and multi-piece seals. Both types of seals had a pair of seal bulbs to satisfy the redundancy requirement. A series of performance assessments and comparisons were made between the candidate seal designs indicating that they meet the requirements for leak rate and compression and adhesion loads under a range of operating conditions. Other design factors such as part count, integration into the docking system tunnel, seal-on-seal mating, and cost were also considered leading to the selection of the multi-piece seal design for the new docking system. The results of this study can be used by designers of future docking systems and other habitable volumes to select the seal design best-suited for their particular application...|$|R
40|$|A {{multifaceted}} {{program to}} study high gradient structures and properties of RF breakdown {{is under way}} at SLAC. This program includes testing of simplified versions of traveling wave and standing wave structures at 11. 4 GHz. [Dolgashev] RF power is fed into these structures using a TE 01 mode-launcher. An RF flange is used to connect the mode-launcher to the test-structure. The rf currents flow through either the stainless steel lip on the flange or, in an alternate assembly, through a copper gasket pressed between the same stainless steel lips. In a recent experiment with a single cell traveling wave structure, a flange with stainless steel lips was irreversibly damaged at RF power about 90 MW and {approx} 100 ns pulse length. We suggest an alternative flange that does not rely on metal-to-metal contact in the rf power transfer region. The idea is to use an asymmetric choke flange, where the choke grove is cut into a conflate flange on the mode-launcher. The structures themselves will have a simpler, <b>flat</b> conflate <b>flange</b> with rounded corners on the vacuum side. The Vacuum seal is achieved with a Cu gasket between these two flanges above the RF region. We have designed a flange with a choke which is almost field free in the vacuum gasket region, whose technical specifications and RF properties are presented below. Design simulations were conducted using HFSS, a 3 D finite element code that solves electromagnetic fields in complex structures. Figure 1 demonstrates the projected physical look of the choke flange, while {{the table next to}} it lists the critical parameters.

Figure 2 demonstrates the electric field strength profile in the geometry for 100 MW input power. The maximum magnetic field for in this geometry is near the pipe at 59 kA/m for 100 MW input.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the research and}} evaluation of the gaskets used in pipe systems. Referring to the title "Failure Analysis of Pipe Joint Gaskets Spiral wound”, this gasket is suitable for use in piping systems Spiral wound gasket designs are typically used in <b>flat</b> faced pipe <b>flanges.</b> They are also often used in pump applications with recessed flanges. Spiral wound gasket {{is an important component}} in the pipe system, this is because it functions as an additional component during the installation process pipe. It works to prevent the occurrence of leakage in the pipe connection system. These gaskets also have the distinct advantages that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures because the material used for manufacturing is gasket material that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures. Gasket is made up of several main sections, "inner ring, filler, and outer ring. " Each section has its own features to prevent the leakage occurred. This matter to avoid the accident happened to the workers in this sector. The methodology of this project through the drawing spiral wound gasket using solid works and convert the drawing into Algor software. The mechanical test like tensile test, hardness test and metallurgical test also conduct in this project. All of the result has been discussed in this project and has been compared with other result. The mechanical test result has been record in this project, this is needed for the comparison between the analysis result. For the Algor analysis, it has been through the simulation to find stress and strain for the spiral wound gasket. For this analysis pressure (100 kN and 500 kN) has been applied in both directions. This is important to compare the value of the analysis to know the better type of gasket. From all analysis and result the gasket can be selected follow on the durability of the gasket from the result. Spiral wound gasket with inner ring has been recommended for using in the flanges system because it more durability than the spiral wound gasket without inner ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop tools for {{understanding}} the influence of crystal quality and crystal mounting on harmonic-generation efficiency at high irradiance. Measuring the homogeneity of crystals interferometrically, making detailed physics calculations of conversion efficiency, performing finite- element modeling of mounted crystals, and designing a new optical metrology tool were key elements in obtaining that understanding. For this work, we used the following frequency-tripling scheme: type I second- harmonic generation followed by type II sum-frequency mixing of the residual fundamental and the second harmonic light. The doubler was potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), and the tripler was deuterated KDP (KD*P). With this scheme, near-infrared light (1053 nm) can be frequency tripled (to 351 nm) at high efficiency (theoretically > 90 %) for high irradiance (> 3 GW/cm&sup 2;). Spatial variations in the birefringence of the large crystals studied here (37 to 41 cm square by about 1 cm thick) imply that the ideal phase-matching orientation of the crystal {{with respect to the}} incident laser beam varies across the crystal. We have shown that phase-measuring interferometry can be used to measure these spatial variations. We observed transmitted wavefront differences between orthogonally polarized interferograms of {lambda}/ 50 to {lambda}/ 100, which correspond to index variations of order 10 - 6. On some plates that we measured, the standard deviation of angular errors is 22 - 23 µrad; this corresponds to a 1 % reduction in efficiency. Because these conversion crystals are relatively thin, their surfaces are not flat (deviate by k 2. 5 urn from flat). A crystal is mounted against a precision-machined surface that supports the crystal on four edges. This mounting surface is not flat either (deviates by + 2. 5 µm from <b>flat).</b> A retaining <b>flange</b> presses a compliant element against the crystal. The load thus applied near the edges of the crystal surface holds it in place. We performed detailed finite-element modeling to predict the resulting shape of the mounted crystal. The prediction agreed with measurements of mounted crystals. We computed the physics of the frequency-conversion process to better quantify the effects on efficiency of variation in the crystal� s axis, changes {{in the shape of the}} crystal, and mounting-induced stress. We were able to accurately predict the frequency-conversion performance of 37 -cm square crystals on Beamlet, a one-beam scientific prototype of the NIF laser architecture, using interferometric measurements of the mounted crystals and the model. In a 2 {omega} measurement campaign, the model predicted 64. 9 % conversion efficiency; 64. 1 % was observed. When detuned by 640 µrad, the model and measurement agreement is even better (both were 10. 4 %). Finally, we completed the design and initial testing of a new optical metrology tool to measure the spatial variation of frequency conversion. This system employs a high-power subaperture beam from a commercial laser oscillator and rod amplifier. The beam interrogates the crystal� s aperture by moving the crystal horizontally on a translation stage and translating the laser beam vertically on an optical periscope. Precision alignment is maintained by means of a full-aperture reference mirror, a precision-machined surface on the crystal mount, and autocollimators (the goal for angular errors is 10 µrad). The autocollimators track the mounting angle of the crystal and the direction of the laser beam with respect to the reference mirror. The conversion efficiency can be directly measured by recording l{omega}, 2 {omega}, 3 {omega} energy levels during the scan and by rocking (i. e., tilting) the crystal mount over an angular range...|$|R
