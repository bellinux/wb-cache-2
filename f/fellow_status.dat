50|$|In the pre-Qin time, {{the social}} {{status of a}} {{retainer}} was not an inferior one. A master, though much superior in political and social status {{as well as in}} wealth, had to treat his retainers politely. But guests did not all have the same status, nor were they all treated the same. As a rule, those who engaged in humble occupation and were looked down upon by society were also held in less respect as retainers. A man without special ability was also considered inferior by his master and his <b>fellow</b> retainers.The <b>status</b> of retainers in the Later Han, and especially in the era of the Three Kingdoms, was markedly inferior; retainers were asked to engage in productive and menial labor and were treated more like slaves or servants.|$|R

40|$|Chinese tourists, who are {{increasingly}} traveling out of Asia independently, need trustworthy and readily available information sources. This study explores {{the motives of}} Chinese tourists who have invested considerable time (mostly more than a week) in creating information-rich, influential, and interactive online travel blogs—effectively creating personalized little "Lonely Planets" that serve these growing information needs. This study assesses the {{demographic characteristics of the}} "Lonely Planets" creators, the features of their blogging behavior, and the motivations for the involvement. It reveals six motive categories: "positive self-enhancement through online social connection," "altruism: being helpful to <b>fellow</b> travelers," "social <b>status</b> issues," "personal status and achievement," "self-documentation and sharing," and "hedonic enjoyment of blogging. " Superficially, these motivations seem to be similar with previous Western studies of blogging behavior, but significant contextual and cultural issues exist and are explained. Management implications and future research arising from the current study are provided...|$|R
50|$|Australian podiatric {{surgeons}} are specialist podiatrists {{with further}} training in advanced medicine, advanced pharmacology, {{and training in}} foot surgery. Podiatrists wishing to pursue specialisation in podiatric surgery must meet the requirements for Fellowship with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. They first complete a degree of 4 years, which includes 2 years of didactic study and 2 years of clinical experience. Following this, a master's degree must be completed with focus on biomechanics, medicine, surgery, general surgery, advanced pharmacology, advanced medical imaging and clinical pathology. They then qualify for the status of Registrar with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. Following surgical training with a podiatric surgeon (3-5 years), rotations within other medical and surgeons' disciplines, overseas clinical rotations, and passing oral and written exams, Registrars may qualify for Fellowship <b>status.</b> <b>Fellows</b> are then given Commonwealth accreditation under the Health Insurance Act to be recognised as providers of professional attention, {{for the purposes of}} health insurance rebates.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses {{not only on}} the impact of students' {{achievement}} motivation, but also on the influence of achievement motivation of <b>fellow</b> students on <b>status</b> and growth in language and math achievement across Grades 7 and 8. The achievement motivation of schoolmates may create a learning environment that facilitates or impedes learning above and beyond what would be expected {{on the basis of the}} individual student's achievement motivation, intelligence and background characteristics. Data from the LOSO-project, a longitudinal study in secondary education, have been analysed using multilevel linear growth curve modeling. It turns out that the effect of achievement motivation, both of individuals and in groups, should not be neglected in explanations of individual progress in achievement, even when ability and background characteristics such as the socio-economic status, age, sex and home language have been controlled for. In addition, the data suggest that especially boys with poor achievement motivation at the start of secondary education are at risk of falling behind with regard to language achievement in the subsequent years. </span...|$|R
