5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the people}} who were {{scheduled}} to be on Eastland was 20-year-old George Halas, an American football player, who was delayed leaving for the dock, and arrived after the ship had capsized. Despite stories to the contrary, no reliable evidence indicates Jack Benny was aboard Eastland or scheduled to be on the excursion; possibly the basis <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> was that Eastland was a training vessel during World War I and Jack Benny received his training in the Great Lakes naval base, where Eastland was stationed.|$|E

His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible, although he was more conservative about its destructive power than Mark Oliphant and his British colleagues.|$|E

When Hockins and Ebony were left, as we have seen, to mix their [...] "powders," [...] the former, being a {{reckless}} man, forgot to put his pipe out, and Ebony being a careless man, (as regarded himself), did not observe the omission. The consequence was that the seaman kept on puffing and emitting sage reflections to his admiring friend while they mixed their compounds in concert.|$|E
