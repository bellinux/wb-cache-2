It {{can also be}} used to help treat harlequin <b>ichthyosis,</b> lamellar <b>ichthyosis</b> and is used in xeroderma pigmentosum cases to relieve keratoses. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. It is also used for treatment of neuroblastoma, a form of nerve cancer.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin, {{also known}} as 13-cis-retinoic acid (and colloquially {{referred}} to by its former brand name Accutane), is a medication primarily used to treat severe acne. Rarely, it {{is also used to}} prevent certain skin cancers (squamous-cell carcinoma), and in the treatment of other cancers. It is used to treat harlequin-type <b>ichthyosis,</b> a usually lethal skin disease, and lamellar <b>ichthyosis.</b> It is a retinoid, meaning it is related to vitamin A, and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Its isomer, tretinoin, is also an acne drug.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid as a {{medication}} is used most commonly to help remove the outer {{layer of the}} skin. As such {{it is used to}} treat warts, psoriasis, dandruff, acne, ringworm, and <b>ichthyosis.</b>|$|E

500|$|Reptile {{featured}} in director Kevin Tancharoen's 2010 short film , a grittier, more realistic {{take on the}} MK canon. He was played by Richard Dorton and depicted therein as a cannibalistic criminal who eats his victims' heads after killing them.

500|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{travel to}} Gibsonton to {{investigate}} a 28-year series of attacks by an unknown assailant {{in a community of}} former circus sideshow performers.

[...] Urea 40% [...] "dissolves the intercellular matrix" [...] of the nail plate. Only diseased or dystrophic nails are removed, as there is no effect on healthy portions of the nail.

2500|$|The {{compound}} 13-cis {{retinoic acid}} was first {{studied in the}} 1960s at Roche Laboratories in Switzerland by Werner Bollag {{as a treatment for}} skin cancer. [...] Experiments completed in 1971 showed that the compound was likely to be ineffective for cancer and, surprisingly, that it could be useful to treat acne. [...] However, they also showed that the compound was likely to cause birth defects, so in light of the events around [...] thalidomide, Roche abandoned the product. In 1975, Gary Peck and Frank Yoder independently rediscovered the drug's use as a treatment of cystic acne while studying it as a treatment for lamellar <b>ichthyosis,</b> and published that work. [...] Roche resumed work on the drug. In clinical trials, subjects were carefully screened to avoid including women who were or might become pregnant. [...] Roche's New Drug Application for isotretinoin for the treatment of acne included data showing that the drug caused birth defects in rabbits. The FDA approved the application in 1982.|$|E

For this reason it is known as common <b>ichthyosis.</b> It is usually an autosomal dominant inherited disease (often associated with filaggrin), although a rare non-heritable version called acquired <b>ichthyosis</b> exists.|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms can vary enormously, from the mildest, most common, type such as <b>ichthyosis</b> vulgaris {{which may be}} mistaken for normal dry skin up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin type <b>ichthyosis.</b> <b>Ichthyosis</b> vulgaris {{accounts for more than}} 95% of cases.|$|E

50|$|There {{are more}} than 20 types of <b>ichthyosis</b> which range in {{severity}} of symptoms, outward appearance, underlying genetic cause, and mode of inheritance (e.g., whether the abnormal gene inherited is dominant, recessive, autosomal, or X-linked). <b>Ichthyosis</b> comes from the ἰχθύς, since dry, scaly skin is the defining feature {{of all forms of}} <b>ichthyosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most cases (approximately 75%) of {{collodion}} {{baby will}} go on to develop a type of autosomal recessive congenital <b>ichthyosis</b> (either lamellar <b>ichthyosis</b> or congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema).|$|E
5000|$|X-linked <b>ichthyosis,</b> {{a form of}} <b>ichthyosis</b> {{caused by}} a {{hereditary}} deficiency of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme. It is fairly rare, affecting one in 2,000 to one in 6,000 males.|$|E
5000|$|This term {{is used to}} {{describe}} {{a certain type of}} <b>ichthyosis,</b> a congenital skin condition. Lamellar <b>Ichthyosis</b> often presents with a [...] "colloidal" [...] membrane at birth. It is characterized by generalized dark scaling.|$|E
50|$|He {{is remembered}} for his {{research}} of <b>ichthyosis</b> congenita, a disease he classified into three types based on severity (<b>ichthyosis</b> congenita gravis, mitis and tarda). In 1900 he published Über Ichtyosis congenita regarding the disorder.|$|E
50|$|CIE has {{symptoms}} {{very similar}} to Lamellar <b>ichthyosis</b> (LI) but milder and {{is considered by many}} scientists to be a variant of that disease, so both diseases are grouped under the title autosomal recessive congenital <b>ichthyosis</b> (ARCI).|$|E
