5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their status. Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change <b>in</b> <b>wealth</b> could affect an individuals status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars {{led to the}} {{separation}} of Norway and Denmark. Norway was restored in 1814 as an autonomous kingdom in a personal union with Sweden. The two states had separate institutions, except for the king and the foreign service. Regained statehood required new public buildings, mainly {{in the capital of}} Christiania. During the following century, the country experienced an impressive growth <b>in</b> <b>wealth</b> and population, resulting in a need for new infrastructure and buildings.|$|E

5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap <b>in</b> <b>wealth,</b> and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of urbanization in Africa, they created mobile cities. If the land was no longer suitable for crops, then the people would have to change their location.The importance of <b>Wealth</b> <b>in</b> People in Africa {{could be related to}} the people in Africa having a primacy of exit. With there being so much land around, if the people did not like the way a ruler was leading, they could leave and start a new settlement. When the European settlers came, they also acknowledged the importance of <b>Wealth</b> <b>in</b> People. This is seen with European men like the laçandos who married prominent African women in order to gain more connections for trading. Additionally <b>Wealth</b> <b>in</b> People is also connected to <b>Wealth</b> <b>in</b> Knowledge. <b>Wealth</b> <b>in</b> Knowledge and <b>Wealth</b> <b>in</b> People are closely related; they both focus on the number of people or things that a person knows as a marker of his or her power in African society. This emphasis of knowledge could also be related to the heavy presence of oral history in African society. The griots were African oral historians and were highly ranked in society. The ability to learn the history like the Sundiata epic became a sacred tradition passed between father and son.|$|R

40|$|We discuss {{evolution}} of personal <b>wealth</b> <b>in</b> transition economies. While the data availability {{is still a}} problem, the available indirect evidence suggests privatization has resulted in an increase <b>in</b> personal <b>wealth</b> but also <b>in</b> personal <b>wealth</b> inequality – especially in the countries that lagged behind in building effective institutions. Another source of wealth inequality is the high income inequality due to wage decompression coupled with the low saving rates among the poor. We pay a special attention {{to one of the}} most noticeable implications of this rise <b>in</b> personal <b>wealth</b> and wealth inequality – the emergence of so called “oligarchs”. Using the comprehensive dataset of Muscovites’ incomes we show that surveys that do not take into account the first- and second-tier rich (billionaires and millionaires) may drastically underestimate inequality...|$|R

25|$|Cities arose and flourished, {{especially}} in Flanders and Brabant. As the cities grew <b>in</b> <b>wealth</b> and power, {{they started to}} buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign, including city rights, the right to self-government {{and the right to}} pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were Brugge and Antwerp (in Flanders) which would later develop into {{some of the most important}} cities and ports in Europe.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, {{died from}} wounds and disease, {{and many more}} were left {{crippled}} and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses <b>in</b> <b>wealth.</b> In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi {{had been more than}} $500 million, of which $218 million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177 million.|$|E
40|$|We re-examine {{the link}} between changes <b>in</b> housing <b>wealth,</b> {{financial}} wealth, and consumer spending. We extend a panel of U. S. states observed quarterly during the seventeen-year period, 1982 through 1999, to the thirty-one year period, 1978 through 2009. Using techniques reported previously, we impute the aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial assets, and measures of aggregate consumption {{for each of the}} geographic units over time. We estimate regression models in levels, first differences and in error-correction form, relating per capita consumption to per capita income and wealth. We find a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon household consumption. This effect is consistently larger than the effect of stock market wealth upon consumption. This reinforces the conclusions reported in our previous analysis. In contrast to our previous analysis, however, we do find – based on data which include the recent volatility in asset markets – that the effects of declines <b>in</b> housing <b>wealth</b> <b>in</b> reducing consumption are at least as large as the effects of increases <b>in</b> housing <b>wealth</b> <b>in</b> increasing the course of household consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of spatial inequality <b>in</b> gross housing <b>wealth</b> <b>in</b> the UK. Our results challenge recent research findings in the UK that suggest inexorable rises <b>in</b> housing <b>wealth</b> inequality. We argue that such findings are illusory, arising {{in part from the}} use of final period price levels to categorise areas into low and high house price locations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the bias that final period categorisation introduces and we then estimate how gross housing wealth inequality changes over time using a battery of measures. All our results indicate that there is evidence of cycles <b>in</b> housing <b>wealth</b> inequality but no evidence of an upward trend. Most surprisingly, the cycles in inequality are found to be of very large amplitude and this may have important effects on consumption, work incentives and business formation. We also find that the entire distribution of house values has shifted which is likely to imply a growing gulf <b>in</b> housing <b>wealth</b> between owners and renters over the period considered...|$|R

On 13 July, Waller's army was destroyed at the Battle of Roundway Down.|$|E
