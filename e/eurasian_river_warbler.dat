Results are combined withother available tracer observations to analyze water mass composition at Fram Strait. Acombination of Pacific water and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>river</b> runoff dominated (> 80 % and > 10 % of thetotal mass, respectively) the upper East Greenland Current (EGC), while the remainder ofthe section was dominated by North Atlantic water. A much smaller contribution of Pacificwater to the EGC (50 %) at Fram Strait in 1987 suggests that this component can be quitevariable in time. North American river water was not detectable at Fram Strait in 1998. Presumably, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>river</b> water we observed at Fram Strait transited eastward alongshelf within the Arctic, mixed with Pacific water {{in the vicinity of the}} East Siberian Sea, andwas borne by the transpolar drift across the Arctic Ocean. In the absence of significant netice formation along the way such a pathway can be expected to produce more pronouncedfreshening of the EGC than when <b>Eurasian</b> <b>river</b> water mixes more directly off shelf intosalty Atlantic waters and Pacific water is diverted largely through the Canadian archipelago.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the variability of the Arctic freshwater (FW) export to the North Atlantic, using a simulation from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM), version 3, which includes passive tracers that track the movement of FW from the different FW sources in the Arctic. We find that in Fram Strait the FW export is mainly composed of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>river</b> runoff and FW of Pacific origin, whereas the FW export through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) is mainly composed of Pacific FW and North American runoff. The FW export variability is found to be related to changes in the large-scale atmospheric forcing over the Arctic, and not to changes in the FW input. We show that the details of the export variability are different for the export through Fram Strait and the CAA, with a much larger influence of salinity changes in the Fram Strait outflow than in the CAA, where the FW export variability is dominated by velocity anomalies. This difference explains the higher correlation of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index with the liquid FW export through the CAA than through Fram Strait. The export of FW from different sources also shows differences in the correlation with the AO index, with much larger correlations between the export of Pacific FW, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>river</b> runoff, and North American river runoff and the AO than for the total liquid FW export...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{and climate}} change {{projections}} forced by greenhouse gas emissions have indicated a wetting trend in northern high latitudes, evidenced by increasing <b>Eurasian</b> Arctic <b>river</b> discharges 1, 2, 3. The increase in river discharge has accelerated in the latest decade and an unprecedented, record high discharge occurred in 2007 along with an extreme loss of Arctic summer sea-ice cover 4, 5, 6. Studies have ascribed this increasing discharge to various factors attributable to local global warming effects, including intensifying precipitation minus evaporation, thawing permafrost, increasing greenness and reduced plant transpiration 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. However, no agreement has been reached and causal physical processes remain unclear. Here we show that enhancement of poleward atmospheric moisture transport (AMT) decisively contributes to increased <b>Eurasian</b> Arctic <b>river</b> discharges. Net AMT into the <b>Eurasian</b> Arctic <b>river</b> basins captures 98 % of the gauged climatological river discharges. The trend of 2. 6 % net AMT increase per decade accounts well for the 1. 8 % per decade increase in gauged discharges and also suggests an increase in underlying soil moisture. A radical shift of the atmospheric circulation pattern induced an unusually large AMT and warm surface in 2006 – 2007 over Eurasia, resulting in the record high discharge...|$|R

40|$|Bird sound {{classification}} {{and recognition}} using wavelets In this paper a new method for automatic classification {{and recognition of}} bird sounds is presented. Our main idea is to study, how inharmonic and transient bird sounds can be recognized efficiently. The data consisted of sounds of eight bird species. Five species, the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the Graylag Goose (Anser anser), the Corncrake (Crex crex), the <b>River</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Locustella fluviatilis), and the Magpie (Pica pica) have inharmonic sounds, whereas the remaining three reference species, the Quail (Coturnix coturnix), the Spotted Crake (Porzana porzana), and the Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) have harmonic sounds. The wavelet analysis was selected due to its ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information, {{and its ability to}} analyse signals which contain discontinuities and sharp spikes. The feature vectors calculated with the proposed algorithm from the wavelet coefficients were used as the inputs of two neural networks, the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP).

To date, for freshwater crabs, one endemic subgenus within the genus Potamon, Potamon (Himalayapot-amon) Pretzmann, 1966, has been described from the Himalayas. This subgenus includes two species, Potamon atkinsonianum (Wood-Mason, 1871) and Potamon emphysetum (Alcock, 1909). The taxonomic position of these two species is reconsidered. The subgenus Himalayapotamon is raised to generic level and its systematic and zoogeographic position is discussed. Based mainly on the morphology of the male copulatory system, Him-alayapotamon belongs to the family Potamidae. It is more related to the Eurasian genus Potamon Savigny, and is distinct from the South-East Asian genus Potamiscus {{as well as from the}} Indian freshwater crabs of the family Gecarcinucidae.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. Since the 1930 s, streamflow from <b>Eurasian</b> <b>rivers</b> {{discharging}} to the Arctic Ocean {{has been}} increasing. Much {{of this change}} {{has been attributed to}} increased precipitation, but recent studies show inconsistencies in long-term streamflow and precipitation trends. Alternatively, these inconsistencies may imply a release of water from storage via permafrost degradation. For many of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>rivers,</b> an increase in annual streamflow volume has been accompanied by a shift in seasonality. However, the signature of these changes in forcings and/or internal hydrologic dynamics are potentially confounded by the construction and operation of large reservoirs on many of the region's major rivers. A combination of data analysis and macroscale hydrological modeling are used to explore the controls on observed changes in annual and seasonal streamflow for several basins in the Eurasian Arctic. This work comprises three related studies. First, by comparing trends in observed streamflow and precipitation for a number of periods between 1936 and 2000, we find that streamflow trends generally exceeded precipitation trends for the permafrost basins (likely due to permafrost degradation), whereas precipitation trends generally exceeded streamflow trends over the non-permafrost basins (likely due to increased summer evapotranspiration). Second, using a physically-based reservoir model coupled to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model, we find that, while reservoir construction and operation apparently had little effect on long-term annual streamflow trends, they are responsible for much of the observed increases in winter and early spring streamflow from the regulated basins. Third, by applying the VIC model over the Eurasian Arctic, we explored the roles of evapotranspiration, snowpack storage, and soil moisture storage (both liquid and frozen) in contributing to discrepancies between monthly precipitation and streamflow trends. Evapotranspiration influenced streamflow trends between May and September, while the effects of snowpack dynamics (the greatest contributor to seasonal streamflow changes) were greatest during the spring snowmelt and the fall onset of snowpack accumulation. The effects of soil moisture dynamics on streamflow changes were dominant during the snow-free season, although for some permafrost basins, an increase in active layer depth likely resulted in greater baseflow into the fall and early winter...|$|R

30|$|River {{discharge}} into the Arctic Ocean {{is a highly}} effective conveyor in transporting continental heat across Eurasia (Nghiem et al. 2014) under a warming climate with increasing temperatures (Fig.  2). <b>Eurasian</b> <b>rivers</b> with immense watersheds, particularly the Severnaya Dvina, Pechora, Ob, Yenisei, Lena, and Kolyma Rivers, provide a massive flux of warm waters into the Arctic Ocean or peripheral seas contributing to melt sea ice in spring and summer. The massive river energy flux to the Arctic Ocean carries an enormous heating power of 1.0 [*]×[*] 1019  J/year for each 1  °C of the warm river waters above freezing, which {{is equivalent to the}} power release from detonation of 2.5 [*]×[*] 109  TNT/°C/year (Nghiem et al. 2014). With increased water temperatures (Lammers et al. 2007) and longer ice-free periods of the Arctic rivers (Shiklomanov and Lammers 2014), the role of river heat input is increasing and must be incorporated in sea ice prediction and projection models. These changes of river discharge in Northern Eurasia have a predictive potential to force Arctic change at interannual to decadal timescales and beyond (Richter-Menge et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|To {{more fully}} {{understand}} the role of precipitation in observed increases in freshwater discharge to the Arctic Ocean, data from a new archive of bias-adjusted precipitation records for the former USSR (TD 9813), along with the CRU and Willmott-Matsuura data sets, were examined for the period 1936 – 1999. Across the six largest <b>Eurasian</b> <b>river</b> basins, snowfall derived from TD 9813 exhibits a strongly significant increase until the late 1950 s and a moderately significant decrease thereafter. A strongly significant decline in derived rainfall is also noted. Spatially, snowfall increases are found primarily across north-central Eurasia, {{an area where the}} rainfall decreases are most prominent. Although no significant change is determined in Eurasian-basin snowfall over the entire 64 year period, we note that interpolation from early, uneven station networks causes an overestimation of spatial precipitation, and that the local snowfall trends determined from gridded TD 9813 data are likely underestimated. Yet, numerous uncertainties in historical Arctic climate data and the sparse, irregular nature of Arctic station networks preclude a confident assessment of precipitation-discharge linkages during the period of reported discharge trends...|$|R

40|$|Interpretations of {{magnetic}} susceptibility variations in circum-Saharan marine sediments have suggested {{a close relationship}} with Saharan dust supply, which assumes that dust dominates over the potential contributions from a variety of other sources and processes. To evaluate the importance of Saharan dust supply versus that of other potential sources of variability in magnetic susceptibility, we compile magnetic susceptibility data from eastern Mediterranean Plio-Pleistocene sequences at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites 964, 966, 967 and 969, for comparison with other paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic proxy data for the same intervals. Our results demonstrate that magnetic susceptibility variations are linked to the supply of Saharan dust through some parts of the studied intervals, but seem to be predominantly controlled by the discharge of suspended matter from <b>Eurasian</b> <b>rivers</b> and the Nile. Depositional and diagenetic processes in the stratigraphic vicinity of ash layers and sapropels also affect magnetic susceptibility values.

40|$|The Arctic {{hydrological}} cycle throughout the Holocene is analyzed {{based on the}} results of transient simulations with the coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation model ECHO-G. The results suggest a ~ 2 % increase of mid-Holocene to preindustrial Arctic river discharges for the <b>Eurasian</b> continent. However, <b>rivers</b> of the North America Arctic realm show a moderate runoff decline of approximately 4 to 5 % for the same period. The total river discharge into the Arctic Ocean has remained at an approximately constant preindustrial level since the mid Holocene. The positive discharge trend within Eurasia is caused by a more rapid decrease in local net evaporation compared to a smaller decline in advected moisture and hence precipitation. This effect is neither recognized within the North American Arctic domain nor in the far eastern part of the Eurasian Arctic realm. A detailed comparison of these model findings with a variety of proxy studies is conducted. The collected proxy records show trends of continental surface temperatures and precipitation rates that are consistent with the simulations.
