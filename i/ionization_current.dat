50|$|Below the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> or {{breakdown}} voltage {{there is no}} glow, but as the current increases to the ionization point the Townsend discharge happens just as glow discharge becomes visible; this {{is the start of}} the normal glow range. As the current is increased above the normal glow range, abnormal glow begins. If the current is increased to the point the cathode glow covers the entire cathode arc discharge begins.|$|E
50|$|Each ion pair created {{deposits}} or {{removes a}} small electric charge {{to or from}} an electrode, such that the accumulated charge {{is proportional to the}} number of ion pairs created, and hence the radiation dose. This continual generation of charge produces an <b>ionization</b> <b>current,</b> which {{is a measure of the}} total ionizing dose entering the chamber. However, the chamber cannot discriminate between radiation types (beta or gamma) and cannot produce an energy spectrum of radiation.|$|E

From these measurements the relative stopping powers {{of these elements}} for the secondary electrons of the gamma rays have been deduced. [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} here to observe precisely those variables that matter, since {{there may be}} false indicators along the way. For example, <b>ionization</b> <b>currents</b> might get periodic high surges, which do not imply high rates but just high energy depositions for stray events. These surges will be tabulated and viewed with cynicism if unjustifiable, especially since {{there is so much}} background noise in the setup.|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>ionization</b> <b>currents</b> for {{measuring}} pressure was first {{demonstrated in the}} late 1940 's. The early gauges operated at high voltages and used rather large ion sources. The ionization gauge is actually a densitometer that is sensitive to the temperature and pressure of the gas in the chamber. This report describes the use of low voltages and small ion sources {{in the development of}} a prototype...|$|R
50|$|A voltage {{potential}} is applied between the electrodes {{to create an}} electric field in the fill gas. When gas between the electrodes is ionized by incident ionizing radiation, ion-pairs are created and the resultant positive ions and dissociated electrons move to the electrodes of the opposite polarity {{under the influence of}} the electric field. This generates an <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> which is measured by an electrometer circuit. The electrometer must be capable of measuring the very small output current which is in the region of femtoamperes to picoamperes, depending on the chamber design, radiation dose and applied voltage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ionization</b> <b>current</b> {{signals are}} all pulses {{with a local}} peak in between. Using a logical AND gate in {{continuous}} time (having a stream of [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] pulses as one input and the current signal as the other), the tail portion of every current pulse signal is extracted. This gated discrimination method is used {{on a regular basis}} on liquid scintillators. The gated delay unit is precisely to this end, and makes a delayed copy of the original signal {{in such a way that}} its tail section is seen alongside its main section on the oscilloscope screen.|$|E
50|$|The {{oscilloscope}} registers {{a current}} pulse with every event. The pulse {{is merely the}} <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> in the detector caused by this event plotted against time. The total energy of the incident particle can be found by integrating this current pulse with respect to time to yield the total charge deposited {{at the end of}} the PMT. This integration is carried out in the analog-digital converter (ADC). The total deposited charge is a direct measure of the energy of the ionizing particle (neutron or photon) entering the neutron detector. This signal integration technique is an established method for measuring ionization in the detector in nuclear physics. The ADC has a higher dead time than the oscilloscope, which has limited memory and needs to transfer events quickly to the ADC. Thus, the ADC samples out approximately one in every 30 events from the oscilloscope for analysis. Since the typical event rate is around 106 neutrons every second, this sampling will still accumulate thousands of events every second.|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} and control {{system for the}} Munich MP-Tandem is based on two bundles of acrylic light pipes running in the column structure from {{both ends of the}} tank to the dead sections and to the terminal. These light guides transmit all control signals for lenses, beam steerers, foil strippers and variable apertures as well as the readings of beam currents, charging <b>currents,</b> column <b>currents,</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>currents,</b> pump currents and voltages, and alternator frequencies. Details of the mechanical and electronic design are presented. Before the system has been installed, parts of it have passed various high voltage and radiation tests.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the PBTA (Parasitic Bipolar Transistor Action) induced by impact ionization on the maximum operating voltages {{as well as on}} the isolation performance in VLSI CMOS structures was investigated using the sensitivity of the nMOS- and bipolar-parameters to the operating voltages. Strong coupling between the MOS- and bipolar-currents exists due to the potential drop caused by the impact <b>ionization</b> <b>currents</b> of the nMOSFET. The base currents of the bipolar transistors reduce the measurable substrate current. The maximum operating voltage in CMOS is limited by the impact ionization induced PBTA. The isolation performance is reduced by the collector current of the vertical transistor...|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, the GDD involves {{one or more}} electrodes biased with {{a generally}} low voltage (e.g. up to 20 V), which is sufficient to collect the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> created by whatever sources. This {{is much the same}} as an ionization chamber in particle physics. The size and location of these electrodes determine the detection volume in the gas and hence the type of signal detected. The energetic BSE traverse a long distance, whereas the SE travel a much shorter lateral distance mainly by way of diffusion in the gas. Correspondingly, an electrode placed further away from the beam axis will have a predominantly BSE component in comparison to the predominant SE component collected by an electrode placed close to the axis. The precise proportion of signal mix and intensity depends on the additional parameters of gas nature and pressure in conjunction with electrode configurations and bias, bearing in mind that there is no abrupt physical distinction between SE and BSE, apart from the conventional definition of the 50 eV boundary between them.|$|E
50|$|The Trionic system lacks a {{camshaft}} position sensor. This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of <b>ionization</b> <b>current.</b> One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark plug gap (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} the thermal part of an {{ionization}} signal is presented that connects the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> to cylinder pressure and temperature in a spark ignited internal combustion engine. One strength of the model is that it after calibration has only two free parameters, burn angle and initial kernel temperature. By fitting the model to a measured ionization signal {{it is possible to}} estimate both cylinder pressure and temperature, where the pressure is estimated with good accuracy. The model approach is validated on engine data. Cylinder pressure and <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> data was collected on a Saab 4 -cylinder SI engine for a variation in ignition timing and air-fuel ratio. The main result is that the parameterized <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> model can be used to estimating combustion properties as pressure, temperature and content of nitric oxides based on measured ionization currents. The current status of the model is suitable for off-line analysis of ionization currents and cylinder pressure. This <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> model not only describes the connection between the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> and the combustion process, it also offers new possibilities for EMS to control the internal combustion engine...|$|E
50|$|Most silicon {{particle}} detectors work, in principle, by doping narrow (usually around 100 micrometers wide) {{strips of}} silicon {{to turn them}} into diodes, which are then reverse biased. As charged particles pass through these strips, they cause small <b>ionization</b> <b>currents</b> that can be detected and measured. Arranging thousands of these detectors around a collision point in a particle accelerator can yield an accurate picture of what paths particles take. Silicon detectors have a much higher resolution in tracking charged particles than older technologies such as cloud chambers or wire chambers. The drawback is that silicon detectors are much more expensive than these older technologies and require sophisticated cooling to reduce leakage currents (noise source). They also suffer degradation over time from radiation, however this can be greatly reduced thanks to the Lazarus effect.|$|R

Uniform field sparking potentials were also measured for Nd range 1 · 24 × 1016 less-than-or-eq, slant Nd less-than-or-eq, slant 245 × 1016 cm- 2. The ratio of the Townsend primary ionization coefficient α to N, α/N, was found to depend on E/N only. The secondary coefficients were also evaluated for aluminium and gold-plated electrodes for the above range of E/N. Measurements of the sparking potentials showed that Paschen's law is not obeyed in air at values of Nd near and below the Paschen minimum...|$|R

40|$|By {{directly}} measuring in-cylinder {{parameters and}} adjusting the spark advance, the engine e ciency can be maximized. A feedback scheme for spark-advance control using the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> as sensed variable has earlier been presented.

Humidity signi cantly a ects the burn rate and active water injection is used {{to slow down the}} combustion giving a peak pressure position (PPP) that occurs too late. The <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> based feedback-scheme adjusts the spark advance, and moves the PPP back to optimum. An additional result is that the engine e ciency can be increased by combining active supply of water to the combustion and the spark-advance control scheme.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} detector and pressure gauge for uranium hexafluoride in high‐vacuum systems is described. Negative surface ionization of UF_ 6 occurs on ribbon filaments operated at temperatures {{too low for}} electron emission to be significant. The ion current measured on a cylindrical collector surrounding the filament assembly varies regularly with UF_ 6 pressure below 10 ^(− 3) Torr. Different filament materials are considered, including rhenium, thoriated tungsten, and platinum. Rhenium {{is found to be}} the most satisfactory material for operation of diode emitters as a pressure gauge.

40|$|The {{transition}} radiation tracker (TRT) {{is one of}} the three subsystems of the inner detector of the ATLAS experiment. It is designed to operate for 10 yr at the LHC, with integrated charges of similar to 10 C/cm of wire and radiation doses of about 10 Mrad and 2 multiplied by 10 ** 1 ** 4 neutrons/cm** 2.

40|$|For every {{operating}} condition {{of an internal}} combustion engine there exists an optimal spark timing, called maximum brake torque (MBT), which maximises the output torque and {{the efficiency of the}} engine. Traditionally MBT timing is implemented as an open-loop control where the ignition timing is found by using a combination of static lookup tables and sensor information. With a direct closed-loop control from the combustion process the performance of internal combustion engines could be improved. The thesis investigates if it is possible to estimate the MBT timing from the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> for every {{operating condition}} of a spark ignited engine where the operating conditions are defined by the engine parameters lambda, internal exhaust gas recirculation, engine load, engine speed and spark advance.
