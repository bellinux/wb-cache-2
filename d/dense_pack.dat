The expedition's main base {{was established in}} January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, Adélie Land. This was much farther west than originally intended; <b>dense</b> <b>pack</b> ice had prevented the expedition ship SY Aurora from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit. Only after the Aurora—heading west—had rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made.|$|E
500|$|After a month-long halt in the Grytviken whaling station, Endurance {{departed}} for the Antarctic on 5 December. Two days later Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter pack ice {{as far north}} as 57°26′S, forcing the ship to manoeuvre. [...] During the following days there were more tussles with the pack, which on 14 December was thick enough to halt the ship for 24hours. [...] Three days later the ship was stopped again. Shackleton commented: [...] "I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that the pack would be loose. What we were encountering was fairly <b>dense</b> <b>pack</b> of a very obstinate character".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Britain, Ninnis {{qualified}} in January 1867 {{for the title of}} Surgeon in the Royal Navy by passing examinations at the Royal College of Surgeons; the following month he was appointed to the Royal Hospital in Greenwich, where he remained until 1869. On 21 December 1874 he was promoted to Staff-Surgeon Second Class. In May 1875 he was appointed to HMS Discovery, one of two ships—the other HMS Alert—which comprised the British Arctic Expedition, led by Captain Sir George Nares. The expedition aimed {{to be the first to}} reach the North Pole, pushing north through Smith Sound, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. The two ships made slow progress up the sound, repeatedly halted by <b>dense</b> <b>pack</b> ice. During August of the first year, the expedition's Greenland Dogs began to show signs of disease; the dogs experienced fits and [...] "madness", owing, it was assumed, [...] "to close confinement, wet decks, and want of natural exercise." [...] Ninnis and Fleet-Surgeon Thomas Colon of the Alert were charged with investigating the disease. Ninnis' report to Nares noted the disease's similarity to rabies, [...] "but there is no instance recorded in Greenland of human beings who have been bitten having suffered from hydrophobia , and the recovery of the animals in some instances is entirely opposed to the recorded experience of true rabies." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{this point}} of the battle {{it is clear that}} Caesar's {{opposition}} had little hope of survival. They were being pushed closer and closer into a <b>dense</b> <b>pack</b> that was being surrounded by Caesars men who were using projectile weapons to pick off their remaining forces. Using [...] peltats (a light infantry man) equipped with slings and javelins {{and with the help of}} archers, they unleashed a barrage of missiles at the closely packed Nervii. The last of them fought with ferocity and courage for they were continuing to retaliate with their spears and catching the Romans javelins and throwing them back at them. The Nervii hadn't used any other projectile type weapon except for the spear. The Nervii warriors fought to the last, standing on the bodies of their slain comrades, and throwing the Romans’ own spears back at them. [...] Eventually the few remaining Nervii broke and fled the field. [...] Caesar’s opinion of the Nervii was that they had shown great fighting spirit in carrying an attack forward so vigorously on to difficult ground and in continuing to fight stubbornly when the tide of battle turned irretrievably against them. Caesar talks of a grimly inspiring image of the last of the Nervii who were atop a mound of corpses of their own warriors and shouting in defiance towards the Romans, fighting till their last breath. He goes on to say that they had outstanding courage, for they launched a surprise attack, crossed a river up its banks then rushed on to attack all with A fighting spirit. He glorifies his victory by stating how well his army did without having to be ordered to launch a counterattack. It was most probable that his soldiers had experienced veteranism that they were able to hold off their onslaught. Still he mitigated his losses by not including how many casualties he suffered or that they were in serious danger of losing. In his account of this battle in his book [...] "the Conquest of Gaul" [...] he gives a biased information of what actually happened in the battle but it remains one of the only primary sources during that time. And since it was written by him much is unknown of the Nervii's side of the battle, like how Bodougnats ( [...] the leader of the Nervii) ordered his men into battle.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> initiative {{met with}} strong {{criticism in the}} media and in the government, and the idea was never implemented. Detractors of the <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> strategy pointed out a number of flaws. First, the advent of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRV, negated the concept due to their ability to conduct a time-on-target barrage. Simply put, a single missile could deliver a volley of three to twelve warheads to the target where they could each detonate at approximately the same time, thus dispensing with the disruptive debris cloud that <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> relies upon for protection. Secondly, there were widespread doubts {{at the time that the}} hardened nature of the armored missile silos were as robust as the military claimed, leading to worries that a single warhead could in fact destroy an entire <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> missile field. Finally, <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> was perceived by some to be a provocative, if not overtly hostile measure at a time when nuclear warfare seemed to be a distinct possibility. Ultimately, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected using the <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> strategy by a 245-176 vote.|$|E

Then a <b>dense</b> <b>packing</b> structure is obtained in a container by simulating dropping of particles under gravitational forces. Furthermore, a scheme that makes the bottom boundary fluctuate up and down was applied to obtain more <b>denser</b> <b>packing.</b> The discrete element method (DEM) was employed to simulate the interactions between particle-particle and particle-boundary during the particles' motions.

5000|$|<b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> was a {{proposed}} configuration strategy for basing LGM-118 Peacekeeper ICBMs, developed under the Reagan administration, {{for the purpose}} of maximizing their survivability in case of a surprise nuclear first-strike on their silos conducted by a hostile foreign power. According to the <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> strategy, a series of ten to twelve hardened silos would be grouped closely together in a line. This line of silos would generally run north-to-south, as the primary flight path for Soviet inbound nuclear ICBMs would be expected to come from the north over the North Pole. The proposed <b>Dense</b> <b>Pack</b> initiative met with strong criticism in the media and in the government, and the idea was never implemented.|$|E

5000|$|On 22 November 1982 the {{administration}} {{announced that the}} missile was {{to be known as}} Peacekeeper, and introduced an entirely new basing concept, the [...] "dense pack". The <b>dense</b> <b>pack</b> idea involved building super-hardened silos that would withstand more than 10,000 psi (70 MPa) of overpressure, compared to 2,000 of the existing silos, or 5,000 psi for the upgraded versions originally proposed. This extra hardness can be easily offset by minor increases in warhead accuracy. The key to <b>dense</b> <b>pack</b> concept was to space the silos so close together, about 1,800 feet (550 m), that warheads attacking one silo would destroy others incoming to attack another silo in the same pack. This [...] "fratricide theory" [...] was highly criticized due to the expected relative ease with which the Soviets could modify their warheads and circumvent this design. All that was required was that several warheads arrive and be detonated within a few milliseconds of each other, so the blast waves did not reach each other before completing destruction of the silo. Such timing could be easily achieved with commercially available clocks. Congress again rejected the system.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem with}} Swarmjet {{was that it}} could be argued that it {{eliminated}} the need for MX.

Swarmjet would do this for any attack, whether on MX in <b>dense</b> <b>pack,</b> in existing Minuteman silos, or the existing Minuteman fleet. So if Swarmjet did work, it argued against spending money on MX as well. It is speculated that this is the major reason why Swarmjet saw so little official interest in the early 1980s.|$|E
