2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I said, Tom, she hasn't accused me-- that is, openly; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{will make}} others think," [...] {{returned}} Nellie. And now she {{showed signs of}} bursting into tears again. [...] "Oh, I feel as if I must pack up and go home!" ...|$|E
60|$|STREPHON. I do {{not want}} the girl who is to be born today. How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> will be like? I want you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Majesty pardon me. She {{called me}} to her closet {{yesterday}} and pledged me to secrecy before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was furious, of course. She did {{not refer}} to the matter when we were alone together, {{but there was no}} need to. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was thinking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess she is," [...] said Mrs. Moses. [...] "That gal {{is worth}} any seven grown-up women in town. And she was four nights settin' {{in my kitchen}} before <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was up to." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> prefers? She told me {{that she}} doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.|$|E
6000|$|... "Being {{kind and}} good isn't liking. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks. But of course I can't expect to {{convince}} you of it; {{no one else could}} see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see they}} are very {{superior}} people," [...] said Bernard. [...] "And little Miss Evers--what does she do in the morning? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does in the evening!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant--I <b>knew</b> she was right, and I rose {{at once to}} go to the card-table. As I {{left the}} piano Miss Fairlie turned a page of the music, and touched the keys again with a surer hand.|$|R
60|$|Now, as for Justine Marie, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was {{as well as}} if I {{had seen}} her. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she was well enough; there were girls like her in Madame Beck's school--phlegmatics--pale, slow, inert, but kind-natured, neutral of evil, undistinguished for good.|$|R
60|$|EMILY--[With her sugary smile.] That isn't what Martha means, you silly. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> {{thinking}} about us, and I'm {{not sure that}} I don't agree with her--partly. She feels that we're so awfully strict--about certain things. It must be so different in the Far West--I suppose--so much freer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now YOU know it, {{will you}} not turn to Violet for advice and comfort? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> can be. If you could guess what she saved me from, you would fly {{at once to}} her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very possibly," [...] Newman rejoined. [...] "But {{she will}} not know. I was in that convent {{yesterday}} and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>SHE</b> is doing. Lord deliver us! You can guess whether {{it made me feel}} forgiving!" ...|$|E
60|$|Why the deuce should Mrs. Botibol blow me a kiss? I wouldn't {{kiss her}} for the world. Why do I grin when I see her, as if I was delighted? Am I? I don't care a straw for Mrs. Botibol. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks about me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said about my last volume of poems (I had it from a dear mutual friend). Why, I say in a word, are we going on ogling and {{telegraphing}} each other in this insane way?--Because we are both performing the ceremonies demanded by the Great Snob Society; whose dictates we all of us obey.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I would--to-morrow. Why shouldn't I? What are {{fame and}} name and society to me--a {{descendant}} of wreckers and smugglers, like her. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> made of, my boy, to her innermost fibre; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the perfect and pure quarry she was dug from: {{and that gives}} a man confidence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] Mrs. March now assented, and {{she waved}} her fan thoughtfully before her face. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was {{thinking}} of, and I looked at Miss Gage, who had involuntarily taken the pose and expression of the moment when I first saw her at the kiosk in Congress Park. [...] "And Miss Gage?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{considered}} the matter. The word of honor {{of a fellow}} such as he was could not be worth much, but the merest chance {{of getting rid of}} tramps should not be neglected. I went in to talk to Euphemia about it, although <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would say. <b>I</b> reasoned with myself as much as with her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cursed if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was. I rammed a cake of good Trinidad tobacco into my boot when I saw her. I've {{seen the}} inside of a French prison before now. Give way, Bill, and have it over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Almost {{the very}} words I said to her!' exclaimed her mother. 'Now really, another time, when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{would tell you}} but for this reason, and won't, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, to tell you myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is not. She {{is not a}} friend, as {{you call}} her, if she {{encourages}} you in the wrong, {{if she does n't}} help you. No, I have no patience with her," [...] I declared; [...] "I don't like her, and I won't go to see her!" ...|$|E
60|$|These {{were our}} words, yet we scarce heeded their meaning. Between us was drawn a subtler communion than speech, and we dared--neither of us--to risk speech. She searched my face, but {{her lips were}} closed. She did not take my hand again as in the afternoon. <b>She</b> turned away. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would have said.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{was going}} to be at: on came her histarrix agen, and she began screechin and roaring like mad. Down comes of course the eleven gals and old Shum. There was a pretty row. [...] "Look here, sir," [...] says she, [...] "at the conduck of your {{precious}} trull of a daughter--alone with this man, kissin and dandlin, and Lawd <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> besides." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted you}} here for, Anne, to {{be a witness}} to my pig-headed obstinacy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Curse her," [...] he said, as {{the fumes}} mounted into his brain, [...] "curse her, {{she is trying}} to frighten me with her infernal magic, but she sha'n't. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is at; but I will be {{beforehand}} with her." [...] And, staggering under the mingled influence of drink and excitement, he rose and left the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{believes}} she is alive, too," [...] she said. [...] "He can't sleep or rest till he finds her, {{for my husband}} loves her as well as I do. But sometimes I feel it's wicked to hope she is alive. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> suffers, for I suffered, myself; and life isn't worth living when despair and disappointment fills it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} she will say, my lad, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> ought to say. I am going round to Thompson's now {{for a copy of}} the deposition, and will bring it for her to see. Thompson will read it aloud at the meeting of the court today, so by this {{afternoon}} every one will know that you are cleared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no--oh no!' exclaimed Mary, {{in great}} confusion, 'Gertrude did not mean--I am sure <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was {{thinking}} of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} crying, mademoiselle," [...] I said, [...] "and I think I can guess the reason. M. Claude {{has told me}} {{something}} about it. He has asked you for your hand, and you have refused him. Is it not so?" [...] This {{was a little bit}} of hypocrisy on my part, I confess, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had been crying about perfectly: but I wished to be loyal to M. Claude.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> fain would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> hath deserved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{care for}} her conversation--I know what it amounts to.' I made no rejoinder--I {{scarcely}} knew what rejoinder to make--and the girl went on, 'I know what she thinks and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> says.' Still I was silent, but the next moment I saw that my delicacy had been wasted, for Miss Mavis asked, 'Does she make out that she knows Mr. Porterfield?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Miss Thurwell, dad," [...] he said coolly, [...] "and I'll bet ten to one <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants. Mind {{you leave}} it all to me. I've no time to explain, but you'll spoil it if you interfere. Come in. Why, Miss Thurwell, we were this moment talking of you," [...] he continued, {{springing}} {{to his feet and}} offering her a chair. [...] "Please come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{infatuated}} with her voice; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{is going to}} do in the world. Old Barytone {{told me that he had}} never heard such a voice from a woman's mouth since the days of Malibran; and if there is a man who knows one voice from another, it is Barytone. He can taste the richness of the instrument down to its lowest tinkling sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> cannot <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would say; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{must say}} myself. All that is over, Emmeline. I cannot {{ask her to}} marry a beggar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's my opinion," [...] he said, [...] "that {{that old}} lady--Lady Beach-Mandarin <b>I</b> mean--doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> saying half the time. She says--oh! {{remarkable}} things. Saying that for example!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother wants you. She {{says she}} must see you. Come {{as soon as}} you can. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to tell you--but <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> we need you." ...|$|R
