5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real <b>grape</b> juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine <b>grape</b> juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real <b>grape</b> juice producers such as Welch <b>Grape</b> Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation <b>grape</b> flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial <b>grape</b> drink that included neither real <b>grape</b> juice nor fruit from the <b>grape.</b>|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux <b>grape</b> varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that the <b>grape</b> originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the <b>grape</b> was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the <b>grape</b> provided a good resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The <b>grape</b> continued to grow in popularity until the Powdery mildew epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that <b>grape</b> disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted <b>grape</b> in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different <b>grape</b> varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.|$|E
5|$|J. Grossman's Sons began {{manufacturing}} Grapico in 1914. At that time, Grapico {{consisted of}} a syrup that, when mixed with soda water, had the taste, smell, and color of a genuine <b>grape</b> drink. The product was artificially colored and flavored with only an infinitesimal amount of <b>grape</b> juice or fruit of the <b>grape.</b>|$|E

5|$|Thomcord <b>grape</b> is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless <b>grape</b> (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord <b>grape</b> (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make <b>grape</b> juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table <b>grape</b> and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} mainly the {{spatial distribution of}} <b>grapes</b> quality parameters at the plot scale, and concluded that <b>grapes</b> sugar content is a variable parameter, with a less predictable spatio-temporal evolution. Our study aimed to identify a pattern of spatial variation of <b>grapes</b> sugar content at a regional scale, under the temperate continental climate of the Huşi (Romania) wine growing region. In order to do this, <b>grapes</b> sugar content was analyzed in relation to climate. The conditioning of <b>grapes</b> sugar content by climatic factors was analyzed based on regression models (Pearson correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, linear regression). Spatial variation of <b>grapes</b> sugars content was achieved by the regression – kriging approach, using climate suitability as predictor. Spatial variation of obtainable wine types was achieved by classifying the spatial distribution of <b>grapes</b> sugar content, according to DOC wine production regulation for the Husi area. The study revealed that among climatic factors, the actual sunshine duration is the most influential one on <b>grapes</b> sugar content. Mapping <b>grapes</b> sugar content generated a coherent spatial distribution pattern at the vineyard scale, as it significantly correlates with terrain altitude. Based on <b>grapes</b> sugar content spatial variation, two areas with different potential for sugars accumulation into <b>grapes</b> were delineated. The outcomes reveal that <b>grapes</b> sugar content presents significant correlations with climate variables specific to vineyards and with climate suitability for wine production. Knowing these correlations allows revealing patterns that determine the spatial distribution of the <b>grapes</b> sugar content...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental <b>grape</b> that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim <b>Grape</b> Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine <b>grape</b> Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E

5|$|While not as {{prolific}} in mutating as Pinot noir, nor {{as widely}} used in production of offspring, Cabernet Sauvignon {{has been linked to}} other <b>grape</b> varieties. In 1961, a cross of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache produced the French wine <b>grape</b> Marselan. Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia. Cabernet blanc is a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid <b>grape</b> variety that was discovered in Switzerland in the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the <b>grape</b> can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the <b>grape</b> is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the <b>grape</b> develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} the harvest is {{determined}} by the publication of a harvesting permit, usually issued from late August. Harvesting is by hand using two sets of trays. One set of trays is for <b>grapes</b> suitable for the AOC, the other set is for <b>grapes</b> that can not qualify. Chiselling, the removal of damaged <b>grapes</b> or not immmature <b>grapes</b> is not permitted for the AOC <b>grapes.</b> Only vines aged 3 years and older are eligible for the AOC.|$|R

Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against <b>grape</b> growers in Delano, California, where the <b>grape</b> season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E
5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the <b>grape.</b> The <b>grape</b> naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter <b>grape.</b> The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E
