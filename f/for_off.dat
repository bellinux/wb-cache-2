5|$|After {{starting}} {{out in the}} Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called <b>for</b> <b>off</b> spinner Harbhajan to be recalled in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{immediately}} guided Palace {{back to the}} Premier League as runaway {{champions of}} the second tier, Chris Armstrong top-scoring with 23 league goals. During this period the badge was changed with the bird being replaced by one which Ron Noades felt more closely resembled an eagle. 1995 again saw the club making news <b>for</b> <b>off</b> the field reasons. On 25 January 1995 Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park. Following a bad tackle on Richard Shaw, United's maverick French forward Eric Cantona was sent off. As Cantona walked towards the tunnel he was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons. This angered Cantona, who launched a flying kick at him with both feet. Manchester United suspended Cantona {{for the remainder of}} the season, while the French Football Federation dropped Cantona from the France national football team, and stripped Cantona of the captaincy of Les Bleus. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail; this was reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and in 1996 was found guilty of two charges of using threatening words and behaviour towards Cantona. More was to follow at Selhurst in March, when Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. In 1995 Palace reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups, but a shortage of Premier League goals counted against them alongside the introduction of a fourth relegation place. The Premiership was being cut from 22 to 20 clubs at the end of the 1994–95 season, and Palace found themselves demoted on the last day of the season once again.|$|E

From 1979 onwards, the Puma formed the mainstay of the Bristow fleet; the type took over the duties of Bristow's retiring Westland Wessex helicopters in 1981. In 1982, Bristow introduced the more powerful Super Puma into service, supplementing their then-total fleet of 11 SA 330J Pumas.|$|E

25|$|Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma {{had been}} greatly perturbed {{by the loss}} of Muang Soui to the communists. As {{planning}} <b>for</b> <b>Off</b> Balance went forward, he decided to remove the ban on bombing Khang Khai. He stumped for 150 air strikes to attack on 1 July as a means of showing his wrath. He also requested 150 more sorties the following day. This request to Seventh Air Force was passed back to Washington, DC for approval. It arrived there on a weekend, and was mishandled by junior staff on duty. When more senior officials returned to work on Monday, they disapproved the request as being an unnecessary escalation of the war, especially since there was a Chinese cultural mission in Khang Kai. The American ambassador in Vientiane, G. McMurtrie Godley, was also cautioned about allowing the RLAF to bomb Khang Khai, for fear of provoking the Chinese communists. The entire subject was slated for discussion at an upcoming rules of engagement on 11 August.|$|E

In a review of The Simpsons ninth season, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "Bart Carny" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Dave Hughes {{first started}} working for Adult Swim in 2003 after an eight-year stint with MTV Animation, {{where he had}} edited series such as Beavis and Butt-head and Celebrity Deathmatch. Hughes, who saw Adult Swim [...] "slipping away from its more {{experimental}} roots" [...] as it got popular, had the concept <b>for</b> <b>Off</b> the Air in mind before, but never {{thought he would be}} the one to make it. While living in New York, 120 Minutes, Concrete TV, Liquid Television and Night Flight were among some of the experimental programming that exposed him [...] "to a whole new world of ideas, music and people that I just didn't see anywhere else on television." ...|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Talk Soup", {{which is}} about a man who desires to go on {{television}} to tell the world about his strange life, was originally commissioned as a new theme for the E! Entertainment Television show of the same name. Although the producers approved the lyrics and enjoyed the final result, they decided against using it. [...] "Waffle King", the track that had been intended <b>for</b> <b>Off</b> the Deep End, was written as [...] "a song about a guy who becomes incredibly famous for doing something kinda stupid, and then starts taking himself way too seriously". Yankovic included [...] "Harvey the Wonder Hamster", a short tune from one of his Al TV appearances, after receiving numerous requests to include it on an album.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Off the Deep End was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic's parodies, {{but also his}} originals. Barry Weber, of Allmusic, wrote, [...] "In addition to re-establishing his satirical craftsmanship, Deep End showcases some of Yankovic's best originals ever; [...] "Trigger Happy," [...] "When I Was Your Age," [...] and [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] {{prove to be the}} album's greatest songs." [...] Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, [...] "In fact, it's strange to admit, but the originals on Off The Deep End actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Off the Deep End was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne noted that the video <b>for</b> <b>Off</b> the Deep End lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was [...] "an old-fashioned laugh riot", but that half of Yankovic's humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} <b>for</b> <b>Off</b> the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of a control freak over the years, and I’d finally gotten to the point in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself." [...] By late 1990 five originals—"Airline Amy," [...] "Trigger Happy", [...] "When I Was Your Age", [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore," [...] and [...] "Waffle King"—were recorded.|$|E
