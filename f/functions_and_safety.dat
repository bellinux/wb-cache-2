Although SSC classification guidelines for nuclear power plants have been well established and applied, those for research reactors have been only recently established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Korea has operated a pool-type research reactor (the High Flux Advanced Neutron Application Reactor) and has recently exported another pool-type reactor (Jordan Research and Training Reactor), which is being built in Jordan. Korea also has a plan to build one more pool-type reactor, the Kijang Research Reactor, in Kijang, Busan. The safety classification of SSCs for pool-type research reactors is proposed in this paper based on the IAEA methodology. The proposal recommends that the SSCs of pool-type research reactors be categorized and classified on basis of their safety <b>functions</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> significance.

40|$|As is {{the case}} with many other {{manufacturers}} of vehicles, Volvo Construction Equipment has a constantly increasing amount of electric and electronic equipment in their articulated haulers. These are of great use in modern machines, bringing <b>functions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> that were not possible before, but they also bring more cables to handle. In the case of the articulated haulers a quite thick cable harness of about 15 meters in length reaches from the driver’s cabin in the front to the components in the far back end of the vehicle. This is not only a lot of long cables to handle both during assembly and service, but the nature of signals traveling in cables is that the voltage gets weaker with distance. This phenomenon has to be accounted for by measuring devices dependent on the voltage. It has been suggested that a device referred to as an intelligent node, or ICCS-module, which communicates digitally via CAN could be installed {{in the back of the}} articulated haulers. This module would be independent of the mentioned drop in voltage. The ICCS-module will be receiving a small bundle of cables being routed from the driver’s cabin. From it cables would go out to a majority of the components in its vicinity. The components connected to the node would not need to have any other cables. This thesis is focused on the mechanical aspects of installing this ICCS-module. Having electric and electronic equipment on construction vehicles is a challenge when it comes to protecting the device from the harsh environment that is the hauler’s exterior. It will have to withstand being immersed in water for long periods of time, greatly varying temperatures, vibrations and shocks as well as being hit by projectiles. The placement as well as the design of the enclosure should be chosen with respect to both the devices length of life and how well it fulfils its intended role and achieves the expected results. To produce an enclosure and find a placement aiming to satisfy these conditions, a traditional product development process were executed. The articulated haulers as well as relevant literature were researched. Concepts were generated and evaluated by both the author and by employees at Volvo Construction Equipment until a final concept for the enclosure and placement were found. The enclosure were then designed in detail specifying the material, manufacturing techniques, controlled for thermodynamic circumstances, modelled in Catia V 5 and controlled for vibrations. It was concluded that the enclosure should be able protect the ICCS-module after some more development and that the placement and cable routing results in a much shorter total cable length...|$|E
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) is {{a disease}} that results after a selective destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas. The lack of β-cells renders T 1 D patients completely unable to synthesize and secrete insulin, {{which leads to a}} life-long need of exogenous insulin for survival. The cause for this selective destruction is still debated, but both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to regulate susceptibility and development of T 1 D. Together with my colleagues, I have studied different aspects of the observed link between enterovirus (EV) infections, especially those by Coxsackievirus serotype B (CVB) and the development of T 1 D. CVB infections may accelerate diabetes development in diabetes-prone mice. This acceleration can however be abrogated by activated iNKT cells. By studying how stimulated or non-stimulated iNKT cells differently regulated macrophages after a CVB 4 infection, we have suggested a mechanism for this suppression. We showed that iNKT cells activated in the presence of CVB 4 induced suppressive functions in isletresident macrophages, which then inhibited diabetes development in diabetes-prone mice. Recently, two multi-center studies suggested CVB 1 infections to be diabetogenic, causing human β-cell autoimmunity and T 1 D development. The identification of a specific virus strain suggests a possibility to use a vaccine, in order to reduce diabetes development. We therefore developed a prototype CVB 1 vaccine and tested the <b>functions</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> profile in two different animal models. We showed that the vaccine was well tolerated and protected mice from CVB 1 infection. Furthermore, we also observed that the vaccine was safe in an autoimmune setting where we showed no acceleration of diabetes development or triggered autoimmunity in vaccinated mice prone to develop autoimmune diabetes. Despite the findings that CVB 1 may be diabetogenic, an inverse correlation between the incidence of T 1 D and the number of recorded EV infections have been observed. This counterintuitive observation may be explained by the poliovirus hypothesis, stating that a low herd immunity due to a low frequency of virus infections in the population, may make children that lack maternally transferred antibodies more susceptible to diabetogenic infections. Hence, we tested if maternally transferred antibodies transferred could protect offspring from a diabetogenic CVB 3 infection in a mouse model for virus-induced diabetes. Our results support a role for the poliovirus hypothesis in explaining the observed inverse correlation between T 1 D incidence and prevalence of EVs. The primary site of replication for CVBs is in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), but what regulates the viral spread to other targeted organs is not known. IFN-λs may regulate permissiveness to the infection. We therefore investigated how intestinal epithelial cells respond to IFN-λ stimulation and found that they could upregulate specific antiviral proteins. This suggested that IECs could be used in a model to study if IFN-λs can regulate IEC permissiveness to CVBs...|$|E

40|$|Technical {{systems that}} {{comprise}} {{at least one}} electrical, electronic, or programmable electronic device and perform safety functions are called safety instrumented systems. Safety instrumented systems are used {{to reduce the risk}} related to hazardous events that may result in undesired consequences to humans, the environment, and assets, and the reliability of such systems is therefore important. The international standard IEC 61508 can be used to ensure safe and reliable safety instrumented systems, and it applies to all types of safety instrumented systems. Based on IEC 61508, the process industry and the machinery industry have developed their own versions called IEC 61511 and IEC 62061, respectively. IEC 61508 includes requirements for all activities necessary for achieving reliable safety instrumented systems throughout their whole lifecycle, and the standard introduces concepts and terminology that can be challenging to understand. Some basic concepts and terminology in IEC 61508 are clarified in this master thesis. A safety function, performed by a safety instrumented system, may be demanded from seldom to continuously. IEC 61508 distinguishes between safety functions that are demanded less frequent and more frequent than once per year, and these two modes of operation are called low-demand and high-demand, respectively. Furthermore, the standard requires that different reliability measures are used for demonstrating the reliability of the safety instrumented systems performing low-demand and high-demand safety functions. In two examples, the two reliability measures are used, and the calculated results show that there is an inconsistency with the classification of safety functions in IEC 61508. This inconsistency is, however, not experienced with the classification in IEC 61511, and the approach in IEC 61511 seems better. Other differences between low-demand and high-demand safety functions are not well explained in IEC 61508. Because IEC 61511 considers mainly low-demand safety functions and IEC 62061 considers only high-demand safety functions, specific requirements in these two standards are compared to reveal possible differences between low-demand and high-demand. It is concluded that there are essentially no differences between the compared requirements. Based on the event, loss of control, in an accident scenario, it is proposed a new approach for classifying safety functions. A definition of loss of control is suggested and it distinguishes between safety control <b>functions</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> protection functions. These two functions are further related to two additional events in an accident scenario, and a model that illustrates the proposed classification in relation to the three events in an accident scenario is developed. The proposed classification is neither based on frequency of demands nor does it prescribe use of a specific reliability measure, and the classification is thus different from the classification in IEC 61508. The proposed classification is more similar to the classification in IEC 61511. Safety instrumented systems are used in the hydropower industry, but IEC 61508 is essentially not yet applied. The Machinery Directive requires machine manufacturers to meet the essential health and safety requirements, and some of these requirements can, for safety instrumented systems in machines, be met by complying with IEC 62061. Because IEC 62061 is based on IEC 61508, this is a relationship between IEC 61508 and the hydropower industry. From the perspective of a typical company operating hydropower plants in the Norwegian hydropower industry, some benefits and challenges related to implementation and use of IEC 61508 are discussed. IEC 61508 provides a rigorous, risk-based approach for achieving reliable safety instrumented systems and many of the concepts in the standard could be very useful in the hydropower industry. However, the standard is comprehensive and extensive resources and competence are prerequisites for successful implementation and use. It is concluded that IEC 61508 may not be what the hydropower industry needs, but a joint project for developing a unified approach for ensuring reliable safety instrumented systems may be a better option. </p...|$|E
