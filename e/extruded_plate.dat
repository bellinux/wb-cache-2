40|$|Spot joining of {{aluminium}} intensive vehicle bodies using self-pierce riveting (SPR) technology {{is well established}} with over 10 years of commercial application in the automotive industry. SPR is a promising technique for magnesium, especially for spot joining to dissimilar metals because the formation of brittle intermetallic phases encountered in resistance spot welding or laser welding is avoided. The challenge however is to overcome the poor ductility of magnesium at ambient temperatures and prevent cracking of the magnesium ply, especially when it {{is placed on the}} bottom {{in the design of the}} joint. This paper presents progress made in SPR joining of magnesium by using a laser to preheat the magnesium ply and assist its deformation. Magnesium-to-magnesium and aluminium-to-magnesium joints of various ply thicknesses and alloys included: 2 to 3 mm thick high pressure die cast AM 50 and AM 60 alloys, 3. 3 mm thick strip cast AZ 31 -O, 2 mm thick Al 5005 -H 34 sheet, and 1. 5 or 3 mm thick Al 6060 -T 5 <b>extruded</b> <b>plate.</b> Results are presented on the quasi-static tensile shear strength of various joints produced at cycle times of less than 5 s...|$|E

The background for this thesis is to help find needed experimental data to calibrate and develop these model further. In this thesis the chosen material to study was from an <b>extruded</b> <b>plate</b> of AA 6082 aluminium, which is a relevant material in for example the automobile industry. Three different tempered cases has been studied in depth with Transmission Electron Microscopy, tensile tests and hardness curves. A hardness curve was made to find T 6 which is the first case. The second case was weakly over aged at 185 ◦C after reaching T 6 until it reached ≈ 70 % of peak hardness. The third case was over aged at 200 ◦C after reaching T 6 until it also reached ≈ 70 % peak hardness. It has been made cross section area and length distributions of the precipitates for the three cases using a TEM. The tensile tests were done to relate the contributions of the different particle parameters such as length, cross section area and density to the mechanical properties of the material. It was found in the tensile tests that the over aged materials experienced increased initial work hardening rate as compared to T 6. The distributions showed that the material over aged at 200 ◦C had wider and shorter precipitates compared to the material over aged at 185 ◦C. It was also found that the over aged materials has a significantly lower particle density compared to T 6...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRare earth Mg alloy has aroused {{increasing}} {{attention in}} aviation, spaceflight, war industry application fields; however, its poor corrosion-resistance restricted its {{wide range of}} application. For Mg- 7 Gd- 5 Y-Nd-Zr <b>extruding</b> <b>plate,</b> the grain orientation and size are different in three planes, which is extruding plane (surface), side plane, and cross-section plane. Microstructure {{may lead to the}} variation of corrosion resistant to marine climate environment. The corrosion resistance of chloride ion in three different planes of rare earth Mg plate was studied. The immersion and dynamic potential polarization curves in 3. 5 wt. % concentration of sodium chloride solution were used to analysis and compare electrochemical characteristics among the three planes. Optical microscope was employed to observe the microstructure of Mg alloy before and after the chloride ion erosion. The X-ray diffraction was used to determine its corrosion product. The results show that corrosion-resistance properties of the three planes (surface, side and cross section) are different. Pitting corrosion are mainly characteristics and corrosion product is magnesium hydroxide. The different resistant properties of three planes are mainly attributed to different grain size and orientation of the different planes...|$|R

The <b>plates</b> were <b>extruded</b> with a reduced thickness and processed in the internal boxes by thermoforming process. A non-uniform distribution of the PSAI, resulting in boxes with thick outside the internal standards required has been observed.

40|$|The elastic {{properties}} and internal friction of two magnesium alloys were studied from 25 C to 450 C using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS). The Young&#x 27;s moduli {{decrease with increasing}} temperature. At 200 C, {{a change in the}} temperature dependence of the elastic constants is observed. The internal friction increases significantly with increasing temperature above 200 C. The observed changes in the temperature dependence of the elastic constants and the internal friction are the result of anelastic relaxation by grain boundary sliding at elevated temperatures. Elastic properties govern the behavior of a materials subjected to stress over a region of strain where the material behaves elastically. The elastic properties, including the Young&#x 27;s modulus (E), shear modulus (G), bulk modulus (B), and Poisson&#x 27;s ratio (?), are of significant interest to many design and engineering applications. The choice of the most appropriate material for a particular application at elevated temperatures therefore requires knowledge of its elastic properties as a function of temperature. In addition, mechanical vibration can cause significant damage in the automotive, aerospace, and architectural industries and thus, the ability of a material to dissipate elastic strain energy in materials, known as damping or internal friction, is also important property. Internal friction can be the result {{of a wide range of}} physical mechanisms, and depends on the material, temperature, and frequency of the loading. When utilized effectively in engineering applications, the damping capacity of a material can remove undesirable noise and vibration as heat to the surroundings. The elastic properties of materials can be determined by static or dynamic methods. Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), used in this study, is a unique and sophisticated non-destructive dynamic technique for determining the complete elastic tensor of a solid by measuring the resonant spectrum of mechanical resonance for a sample of known geometry, dimensions, and mass. In addition, RUS allows determination of internal friction, or damping, at different frequencies and temperatures. Polycrystalline pure magnesium (Mg) exhibits excellent high damping properties. However, the poor mechanical properties limit the applications of pure Mg. Although alloying can improve the mechanical properties of Mg, the damping properties are reduced with additions of alloying elements. Therefore, it becomes necessary to study and develop Mg-alloys with simultaneous high damping capacity and improved mechanical properties. Moreover, studies involving the high temperature dynamic elastic properties of Mg alloys are limited. In this study, the elastic {{properties and}} internal friction of two magnesium alloys were studied at elevated temperatures using RUS. The effect of alloy composition and grain size was investigated. The wrought magnesium alloys AZ 31 and ZK 60 were employed. Table 1 gives the nominal chemical compositions of these two alloys.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{characteristics}} of the Fiber-Reinforced Cementitious composite (FRCC) depend largely on the methods of processing. The fibre-reinforced cement based composites manufactured by extrusion show a great improvement in strength, toughness, ductility, and durability as compared to the traditional casting method. The extrudate showed a superior workability for nailing, sawing and drilling. The advantages of the extrusion technique include: mass-production capability, product manufacture flexibility, the ability to produce complicated and varied shapes, and the capability of improving the material properties. This property improvement can be attributed to the achievement of low porosity and good interfacial bond under high shear and compressive stress during the extrusion process. Various kinds of building product, such as cylinder, sheet, pipe, channel and honeycomb wall panel by incorporating various mineral admixtures and polymers have been manufactured by the extrusion technique. Two kinds of short fiber, ductile polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers and stronger but less ductile glass fibers, were used as the reinforcement in the products. A number of <b>extruded</b> <b>plates</b> were exposed to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing in accordance with ASTM C 666 (Procedure B) after the 28 -days curing period in the presence of 3 % sodium chloride solution. Variables investigated were the matrix content, fiber volume ratio, type of fiber, w/c ratio and addition of polymer and color pigment. After three hundred cycles of freezing and thawing, flexural tests were conducted in order to compare the strength and the global response of both reference and freeze-thaw specimens. Also, deicer salts scaling resistance was evaluated by means of mass change measurements after 300 cycles. The primary concern of glass fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (GFRC) is the durability of glass fibers in the alkaline environment of cement. Despite the use of improved alkaline-resistant glass fibers (AR-glass) and pozzolanic materials such as silica fume and fly ash, durability concerns still exist. In AR-GFRC, growth of hydration products around the filaments plays a dominant role in inducing embrittlement of the fibers and loss of toughness of the composites. The improvement of the matrix is obtained by using polymers to optimize the nature of the hydrates in the interface between the fibers and the matrix. One of the purposes of this thesis is to present an experimental investigation on the effects of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) powder on GFRC properties under different severe environments. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the polymer on the durability of GFRC, flexural tests were performed on specimens exposed to both short period of normal curing condition and long term of high temperature condition. The final part of this thesis introduces two types of laminates, double-layer reformed bamboo (Cross-ply) laminate and unidirectional FRC plate-reformed bamboo laminate. The latter is made of reformed bamboo and extruded Fibre-Reinforced Cementitious (FRC) plates. The reformed bamboo is ductile and tough, and has high tensile strength while the FRC plate has a higher compressive strength but poor in toughness. The FRC plate-reformed bamboo laminate developed fully utilizes the advantages of each component to achieve superior mechanical properties. A series of flexural, impact, and Compression After Impact (CAI) tests have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the laminate. It is found that the newly developed laminate has high flexural strength (I 00 MPa), excellent impact resistance, good ductility, and outstanding toughness. Hence, it has a good potential in engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work have}} {{investigated}} variants of an AA 6082 aluminium alloy. Five different alloys with various amounts of Mn, Cr and Zr {{have been subjected}} to three homogenization procedures. After homogenization, the aluminium billets were <b>extruded</b> into <b>plates</b> that were artificially aged to T 6 -temper. Further, the profiles were MIG welded to obtain a heat affected zone. The effect of these parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties of the various alloys in welded state have been studied. The microstructure after extrusion and welding were investigated by optical microscope and hardness measurements. In addition, subsequent heat treatments have been performed in an attempt to further increase the density of dispersoids for one specific alloy. Welding of age-hardened aluminium alloys change the microstructural hardening phase that can be a challenge for the mechanical properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and lead to a reduction of the yield strength. The strength of the ageing effect is crucial for the load-bearing capacity of welded structure. The degree of work hardening in the HAZ is important to achieve the same yield strength level as the base material. Introduction of dispersoids in the alloys can affect the microstructure and strength of the aluminium alloys, and in the present work, an attempt to increase the strength by the introduction of dispersoids is carried out. Results from this study show that chemical composition, homogenization procedure, artificial ageing and welding influence the grain structure and mechanical properties of these AA 6082 -alloys. Density of dispersoids increases with increasing amount of Mn, Cr and Zr, low homogenization temperature and short holding time. Dispersoids retard recrystallization effectively after extrusion and welding. A typical welding profile were obtained for all of the tested alloys and the different levels of dispersoids formed during this work have not improved the welding properties significantly...|$|R
40|$|The large-deformation {{behaviour}} of thermoplastics {{has been}} studied by experimental tests and numerical simulations. The work herein {{is a part of}} a larger research project concerning constitutive modelling of polymers. A constitutive model for thermoplastics with structural applications has earlier been proposed in the research project. The work presented in this thesis concerns exploration of the capability of the constitutive model to capture the large-deformation behaviour of polymers at various stress states. In addition, some deformation mechanisms are investigated. Two different thermoplastics are addressed: PVC and HDPE. The PVC is an amorphous thermoplastic filled with a volume fraction of particles of about 0. 2. The HDPE is a semicrystalline thermoplastic that contains fewer particles. All test specimens are taken from 5 mm and 10 mm thick <b>extruded</b> <b>plates</b> of these two materials. From uniaxial tension and compression tests it is found that the yield stress of the PVC is pressure sensitive while that of HDPE is not. Furthermore, the stress-strain curve of PVC, in opposite to HDPE, has a peak stress followed by stress-softening and subsequent strain hardening. Reloading of already deformed tensile specimens, does not recall this local stress maximum. This observation is interpreted as a sign of damage rather than physical aging in the material. Reloading of HDPE, on the other hand, recalls the shape of the initial stress-strain curve of the material. During plastic deformation in uniaxial tension the volume change in the PVC is notable while it in the HDPE is almost zero. Addressing the volume change in PVC, specimens deformed in uniaxial tension are studied in a scanning electron microscope. It is found that the mineral particles have debonded from the PVC matrix and that microscopic voids are formed around the mineral particles in the deformed material. Thus, debonding and void growth are identified as two damage mechanisms in the PVC. Moreover, it is found that the volume change on the macroscale is caused by the void growth on the microscale. Results from numerical unit cell analyses, simulating the interaction between a mineral particle and surrounding polymer matrix, suggest that debonding and void growth can be the cause for the stress drop and the volume change observed in the laboratory tests. Tensile tests of axisymmetric tensile specimens with notch are carried out on both materials to study the behaviour at presence of a triaxial stress field. Again, it is demonstrated that the yield stress of PVC is pressure dependent while the yield stress of HDPE is not, or at least very little, pressure sensitive. However, during plastic deformation of the notched tensile bars, the volume change is significant for both materials. The dilation increases with the stress triaxiality. Fracture surfaces of fractured specimens clearly suggest that the increase of volume both in the PVC and the HDPE has its origin in void growth. Biaxial tests are carried out on the PVC and HDPE materials to serve as a basis for validation of the constitutive model. The parameters of the model are determined from uniaxial tension and compression tests. In order to check how this model is applicable for describing other stress states, the biaxial tension tests were subject for numerical simulations. Comparison of the force-displacement curves and the strain fields from the simulations and the laboratory tests show that the model is capable of capturing the large-deformation behaviour. The test results from the axisymmetric tensile bars with notch were also used for validation of the constitutive model. Comparison of force-displacement curves from laboratory tests and numerical simulations showed that numerical simulations overestimated the maximum force. The overestimation increased with the stress triaxiality, and it was higher for the PVC than for the HDPE. The stress triaxiality seems to enhance some damage that is not captured by the numerical model. PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUltrahigh-pressure {{metamorphic}} rocks {{on both sides}} of the western Himalayan syntaxis show different P–T–t paths. The Kaghan unit was metamorphosed under the UHP conditions significantly later (46 Ma) than the Tso Morari unit (53 Ma), implying that the Tso Morari was subducted earlier (57 Ma) than the Kaghan unit (52 Ma). The age difference likely reflects the initial shape of Greater India, with the Kaghan unit located greater than 300 km south of the Tso Morari before the collision of two continents. We calculate the dip of the subducting plate using two independent methods. The results show gentle dipping subduction east of the western syntaxis, and steep subduction west of the syntaxis since the time of India–Eurasia collision to the present time. We propose that the steep subduction in the western part is likely related to the proto-Chaman and Karakorum faults along which the Indian plate moved northward. In the eastern part, the overlying Eurasian <b>plate</b> <b>extruded</b> to east, which allowed gentle dipping subduction of the Indian continent. Although the main period of eastward extrusion of the Eurasian continent occurred between 30 and 15 Ma, our results suggest that this was likely taking place since the early India–Asia collision. Using those geometrical constraints, a 3 D image of the slab is reconstructed in the western part, showing the sharp bending of the western syntaxis along the proto-Chaman fault. This bending resulted in the warping of the slab surface to form a conical fold with a north-dipping axis located near the western syntaxis...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work has been to {{investigate}} the ultimate capacities of aluminium plates. The aluminium plates {{are supposed to be}} part of a marine structure. Their behaviour has been explored by taking advantage of non-linear finite element simulations. The loading conditions included axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading. Different patterns of heat affected zones have been studied with particular attention on conventionally welded <b>plates</b> and <b>extruded,</b> welded <b>plates.</b> The plates have been given realistic boundary conditions in addition to boundary conditions believed to represent the extremities in plate collapse behaviour. The initial deflection patterns chosen, were generally conservative, and the variations in collapse capacities for different initial deflection patterns have been investigated. The initial deflection amplitudes were systematically varied to cover all values of the initial deflection amplitudes likely to occur. In addition to studying different patterns of the heat affected zones, systematic variations of the breadths of the heat affected zones have been performed. Systematic variations in the magnitudes of the residual stresses and systematic variations of the reductions of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stresses in the heat affected zones have also been carried out. Three different aluminium alloys were studied. They were believed to represent a high, medium and low utilised aluminium alloy. The aspect ratio of the plates was varied to cover both plates that were completely square to plates with a length equal to five times the breadth of the plates. It was found that axially loaded plates with heat affected zones along loaded edges had lower ultimate capacities than plates with heat affected zones along unloaded edges, and if the plates had heat affected zones along loaded edges, having additional heat affected zones along unloaded edges did not alter the buckling capacities. The reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the breadth of the heat affected zones, and the reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the relationship between the value of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress in the heat affected zones and the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress of the base material. The ultimate capacities of transversally loaded plates could be found as the sum of a square plate and a plate strip, even if the plates contained heat affected zones. Square plates and plate strips with relevant patterns of heat affected zones had to be employed. Biaxial interaction curves showed a considerable slenderness dependence for all values of the aspect ratio investigated. The biaxial interaction curves were only slightly affected by introduction of different patterns of heat affected zones. The stress corresponding to equal elastic and plastic strain was better suited as the normalising stress than the more commonly used 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress. One design curve could be used to represent all the different aluminium alloys investigated. Changing the aluminium alloy did not change the shape of the biaxial interaction curves. Based on the detailed study of the collapse behaviour of aluminium plates carried out, and established practice, new ULS design formulas for axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading were proposed. The new design formulas accounted for reductions in ultimate capacities due to heat affected zones, including heat affected zones along loaded edges. They took full advantage of non-linear residual strength for slender plates; and the slenderness dependence and aspect ratio dependence for biaxial interaction curves were systematically incorporated. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
