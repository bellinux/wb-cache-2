This study conducted a comparative experimental analysis of the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for conventional flood coolant <b>machining</b> and sustainable <b>dry</b> <b>machining.</b> The effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut on machining performance has been evaluated for both conditions.

Such materials have great demand in aerospace industry, marine industry, {{and nuclear power}} plants. It is particularly used in the hot sections like engines, because of their high strength and corrosion resistance at high temperature and pressure but they are the most difficult to machine materials. Their high strength possesses large amount of heat generation while machining, which reduce life of tool. Strain rate sensitivity, work hardening and precipitation hardening of material leads to more tool wear. Surface integrity obtain while machining of superalloys is poor. Poor surface finish and high residual stresses are the main causes of failure of these material components. Cutting fluid apply at high pressure in chip forming zone.

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic compressed air {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with compressed air cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic compressed air cooling than those with compressed air cooling and <b>dry</b> <b>machining.</b> The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic compressed air cooling and a thicker chip with compressed air cooling compared to <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic compressed air compared with <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle.

The effect of cryogenic compressed air on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate.

This study investigates the flank wear behavior of coated Titanium Carbonitride (TiCN) coated tools in <b>dry</b> and wet <b>machining</b> of T 6061 Aluminum alloy with the aim of obtaining the optimum cutting speed for <b>dry</b> and wet <b>machining</b> respectively.
