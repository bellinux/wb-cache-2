5|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} to interpret the origin of volcanism in the NCVP. This includes slab windows, mantle plumes, crustal extension and <b>deglaciation.</b> The most common and best mechanism used to explain NCVP volcanic activity is incipient rifting of the North American Plate caused by crustal extension. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Mafic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava flows, although more viscous felsic magma also makes {{its way to the}} surface and can produce explosive eruptions. Two major structural features, the Tintina and Denali-Coast fault systems, run parallel with the NCVP. Both structures have had strike-slip motions since the Cretaceous period and has resulted in several hundred kilometres of crustal displacement.|$|E

I examine in particular the relevance of both {{the path of the}} Sun through the Galaxy and the evolution of the Earth’s orbital parameters in modulating non-terrestrial mechanisms. I build models to predict the extinction rate of species, the temporal variation of the impact cratering rate and ice sheet <b>deglaciations,</b> and then compare these models with other models within a Bayesian framework. I find that the temporal distribution of mass extinction events over the past 550 Myr can be explained just as well by a uniform random distribution as by other models, such as variations in the stellar density local to the Sun arising from the Sun’s orbit. Given the uncertainties in the Galaxy model and the Sun’s current phase space coordinates, as well as the errors in the geological data, {{it is not possible to}} draw a clear connection between terrestrial extinction and the solar motion. In a separate study, I find that the solar motion, which modulates the Galactic tidal forces imposed on Oort cloud comets, does not significantly influence this cratering rate. My dynamical models, together with the solar apex motion, can explain the anisotropic perihelia of long period comets without needing to invoke the existence of a Jupiter-mass solar companion. Finally, I find that variations in the Earth’s obliquity play a dominant role in triggering terrestrial <b>deglaciations</b> over the past 2 Myr. The precession of the equinoxes, in contrast, only becomes important in pacing large <b>deglaciations</b> after the transition from the 100 -kyr dominant periodicity in the ice coverage to a 41 -kyr dominant periodicity, which occurred 0. 7 Myr ago...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the model}} of Paillard and Parrenin (2004), several box models that {{incorporate}} simple parameterizations of the oceanic CO 2 pump were developed. The models’ parameters are calibrated to the δ 18 O and CO 2 observational time series available for the last 800 kyr BP. The Paillard model performance may be improved if its CO 2 sensitivity to insolation is eliminated and different response times are assumed both for absorption/emission of CO 2 and for ablation/accumulation of ice. With these changes the correlations between simulated and experimental time series increase from 0. 59 and 0. 63 (for CO 2 and ice volume V) to 0. 77 and 0. 88 respectively. Oceanic CO 2 pulses of 10 to 20 kyr are found to take place {{at the beginning of the}} last nine <b>deglaciations</b> according to this model. The timing of the last nine terminations may also be qualitatively reproduced with a primary production model in which export depends on V. The dependence between CO 2 export and V that generates the best fit is not exponential, as expected from some evidences, but a square function. The good model-data fitting suggests that the rate of formation of deep water may be an important factor controlling the oceanic pulse that triggers the <b>deglaciations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reconstructions {{of primary}} {{productivity}} at low latitudes {{have been the}} focus of several studies to better understand how the export of nutrient-rich, intermediate Southern Ocean (SO) waters influences productivity at these latitudes. This was triggered by the general observation of minima in the planktonic foraminiferal d 13 C values during <b>deglaciations,</b> which was interpreted as an isotopic signal of intermediate SO waters, together with concomitant increase in diatom productivity at some equatorial sites. However, the impact of these SO waters on productivity at higher latitudes is not well constrained. Here, we compare a high-resolution planktonic foraminiferal d 13 C record with total organic carbon and biomarker records for Proboscia diatoms and haptophytes from a core offshore Southeastern Australia (SEA). This shows that SEA received intermediate SO waters during <b>deglaciations</b> but it did not result in increased productivity during these periods. Instead, the highest primary productivity period, as shown by total organic carbon and alkenone accumulation rates, was during Last Glacial Maximum while Proboscia diatoms mainly proliferated during interglacials and Marine Isotope Stage 3, matching periods of increased diatom productivity in some sites of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. Our study suggests that increased primary productivity offshore SEA is mainly due to stronger westerlies winds during glacial while Proboscia diatom productivity is likely to be also controlled by the transport of silicic acid to this area...|$|R
40|$|Milankovitch {{postulated}} that <b>deglaciations</b> occur when Earth’s obliquity {{is high and}} precession brings Earth’s eccentric orbit nearest the sun during northern summer, and this general concept has been elaborated to show how precession, obliquity, or combinations of both could govern the timing of <b>deglaciations.</b> Earlier observational tests indicate that obliquity paces the late Pleistocene glacial cycles, but are inconclusive with regard to precession because the shorter precession period demands greater time accuracy. Here, both obliquity and precession are shown to pace the timing of late Pleistocene glacial cycles. Requisite time control comes from a new tuning algorithm that calls on the orthogonality between precession and obliquity variations {{in order to avoid}} circularity and check for accuracy. A second test confirms combined orbital pacing without recourse to orbital tuning. Both tests support the Milankovitch hypothesis, but are also consistent with the duration of Southern Hemisphere summer pacing <b>deglaciations.</b> 1 During the late Pleistocene—roughly over the last million years—Northern Hemisphere continental ice has alternately covered much of northern North America and Fennoscandia and then retreated to today’s relatively ice-free conditions at approximately 100, 000 year intervals. The cause of these massive shifts in climate remains unclear—less for lack of hypotheses, of which there are now over thirty, and more for lack of means to choose between them. Most of the models proposed over the last two centuries have called on the precession of the equinoxes relative to Earth’s eccentric orbit 1 – 3, changes in Earth’s obliquity 4, 5, or some combination of both 6 – 11 to control the glacial cycles, though mechanisms wholly internal to the climate system have also been put forward 12, 13. Observational tests indicate that obliquity paces the ∼ 100 ky glacial cycles 5, 14, helping narrow the list of viable mechanisms, but tests of precession’s role have been inconclusive (i. e. p> 0. 05) because of small sample sizes and uncertain timing 5, 14, 15.

25|$|During <b>deglaciation,</b> {{the melted}} ice water {{returns to the}} oceans, thus sea level in the ocean {{increases}} again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the melted ice water {{is not the same}} everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the melted water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{solubility}} in seawater is also affected by temperature {{and by the}} carbonate buffer. The decrease of solubility of carbon dioxide in seawater when temperature increases {{is also an important}} retroaction factor (positive feedback) exacerbating past and future climate changes as observed in ice cores from the Vostok site in Antarctica. At the geological time scale, because of the Milankovich cycles, when the astronomical parameters of the Earth orbit and its rotation axis progressively change and modify the solar irradiance at the Earth surface, temperature starts to increase. When a <b>deglaciation</b> period is initiated, the progressive warming of the oceans releases CO2 in the atmosphere because of its lower solubility in warmer sea water. On its turn, higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere increase the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide acts as an amplifier of the general warming.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{that there have been}} significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent <b>deglaciation.</b> Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away {{from the center of the}} Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.|$|E

25|$|Glacial loads {{provided}} more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada {{and more than}} 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum.

Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the state of stress at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the state of stress is recorded in the postglacial faults in southeastern Canada. When the postglacial faults formed at the end of <b>deglaciation</b> 9000 years ago, the horizontal principal stress orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast-southwest, along the direction of seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

25|$|The lack of {{an impact}} crater at the {{discovery}} site was only explained after the 1920's, with the new understanding about the Missoula Floods, {{one of the largest}} floods documented, caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last <b>deglaciation.</b> The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now Montana or western Canada, and was transported as a glacial erratic (dragged by the glacier ice) to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the Clark Fork River. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at the Lake Missoula right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to 10 million cubic meters per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the Columbia River and the Willamette Valley {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). Some of these ice rafts included boulders (named erratics by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sunk in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans.|$|E
25|$|During glaciation, {{water was}} taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the {{continental}} shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate.

This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America {{at the end of the}} last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory.

The intensification of upwelling in the EEP coincided with those at the Peru margin and in the Southern Ocean.
