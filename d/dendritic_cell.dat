5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E

40|$|Previously we {{have shown}} in a mouse model of {{bronchial}} asthma that thrombomodulin can convert immunogenic conventional <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> into tolerogenic <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> while inducing its own expression on their <b>cell</b> surface. Thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> are tolerogenic while thrombomodulin(-) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> are pro-inflammatory and immunogenic. Here we hypothesized that thrombomodulin treatment of <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> would modulate inflammatory gene expression. Murine bone marrow-derived <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> were treated with soluble thrombomodulin and expression of surface markers was determined. Treatment with thrombomodulin reduces the expression of maturation markers and increases the expression of TM on the DC surface. Thrombomodulin treated and control <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> were sorted into thrombomodulin(+) and thrombomodulin(-) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> before their mRNA was analyzed by microarray. mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory genes and <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> maturation markers were reduced while expression of cell cycle genes were increased in thrombomodulin-treated and thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> compared to control <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> and thrombomodulin(-) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells.</b> Thrombomodulin-treated and thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> had higher expression of 15 -lipoxygenase suggesting increased synthesis of lipoxins. Thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> produced more lipoxins than thrombomodulin(-) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells,</b> as measured by ELISA, confirming that this pathway was upregulated. There was more phosphorylation of several cell cycle kinases in thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> while phosphorylation of kinases involved with pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling was reduced. Cultures of thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> contained more cells actively dividing than those of thrombomodulin(-) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells.</b> Production of IL- 10 is increased in thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells.</b> Antagonism of IL- 10 with a neutralizing antibody inhibited the effects of thrombomodulin treatment of <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> suggesting a mechanistic role for IL- 10. The surface of thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> supported activation of protein C and procarboxypeptidase B 2 in a thrombomodulin-dependent manner. Thus thrombomodulin treatment increases the number of thrombomodulin(+) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells,</b> which have significantly altered gene expression compared to thrombomodulin(-) <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in key immune function pathways...|$|R

40|$|The {{etiology}} of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} is still unknown. Persistence of inflammatory bowel disease {{is associated with a}} breakdown of tolerance against the commensal mircoflora. Various animal studies have provided insights that mucosal <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> {{play a key role in}} this process as highly potent antigen presenting cells. However, the specific function of <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in inflammatory bowel disease is still unkown. Thus, plasmacytoid <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> and myeloid <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease were classified phenotypically and functionally within this study. Inflammatory bowel disease patients with an acute flare up showed a significant drop of <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, the assessment of maturation and activation markers displayed an immature phenotype of these peripheral blood <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells.</b> Myeloide <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> and plasmacytoide <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with inflammatory bowel disease expressed higher amounts of the migration marker alpha 4 -beta 7 on their surface. Moreover, we could identify significant more plasmacytoide <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> and myeloide <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in the population of CD 45 + cells of the mucosa from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. We suggest that immature <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> of the peripheral blood migrate during an acute stage of disease and mature on their way to inflammatory tissue. Cytokine secretion of freshly isolated, cultured and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated myeloide <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> was assessed using cytometric bead arrays.

The type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells can differentiate to secrete IL-12 (which supports TH1 cell development) or IL-4 (which supports TH2 responses). pDNA injected by needle is endocytosed into the <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell,</b> which is then stimulated to differentiate for TH1 cytokine production, while the gene gun bombards the DNA directly into the cell, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation.|$|E

Because of their ability to induce natural and peripheral regulatory T <b>cells,</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> contribute to the development of the central  and peripheral tolerance in the organism.

25|$|This {{regulation}} of cytokines appear to occur via the p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway. Usually, the p38 within the <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> expresses TLR 4 (toll-like receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS (lipopolysaccharide). This causes the p38 MAPK to be phosphorylated. This phosphorylation activates the p38 MAPK to begin producing IL-10 and IL-12. When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, {{the production of}} cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of IL-12. The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and IL-12 may further increase the production of IL-12 once IL-10 is not being produced. This increased production of IL-12 causes increased T-cell immune response.|$|E

Evidence has now been obtained showing that progenitors to <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> can internalize particles, including Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) mycobacteria. The particulates are applied for 20 h to bone marrow cultures that have been stimulated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to induce aggregates of growing <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells.</b> Cells within these aggregates are clearly phagocytic. If the developing cultures are exposed to particles, washed, and "chased" for 2 d, the number of major histocompatibility complex class II-rich <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> increases substantially and at least 50 % contain internalized mycobacteria or latex particles.

Due to the fact that dendritic cells are the immune system's most important antigen-presenting cells, their activity must be tightly regulated by mechanisms such as apoptosis.
