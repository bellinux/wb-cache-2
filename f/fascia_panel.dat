5000|$|In {{terms of}} styling, the {{amplifiers}} up until 1989 are constructed of heavy aluminium extruded cases {{that act as}} heat sinks; these were painted black with a metallic silver brim - thus nicknamed [...] "chrome bumper" [...] range. The pre-amplifiers are housed in [...] "half-size" [...] {{while most of the}} power amplifier range was housed in full-size cases. In 1989, the range was given a new look using the same sturdy aluminium cases but with a new olive-coloured <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> which also had a back-lit logo. Another facelift for the range came in 2002. The 2013 range of Naim equipment has aluminium chassis and sleeves; the fascia is die-cast zinc.|$|E
5000|$|In 1903, 24 {{motor cars}} and 33 {{trailers}} {{were provided by}} Westinghouse. The stock was of an American design, with a clerestory roof and open gated ends. Unheated accommodation was in saloons and the wooden bodies were British built, the bogies {{had been made by}} Baldwin Locomotive Works in America. All cars were 8 ft wide, the motor cars were 59 ft long and weighed 36+1/2 LT and the trailers 58 ft long and weighed 20 LT. First and Third Class cars were provided, the first class seats being natural rattan, the third class seats being moulded plywood.

5000|$|The {{stainless}} steel cabinet surrounding of each letter {{is made from}} thin gauge {{stainless steel}} <b>fascia</b> <b>panels</b> with a non-directional brushed finish. These panels provide a [...] "dimple" [...] like protective coating and are attached with a hi-bond adhesive to the frame structure. The frame structure is a 2" [...] x 6" [...] section welded together. The thin gauge painted steel [...] "letterforms" [...] are welded to the monolithic frame. A steel leveling plate was used to mount each letter into a 46” x 18” x ¼” base plate configuration using gussets, vinyl tape, and silicone. The leveling plate {{is attached to a}} concrete footer. [...] Each of the five of the letters are 7.5 feet in height, 3.5 feet in length, with the main steel cabinet having a depth of 5.875 inches. If all five sculptures were placed side by side the length would total 17.5 feet.|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to the Kiosk building, {{against the}} {{south-eastern}} {{boundary of the}} site, sits a large steel-framed and wire-mesh-enclosed aviary housing nocturnal birds and animals (pre-1970, refurbished in 1987 as the Rainforest Pool Aviary). This features a rock wall and small waterfall. A length of miniature train track runs through a fence opposite this aviary {{and up to the}} concrete block structure described earlier. This marks an earlier course of the miniature train line. The Spirit of the Outback store (former Rock Shop) is founded on a concrete slab with a sloping skirt around the entire building and expressed columns at each wall joint, which hide the downpipes. These consist of a concrete casing. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated steel and walls faced with stone. Its wide <b>fascia</b> <b>panels</b> and eaves are lined with fibrous-cement sheeting. Inside there is a cathedral ceiling with fibrous-cement sheeting behind narrow timber rafters. The walls are also lined with fibrous-cement sheeting.|$|R
50|$|Dipl. Ing. Ernst Zacharias, {{inventor}} of the Cembalet, Pianet & Clavinet told us the very first Pianet series was called just Pianet. It has a case profile with a taper towards the front. It has tapered cylindrical legs that mount to {{the underside of the}} case. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> below the keys. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Pianet' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a valve pre-amplifier and a knee lever for volume control.|$|E
50|$|The Europa Series 2, or Lotus Type 54, was {{introduced}} in April 1968 (approximately chassis number 0645 onwards). The S2 used the same 1470cc Renault engine and mechanical components as the earlier Series 1, but added {{a number of key}} refinements including opening electric windows, adjustable seats, a new fully carpeted interior and a polished wooden <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> for the dashboard. The most significant change was the switch from fully-bonded construction to the use of bolt fasteners to attach the fibreglass body to the backbone steel frame. While reducing the torsional and flexural stiffneses somewhat, the use of a separable body was welcomed by the automotive insurance industry as it greatly reduced the complexity and cost of making repairs to the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Pianet N II has a case profile with a taper {{towards the}} front. It has tapered {{rectangular}} cross section legs in an inverted V that mount {{to the ends}} of the case and are secured by a large threaded knob. The legs are satin black. The legs are braced by a black cross bar towards the base of the rear legs. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> below the keys with a lock fitted centrally. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Pianet N' appears in gold facing forward on the left hand face of the music support ledge. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier and a floor pedal volume control. Vibrato effect is standard.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{asbestos}} to manufacture transite was phased out in the 1980s. Previously transite was made of cement, with varying amounts (12-50%) {{of asbestos}} fiber to provide tensile strength (similar to the steel in reinforced concrete), and other materials. It was frequently used for such purposes as furnace flues, roof shingles, siding, soffit and <b>fascia</b> <b>panels,</b> and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important. It was also used in walk-in coolers made in large supermarkets in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Other uses included roof drain piping, water piping, sanitary sewer drain piping, laboratory fume hood panels, ceiling tiles, landscape edging, and HVAC ducts. Because cutting, breaking, and machining asbestos-containing transite releases carcinogenic asbestos fibers into the air, its use has fallen out of favor. Despite asbestos-containing transite being phased out, {{it is still not}} banned in the United States; some 230,000 deaths have been attributed to it. Demolition of older buildings containing transite materials, particularly siding made from transite requires special precautions and disposal techniques to protect workers and the public. Finding and safely handling asbestos-containing transite is dangerous and difficult and should only be done by an asbestos abatement professional.|$|R
50|$|Available in coupé and {{convertible}} bodies, it is {{a version}} of Continental GT W12 with increased engine power to @6000rpm and 1017 Nm@2050-4500rpm, ZF 8-speed automatic with Quickshift, Block Shifting and wheel-mounted paddleshift, carbon ceramic brakes with enhanced cooling, 420 mm front and 356 mm rear carbon silicon carbide brake discs, 21-inch forged alloy wheels, optional titanium exhaust system, updated version of the torque vectoring system from Continental GT3-R, dynamic system brakes, lowered and stiffened dynamic suspension set-up, front and rear bumper designs incorporating a carbon-fibre splitter and diffuser respectively, new side sill extensions and bonnet vents in carbon-fibre, gloss-black front wing vents, rifled exhaust tailpipe in gloss-black, dark-tint headlamps and tail-lamps, black-finished brightware at front grilles, lights, rear bumper, door handles and window surrounds; optional aerodynamically balanced rear spoiler and front splitter combination for coupe, new Supersports badging, 21-inch forged alloy wheels in black and bright-machined finish, optional side decals optional carbon-fibre engine cover in gloss-finish with Supersports branding, multi-layer hood for convertible, neck warmer for convertible, tri-tone interior option, new diamond-quilted design at seats and door side panels with Alcantara upholstery, a choice of 11 veneers and technical finishes (including chequered Supersports carbon-fibre <b>fascia</b> <b>panels),</b> new Supersports emblem stitching, bespoke Supersports steering wheel and unique gearlever with Alcantara accents. 710 Supersports in total will be built.|$|R
5000|$|The {{appearance}} package {{gave the}} consumer equipment also {{available on the}} [...] "Sport" [...] trucks such as painted bumpers, 20" [...] chrome-clad aluminum wheels, and bright grille inserts. In addition, the package also included a brushed aluminum fuel door, chrome exhaust tip, lower rocker <b>panel</b> <b>fascia</b> or [...] "ground effects", and a hood scoop. The hood scoop was non-functional.|$|R
50|$|This Cembalet II has a side case profile with taper {{towards the}} front of the lid. It has a gold lid lift bar fitted to {{the front of the}} lid. The sides are {{extended}} to the floor with a shaped foot extending toward the player. It has a wooden <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> below the keys with a central lid lock. The music support ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. A speaker housing containing two speakers is fitted below the keyboard and spans the full width of the keyboard in front of the player's knees. Just one speaker was used in early Cembalet II. Two additional rotary controls are fitted at the left hand end of the keyboard.|$|E
50|$|The Ital had revised {{exterior}} styling, but {{retained the}} Marina's 1.3- and 1.7-litre petrol engines and rear-wheel drive chassis. The dashboard and {{interior of the}} Marina were also carried over largely unaltered, including the main <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> which faced 'away' from the driver. The Marina's coupé variant was not produced in Ital form, but the four-door saloon, five-door estate and pick-up and van versions were carried over from the Marina range. From October 1980 an automatic version of the Ital was available with the 2.0-litre O-Series power unit, as the range-topping 2.0HLS. Only about 1,000 2.0HLS models were sold so due to this and their short production run, the 2.0HLS is now the rarest Ital model. In November 1981 all HL and HLS models were fitted with upgraded interior trim.|$|E
50|$|The Cembalet & Cembalet I has a {{rectangular}} case profile with no taper towards the front. It has a gold lid lift bar fitted {{to the front}} of the lid. It has tapered cylindrical wooden legs with gold ferrules at the foot that mount to angled blocks on the underside of the case. It has a wooden <b>fascia</b> <b>panel</b> below the keys with a central lid lock. The keys are wood with conventional plastic laminates for the top and front. Later Cembalet I used plastic keys. The word 'Cembalet I' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a valve pre-amplifier and a knee lever for volume control.|$|E
5000|$|Styling {{changes for}} the sedan and wagon {{included}} new front fender caps on the same fenders as used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear <b>fascia,</b> instrument <b>panel,</b> interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight [...] "coffin nose" [...] look. The contemporary Matador saw a similar frontal treatment, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.|$|R
25|$|Traditional shophouses facade {{ornamentation}} draws {{inspiration from}} the Malay, Chinese and European traditions. European neo-classical motifs include egg-and-dart moldings and ionic or Corinthian capitals on decorative pillasters. From the Malay building tradition, elaborate woodwork has been borrowed {{in the form of}} carved <b>panels.</b> <b>Fascia</b> boards, louvres, screens and fretwork. Finally, from the Chinese tradition comes Sino-Portuguese influences and mythological motifs like phoenixes as well as butterfly-shaped windows. Other traditions include the use of Peranakan pastel coloured glazed tiles, often with floral or geometric motifs. The degree of a shophouse's ornamentation depended on the prosperity of its owner and the surrounding area; shophouse facades in cities and (former) boomtowns are generally more elaborate than spartan rural shophouses.|$|R
25|$|In 1969, Bayer {{exhibited}} an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, {{such as the}} <b>fascia</b> {{and body}} <b>panels,</b> were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and better thermal stability.This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.|$|R
