40|$|The {{expansion}} of the EC to include EFTA countries, and the greater provision of preferential access to protected EC markets for farmers in Eastern Europe's economies in transition, would have opposite effects on Europe's excess supply of food and on international food prices (assuming EC domestic prices remain unchanged). Their combined impacts on these parameters could therefore be positive or negative, as could the effects on net economic welfare in Europe and elsewhere. A multicommodity simulation model of world food markets is used to estimate the commodity and welfare effects of such integration by the year 2000. The results show that even if just the four most advanced Central European countries were to be given free access to EC food markets, that effective increase in European agricultural protection would virtually wipe out the global benefit from the lowering of EFTA's food prices {{to those in the}} EC- 12. The budgetary cost to the EC of allowing Central European farmers access to EC markets would amount to one-quarter of the <b>EC's</b> expenditure on <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> supports, or far greater than what would accrue from EFTA countries joining the EC.

30|$|The {{economic}} intuition of Proposition 1 is as follows: Each processor {{chooses the}} optimal {{amount of the}} agricultural material to purchase where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost. The marginal revenue is increasing in the wholesale price, regardless of the wholesale market structure. Retailers’ seller power causes the wholesale demand to be lower and less elastic through a pivotal shift, 6 {{which leads to a}} lower wholesale price and a lower marginal revenue (MR) for processors. Even when weakened buyer power in agricultural procurement results in a <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> increase, the lower MR for processors due to retailers’ seller power causes processors to compete less aggressively in farm markets than they would when the retail market is competitive and, thus, reduces the amount of <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> increase. Farmer welfare, measured by producer surplus, is increasing in the <b>farm</b> <b>price,</b> ceteris paribus. Thus, when retailers’ seller power reduces the magnitude of <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> increase, it also diminishes the amount of farm welfare gain.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Countries {{around the}} world often face {{agricultural}} products price volatility problem. Agriculture products' price level directly influences producers' revenue, and agriculture products' price volatility will further reveal price risks taken by producers throughout the production. The empirical result of this dissertation {{can be divided into}} three parts. The first part adopts BEKK-MGARCH model to analyze U. S. wheat, corns, and soybeans futures price and volatility transmission effect. Next, corns and soybeans are raw materials of domestic broiler's forage. Therefore, the second part of this dissertation will adopt DCC-MGARCH model to analyze direct influence of U. S. corns and soybeans futures prices volatility on domestic broiler's forage price. Also using the influential effect from indirect influence of domestic broiler's forage price volatility on broiler's <b>farm</b> <b>price,</b> this thesis will further analyze domestic broiler forage and <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> volatility transmission effect. Lastly, the third part of this dissertation also adopts BEKK-MGARCH model, and conducts price and volatility transmission effect analysis on domestic broiler's <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> and chicken retailing price, chicken and pork's retailing price, and pork retailing and hog's <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> volatility, respectively. The estimated result of dissertation is as following: 1. Current period US wheat, corns, and soybeans futures price change' are influenced by prior period self futures price change's. And from different grains futures price change's transmission effect, prior period futures price change's of US wheat, corns, and soybeans would mutually influence current period futures price change's. Next, US wheat, corns, and soybeans futures price change's not only is influenced by self prior period price change's, but also is influenced by crossing market different level's prior period futures price change's short-run shock. US wheat, corns, and soybeans futures price change's volatility not only is influenced by self prior period futures price change's volatility long-run persistence, but also is influenced by crossing market prior period futures price change's volatility long-run persistence. 2. There are significant effects of previous broiler feed and <b>farm</b> <b>prices</b> on current price reactions. As for the interaction between broiler feed and <b>farm</b> <b>price,</b> there are significant effects of previous broiler feed price on current broiler <b>farm</b> <b>price,</b> and of previous broiler <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> on current broiler feed price. As for the price volatility analysis of broiler feed and <b>farm</b> <b>price,</b> the short-run shock and volatility long-run persistent effects of broiler feed <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> are significant. 3. In price transmission effect analysis, prior period hog's farm (pork retailing), not only price are influenced by current period self price volatility, but also current period hog's <b>farm</b> (pork retailing) <b>price</b> is deeply influenced by prior period pork retailing (hog's <b>farm)</b> <b>price.</b> For price volatility short-run shock and long-run persistence transmission effect, current period hog's farm and pork retailing price change's volatility is influenced by prior period self-price change's volatility short-run shock and long-run persistence effect; in crossing market price change's volatility short-run shock and long-run persistence transmission effect, short-run shock and long-run persistence of current retailing price change's volatility also reacts greater to prior period hog's <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> change's volatility.

40|$|The typical {{model of}} retail pricing for produce {{products}} assumes retailers set price {{equal to the}} <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> plus a certain markup. However, observations from scanner data indicate a large degree of price dispersion in the grocery retailing market. In addition to markup pricing behavior, we document three alternative leading pricing patterns: fixed (constant) pricing, periodic sale, and high-low pricing. Retail price variations under these alternative pricing regimes in general have little correlation with the <b>farm</b> <b>price.</b> How do retailers’ alternative pricing behaviors affect farmers’ welfare? Using markup pricing as the baseline case, we parameterize the model to reflect a prototypical fresh produce market and carry {{out a series of}} simulations under different pricing regimes. Our study shows that if harvest cost is sufficiently low, retail prices adjusting only partially, or not at all, to supply shocks tends to diminish farm income and exacerbate <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> volatility relative to the baseline case. However, we also find that if harvest cost is sufficiently large and the harvest-cost constraint places a lower bound on the <b>farm</b> <b>price,</b> increased <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> volatility induced by retailers’ alternative pricing strategies may result in higher farm income, compared to markup pricing. Our study is the first to evaluate the welfare implications for producers of the diversified pricing strategies that retailers utilize in practice and the resulting attenuation of the relationship between prices at retail and at the farm gate.

40|$|In this study, we {{estimated}} catfish {{feed and}} <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> reduced form equations. Of particular importance was {{the impact of}} the recent increase in grain prices induced by ethanol production on feed cost and <b>farm</b> <b>prices.</b> This relationship was examined using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. Results show that a 1 % increase in corn prices caused a 0. 134 % and 0. 263 % increase in feed prices in the short- and long-run, respectively. Catfish <b>farm</b> <b>prices</b> increased by 0. 106 % (short-run) and 0. 211 % (long-run) given a 1 % increase in feed prices. Between 2004 and 2008, corn prices increased from $ 2 to $ 6 per bushels. Taheripour and Tyner (2008) state that of the total increase, 25 % was due to US ethanol subsidies and 75 % was due to the increase in the price of crude oil. Given the $ 1 increase in corn prices (50 %), this should result in a feed price increase of 13 % and a <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> increase of 2. 7 % in the long-run. Park and Fortenbery (2007) found that for every percentage increase in ethanol production, corn prices increased by 0. 16 % in the short run.
