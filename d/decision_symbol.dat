Specifically, three sub-classes referred to as symbol-by-symbol multi-level chirp modulation, full-response phase-continuous multi-level chirp modulation and full-response multi-mode phase-continuous multi-level chirp modulation are considered. These modulated signals are described, illustrated, and examined for their properties. The ability of these signals to operate over AWGN is assessed using upper bounds on minimum Euclidean distance {{as a function of}} modulation parameters. Coherent and non-coherent detection of multi-level chirp signals in AWGN are considered and optimum and sub-optimum receiver structures are derived. The performance of these receivers have been assessed using upper and lower bounds as a function of SNR, modulation parameters, modulation levels, <b>decision</b> <b>symbol</b> locations, and observation length of receiver.

The packet length is normally {{constrained by the}} channel coherence time for a given bandwidth, beyond which channel tracking using an adaptive decision feedback equalizer becomes difficult.

Using the iterative correlation-based equalizer where <b>decision</b> <b>symbols</b> {{are assumed to be}} the true symbols to estimate the channel condition, it is shown based on at-sea data that long packets of data can be transmitted with minimal errors even in harsh environments where the channel coherence time is very short (a fraction of the packet length) ...|$|R

Phase noise becomes a detrimental problem {{and needs to be}} estimated and compensated. In this thesis receiver algorithms are derived and evaluated to mitigate the effects of the phase noise in digital communication systems. In Chapter 3 phase noise estimation in single-input single-output (SISO) systems is investigated. First, a hard decision directed extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to an uncoded system. Next, an iterative receiver algorithm performing code-aided turbo synchronization is derived using the expectation maximization (EM) framework for a coded system. Two soft-decision directed estimators in the literature based on Kalman filtering are evaluated. Low density parity check (LDPC) codes are proposed to calculate marginal a posteriori probabilities and to construct soft <b>decision</b> <b>symbols.</b> Error rate performance of both estimators are compared through simulations. In Chapter 4 phase noise estimation in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is investigated. First, a low complexity hard decision directed EKF is applied to an uncoded system.

A low complexity soft decision directed extended Kalman filter and smoother (EKFS) that tracks the phase noise parameters over a frame is proposed in order to carry out the maximization step. The proposed EKFS based approach is combined with an iterative detector that utilizes bit interleaved coded modulation and employs LDPC codes.
