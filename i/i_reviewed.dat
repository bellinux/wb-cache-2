500|$|Reviews {{were mostly}} positive. A film {{critic for the}} Los Angeles Examiner said that [...] "not since <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> the first Chaplin comedies {{way back in the}} two-reel days has Charlie given us such an orgy of laughs." [...] The New York Times {{reviewer}} Mordaunt Hall considered it [...] "a film worked out with admirable artistry". Variety declared it was [...] "not Chaplin's best picture" [...] but that certain sequences were [...] "hilarious." [...] The New Yorker wrote that it was [...] "on the order of his other , perhaps a little better than any of them" [...] and that it gave an impression [...] "not often - oh, very seldom - found in the movies; an indefinable impression perhaps best described as a quality of charm." [...] On the other hand, Alexander Bakshy of The Nation was highly critical of City Lights, objecting to the silent format and over-sentimentality and describing it as [...] "Chaplin's feeblest".|$|E
2500|$|Five of the jurors, who convicted Workman in 1982, {{have since}} signed {{affidavits}} renouncing either the sentence or the verdict or both. Wardie Parks, {{a member of}} the 1982 jury, has stated that, [...] "If the new evidence <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> had been presented at Workman's trial...I would have had a reasonable doubt whether Workman was guilty of first-degree felony murder, and I would have voted to acquit him of that charge." [...] Parks has said that he did not hear any ballistics evidence during the original trial and believed the testimony of eyewitness Harold Davis.|$|E

The correspondents who have written {{were all in the}} dark, and had made no proper inquiries. I have invited correspondents to come and see what was being done, but they did not come. I have been very unjustly treated by these writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when they are out of matter, and news has been very scarce this winter. Dr. Sheffield thinks it better for the work that I return home now than wait a little longer and make my class reunion in 1902.|$|E

2500|$|Murphy {{has responded}} to Whiting's {{comments}} as follows: [...] "While Whiting, in his presentation for FARMS at BYU, exclaimed delight {{at the prospect of}} evolutionary biology coming to the defense of the Book of Mormon, he offered no scientific data to substantiate an Israelite origin of indigenous peoples anywhere in the Americas. In fact, he conceded, 'current genetic evidence suggests that Native Americans have a genetic history representative of Asia and not the Middle East.'" [...] Murphy further states: [...] "One of the most surprising critiques to emerge was the false allegation that I am evading peer review or that the research <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> would not stand up to peer review ... he article [...] was a summary of genetic research on Native American origins, nearly all of which had been subjected to peer review prior to publication in leading scientific journals such as American Journal of Human Genetics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and American Journal of Physical Anthropology .... Whiting's and Lambert's claims are little more than an inaccurate projection of the inadequacies of LDS apologetics onto my publications." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{regiment}} {{took some}} time to reform during 1813 and would only go back to action in April. Napoleon <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> them at Erfurt on April 27; only three days later the Grenadiers-à-Cheval received news {{of the death of}} their beloved leader, Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières, who had been killed in action by a stray Russian cannonball, next to the village of Rippach. The regiment saw brief action at the battle of Dresden and was involved in supporting the foot Guards take the village of Reudnitz, during the battle of Leipzig in late October. The only major engagement of the year would come at the end of October, at the battle of Hanau. As the Austro-Bavarians under Karl Philipp von Wrede were trying to block the retreat of the Grande Armée towards France, Napoleon was forced to commit his élite troops, personally haranguing the Grenadiers-à-Cheval as they were preparing to go into action. The entire Guard cavalry charged by squadron, in column and broke a numerous enemy cavalry, following it for several hundred metres. During this battle, the colonel major of the regiment, general [...] Louis-Marie Lévesque received six sabre cuts to the shoulder and arm and captain adjutant-major Guindey, famous for killing Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia at the battle of Saalfeld seven years earlier, was killed in action. Another blow was dealt to the morale of the regiment on November 24 of that year, when the regiment's commander-in-chief, general of division Frédéric Henri Walther died suddenly from exhaustion and illness. He was replaced on December 1 by the 45-year-old general of division Claude Étienne Guyot, with the senior general of division Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty taking overall command of the entire Guard cavalry.|$|E

60|$|And {{kneeling}} there, {{the eyes}} of my soul conned closely the scroll of my young life {{as it had been}} unfolded hitherto. <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> its beginnings in the greyness of Mondolfo, under the tutelage of my poor, dolorous mother who had striven so fiercely to set my feet upon the ways of sanctity. But my ways had been errant ways, even though, myself, I had sought to walk as she directed. I had strayed and blundered, veered and veered again, a very mockery of what she strove to make me--a strolling saint, indeed, as Cosimo had dubbed me, a wandering mummer when I sought after holiness.|$|E
60|$|In my mind <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> my wasted life, {{with the}} {{fleeting}} pleasures and the enduring sorrows {{that it had}} brought me--or that I had drawn from it.

He had taken pity on Gaston de Luynes, the nephew of that famous Albert de Luynes who had been Constable of France {{in the early days}} of the late king's reign; he had made me lieutenant of his guards and maître d'armes to his nephews Andrea and Paolo de Mancini because he knew that a better blade than mine could not be found in France, and because he thought it well to have such swords as mine about him.|$|E

[...] "What do you mean by calling my honesty in question?" [...] I had cried the day before, turning upon Myner. Ah, that day before! the day before Waterloo, the day before the Flood; the day before I had sold the roof over my head, my future, and my self-respect, for a dinner at the Café Cluny! ...|$|E

60|$|During {{this visit}} <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> Banks' army a short {{distance}} above Carrollton. The horse I rode was vicious and but little used, and on my return to New Orleans ran away and, shying at a locomotive in the street, fell, probably on me. I was rendered insensible, and when I regained consciousness I found myself in a hotel near by with several doctors attending me. My leg was swollen from the knee to the thigh, and the swelling, {{almost to the point}} of bursting, extended along the body up to the arm-pit. The pain was almost beyond endurance. I lay at the hotel something over a week without being able to turn myself in bed. I had a steamer stop at the nearest point possible, and was carried to it on a litter. I was then taken to Vicksburg, where I remained unable to move for some time afterwards.|$|E
60|$|And {{the more}} I {{thought of what}} had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> the whole {{extraordinary}} sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,--we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by {{the murder of the}} discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.|$|E

Rapidly <b>I</b> <b>reviewed</b> the situation and considered every possible method of escape. At first I could think of none; then suddenly I remembered that the driver and his companion, who no doubt knew every inch of the road, had leaped from the coach, apparently {{over the edge of the}} precipice. This I felt sure they would not have done had they been going to certain death, since they would have preferred to take their chance of mercy at the hands of the brigands. Moreover, these gentry themselves had driven the mules into the abyss whither those wise animals would never have gone unless there was some foothold for them.|$|E
