5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy <b>double-skinned</b> construction, and were {{delivered}} unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
25|$|Dacians had {{developed}} the murus dacicus (<b>double-skinned</b> ashlar-masonry with rubble fill and tie beams) characteristic to their complexes of fortified cities, like their capital Sarmisegetuza Regia {{in what is}} today Hunedoara County, Romania. This type of wall has been discovered {{not only in the}} Dacian citadel of the Orastie mountains, but also in those at Covasna, Breaza near Făgăraș, Tilișca near Sibiu, Căpâlna in the Sebeș valley, Bănița not far from Petroșani, and Piatra Craivii to the north of Alba Iulia. The degree of their urban development was displayed on Trajan's Column and in the account of how Sarmizegetusa Regia was defeated by the Romans. The Romans were given by treachery the locations of aqueducts and pipelines of the Dacian capital, only after destroying the water supply being able to end the long siege of Sarmisegetuza.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of <b>double-skinned</b> construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Cooling {{this large}} engine whilst minimising {{aerodynamic}} drag posed new challenges {{for both the}} Rolls-Royce and Supermarine design teams. Traditional cooling methods using honeycomb-type radiators were known to cause high drag in flight; consequently {{it was decided to}} use the surface skins of the S.6 wings and floats as heat exchangers, employing a <b>double-skinned</b> structure through which the coolant could circulate. Engine oil was cooled in a similar manner using channels in the fuselage and empennage skins. The S.6 was described at the time as a [...] "flying radiator", and it had been estimated that this coolant system dissipated the equivalent of 1,000hp (745kW) of heat in flight. However, even with this system in use, engine overheating was noted during the race flights, requiring the pilots to reduce the throttle setting to maintain a safe operating temperature.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and <b>double-skinned</b> exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the throttle twist grip! The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concrete}} {{remains of}} part of this facility can still {{be seen on the}} summit of the hill: the octagonal concrete base measures 3.85 m (13 feet) across, with a channel running west to east across the middle. On the southern edge of the octagon is a raised area of concrete, which is 225mm (9 inches) higher {{than the rest of the}} base. Around the edge of the octagon are the remnants of a reinforced parapet, which has long been removed. There are also signs of a Fletton brick wall running westward away from the raised area. The octagonal shape of the base indicates that a direction-finding station operator's hut stood there. It would have consisted of a <b>double-skinned</b> wooden structure in which the cavity was filled with shingle designed to make them [...] "splinter proof" [...] or [...] "bulletproof". [...] Two Y stations were operated in Sheringham in World War II, one by the RAF and the other by the Royal Navy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} has 14,000 litres (3,700 gal (US)) {{of internal}} fuel, and its engines are quite thirsty, {{especially when the}} afterburner is active. Fuel was contained within integral tanks within the wings, {{as well as a}} <b>double-skinned</b> section of the fuselage between and outboard of the inlet ducts, underneath the ducts and engines, and forward of the main spar of the tail fin; this provided a total internal capacity of [...] A refueling probe is built into the nose; aerial refuelling was often necessary in operations as the Mirage IV only had the fuel capacity, even with external drop tanks, to reach the Soviet Union's borders, thus refuelling was required to allow for a 'round trip'. In the event of nuclear war between the major powers, it was thought that there would be little point in having the fuel to return as the host air bases would have been destroyed; instead, surviving Mirage IVs would have diverted to land at bases in nearby neutral countries following the delivery of their ordnance.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} one {{moonlight}} night when Geoffrey Thurston sat inside his <b>double-skinned</b> tent which was pitched above {{a river of}} British Columbia. A few good furs checkered the spruce twigs which served as a carpet, and the canvas dwelling was both commodious and comfortable. A bright brass lamp hung from the ridge pole, a nickeled clock ticked cheerily upon a hanging shelf behind the neat camp cot, {{while the rest of}} the well-made furniture betokened a degree of prosperity. One of Savine's junior assistants, sent up there in an emergency to replace an older man, sat close by, and, because he dwelt in a bark shanty, envied Thurston his tent.|$|E
60|$|By and by he set off, {{avoiding}} fallen {{trees and}} scrambling across round-topped rocks. It was rough work {{and he was}} tired, but he could get forward without using the ax, {{which he had been}} forced to do when he fell among the horrible devil's club thorns. For all that, dusk was falling when he came to an opening by a creek where a big fire burned and a <b>double-skinned</b> tent {{stood at the edge of}} the trees. Six or seven sturdy packers lounged beside the fire, and Jim saw this was not a poor man's camp. For a few hot weeks, a traveler need suffer no hardship in the North, if he can pay for packers and canoes. A double-roofed tent will keep out sun and rain and a mosquito bar will keep off the flies, but packers who carry comforts cannot carry tools, and a utilitarian journey is another thing.|$|E
60|$|When {{the meal}} was {{finished}} they all gathered round the replenished fire, Lisle lying back in the shadow because {{of the state of}} his clothes. With the exception of Jim, the others were dressed much as they had been at home; their conversation was light and easy, and their manner tranquil. If he could have blotted out the background of tall straight trunks and shadowy rocks, he could have imagined that they were lounging on a sheltered English lawn. <b>Double-skinned</b> tents, camp-chairs, and other signs of a regard for physical comfort bore out the idea in his mind. These English people with their quiet confidence that what they needed--and that was a good deal--would, as had always happened, somehow be supplied, were at once exasperating and admirable. They were the same everywhere, unmoved by change, claiming all that was choicest as by right, and very much at ease on the fringe of the wilderness. They did not belong to it; one could have imagined that it belonged to them. Their journey, however, had only begun, and there were alterations that must obviously be made on the morrow.|$|E

The Danish Navy has retrofitted the vessels with 12.7 mm heavy machine guns, Stinger launchers and decoy launching systems. The ships can carry and use multiple StanFlex mission modules.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the cooling}} fluid, oil cannot {{be allowed to}} boil. This {{presented}} a particular problem with DB 601-series engines, because oil is sprayed against {{the bottom of the}} pistons, resulting in a considerable amount of heat being transferred to the oil as opposed to the coolant. The He 100's oil cooling system was conceptually similar to the water cooling system in that vapor was generated using the heat of the oil and condensed back to liquid by surface cooling through the skins of the airframe. A heat exchanger was used to cool the oil by boiling ethyl alcohol. The oil itself was simply piped to and from this exchanger, which was apparently located in the aft fuselage. The alcohol vapor was piped into the fixed portions of the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and into a <b>double-skinned</b> portion of the upper-aft fuselage behind the cockpit. This fuselage [...] "turtle deck" [...] panel was the only <b>double-skinned</b> portion of the aircraft's cooling system. The use of a <b>double-skinned</b> panel was possible here because the inside of panel was accessible in the event of repair. Condensed alcohol was collected by a series of bellows pumps and returned to a single header tank that fed the heat exchanger. Some sources speculate that a small air intake located at the bottom front of the engine cowl was used for an auxiliary oil cooler. No such cooler was fitted, nor was there room for one at that point. This small inlet served simply to admit cool air into what was a very hot portion of the engine bay. Immediately above this vent were the two steam separators, and immediately behind it were the hot coolant pipes coming from the separators.|$|E
50|$|The term Pandeiro was {{previously}} {{used to describe}} a square <b>double-skinned</b> frame drum, often with a bell inside; such an instrument is now known by the term adufe in Spain and Portugal. It is derived from an earlier Arabic or Moorish instrument still found in North Africa. The term pandeiro (pandero in Asturian) is still used in parts of Galicia and Portugal to describe the square-shaped drum, while the round drum with jingles is known as Pandeira in Galicia.|$|E

Equipped with 73 alcoves for viewers, the Placentarium {{was intended to be}} silver on the outside and white internally. Designs and a photograph of a small architectural model survive.|$|E
50|$|The Offshore Storage Installation is a barge {{which is}} {{permanently}} anchored in Liverpool Bay, England, and receives {{oil from the}} Douglas Complex of oil platforms in the Irish Sea by way of pipelines under the sea. The facility thus serves as a floating oil terminal, and is capable of holding 870,000 barrels of oil, which can then be transferred to tanker vessels as necessary. The OSI is <b>double-skinned,</b> and is protected by an 800-metre exclusion zone, which is monitored 24 hours a day by radar and a high-powered patrol vessel.|$|E
5000|$|The San Storm is a two-seat {{sports car}} from San Motors India LTD. of India that was {{introduced}} in 1998. It was designed by the French firm, Le Mans Group.

50|$|Body {{inflation}} is {{the practice of}} inflating or pretending to inflate a part of one's body, often for sexual gratification. It is commonly done by inserting balloons underneath clothes or a skin-tight suit and then inflating them. Some people have specially made inflatable suits, commonly made from latex rubber, to make themselves bigger all over. One of the best-known examples is Mr Blowup, who appears in the Deviant Desires book. He wears air-inflated <b>double-skinned</b> latex suits, and has {{made a number of}} TV appearances in the UK, including Eurotrash. Sometimes the body is actually inflated also, such as by enema or drinking large amounts of liquid.|$|E
50|$|Great Eastern's keel {{was laid}} down on 1 May 1854. The hull was an all-iron construction, a double hull of 19 mm (0.75 inch) wrought iron in 0.86 m (2 ft 10 in) plates with ribs every 1.8 m (6 ft). Internally, the hull was divided by two 107 m (350 ft) long, 18 m (60 ft) high, {{longitudinal}} bulkheads and further transverse bulkheads dividing the ship into nineteen compartments. Great Eastern {{was the first}} ship to incorporate the <b>double-skinned</b> hull, a feature which would not be seen again in a ship for several decades, but which is now compulsory for reasons of safety.|$|E

The successful tenderer, Mr W. Taylor, had previously constructed the Lower Hutt Blockhouse and Stockade. The frame of the two-story structure is made from timber and <b>double-skinned</b> with shingle infill, to protect it from rifle fire.

Double skinning over such an extensive area would have made the aircraft unacceptably heavy. Furthermore, there was no access to the inner structure to repair damage such as a bullet hole from the inside, as would be needed if the system used a double skin. A similar system was used by the earlier Supermarine Type 224. Contrary to assertions in some references, all of the He 100s that were built used the evaporative cooling system described above. A derivative of this system was also intended for a late-war project based on the He 100, designated P.1076.|$|E
