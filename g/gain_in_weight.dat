25|$|Disease {{caused by}} the feeding {{activity}} of dipteran flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; these organisms are often of numerous species thus only prominent examples are provided. Feeding by adult flies may cause irritation through to acute stress from painful bites, resulting in loss of grazing time and reduced <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight.</b> Feeding by adult flies on the blood of their hosts exposes the hosts to pathogenic organisms that are infecting the fly, {{this can lead to}} acute disease of the host's blood and other organs. Feeding by adult flies using their sponging mouthparts can also expose the hosts to pathogenic organisms that have contaminated the mouthparts. Larvae of some flies are adapted to feed on the tissues of their host causing direct pathological damage to organs, this is known as myiasis.|$|E
25|$|Obligate myiasis {{of various}} forms {{are typical of}} the oestrid genera. Larval Dermatobia torsalo-flies infest the skin and {{underlying}} tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> and damage to skins used for leather. Larval Gasterophilus stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids. Larval Hypoderma warble-flies infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval Oestrus nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep. Harm to cattle may be caused through panic (known as gadding) at {{the approach of the}} flies if that leads to traumatic injury. There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies.|$|E
