40|$|Background: Adequate <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> {{treatment}} of acute allograft rejection {{is one of}} the most important predictors of post-transplant survival of cardiac transplant recipients. Recently, a number of novel, non-invasive tools have allowed for <b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> better {{treatment of}} rejection episodes. Methods: Using the signal from a special pacemaker implanted during the transplant procedure, the intraventricular electrograms can be obtained. The amplitude and the conduction time of the intraventricular electrogram provide information on electrophysiological properties of ventricular myocardium. Due to edema and inflammation during acute rejection, the amplitude of the signal decreases and the conduction time is prolonged. Results: In Ljubljana Medical Center Transplantation Programme the measurement of intramyocardial electrograms has been shown to represent a reproducible and reliable methodology which led to fewer cardiac biopsy procedures and earlier and better treatment of cardiac allograft rejection. Conclusions: The analysis of intramyocardial electrograms is an important non-invasive tool which allows for better follow-up of cardiac transplant recipients <b>and</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> treatment of allograft rejection episodes. </p...|$|R

A female Asian black bear died in mid-February 2006. In September 2006, some animals at the zoo were diagnosed with tuberculosis, which can also be transmitted to humans, but <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> treatment prevented an outbreak.

25|$|In 2008, a gene {{mutation}} that is typically {{found only in}} Ashkenazi Jews, and is linked to a virulent form of breast cancer in women, was discovered in a cluster of Hispanic Catholic women in southern Colorado, many of whom trace their family's roots to northern New Mexico. It was conclusively shown {{to be related to}} Jewish ancestry, given the history {{of the people in the}} area, and many families reported knowledge of a high incidence of cancer.

25|$|The {{role of a}} GP {{can vary}} greatly between (or even within) countries.

Meanwhile, in rural areas of developed countries or in developing countries a GP may be routinely involved in pre-hospital emergency care, the delivery of babies, community hospital care and performing low-complexity surgical procedures. In some healthcare systems GPs work in primary care centers where they {{play a central role in}} the healthcare team, while in other models of care GPs can work as single-handed practitioners.|$|E

25|$|The Dowding {{system is}} {{considered}} {{key to the}} success of the RAF against the German air force (Luftwaffe) during the Battle of Britain. The combination of <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> rapid dissemination of that information acted as a force multiplier, allowing the fighter force to be used at extremely high rates of effectiveness. In the pre-war period, interception rates of 30% to 50% were considered excellent; that meant that over half the sorties sent out would return without having encountered the enemy. During the Battle, average rates were around 90%, and several raids were met with 100% success rates. Lacking their own direction system, Luftwaffe fighters had little information on the location of their RAF counterparts, and often returned to base having never seen them. When they did, the RAF fighters were almost always in an advantageous position.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebellion}} was {{crippled by}} <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> timid leadership. Kublai sent Bayan to keep Nayan and Kaidu apart by occupying Karakorum, while Kublai led another army against the rebels in Manchuria. Kublai's commander Oz Temür's Mongol force attacked Nayan's 60,000 inexperienced soldiers on June 14, while Chinese and Alan guards under Li Ting protected Kublai. The army of Chungnyeol of Goryeo assisted Kublai in battle. After a hard fight, Nayan's troops withdrew behind their carts, and Li Ting began bombardment and attacked Nayan's camp that night. Kublai's force pursued Nayan, who was eventually captured and executed without bloodshed, by being smothered under felt carpets, a {{traditional way of}} executing princes. Meanwhile, the rebel prince Shikqtur invaded the Chinese district of Liaoning but was defeated within a month. Kaidu withdrew westward to avoid a battle. However, Kaidu defeated a major Yuan army in the Khangai Mountains and briefly occupied Karakorum in 1289. Kaidu had ridden away before Kublai could mobilize a larger army.|$|E
25|$|Because {{ultrasound}} imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer {{and are therefore more}} common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any internal organ damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.|$|E
