2500|$|The Boondock Saints saw a {{very limited}} {{theatrical}} release, with its distributor showing the film in 2000 on only five screens in the United States for a duration of a week. However, the original unrated version of the film was later re-released in theaters on May 22, 2006. Duffy later funded screenings of the film with help from Blockbuster Video. [...] "Blockbuster saved us [...] They agreed {{to take it on}} exclusively, and from there the rest is history." [...] According to Troy Duffy on his audio commentary of the film on DVD, the film's distributor allowed the limited screening in the United States because of the then-recent Columbine High School massacre. The film was shown on major foreign screens (most notably in Japan) with success. Blockbuster released The Boondock Saints as a [...] "Blockbuster Exclusive", a collection of independent direct-to-video films. The Boondock Saints gained a following mostly thanks to word of mouth publicity and was a bestseller when released on DVD.

40|$|Bell morphology, {{propulsion}} and foraging {{appear to}} be interdependent traits among medusan lineages. In general, taxa that possess large oblate bells swim via rowing propulsion and forage as cruising predators, and taxa with small prolate bells swim via jet propulsion and forage as ambush predators. However, hydromedusae from the taxa Leptothecata (referred to here as leptomedusae) experience large changes in bell size and shape during their development. We used video analysis to evaluate changes in bell morphology and kinematics, fluid interactions and behavior of 2 leptomedusan species, Aequorea victoria and Eutonina <b>indicans,</b> during these developmental transitions. Both species begin as small, prolate, jetting juveniles (diameter) and develop into large, oblate, rowing adults (3 ̆e 0. 5 cm diameter). In addition to morphological and propulsive alterations, we observed changes in behavior, whereby as jetters they rarely swam and as rowers they swam nearly continuously. These findings demonstrate that bell fineness, velar aperture ratio and bell kinematics interact to determine fluid interactions and thus determine propulsive mode...|$|R

Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityInterstitial cystitis/painful bladder {{disorder}} is an uncomfortable disease {{for which there}} is no known cause and no consistently effective treatment. Many research studies purport subjective symptom relief with dietary restriction of certain food metabolites (Gillespie, 1993; Koziol, 1994; Theoharides, 1994). Gillespie (1993) demonstrated improvement of serum histamine and ammonia levels, as well as urine <b>indicans,</b> xanthurenic and kynurenic acid levels with restriction of arylalkylamines and acidic foods. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study with a counter balance design was to determine the effect of withholding acidic or arylalkylamine food metabolites on the symptoms of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder disorder. The study also evaluated symptom relief when arylalkylamines plus acidic foods and fluids were withheld. There was no statistical significance in the response to the dietary restrictions. The clinical significance was a reduction in the daily symptom level that was also statistically significant and reduced voidings per day...|$|R

40|$|The morphology, {{swimming}} kinematics and prey {{selection of}} hydromedusae {{have been shown}} to be closely related to hydromedusan foraging mode. In order to confirm this link, we examined the in situ foraging behavior of hydromedusae by video-recording and quantifying the in situ swimming activity and tentacle-extension behavior of 8 co-occurring hydromedusae from the waters surrounding Friday Harbor, Washington. The cruising-predatory medusa Aequorea victoria, Mitrocoma cellularia, Phialidium gregarium, and Eutonina <b>indicans</b> spent a greater proportion of their time swimming (on average from 74. 1 to 92. 1 %) than the ambush-predatory medusae Aglantha digitale, Sarsia sp., Leuckartiara sp., and Stomotoca atra (on average from 19. 5 to 47. 0 %). In addition, the cruising-predatory medusae were observed with their tentacles extended almost continuously, regardless of whether they were swimming or drifting. In contrast, the ambush-predatory medusae drifted with their tentacles extended but contracted their tentacles when swimming. These patterns indicate that cruising-predatory medusa can feed while either swimming or drifting, whereas the ambush-predatory medusae feed while drifting but not while swimming. Thus, swimming plays a distinctly different role within the behavioral repertoire of each of these medusa foraging modes. Furthermore, the swimming activity and tentacle-extension behavior we observed were consistent with strategies that optimized feeding by each of the predator types...|$|R
40|$|The ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1865 is a successful, recent, macroplanktonic invader in European coastal waters, {{including}} theDutch Wadden Sea.

The effect of M. leidyi on {{structure of the}} gelatinous zooplankton community inthe Dutch Wadden Sea was studied by comparing data from before and after its introduction. Gelatinous zooplankton species composition in thewestern Wadden Sea was largely the same between 1980 – 1983 and 2009 – 2012. Only the hydromedusa Eutonina <b>indicans</b> (Romanes, 1876) wasabsent in recent years while Cosmetira pilosella Forbes, 1848 and Margelopsis haeckelii Hartlaub, 1897 were rare species observed only in 2009 – 2012. M. leidyi was present since 2006, with high densities every year in summer and autumn. Predation pressure by scyphomedusae,ctenophores, and hydromedusae on fish larvae and zooplankton in 1980 – 1983 was low because of low densities and a temporal mismatch betweengelatinous zooplankton and their prey. Despite the decrease in abundance of scyphomedusae in recent decades, the introduction of M. leidyi and itslarge annual blooms have increased the overall importance of gelatinous zooplankton as predators in the western Wadden Sea, whereby M. leidyi isresponsible {{for most of the}} predation pressure on mesozooplankton in the area. Rather than outcompeting local species, M. leidyi appeared to fill ina previously unoccupied niche in the pelagic western Dutch Wadden Sea in late summer and autumn...|$|R
