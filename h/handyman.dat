50|$|Generally, in the United States, {{there are}} few legal issues if an unpaid homeowner works on a project within their own home, with some exceptions. Some jurisdictions require paid <b>handymen</b> to be {{licensed}} and/or insured.

Often <b>handymen</b> are barred from major plumbing, electrical wiring, or gas-fitting projects for safety reasons, and authorities sometimes require workers to be licensed in particular trades. However, minor plumbing work such as fixing water taps, connecting sinks, fixing leaks, or installing new washing machines, are usually permitted to be done without licensing. Many <b>handymen</b> are insured under a property damage liability policy, so that accidental property damage from negligence or accidents are covered.|$|R
