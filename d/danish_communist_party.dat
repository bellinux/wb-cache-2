He was living with Lindenberg in Germany when Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. On March 2 that year the Nazi newspaper Völkischer Beobachter published an attack on Der Sexuelle Kampf der Jugend. Reich and Lindenberg left for Vienna the next day. They moved from there to Denmark, where Reich was excluded from the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in November 1933 (without ever having joined it) because of his promotion of teenage sex and the publication that year of The Mass Psychology of Fascism, which they regarded as [...] "counterrevolutionary." [...] There were multiple complaints about his promotion of abortion, sex education, and the attempted suicide of a teenage patient.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to present a {{narrative}} about the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> (DKP) newspaper, Arbejderbladet's portrayal of the Finnish-Russian Winter War along with what based on this can be concluded regarding DKP's political convictions in relation to this war. In {{the light of the}} newly signed non-aggression pact between the communist Soviet and fascist Germany, and the radical changes in political and ideological self-understanding this meant for DKP, {{we take a look at}} how DKP defended and represented the actions of the otherwise, in Denmark, highly unpopular Soviet offensive in Finland. The project is based on a systematic analysis of every edition of Arbejderbladet from October 5 th 1939 to Marts 20 th 1940 which seeks, through a narrative form, to offer the reader a focused and thematic review of the mentioned specific issue which has never before been extensively looked into. The analysis centres its' focus around the themes of the war progress, imperialism, the smear campaign against the Soviet Union, and the volunteers for the war. In Arbejderbladet's portrayal of the Finnish-Russian Winter War the most prominent characteristic seems to be that whatever was carried out or suggested by the Soviet Union was correct. This means that a distinct development of the circumstances behind the war is clearly observable as the Soviet Union throughout the period changed its political positions. It is as a result a consistent aspect that Arbejderbladet and DKP maintain an entirely bias political position...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the involvement of}} the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in the Cooperation Committee for Peace and Security (CCPS), a Danish peace organisation, in the years between the establishment of CCPS in 1974 to 1982 when a number of international events revealed communist dominance in CCPS. The main focus {{of this study is to}} investigate how the Communist Party influenced CCPS and to answer the question: What are the reasons behind the Communist involvement in CCPS? Based on new sources and archives, this study illustrates and concludes that the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> played a vital economic, organizational, and political role in CCPS from the very beginning – even though the visibility of the influence varied through the years. Furthermore, the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> realized that, even though they constituted the economic and organizational foundation in CCPS, they were not always able to control the politics of CCPS In February 1974, during the Cold War, the CCPS was established in an attempt to gather the Danish peace movement. As a social movement organisation CCPS mobilized around peace and disarmament in their attempts to influence the Danish Government and the public opinion. Therefore, the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> saw CCPS as a perfect mouthpiece for communist ideas and politics. Next to being one of the most important peace organisations in Denmark, especially regarding their campaigns against the neutron bomb in 1977, and the NATO double resolution in 1979, CCPS were also one of the most controversial cooperations. Journalists, politicians and the Danish Police Intelligence Service characterized CCPS as a soviet-controlled organisation – and this characterisation has been used ever since in the Cold War Research. Nevertheless, existing research is deficient in relation to documentation. Therefore, this thesis contains basic research, which constitutes a significant contribution to the understanding of how and why the <b>Danish</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> engaged in CCPS...|$|E
