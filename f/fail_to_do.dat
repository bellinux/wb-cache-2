25|$|Good Samaritan laws offer legal {{protection}} {{to people who}} give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, {{for fear of being}} sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance, and holds those who <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so liable.|$|E

500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history".|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I {{had to look at}} it {{from the point of view}} of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E
500|$|On 12 November 1936, {{significant}} changes {{were put in}} place to the functioning of the committee, with the ratification of plans to post observers to Spanish frontiers and ports to prevent breaches of the agreement. This had been delayed by Italian and German demands that air transport be included, which was perhaps a delaying tactic given the impossibility to doing so effectively. Russian military aid now being transported to Spain did not go unnoticed. France and Britain became split on whether to recognise Franco's forces as a belligerent as the British wanted, or to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as the French wanted. On 18 November, this was subsumed by the news that the Italian and German governments had recognised the Nationalists as the true government of Spain. [...] A British bill preventing exports of arms to Spain by British ships from anywhere was signed. Yvon Delbos requested mediation; at the same time, the Republic appealed to the Council of the League of Nations for assistance. Franklin Roosevelt, also approached, ruled out US interference with the words ' no expectation that the United States would ever again send troops or warships or floods of munitions and money to Europe'. On 4 December, France and Britain approached Italy, Germany, Russia and Portugal to request mediation. An armistice would be called, a commission sent to Spain, and, after a plebiscite, a government featuring those uninvolved in the war (such as Salvador de Madariaga) would be established. The considerable number of German soldiers in Spain – at least 5,000 – was now clear, but Italy and Germany were opposed to isolated discussion of the matter.|$|E
