5|$|In 1907, the women's {{auxiliary}} was founded; until then, though seating was mixed, {{women had}} little {{say in the}} running of the synagogue. That year the congregation had 110 member families and annual revenues of $9,259.55 (today $). The congregational school, which held classes one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> had 15 teachers and 200 students.|$|E
5|$|Richard Fetherston had {{established}} a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care. His experience soon showed that his workload would be greatly reduced if ante natal care were provided, with mothers being monitored throughout their pregnancies. He asked Mary if she {{would be willing to}} establish such a clinic, which would be open one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final <b>day,</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> hence.|$|E

50|$|Operating days also {{vary greatly}} {{depending}} on the route. Most of the long distance inter-regional routes run 6 or 7 <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Shorter regional routes mostly run 1, 2, or 3 <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> However, some run 6 or 7 <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|R
5|$|In May 1976, the company's {{long-established}} route between Guildford and Peaslake {{was extended}} to Cranleigh via Ewhurst, and a once-daily schoolday service to and from The Haven, the first bus route to serve the community, was introduced. A number of service changes saw Tillingbourne vehicles operating to Croydon and Chichester one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> each by 1977, although both were withdrawn after three years. The service to Colgate was withdrawn and replaced by a local half-hourly route in Horsham in 1979. In September 1980, the company moved depots again to a larger site in Cranleigh.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was {{admitted}} to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following <b>day.</b> <b>A</b> <b>week</b> later, she signed the new Commonwealth charter. Because of her age {{and the need for}} her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial meeting of Commonwealth heads of government {{for the first time in}} 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by her son, Prince Charles.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E

50|$|The regular {{passenger}} service Limerick - Claremorris through Ennis shut on 5 April 1976. Limerick - Ennis recommenced on Thursdays from 4 August 1984, two <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> from 12 April 1988, four <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> from 19 February 1993 and six <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> from 16 May 1994.|$|R
5000|$|... (1990-1994) Operation three <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in both {{directions}} between Halifax and Montreal following Via budget cuts. The Atlantic also operated three <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and equipment rotated on the two trains. Service between Moncton and Halifax and between Saint-Hyacinthe and Montreal, the only common portions of the two routes, was six <b>days</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|R
5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occursâ€”within a <b>day,</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
5|$|The Timberlake {{party had}} {{decided to make the}} return trip overland, having {{purchased}} horses from the Cherokee. Ostenaco, accompanied by several hundred Cherokee warriors, guided the Timberlake group northward across what is now known as the Great Indian Warpath, which follows the western base of the Appalachian Mountains. On March 11, the party arrived at the abandoned village of Elajoy along Little River in what is now Maryville, Tennessee, and crossed the French Broad River the following <b>day.</b> <b>A</b> <b>week</b> later, they reached Fort Robinson, which the Stephen garrison had abandoned but stashed a large supply of flour. The expedition left Long Island on March 22, continuing northward to an army camp where Timberlake had left some belongings. He was deeply disappointed to find the trunk had been looted and most of his goods had been stolen. The party finally reached Williamsburg, Virginia in early April.|$|E
5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E

His students included Fiona French.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, under Kornfeld's leadership, the congregational school held classes one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and had six {{teachers}} and ten students.

He filled that role until 1924, when he became rabbi of the Collingwood Avenue Temple in Toledo, Ohio, where he served until 1934.|$|E
25|$|Revis {{missed the}} {{majority}} of training camp and {{all four of the}} team's preseason contests while holding out for a new contract. He was to receive approximately $1 million in the fourth year of a six-year contract.

25|$|In March 2010, {{a number}} of the routes around Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City, that only ran {{a couple of times a}} day or on one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> were lost to Sullivan Buses. The evening 620 service {{contract}} was also lost to Arriva Shires & Essex. The 694 service, introduced in September 2009 as a park and ride service between College Lane and Stanborough Lakes in WGC, was axed completely.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} {{considered by}} the commission, and promoted by Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, was to restrict access into the congestion zone one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> based on the last digits of the license plates. This sort of road space rationing system is currently practiced {{in two of the}} world's Top 10 megacities, SÃ£o Paulo and Mexico City. Bloomberg's plan was endorsed by the then new Governor David Paterson, whose support was considered key to approving the bill in Albany.|$|E
25|$|LCBL field {{managers}} {{are among the}} youngest in any summer college baseball league. This gives an unrivaled level of comfort to the players, being coached {{by a man who}} is closer to their age than their college head coach. However, youth or inexperience is not a viable excuse for not commanding the dugout. The interview process is thorough and each must take their leadership duties very seriously. Upon being hired, managers select their assistant coach and set aside at least one <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for practice time.|$|E
