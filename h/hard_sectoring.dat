5000|$|... 8- and -inch floppy disks were {{available}} with both soft sectoring and <b>hard</b> <b>sectoring.</b> Because of the similarity in magnetic characteristics between some disk types, {{it was possible}} to use an incorrectly certified disk in a soft sectored drive. Quad density -inch disks were rare, so it was not uncommon to use higher quality double density disks, which were usually capable of sustaining the 96 TPI formatting of quad density, in drives such as the Commodore 8050.|$|E
50|$|In older 8- and 5-inch floppy disks, <b>hard</b> <b>sectoring</b> was {{implemented}} by punching sector {{holes in the}} disk to mark the startof each sector. These were equally spaced holes, at a common radius. This was {{in addition to the}} index hole, situated between two sector holes, to mark the start of the entire track of sectors. When the index or sector hole was recognized by an optical sensor, a sector signal was generated. Timing electronics or software would use the faster timing of the index hole between sector holes, to generate an index signal. Data read and write is faster in this technique than soft sectoring as no operations are to be performed regarding the starting and ending points of tracks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:We {{develop a}} semi-holographic {{model for the}} out-of-equilibrium {{dynamics}} dur-ing the partonic stages of an ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision. The model combines a weakly-coupled <b>hard</b> <b>sector,</b> involving gluon modes with energy and momenta {{of the order of}} the saturation momentum and relatively large occupation numbers, with a strongly-coupled soft sector, which physically represents the soft gluons radiated by the hard partons. The <b>hard</b> <b>sector</b> is described by perturbative QCD, more precisely, by its semi-classical approx-imation (the classical Yang-Mills equations) which becomes appropriate when the occupa-tion numbers are large. The soft sector is described by a marginally deformed conformal field theory, which in turn admits a holographic description in terms of classical Einstein’s equations in AdS 5 with a minimally coupled massless ‘dilaton’. The model involve two free parameters which characterize the gauge-invariant couplings between the <b>hard</b> and soft <b>sectors.</b> Via these couplings, the hard modes provide dynamical sources for the gravita-tional equations at the boundary of AdS 5 and feel the feedback of the latter as additional soft sources in the classical Yang-Mills equations. Importantly, the initial conditions for this coupled dynamics are fully determined by the <b>hard</b> <b>sector</b> alone, i. e. by perturbative QCD, and are conveniently given by the color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. We also develop a new semi-holographic picture of jets in the QGP by attaching a non-Abelian charge to the endpoint of the trailing string in AdS 5 representing a heavy quark. This leads to modified Nambu-Goto equations for the string which govern the (collisional and radiative) energy loss by the heavy quark towards both hard and soft modes...|$|R

2500|$|Another LED/photo-transistor pair {{located near}} the center of the disk detects the index hole once per {{rotation}} in the magnetic disk; it is used to detect the angular start of each track [...] and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed. Early 8‑inch and 5¼‑inch disks had physical holes for each sector and were termed <b>hard</b> <b>sectored</b> disks. Later soft-sectored disks have only one index hole, and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low-level software from patterns marking the start of a sector. Generally, the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks, with only the disks and controllers differing. Some operating systems utilizing soft sectors, such as Apple DOS, do not use the index hole; the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor; this was mainly a hardware cost-saving measure.|$|R
40|$|We utilize a 3 D hybrid hydro+micro {{model for}} a {{comprehensive}} and consistent description of soft and hard particle production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. In the soft sector {{we focus on the}} dynamics of (multi-) strange baryons, where a clear strangeness dependence of their collision rates and freeze-out is observed. In the <b>hard</b> <b>sector</b> we study the radiative energy loss of hard partons in a soft medium in the multiple soft scattering approximation. While the nuclear suppression factor $R_{AA}$ does not reflect the high quality of the medium description (except in a reduced systematic uncertainty in extracting the quenching power of the medium), the hydrodynamical model also allows to study different centralities and in particular the angular variation of $R_{AA}$ with respect to the reaction plane, allowing for a controlled variation of the in-medium path-length.

25|$|JRT Pascal, for example, {{provided}} versions on -inch disk for North Star, Osborne, Apple, Heath <b>hard</b> <b>sector</b> {{and soft}} sector, and Superbrain, {{and a single}} 8-inch version. Certain disk formats were more popular than others. The Xerox 820's became widely supported, for example; much software was available on it, and other computers such as the Kaypro II were compatible with the format. No single manufacturer, however, prevailed in the -inch era of CP/M use, and disk formats were not portable between hardware manufacturers. A software manufacturer had to prepare a separate version of the program for each brand of hardware on which it was to run. With some manufacturers (Kaypro is an example), there was not even standardization across the company's different models. Because of this situation, disk format translation programs, which allowed a machine to read many different formats, became popular and reduced the confusion, as did programs like Kermit which allowed transfer of data and programs from one machine to another using the serial ports that most CP/M machines had.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the prospects for}} the development of the Polish <b>hard</b> coal <b>sector</b> from the perspective of the power sector. The most important issues determining the mid- and long-term future for domestic coal production are: (1) the development of the economy, hence the demand for electricity, (2) regulations (mostly environmental) affecting the power sector, (3) the competitiveness of coal-based technologies, and (4) the costs of domestic coal production. Since the range of issues and relations being considered is very broad, a specific method needs to be employed for the quantitative analysis. The tool applied in this study is the partial equilibrium model POWER-POL, in which both the coal and the power sectors are incorporated. The model focuses on energy-economy-environmental issues without capturing detailed macroeconomic links. The model was run under six scenario assumptions. The results show that the domestic coal sector should maintain its position as a key supplier of primary energy for the Polish power sector. However, the environmental regulations to which the domestic power sector has to conform will decrease the share of coal in the fuel-mix. Since the investment processes in this sector are usually long-term, the effects of changes will be noticeable from 2015 onwards. Partial equilibrium model <b>Hard</b> coal Power <b>sector...</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{possible}} {{approach for}} boot loaders to load kernel images is by directly accessing <b>hard</b> disk <b>sectors</b> without understanding the underlying file system.

Such maps need to be updated each time a kernel image changes its physical location on disk, due to installing new kernel images, file system defragmentation etc. Also, in case of the maps changing their physical location, their locations need to be updated within the boot loader's MBR code, so the sectors indirection mechanism continues to work.
