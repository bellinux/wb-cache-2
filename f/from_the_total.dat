Although officially, subtropical cyclones are excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>total,</b> the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.|$|E

5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013.

Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character.
