5|$|A <b>fibrinogen</b> uptake {{test was}} {{formerly}} {{used to detect}} deep vein thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} pathway of endocytic processing {{had also}} been demonstrated wherein certain proteins like <b>fibrinogen</b> and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC-II molecules after they are denatured and their disulfide bonds are reduced (breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms across it). The proteases then degrade the exposed regions of the protein-MHC II-complex.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, <b>fibrinogen</b> tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, <b>fibrinogen,</b> factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from <b>fibrinogen,</b> and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
25|$|Thrombasthenia of Glanzmann and Naegeli (Glanzmann thrombasthenia) is {{extremely}} rare. It {{is characterized by}} a defect in GPIIb/IIIa <b>fibrinogen</b> receptor complex. When GPIIb/IIIa receptor is dysfunctional, <b>fibrinogen</b> cannot cross-link platelets, which inhibits primary hemostasis. This is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>fibrinogen</b> is a {{rod-like}} protein with nodules {{on either}} end capable of binding GPIIb/IIIa, activated platelets with exposed GPIIb/IIIa can bind <b>fibrinogen</b> to aggregate. GPIIb/IIIa may also further anchor the platelets to subendothelial vWF for additional clot structural stabilisation.|$|E
25|$|Deficiencies of <b>fibrinogen</b> (quantitative or qualitative) {{will affect}} all {{screening}} tests.|$|E
25|$|Lipoprotein(a) {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with Calnexin, Fibronectin and <b>Fibrinogen</b> beta chain.|$|E
25|$|This test mildly {{activates}} {{the contact}} phase of haemostasis. The result {{is influenced by}} coagulation factors, platelets, <b>fibrinogen</b> and heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is detected at higher concentrations. In the absence of heparin, INTEM is a screening test for the haemostasis system. It is used for therapeutic decisions regarding the administration of fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, <b>fibrinogen</b> or platelets.|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts <b>fibrinogen</b> to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down <b>fibrinogen</b> and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of <b>fibrinogen</b> and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|Common: aPTT, PT (also used to {{determine}} INR), <b>fibrinogen</b> testing (often by the Clauss method), platelet count, platelet function testing (often by PFA-100), thrombodynamics test.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid iodine uptake {{blockade}} with {{potassium iodide}} {{is used in}} nuclear medicine scintigraphy and therapy with some radioiodinated compounds that are not targeted to the thyroid, such as iobenguane (MIBG), {{which is used to}} image or treat neural tissue tumors, or iodinated <b>fibrinogen,</b> which is used in <b>fibrinogen</b> scans to investigate clotting. These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. However, since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thyroid for iodide.|$|E
25|$|Organelle zone – {{is rich in}} {{platelet}} granules. Alpha granules contain clotting mediators such as factor V, factor VIII, <b>fibrinogen,</b> fibronectin, platelet-derived growth factor, and chemotactic agents. Delta granules, or dense bodies, contain ADP, calcium, serotonin, {{which are}} platelet-activating mediators.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme reptilase (batroxobin), {{derived from}} this snake's venom, {{is used in}} modern medical {{laboratories}} to measure <b>fibrinogen</b> levels and blood coagulation capability. The test {{is considered to be}} a replacement for thrombin time, and is used when heparin is present in the sample. The enzyme is unaffected by heparin.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory that}} {{thrombin}} {{is generated by}} the presence of tissue factor was consolidated by Paul Morawitz in 1905. At this stage, it was known that thrombokinase/thromboplastin (factor III) is released by damaged tissues, reacting with prothrombin (II), which, together with calcium (IV), forms thrombin, which converts <b>fibrinogen</b> into fibrin (I).|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 34 studies found a reduced risk of mortality from {{coronary heart disease}} in men who drank 2 - 4 drinks per day and women who drank 1 - 2 drinks per day. Alcohol {{has been found to}} have anticoagulant properties. Thrombosis is lower among moderate drinkers than abstainers.Ridker, P., et al. Moderate alcohol intake may reduce risk of thrombosis. American Medical Association press release, September 22, 1994 A {{meta-analysis of}} randomized trials found that alcohol consumption in moderation decreases serum levels of <b>fibrinogen,</b> a protein that promotes clot formation, while it increases levels of tissue type plasminogen activator, an enzyme that helps dissolve clots. These changes were estimated to reduce coronary heart disease risk by about 24%. Another meta-analysis in 2011 found favorable changes in HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, and <b>fibrinogen</b> associated with moderate alcohol consumption.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide has {{roles in}} both blood {{coagulation}} and anticoagulation. Sulfatide has anticoagulation activity when it binds to <b>fibrinogen,</b> which prevents <b>fibrinogen</b> from converting to fibrin. Sulfatide {{also has a}} direct inhibitory effect on thrombosis. On the other hand, sulfatide also helps to improve blood coagulation and thrombosis: first, sulfatide is believed to aid in thrombosis through its participation with coagulation factor XII; second, sulfatide binding to annexin V accelerates coagulation; third, sulfatide and P-selectin interactions expressed on platelets, help to ensure stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, most of these conclusions have been drawn using exogenous forms of sulfatide. Consequently, additional research and experimentation on endogenous sulfatide is necessary to fully understand the role of sulfatide in coagulation and thrombosis. Sulfatide is also present in serum lipoproteins, which {{are believed to be}} associated with the cause and development of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of DIC is {{centered}} around treating the underlying condition. Transfusions of platelets or {{fresh frozen plasma}} can be considered in cases of significant bleeding, or those with a planned invasive procedure. The target goal of such transfusion depends on the clinical situation. Cryoprecipitate can be considered in those with a low <b>fibrinogen</b> level.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{thrombolytic}} agent being used, additional anticoagulation with heparin or {{low molecular}} weight heparin may be of benefit. With tPa and related agents (reteplase and tenecteplase), heparin is {{needed to keep the}} coronary artery open. Because of the anticoagulant effect of <b>fibrinogen</b> depletion with streptokinase and urokinase treatment, it is less necessary there.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fibrinogen</b> {{level has}} {{initially}} {{thought to be}} useful in the diagnosis of DIC {{but because it is}} an acute phase reactant, it will be elevated due to the underlying inflammatory condition. Therefore, a normal (or even elevated) level can occur in over 57% of cases. A low level, however, is more consistent with the consumptive process of DIC.|$|E
25|$|Donated {{blood is}} usually {{subjected}} to processing {{after it is}} collected, to make it suitable for use in specific patient populations. Collected blood is then separated into blood components by centrifugation: red blood cells, plasma, platelets, albumin protein, clotting factor concentrates, cryoprecipitate, <b>fibrinogen</b> concentrate, and immunoglobulins (antibodies). Red cells, plasma and platelets can also be donated individually via a more complex process called apheresis.|$|E
25|$|There is debate {{regarding}} whether obesity or {{insulin resistance}} {{is the cause}} of the metabolic syndrome or if they are consequences of a more far-reaching metabolic derangement. A number of markers of systemic inflammation, including C-reactive protein, are often increased, as are <b>fibrinogen,</b> interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α), and others. Some have pointed to a variety of causes, including increased uric acid levels caused by dietary fructose.|$|E
25|$|However, Norris (2004) warned {{this species}} has a {{relatively}} large venom yield containing high levels of proteolytic enzymes, especially in the adults. A publication he mentions by Rael et al. (1986) showed it contains at least three proteolytic hemorrhagins that degrade <b>fibrinogen</b> and cause myonecrosis, but no Mojave toxin. On the other hand, three specimens from Mexico studied by Glen et al. (1983) did have Mojave toxin and lacked hemorrhagic activity.|$|E
25|$|This {{acute phase}} {{response}} occurs {{as a result}} of a rise in the concentration of IL-6, which is produced by macrophages as well as adipocytes in response to a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions such as bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases; malignancy; and tissue injury and necrosis. These conditions cause release of interleukin-6 and other cytokines that trigger the synthesis of CRP and <b>fibrinogen</b> by the liver.|$|E
25|$|Excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{results from}} the excess activation of the coagulation cascade. The excess thrombin cleaves <b>fibrinogen,</b> which ultimately leaves behind multiple fibrin clots in the circulation. These excess clots trap platelets to become larger clots, which leads to microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. This lodging of clots in the microcirculation, in the large vessels, and in the organs is what leads to the ischemia, impaired organ perfusion, and end-organ damage that occurs with DIC.|$|E
25|$|MCF is the {{greatest}} vertical amplitude of the trace. It reflects the absolute strength of the fibrin and platelet clot. A low MCF is indicative of decreased platelet number or function, decreased <b>fibrinogen</b> level or fibrin polymerization disorders, or low activity of factor XIII. A mechanically weak clot represents a severe bleeding risk and should initiate immediate therapeutic steps. High doses of heparin can lower MCF in the INTEM assay, but not in HEPTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM or APTEM (see under “reagents”).|$|E
25|$|If a {{coagulation}} factor {{is part of}} the contact activation or tissue factor pathway, a deficiency of that factor will affect only one of the tests: Thus hemophilia A, a deficiency of factor VIII, which {{is part of the}} contact activation pathway, results in an abnormally prolonged aPTT test but a normal PT test. The exceptions are prothrombin, <b>fibrinogen,</b> and some variants of FX that can be detected only by either aPTT or PT. If an abnormal PT or aPTT is present, additional testing will occur to determine which (if any) factor is present as aberrant concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as <b>fibrinogen,</b> which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E
25|$|One {{possibility}} is that negative feedback mechanisms, which normally maintain tolerance of the self are overtaken by positive feedback mechanisms for certain antigens, such as IgG Fc bound by Rheumatoid Factor and citrullinated <b>fibrinogen</b> bound by antibodies to citrullinated peptides (ACPA). A debate on the relative roles of B-cell produced immune complexes and T cell products in inflammation in RA has continued for 30 years, but neither cell is necessary {{at the site of}} inflammation, only autoantibodies to IgGFc, known as rheumatoid factors (RF), and (ACPA). As with other autoimmune diseases, people with RA have abnormally glycosylated antibodies, which are believed to promote joint inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and <b>fibrinogen,</b> potentiating the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of coagulation in two pathways is mainly artificial, it originates from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured after the clotting was initiated by glass (intrinsic pathway) or by thromboplastin (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids). In fact thrombin is present {{from the very}} beginning, already when platelets are making the plug. Thrombin has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of <b>fibrinogen</b> to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens affect liver protein {{synthesis}} and thereby influence the cardiovascular system. They {{have been found}} to affect the production of a variety of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, including increased factor IX, von Willebrand factor, thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT), fragment 1+2, and D-dimer and decreased <b>fibrinogen,</b> factor VII, antithrombin, protein S, protein C, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Although this is true for oral estrogen, transdermal estradiol has been found only to reduce PAI-1 and protein S, {{and to a lesser extent}} than oral estrogen. Due to its effects on liver {{protein synthesis}}, oral estrogen is procoagulant, and has been found to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Conversely, modern oral contraceptives are not associated with an increase in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in healthy, non-smoking premenopausal women of any age, except in those with hypertension (high blood pressure). However, a small but significant increase in the risk of stroke, though not of myocardial infarction, has been found in menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. An increase in the risk of stroke has also been associated with older high-dose oral contraceptives that are no longer used.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{conditions}} {{that have been}} linked with venous thrombosis are possibly genetic and possibly acquired. These include: elevated levels of factor VIII, factor IX, factor XI, <b>fibrinogen</b> and ...|$|E
500|$|The rare {{forms of}} {{congenital}} thrombophilia are typically {{caused by a}} deficiency of natural anticoagulants. They are classified as [...] "type I" [...] and are more severe in their propensity to cause thrombosis. The main ones are antithrombin III deficiency, protein C deficiency and protein S deficiency. Milder rare congenital thrombophilias are factor XIII mutation and familial dysfibrinogenemia (an abnormal <b>fibrinogen).</b> It is unclear whether congenital disorders of fibrinolysis (the system that destroys clots) are major contributors to thrombosis risk. Congenital deficiency of plasminogen, for instance, mainly causes eye symptoms and sometimes problems in other organs, but the link with thrombosis has been more uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantitative}} and qualitative screening of <b>fibrinogen</b> {{is measured by the}} thrombin clotting time (TCT). Measurement of the exact amount of <b>fibrinogen</b> present in the blood is generally done using the Clauss method for <b>fibrinogen</b> testing. [...] Many analysers are capable of measuring a [...] "derived fibrinogen" [...] level from the graph of the Prothrombin time clot.|$|E
