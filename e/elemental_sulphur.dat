Isotopic (δ¹³C and δ ³⁴S) analysis was also performed on the bulk organic matter in the sediments.

Interpretations from proxy data extracted from the cores suggest that relatively higher TOC contents in core MAR 00 - 6 compared to the other Black Sea cores can be explained by better preservation of organic matter. This is attributed to the existence of a more stable stratified water-column well below wave base and/or greater salinity contrast between surface and bottom waters at this site before 5000 yr BP.

40|$|Combustion {{processes}} in {{coal-fired power plants}} and municipal waste combustors, are major sources of mercury emissions. Conventional pollution abatement technologies have been proven inefficient for controlling gas-phase mercury emissions, and especially the elemental form of mercury (Hg°), due to its insolubility in water, chemical inertia and high volatility. One promising option is the mercury retention by adsorption with solid materials such as activated carbon, calcium-based sorbents, fly ash and zeolites. Among them, activated carbon, which pos-sesses extended surface area and high surface reactivity, seem to be suitable for Hg° adsorption, used in a fixed bed operation or in an injection process. The {{purpose of the current}} PhD thesis is to evaluate the performance of activated carbons with different physico-chemical characteristics, for gas-phase mercury adsorption under various conditions. This research was realized in order to elucidate some unclear estimations in the lit-erature. So, the correlation between activated carbon pore structure and its organic material properties with mercury adsorption, was investigated. The effect of inorganic material on the activation process and the physicochemical properties of the produced activated carbons, as well as the probability of elemental mercury retention in inorganic matter, was also examined. Additionally to activated carbon pore structure impact on mercury removal ability, the oxygen functional groups that constitute active sites for mercury chemisorption and favors the adsorp-tion procedure, have been determined. Their action was also observed at high temperatures, where physical adsorption participation is limited. Similarly, the reaction between <b>elemental</b> mercury and <b>sulphur</b> atoms added on carbon surface was responsible for the enhanced mercury adsorption capacity of the sulphur impregnated activated carbons. Against the results obtained in several studies, in this research the modification of activated carbon surface after sulphur ad-dition didn’t change its pore structure characteristics. The above results have been derived under inert gas conditions (Ν 2 and Hg°), without the interference or the competitive adsorption of other flue gases. The chemisorption of elemental mercury was also investigated in the presence of some flue gases and it was found that mercury adsorption not only was affected by activated carbon characteristics, but also by the oxidant properties of the flue gases. Two commercial activated carbons of different origin have been used (F 400 from bitumi-nous coal and RWE from German lignite) in order to examine the chemical affinity between activated carbon surface and elemental mercury. Moreover, activated carbons produced from Ptolemais Greek lignite, which has been mainly used in energy production field and disposes a high content of mineral matter, were tested. Activated carbons prepared from raw Ptolemais lignite (PSK-R) and demineralized lignite (PSK-D) with physical activation method at 800 and 900 °C, have been tested for their gas-phase elemental mercury adsorptive capacity. With these tests, the effect of inorganic matter on the physicochemical properties of the produced activated carbons and on elemental mercury adsorption was explored. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce {{environmentally}} safe flame-proofing compositions to give a wash-durable finish on textile and other substrates. Thus this work describes the preparation and application of new urea condensates formed from the reaction of urea {{with a variety of}} chemicals including phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid and sulphamic acid; the condensates gave different degrees of flame retardancy (FR) on a variety of substrates. Studies of urea thermal decomposition showed the production of isocyanic acid and ammonia, above "the urea melting point (l 3 S•C). Using an open reaction vessel, urea, sulphamic acid and phosphorous acid gave an exothermic reaction over the temperature range 120 - 140 'C with gas liberation. The condensates thus formed contained aliphatic polyamide chains, containing urea groups and sulphur and phosphorus residues. According to the type and amount of initial materials, various urea condensates, capable of imparting different degrees of flame retardancy, were synthesized. The sulphamic acid/urea (SIU), phosphoric acid /urea (P AIU), sulphamic acid/phosphoric acid/urea (SJPAIU) and also sulphamic acid/phosphorous acid/urea (S/PH/U) condensates were produced. When these urea condensates were cooled down, Water-soluble products were produced, and these materials could be applied to the textile substrate using a pad-bake technique. Cotton fabrics were treated with these condensates: typically a pad-liquor contained 500 g/l of urea condensate, 10 g/I of wetting agent; fabric was padded to 80 % wet pick-up, dried (80 'C) and cured for two minutes (l 65 'C). These urea condensates, when cured on cotton at high temperature (16 S'C), change to water-insoluble products; as a result of reactions between cellulose hydroxyl group and the urea condensate a complicated polymer structure network can be produced on the surface of a fabric and a flame retardant effect imparted. The SIU condensate only produced partial FR properties, {{while the rest of the}} compounds produced completely flame retardant fabrics. FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis was carried out on the urea condensates and also on the flame retardant fabrics. DSC thermal analysis was performed on the initial materials, urea condensates and also the treated fabrics. The characterization of urea condensate treated fabrics were studied further using SEM and energy dispersion X-ray micro analysis. In the case of the urea condensates a small amount of sulphamic acid has a significant influence on the reaction between phosphating agents and urea; in fact the presence of SA reduces the exothennic reaction. However, at high concentrations of urea, the exothermic reaction occurred at a higher temperature and a hard crystalline product was produced, thus application required dissolution in warm water (50 •C). A urea condensate of 1 mole sulphamic acid, 1 mole phosphorus acid and up to 18 moles of urea could produce a durable flame retardant finish on cotton fabric. A higher amount of phosphorous acid in the urea ~ondensate products (IS/ 2 PH/IOU) reduced the exotherm temperature and a high quality flame retardant effect was produced on cotton fabric. The evenness of phosphorus and <b>sulphur</b> <b>elemental</b> distribution on the surface and cross section of treated fibre was confirmed using SEM. Desirable flame retardancy effects from the urea condensate treated fabrics were obtained with comparatively low levels of sulphur and phosphorus (in comparison with the current commercially available Proban and Pyrovatex treated fabrics). However, in the washing process of the condensate-treated fabr ics, no significant reduction in P or S concentration/level was found. The excellent flame retardancy of the new system can be explained due to the N/P/S containing polymer formed on the surface of the fabric. DSC results from the treated fabrics confirmed these observations. Fabrics treated with Pro ban and Pyrovatex showed a very sharp exotherm after 300 'C, but for fabrics treated with the urea condensates only a small exotherm effect appeared. In FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis, the production of aliphatic polymer chains of different length was verified, however, for the insoluble product formed in situ by heating at 160 'C, and also for the condensates formed on the fabric at high temperature, a complicated polymer structure was shown to contain a possible combination of cyanuric acid, cyclic urea, triazine and melamine. All these materials have been identified in the FT-IR spectra of a water- insoluble urea product formed at 160 •C. To make a model reaction with other hydroxyl group-containing substrates, starch and polyvinyl alcohol were treated with the ISI 2 PH/IOU condensate. The flame retardancy effect on both these treated substrates was confirmed by DSC thermal analysis. Advantages of this new wash-durable FR system over the currently available Proban/Pyrovatex systems include: no formaldehyde, low cost, ready availability of materials, simplicity of the treatment (no specific equipment required), and maintenance of all the desirable physical properties of the fabric, such as soft handle, acceptable tensile strength, no effect on dyed grounds and also no yellowing of the fabric.

Although yeasts capable of oxidizing sulphur could not be isolated {{from a wide range}} of soils, a yeast-like fungus (Monilia sp.) isolated from deciduous woodland soil oxidized <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> to sulphate, forming thiosulphate, but not tetra-thionate. This fungus also oxidized tetrathionate to sulphate but showed only limited ability to oxidize thiosulphate to tetrathionate. Both Asper-gillus niger and Trichoderma harzianum oxidized <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> in mixed culture with Mucor flaous. Larger amounts of sulphate were initially formed in mixed, compared to single culture; bu...|$|E

In the presence of excess of sulphur trioxide, however, the <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> released combines with it to form sulphur sesquioxide which subsequently decomposes and gives off sulphur dioxide.

40|$|An agro-waste origin cardanol benzoxazine monomer (Ca) {{has shown}} {{potential}} as a suitable sustainable linker to chemically bind petroleum industry generated waste, <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> (S) to form random copolymers poly(S-r-Ca). A series of random copolymers with varied weight percent of <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> (20 - 95 %) were synthesised via bulk polymerisation methodology. The Ca monomer offered several reaction sites to facilitate the formation of sulphur rich copolymers as supported by FT-IR, H- 1 NMR, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, DSC and TGA studies. The curing temperature of Ca {{was found to be}} lowered to reaction temperature i. e. 185 degrees C from 242 degrees C using <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> as co-reactant. Preliminary studies of random poly(S-r-Ca) copolymers with a very high sulphur loadings (> 80 % w/w) demonstrated inverse vulcanisation and suggest their utility as an efficient substitute to <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> as a cathode material in Li-S battery.

40|$|A sizable {{amount of}} {{technical}} {{information has been}} accumulated {{on the effects of}} agricultural applications of the natural mineral product called Sul-Fe. This technical information supports the field observations of farmers, landscapers and gardeners who have used the product. Sul-Fe is often evaluated in terms of its sulphur content alone. When compared to <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> (100 % sulphur), the 18 to 21 % sulphur content of Sul-Fe seems relatively low. However, as the following technical data indicates, when judged on actual effects, Sul-Fe's complex mixture of minerals has several advantages over <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur.</b> When judged on the basis of soil acidulation, Sul-Fe has more immediate effects than <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur.</b> The rapid acidifying effect is due to Sul-Fe's content of crystalline sulphuric acid. Sul-Fe also has long-term effects on soil pH due to its content of sulphur and sulfides and the time required to oxidize these materials. <b>Elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> contains sulphur in only one chemical form which must be microbially oxidized before it becomes reactive in the soil solution, a reaction that takes quite some time in some soils. Sul-Fe is thus better than <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> in terms of immediate effects and comparable in terms of long term effects. Applied blends of Sul-Fe supplemented with <b>elemental</b> <b>sulphur</b> may provide for a maximization of both short and long term effects. An additional benefit derived from the use of Sul-Fe is the addition to the soil of a variety of trace nutrients including iron, calcium, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, and molybdenum...|$|E
