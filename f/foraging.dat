5|$|The {{cattle egret}} feeds {{on a wide}} range of prey, {{particularly}} insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed <b>foraging</b> along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret <b>foraging</b> success is much higher when <b>foraging</b> near a large animal than when feeding singly. When <b>foraging</b> with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6times more successful in capturing prey than when <b>foraging</b> alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed <b>foraging</b> in peculiar situations like railway lines.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was cunducted, using simple equations, to suggest {{relationships}} amung <b>forage</b> growth analysis, <b>forage</b> digestion analysis and ruminant growth analysis. <b>Forage</b> relative growth rate [RGR] {{was related to the}} decrease in dry matter digestibility with <b>forage</b> growth through <b>forage</b> lignification to form indigestible materials.

5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor negatively affected <b>foraging</b> efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The <b>foraging</b> efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of <b>foraging</b> on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} <b>foraging</b> and eating in the morning, {{starting}} {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. <b>Foraging</b> resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third <b>foraging</b> period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day <b>foraging</b> range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some <b>foraging</b> may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations <b>foraging</b> for fresh growth.|$|E

5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and <b>foraging.</b> These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in <b>foraging,</b> making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to <b>foraging</b> from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time <b>foraging</b> with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Foraging</b> {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. <b>Foraging</b> workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a <b>foraging</b> expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or <b>foraging</b> for food.|$|E

This paper analyses the six-year <b>forage</b> development programme, comparing its two phases, from an innovation systems perspective to identify best practices. The study shows that key <b>forage</b> innovative practices are: targeting innovative <b>forage</b> farmers, developing local <b>forages,</b> establishing private <b>forage</b> sources, <b>forage</b> promotion and diversifying capacity building.

5|$|<b>Foraging</b> {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the <b>foraging</b> trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, <b>foraging</b> dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while <b>foraging</b> for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later <b>foraging.</b>|$|E
5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a <b>foraging</b> individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in <b>foraging</b> reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{essential}} nutrient for beef cattle, but over-supplementation of P may have negative environmental and economic impacts. The P concentration in <b>forage</b> selected by grazing cattle may be sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements without supplementation. Similarly, the crude protein (CP) and in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) concentration of <b>forage</b> selected by grazing cattle may be greater than available <b>forage.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} determine the P, CP, and IVDDM concentrations of <b>forage</b> selected by beef cattle grazing cool-season grass pastures. Fifteen fall-calving Angus cows were managed by either continuous or rotational stocking in 30 -acre smooth bromegrass pastures, replicated twice. In July and August, one ruminally fistulated steer was placed in each pasture for one week. On two consecutive days {{at the end of each}} week, fistulated steers were ruminally evacuated, allowed to graze for 2 h, and sampled for <b>forage</b> selected during grazing. <b>Forage</b> samples were hand-clipped at ground level and from the upper half of the <b>forage</b> sward in pasture areas adjacent to the areas being grazed. A subsample of the ground-clipped <b>forage</b> was placed in the rumen and allowed to soak for 2 h following sampling of selected <b>forage</b> to correct the P, CP, and IVDDM concentrations in the selected <b>forage</b> for salivary P, CP, and IVDDM absorbed by selected <b>forage.</b> Hand-clipped and selected <b>forage</b> samples were analyzed for P, CP and IVDDM concentrations.

5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, {{small groups of}} goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species <b>foraging</b> flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, <b>foraging</b> success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that <b>foraging</b> sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their <b>foraging</b> to include the inner canopy, but {{did not do so}} where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap.|$|E
40|$|<b>Forage</b> fish play {{a pivotal}} role in marine {{ecosystems}} and economies worldwide by sustaining many predators and fisheries directly and indirectly. We estimate global <b>forage</b> fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of <b>forage</b> fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of <b>forage</b> fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of <b>forage</b> fisheries and (iii) the support service of <b>forage</b> fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. <b>Forage</b> fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. <b>Forage</b> fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, <b>forage</b> fish contribute a total of about $ 16. 9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i. e. 20 % of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of <b>forage</b> fisheries was $ 5. 6 billion, fisheries supported by <b>forage</b> fish were more than twice as valuable ($ 11. 3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of <b>forage</b> fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally.

5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins <b>foraging</b> at sunrise. While <b>foraging,</b> a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A <b>foraging</b> bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held {{slightly}} open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while <b>foraging.</b> When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey.

Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar <b>foraging</b> technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, <b>foraging</b> is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between <b>foraging</b> distance and feeding rate.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{one in a series}} of three that {{addresses}} the issue of <b>forage</b> loss in harvest, storage, and feeding of animals. <b>Forage</b> loss occurs primarily by two modes: 1) escape of <b>forage</b> from the mass of <b>forage</b> as it moves through handling and storage processes and 2) microbial deterioration.
