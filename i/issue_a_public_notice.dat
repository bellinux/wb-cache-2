40|$|Commission finds {{good cause}} for {{concluding}} that notice and comment are unnecessary. The rule changes {{adopted in the}} Order are minor in nature in that the Commission is changing the format of grantee codes that will be assigned {{in the future to}} prospective applicants for equipment certification, but is not changing any other requirements for equipment certification. Further, these changes will not have any effect on parties that have already been assigned three-character codes because they may continue to use them indefinitely. Thus, the Commission concludes that notice and comment are not necessary before changing the rules on grantee code format. 7. The Commission finds that the benefits of the rule changes are significant because the changes will enable it to continue to certify equipment from new parties, thus expanding the range of devices available to consumers. The Commission also finds that the costs of these rule changes are insignificant because it is not appreciably more burdensome for a party to apply for and use a fivecharacter code than a three-character code. There will be no additional burden on parties that already have three-character codes assigned because they may continue to use them indefinitely. Thus, the Commission concludes that the benefits of the rule changes are greater than the costs. 8. The Commission is making the rule changes effective 30 days after date of publication of this Order in the Federal Register. The change in grantee code length necessitates a non-substantive change in the electronic FCC Form 731 that is used to apply for equipment certification. This change to the form does not require prior Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval, but the Commission will provide OMB with a copy of the revised form for their records. The Commission plans to begin assigning grantee codes with the new format no earlier than 30 days after the revised Form 731 is available, and it will <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notice</b> announcing the date on which it will begin issuing five-character grantee codes...|$|E
