5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> that.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>admire</b> {{many things}} that Hitler wrote, many of the {{programs}} and policies that he instituted in Germany, {{but we do not}} blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>admire</b> Furtwängler for his {{originality}} and honesty. He liberated {{himself from}} slavery to the score; {{he realized that}} notes printed in the score, are nothing but SYMBOLS. The score is neither the essence nor {{the spirit of the}} music. Furtwängler had this very rare and great gift of going beyond the printed score and showing what music really was.|$|E
6000|$|... "I just {{admitted}} that <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> her. <b>I</b> never {{said she was}} a vulgar flirt; her mother was an absolutely scientific one. Heaven knows <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> that! It's a nice point, however, how much one is hound in honour not to warn a young friend against a dangerous woman because one also has relations of civility with the lady." ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>admired</b> our famous Professor, and <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> Hilda Wade: 'twas {{a matter}} of regret to me that my two admirations did not seem in return {{sufficiently}} to admire one another. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] Hilda answered, pouring out my second cup; [...] "he is a very great man. I never denied that. The greatest man, on the whole, I think, that I have ever come across." ...|$|R
25|$|Someone {{from whom}} I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> him but I cannot {{understand}} why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what {{seems to me to}} have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>admire</b> {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

6000|$|From {{her smile}} {{he knew that}} she was not beyond liking to be appreciated, and this {{reassured}} him. [...] "That's not humbug," [...] he said. [...] "I never told a woman <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> her when <b>I</b> didn't. In fact I don't know when I've told a woman <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> her, except my wife in the old days; and wives are funny." [...] He was silent, but resumed abruptly: ...|$|R

500|$|... "It's {{fun when}} you can find someone that you can relate to and that you respect. Jay-Z is someone <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> {{as a writer and}} as an artist. We could be sitting in the studio, and he can {{freestyle}} a rhyme that would be incredible just off the top of his head. He doesn't need a pen and paper. I equate that to a singer who can pick up the mike and riff and ad-lib over a song and take you to a totally new place." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite much prepublicity, Harlow {{received}} a lukewarm response from critics: Variety referred to Baker's portrayal of Harlow as [...] "a fairly reasonable facsimile, although she lacks the electric fire of the original." [...] Relations between Baker and Levine soured; in a 1965 interview, Baker sardonically commented: [...] "I'll {{say this about}} Joe Levine: <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> his taste in leading ladies," [...] which led the press to suspect a rift between the actress and producer. Baker sued Levine over her contract with Paramount Pictures in 1966, and was ultimately fired by Paramount and had her paychecks from Harlow frozen amid the contentious legal dispute; this left Baker {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in debt (however, she was eventually awarded $1 million in compensation).|$|E
500|$|... "La Mordidita" [...] {{was written}} by Ricky Martin, Pedro Capó, José Gómez, Yotuel Romero and Beatriz Luengo for Martin's tenth studio album A Quien Quiera Escuchar. Its {{production}} was completed by Antonio Rayo along with Romero. Talking about his collaboration with Yotuel, Ricky Martin said in an interview, [...] "It {{was a very big}} collaboration being able to work with Yotuel; a Cuban brother, big producer, composer, someone who <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> and respect a lot". During the same interview, he talked about the song, saying [...] "It is a coquettish song, it presents a party, union of cultures, it is energetic". Two remixes of the song were availabale for digital download; a Brian Cross remix on June 2, 2015 and an [...] "Urban Remix" [...] by Zion & Lennox on July 17, 2015.|$|E

500|$|The New Directions' {{rendition}} of [...] "Born This Way" [...] was strongly approved by Lady Gaga. On her Twitter account, she wrote, [...] "I really loved Glee Born This Way episode. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> {{the show for}} being brave+fighting for such modern social messaging. Never back down." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance a [...] "B+", and commented that it wasn't her favorite group number, mostly because she felt the song [...] "wasn't [...] best effort". Berk was less kind about the song, and called it a [...] "crappy but thematically admirable Gaga tune", though he gave it three stars out of five. Slezak gave it an [...] "A−" [...] and approved of the rendition: [...] "it was nice {{to see and hear}} Tina, Mercedes and Kurt on lead vocals—instead of, say, Blaine, Rachel, and Mr. Schue." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, [...] "Black Coffee" [...] was {{included}} in the competitive music video game series SingStar. According to Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman, the [...] "smart-pop attack" [...] of the song [...] "paved the way" [...] for later girl groups Girls Aloud and the Sugababes. Neil Hannon of the Irish band The Divine Comedy expressed admiration for [...] "Black Coffee", commending its production-heavy sound which [...] "adds to the sound of it, rather than taking anything away", and noted that its sound later became apparent in singles by Girls Aloud: [...] "Girls Aloud do pop like that now: songs like 'Biology' are a bit weird, and they flout the general rules, and <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> that. But 'Black Coffee' is better." [...] Writing for Metro in 2013, Seamus Duff stated that [...] "Black Coffee" [...] still sounded as [...] "fresh and relevant".|$|E

500|$|Garbage drummer and co-producer Butch Vig {{said that}} when the group contributed to film soundtracks, [...] "one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song." [...] Manson called herself {{a fan of the}} series, [...] "an {{institution}} <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> and has always captured my imagination since I was a child", and the films had a [...] "sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because [...] "you know it's going down in movie history", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, [...] "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" [...] The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts [...] "something that you can enjoy on the surface, but underneath there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into." ...|$|E
500|$|Axis {{attention}} now concentrated upon the New Zealand Division; after the recent fighting, the division, less 4,500 men {{who joined the}} 70th Division, withdrew towards the frontier in need of rest, refitting and re-organization; the 70th Division was again cut off. On 1December, Godwin-Austen {{was concerned about the}} exposed British position at Ed Duda, as were the staff of 70th Division, who believed the area had become untenable. Infantry had reinforced the captured ground, the 14th Infantry Brigade holding a line from Ed Duda to roughly [...] to the north-east. The Essex were still dug in at Ed Duda, with the 19th New Zealand Battalion to their north-east, then the 4th Border Regiment, the 18th New Zealand Battalion to their east and the 1st Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment to their north at Bir (Magen) Belhamed and the captured Axis strong point known as [...] "Leopard". The commanding officer of the 1st Essex reported that the position was well prepared and he was confident of repelling any assault. Scobie sent word stating [...] "Well done, <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> your spirit".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Gay's 200m {{performance}} at the 2006 IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart {{was the culmination of}} a highly successful year. He became the World Athletics Final champion with another improved personal best of 19.68s, making him the joint third-fastest 200m sprinter with Namibian Frankie Fredericks. Gay was pleased that Fredericks was on site to see his best equaled: [...] "To run that time in front of Frankie is a privilege. He's someone <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> a great deal both as an athlete and as a man." [...] Gay also won a bronze medal in the 100m, finishing behind Powell and Scott. However, Gay proved himself over 100m at the 2006 IAAF World Cup, taking gold with a 9.88s run. At the end of the season, with Gatlin banned from competition, Gay dominated the Track and Field News US 2006 list, having run six of the seven fastest 100m, with Scott in third, and four of the top six 200m times (behind Carter and Spearmon). Furthermore, he was the second fastest 100m runner in the world that year, second only to world record holder Powell. Having proven himself to be adept at both 100 and 200m, Gay reflected upon his development as a sprinter: ...|$|E
500|$|Howard {{originally}} envisioned Maximus as the [...] "ultimate super-cop", jokingly {{referring to}} the character as [...] "the Tommy Lee Jones of horses". Attempting to make Maximus feel like a [...] "fresh" [...] character, the filmmakers researched several historical horses from both animated and live-action films {{to ensure that the}} character would be unique and different enough from his predecessors. Greno explained that [...] "Maximus ... could have easily slipped into the category of, 'Oh, I've seen that before.'" [...] To prevent this, the filmmakers referenced [...] "a board with photos of all the different animated horses that had been done". Howard explained that Maximus was originally conceived as a [...] "pretty serious" [...] character, but eventually developed into a funnier and more likeable horse as the animators continued to draw him with dog-like attributes. Both Pascal and Maximus, who according to the Austin American-Statesman are responsible for providing the film with the majority of its comic relief, were eventually written into the film by screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Analyzing the characters' roles in the film, HitFix observed that [...] "There's a simplicity to it all that <b>I</b> <b>admire,</b> and you throw in a few anthropomorphized animals so everyone laughs a lot, and that's the Disney recipe". One critic wrote about Maximus: ...|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E

And I made the decision consciously to make as many movies as I could in as short a period of time as I could" ...|$|R
6000|$|The German gentleman is {{also more}} interesting, {{the more you know}} him; it seems {{sometimes}} as if I could fairly drink in his ideas. I have found out why the young lady from New York doesn't like me! It is because I said one day at dinner that <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> to go to the Louvre. Well, when I first came, it seemed as if <b>I</b> did <b>admire</b> everything! ...|$|R
