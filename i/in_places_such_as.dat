5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the railway, Cheadle Hulme was a rural and {{agricultural}} cluster of hamlets. The railway brought a huge influx of people to the area, and provided opportunities for residents to work <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Manchester. Cheadle Hulme gradually grew to become a large suburb of over 29,000people thanks to the railway.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{was popular}} in Karnataka {{during the first}} {{millennium}} <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Gulbarga and Banavasi. A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in Gulbarga district in 1986 has proven that the Krishna River basin was once home to both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism.

5|$|ACC teams viewed a {{berth in}} the Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} due to its location. Aside from {{being one of the}} lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Both the Mont Blanc massif, and the Aiguilles Rouges {{range to}} its north, now {{form part of}} the {{external}} zone of the Alps, effectively being the outermost layers of rock. The central granites make up Mont Blanc, the steep slopes of the Drus, the Grandes Jorasses and the Dent du Géant, and at the highest points are topped by schists, which are visible <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Grands Montets and near Mont Blanc's summit.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the East African coast {{are used}} {{as a source of}} {{building}} material. Ancient (fossil) coral limestone, notably including the Coral Rag Formation of the hills around Oxford (England), was once used as a building stone, and can be seen in some of the oldest buildings in that city including the Saxon tower of St Michael at the Northgate, St. George's Tower of Oxford Castle, and the mediaeval walls of the city.|$|E

5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} fishing industry {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. <b>In</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. <b>In</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
5|$|This species breeds in vegetated {{areas of}} {{freshwater}} lakes across Europe, Asia, Africa, northern South America and {{the southwest and}} western United States. After breeding, this bird migrates to saline lakes to moult. Then, after completing the moult and waiting for sometimes several months, it migrates to winter <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the south-western Palearctic and the eastern parts of both Africa and Asia. It also winters in southern Africa, another place where it breeds. In the Americas, it winters {{as far south as}} Guatemala, although the wintering population there is mainly restricted to islands in the Gulf of California, the Salton Sea, and Baja California. When not breeding, its habitat is primarily saline lakes and coastal estuaries.|$|E

5|$|Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga {{contribution}} to polity, culture and {{literature of the}} modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward Jainism resulting {{in the construction of}} monuments <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from religion to elephant management.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} in Africa in general faces many challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if quality female players in Africa are developed, many leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Northern Europe or the United States. Funding for women's {{football in}} Africa is also an issue; most of the funding for women's football and for the women's national teams comes from FIFA, not the national football association.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1928, Agârbiceanu, a {{recipient}} of the National Prize for Literature, headed the Cluj chapter of Astra and edited Transilvania. It was in this magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of eugenics, calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his participation was somewhat incongruous, but Agârbiceanu did not see a conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws. From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congresses and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Aleșd.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
5|$|In short, the Rashtrakuta {{rule was}} {{tolerant}} to multiple popular religions, Jainism, Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. Buddhism too found support and was popular <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Dambal and Balligavi, {{although it had}} declined significantly by this time. The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara's Advaita philosophy. Islamic contact with South India began {{as early as the}} 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts, specifically in towns such as Kayalpattanam and Nagore. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappilas (Moplahs) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} she is not good at {{business}} as she is not organised enough, and has never really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday. Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally <b>in</b> <b>places,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
