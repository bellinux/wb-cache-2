5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, {{a long series of}} Mexican revolutions began. The <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} an outright invasion. Just {{coming off a}} disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E
5|$|The Queen of Somnia {{tells the}} Hero to {{discover}} who he really is. The quest leads {{the party to}} Arkbolt, where a terrible monster is blocking a nearby cave. The reward for defeating the monster is the famed Sunderbolt Blade, but before the party can strike the <b>final</b> <b>blow,</b> a warrior {{by the name of}} Terry kills the monster, winning the sword. After traveling both worlds, the party learns that Murdaw was not the only evil in the world, having fought several other monsters that all seem to be connected.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E
5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette. The trial was transformed from a murder trial into one against the Camorra as a whole. The hearings began in the spring of 1911 and would continue for twelve months. Fabbroni intended to use the trial to strike the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to the Camorra. The trial was attended by the former mayor of New York City, George B. McClellan, in whose administration Petrosino was killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials of}} the central {{committee}} of the Fasci, {{that took place in}} Palermo in April and May 1894, were the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to the movement. In spite of an eloquent defence, which turned the Court into a political platform and thrilled every socialist in the country, they were condemned to heavy sentences of imprisonment. On May 30, 1894, the leaders of the movement received their sentence: Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida to 18 years and Rosario Bosco, Nicola Barbato and Bernardino Verro to 12 years in jail.|$|E

50|$|Orella's {{population}} {{began to}} decline with the depression in the 1930s. After World War 2, the economic boom allowed many to leave rural Orella for population centers.

5|$|Washington's Continental Army, also newly {{funded by}} $20,000 in French gold, {{delivered}} the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to the British in 1781, after a French naval victory allowed American and French forces to trap a British army in Virginia, preventing reinforcement by Clinton from the North. The surrender at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, {{marked the end}} of major fighting in North America. Cornwallis failed to appear at the official surrender ceremony, and sent General Charles O'Hara as his proxy; Washington then had General Benjamin Lincoln accept the surrender in his place.|$|E
5|$|As {{the winner}} of 2015–16 I-League, Bengaluru FC were paired against 8th ranked team Aizawl F.C. for the quarter-final round. On 30 April 2016, in {{the first leg of}} quarter finals, Bengaluru FC took an early lead in 15th minute with a goal from Eugeneson Lyngdoh, however Alfred Jaryan {{equalized}} for the home team in 38th minute. Aizawl struck the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> in the dying minutes when Joel Sunday scored the winner for the home team, leaving Bengaluru FC trailing after the first leg. Bengaluru FC suffered a shock defeat in the home leg as well, as the team went down 2–3 to Aizawl. C.K. Vineeth's first half equalizer and Sunil Chhetri's successful penalty proved insufficient as Bengaluru FC were ousted from the Federation cup on 3–5 aggregate loss.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople {{began to}} decline {{continuously}} {{after the end of}} the reign of Basil II in 1025. The <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> was given by the conquest of Villardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, where the City was sacked and pillaged. The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinople's churches, defenses, and basic services were in disrepair, and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century. After the reconquest of 1261, however some of the city's monuments were restored, and some, like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye, were created.|$|E

5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to particle models of light.|$|E
5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in any danger, he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the <b>final</b> <b>blow,</b> Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{military}} {{consisted of}} {{a diverse group of}} men drawn across the various nations of the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in armour and style of fighting. The troops were usually armed with a bow, a 'short spear' and a sword or axe, carried a wicker shield. They wore a leather jerkin, although individuals of high stature wore high quality metal armor. The Persians most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy, then closed in to deliver the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> with spears and swords. The first rank of Persian infantry formations, the so-called 'sparabara', had no bows, carried larger wicker shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears. Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation. The cavalry probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, the US Navy's {{battleship}} designs {{reflected the}} prevailing theory of naval combat—that battles would initially be fought at some distance, but the ships would then approach to close range for the <b>final</b> <b>blows,</b> when shorter-range, faster-firing guns would prove most useful.

5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 191 brought strong {{criticism}} from the media regarding the DC-10's safety and design. The DC-10 {{had been involved in}} two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors, American Airlines Flight 96 (1972) and Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (1974). The separation of engine one from its mount, the widespread publication of the dramatic images of the airplane missing its engine seconds before the crash, and a second photo of the fireball resulting from the impact, raised widespread concerns about the safety of the DC-10. The <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to the airplane's reputation was dealt two weeks after the crash, when the aircraft was grounded by the FAA. Although the aircraft itself was later exonerated, the damage in the public's eye was already done.|$|E
5|$|The nation enjoyed {{considerable}} international prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire and had become an emerging power in the international arena. While PedroII was receiving medical treatment in Europe, the parliament passed, and Princess Isabel signed on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law, which completely abolished slavery in Brazil. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery proved to be unfounded. Nonetheless, the end of slavery was the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> to any remaining belief in the crown's neutrality, and this resulted in an explicit shift of support to Republicanism by the ultraconservatives—themselves backed by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{retrieving}} {{the final}} Periapt shard, Lara discovers Eckardt {{in the midst}} of attempting to revive the Sleeper, using the Sanglyph and body parts stolen from the Monstrum's victims. She is able to stab him with two shards, but before she can deliver the <b>final</b> <b>blow,</b> she is interrupted by Eckhardt's right-hand man, Karel. Karel kills Eckhardt with the final shard, revealing that he is a Nephilim himself, and had used Eckhardt to ensure the survival of his species. He had also manipulated Lara, in the guise of Bouchard, Luddick and Kurtis, to retrieve the Obscura Paintings. He offers Lara immortality if she will help him complete the task, but Lara experiences a flashback to Von Croy’s murder, and sees that Karel, in Eckhardt's form, was the Monstrum. She refuses, retrieves the Sanglyph from Eckhardt's body, and plants it on the Sleeper, overloading it with energy and causing it to explode, taking Karel with it. In the aftermath, Lara discovers Kurtis' Chirugai blade, which directs her towards Boaz's chamber. Smiling, she heads inside.|$|E

5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips into the air and lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships.

5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports of imminent invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations because the United States and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had finally gotten permission to lead his own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the <b>final</b> <b>blow</b> in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E
