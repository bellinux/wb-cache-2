2500|$|Some {{publications}} and authors have regarded Taki {{as one of}} the best female fighting game or even overall video game characters of them all for a variety of reasons. In 2003, GMR feature [...] "The GREAT Women of Gaming" [...] included Taki at fourth place, while play called her and Ivy [...] "arguably the finest females in all of 3D fighting." [...] In 2007, Rob Wright of Tom's Games chose Taki {{as one of the}} 50 greatest female characters in video games, calling her [...] "a skilled and noble warrior with a shining spirit and stunning beauty" [...] and suggesting that Zhang Ziyi should play her in then-planned live action adaptation of the Soulcalibur series (Dreamcast Magazine has previously suggested Michelle Yeoh). Patrick Toworfe of B-TEN ranked her as the gaming's ninth top female character in 2014, and WhatCulture's Joe Pring placed Taki at 23rd spot on his 2015 list of greatest female fighting game characters of all time, commenting: [...] "Ignore the ridiculously over-the-top bust size <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and youâ€™ll realise how great a character Taki is." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> I {{could see}} that spirit company, ghosts of the ferns and leaves, of {{butterflies}} and bees and birds, and four-footed things innumerable, ghosts of the wind, the sun-beams, and the rain-drops, and tiny flickering ghosts of moon-rays. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> I saw what the fairy's eyes were seeing, without knowing what they saw.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the old {{flame of}} quick anger burned in Geoffrey's eyes. Then he responded.|$|E
5000|$|... "It'll DZUS right back": Describes <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> you cut <b>a</b> part of {{your car}} or truck out <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>moment</b> of enjoyment. Generally made {{in the middle of}} the desert.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tio Pancho," [...] she said, with {{a charming}} smile, [...] "may I trouble {{you to ask}} Mr. Merriam to come out <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> that I may speak with him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{the burly}} figure reappeared on the balcony.|$|R

60|$|Tommy found Bessie {{sitting by}} the kitchen window, looking dreamily out of it. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Tommy thought uneasily that Bessie was looking very pale and thin this spring.|$|E
50|$|The new enemy {{has been}} lying low <b>for</b> <b>just</b> such <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The races are {{cut off from}} one another and the islands are exposed to attackers, who fall upon them from demonic depths.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Amanda looked scared. Then with a queer {{little laugh}} she jumped in again.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand to Sir Richmond. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> they stood hand in hand, appreciatively....|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Tara of Helium {{looked her}} surprise; {{and then she}} shrugged her {{beautiful}} shoulders as {{she turned her head}} to cast her eyes over one of them at Gahan of Gathol.|$|E
60|$|Seaforth trembled {{a little}} as he did it, and glanced <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> at his comrade's face. It was set and grey, but it went {{suddenly}} awry into the grotesque semblance of a smile.|$|E
60|$|Coulthurst, {{who could}} not see the door from where he sat, looked up from his book <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and did not appear to notice that Tomlinson was no longer in front of him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fyshe {{was here}} {{launched}} upon his favourite topic; but he interrupted himself, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{to speak to}} the waiter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hope they won't {{kill any}} one," [...] said Mr. Pope, and <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the {{conversation}} hung fire. [...] "And your friend?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|CUTHBERTSON. But <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to {{say good}} night. (Julia and Charteris {{look at one another}} in dismay. Cuthbertson looks quickly at them, perceiving that {{something}} is wrong.) ...|$|R
6000|$|None of the Ingleside folks spoke <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Their silence {{meant that}} they thought Susan's pluck in [...] "working out" [...] quite wonderful. But Susan mistook their meaning and her sun-burned face grew red.|$|E

6000|$|Esmond's eyes rested <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> on Sewell. [...] "Only two {{or three}} of the men talking rather wildly, sir. Somebody has been putting notions into their heads. It {{occurred}} to me I might as well make sure they all had certificates." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the frozen, misty {{atmosphere}} took on {{a reddish}} hue, his tongue clove {{to the roof of}} his mouth, a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... "She met you, at the Fergusons', <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{when she}} was out here last autumn. What really nice and simple people the Fergusons are, with all their money!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{turnings}} come at crucial {{times in}} the characters lives. They are doomed and unhappy people and though the turning may not change their lives we see their humanity even if <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{she hesitated}} (the grace and {{dignity of the}} tall girl awed her, {{confused}} her), then Zulime went to her, and the two women, so diverse, yet so dear to me, met in an embrace of mutual love and confidence.|$|E
60|$|At last Dave {{seemed to}} obtain a slight advantage. The Indian relaxed his vigor <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and in that {{fraction}} of time the young soldier caught him by the throat and gave him such a squeeze that the redman's windpipe was well-nigh dislocated.|$|E
60|$|Presently in sweeps Aunt Tommy, in {{an elegant}} dress, not a hair out of place. She looked {{perfectly}} sweet, only her nose was a little red. Dick looked at her <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then he stepped forward and took her right into his arms.|$|E
60|$|Ruby {{slipped her}} arm about Anne's waist with a shallow little laugh. But <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> their eyes met, and, behind all the luster of Ruby's, Anne saw {{something}} that made her heart ache.|$|R
6000|$|... (Monte Mottarone! <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{taste the}} sweet Italian name upon your lips.) These {{were the days}} before the {{funicular}} from Stresa, when one trudged up a rude path through the chestnuts and walnuts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} to notice me, Philip," [...] she murmured. [...] "I {{want you to look}} <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> as though you thought me {{the only person in the}} world--as you did once, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} Mr. Birdsell?" [...] she asked, {{presenting}} a powerful {{young man with}} a singularly handsome face.

6000|$|... "I will not," [...] he promised. [...] "It {{was only}} <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I felt an idiot.

6000|$|... "So she {{has just}} been telling me," [...] said Elinor. Conolly's {{surprise}} escaped him <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in {{a quick glance at}} Marian. She colored, and looked reproachfully at her cousin, who added, [...] "I am sure you must be a nuisance to the neighbors." ...|$|E
60|$|And then Mary Margaret {{sat down}} <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{intending}} {{to get right}} up and help her mother light the fire, laid her head on her father's shoulder, and fell sound asleep before she ever suspected it.|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [urgently] No: please hold on. I can {{convince}} you--[a loud buzz-uzz-uzz]. Engaged! Who is she calling up now? [Represses {{the button and}} calls] The Chief Secretary. Say I {{want to see him}} again, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|And then, {{and more}} {{in the manner of}} a Russian prince than any common count, Chitterlow bowed and withdrew. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he allowed <b>a</b> conquering eye to {{challenge}} Helen's and noted her for a girl of quality....|$|R
