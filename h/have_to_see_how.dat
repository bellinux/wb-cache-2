[...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

In short, it is essential that a language is shareable, but this does not imply that for a language to function that it is in fact already shared.|$|E

2500|$|Khánh's {{quartet of}} delegates responded to Taylor by {{responding}} in a circumlocutory way. They remained calm {{and did not}} resort to direct confrontation. Kỳ said the change was necessary, as [...] "the political situation is worse than it ever was under Diệm". Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have unity". He claimed that some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ then promised that he would explain the decision at a media conference and that he and his colleagues would return to their military roles in the near future. Thiệu said [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government ... Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated". When Taylor said that the moves detracted from Hương and Sửu's powers, the generals disagreed, and said that they supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the deposal of the HNC.

6000|$|... § VI. Now, it also happens, {{from its}} place in buildings, that the {{sectional}} roof over a narrow space {{will need to be}} considered before we come to the expanded roof over a broad one. For when a wall has been gathered, as above explained, into piers, that it may better bear vertical pressure, it is generally necessary that it should be expanded again at the top into a continuous wall before it carries the true roof. Arches or lintels are, therefore, thrown from pier to pier, and a level preparation for carrying the real roof is made above them. After we have examined the structure of piers, therefore, we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> lintels or arches are thrown from pier to pier, and the whole prepared for the superincumbent roof; this arrangement being universal in all good architecture prepared for vertical pressures: and we shall then examine the condition of the great roof itself. And because the structure of the roof very often introduces certain lateral pressures which {{have much to do with}} the placing of buttresses, it will be well to do all this before we examine the nature of buttresses, and, therefore, between parts (B) and (C) of the above plan, § IV. So now we shall have to study: (A) the construction of walls; (B) that of piers; (C) that of lintels or arches prepared for roofing; (D) that of roofs proper; and (E) that of buttresses.|$|E

The buildup to Galavan's plan (Maniax, Barbara kidnapping Jim, trying to get Bruce to sign, etc.) was always going to be better than these final moments of the plan - which seem to involve Gotham crumbling under the heel of a dozen monks who can't fight for s***.

5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote: [...] ""Bullseye" [...] wasn't bad at all, {{but it was}} sort of a flatliner when it came to providing thrills. The spinning wheel bit made for an interesting gambit, but it still seemed like it could have gone further. And while I like the prospect of Dot and Bette trying to separate themselves, their arc this week with Dandy felt a lot like filler. We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> everything shakes out with Dandy and Jimmy's pow wow." [...] Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A- rating, writing: [...] "When [...] "Bullseye" [...] drops a chainsaw, it loses a pinky toe at most. This is the episode that's been waiting to fight its way out of Freak Show all along, catalyzing the season's potential energy into the genuine spectacle of histrionic freakouts and hypnogogic fantasy." ...|$|E

It's very lucky for a trainer like me to get horses like these. I'm going to enjoy it while it's happening. These horses don't come along very often". Commenting on Palace Episode's prospects he added [...] "He's a very good horse who is entitled to go for very good races. He'll definitely stay {{a mile and a half}} and we'll just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he matures over the winter.

5000|$|On 26 October, Kingston Hill was one {{of eleven}} horses to contest the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, after being {{supplemented}} for the race {{at a cost of}} £17,500. He was ridden by regular jockey Andrea Atzeni and started as the 7/2 favourite. Unlike in his previous race, Kingston Hill was positioned just behind the leaders after the start. He took the lead with over one furlong still to run and pulled clear to win by four and a half lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained colt Johann Strauss. After the race his odds were cut for the Derby and 2000 Guineas in 2014. Commenting on Kingston Hill's targets for the 2014 season, Varian said after the race [...] "We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he winters and what he's like in the spring. People have said is he a 10-furlong, mile-and-a-half horse, but he has the pace for a mile and travels so well... He has good acceleration and will be in everything. You've got to have an open book with him. We'll have a good eye on the Guineas. Whether he runs before or goes straight there or bypasses the Guineas we'll have to wait and see." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2012, {{directors}} Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor discussed {{producing a}} potential Ghost Rider 3, and having someone else direct it. Neveldine told The Playlist that Cage had {{expressed interest in}} appearing in another Ghost Rider film, hinting that the film could move forward provided that Spirit of Vengeance was a success, saying, [...] "I know Nic wants to do it, he's very pumped about it.... We'll just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> well this does." [...] In March, 2013, when Cage was asked about a possible third installment, he said, [...] "It's possible, but it won't be with me.... Anything's possible. But I doubt, highly, that I {{would be in a}} third installment of that." [...] According to MTV reporting, Cage believes that another Ghost Rider film might happen [...] "down the road," [...] saying, [...] "It would be interesting if they did it with a female Ghost Rider," [...] but he insisted that his days as Johnny Blaze were behind him. Cage also said, [...] "Personally, I'm done. I've done what I had to do with that part. You never say never, but right now, today, I would say that I'm done." [...] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced on May 2, 2013 that the film rights to Ghost Rider had reverted to Marvel Studios, though he also stated that the studio had no immediate plans to make another Ghost Rider film.
