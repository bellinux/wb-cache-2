40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} compare the effects of {{captopril}} plus <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> versus monotherapy on infarct collagen content and left ventricular remodeling and function during healing after myocardial infarction. Background. Captopril or <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> monotherapy can limit postinfarction dilation. Whether captopril inhibits infarct collagen content, or whether captopril plus <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> might be more beneficial, is not known. Methods. In vivo remodeling variables and function (echocardiography), hemodynamic variables, postmortem topography (planimetry) and collagen content (hydroxyproline) were measured in 48 chronically instrumented dogs that were randomized 2 days after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to 6 weeks of therapy with captopril, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> captopril plus <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> or placebo. Results. Compared with placebo, the three active therapies decreased blood pressure and left atrial pressure; limited infarct expansion, infarct thinning, noninfarct wall stretching and thickening; limited left ventricular dilation and increase in left ventricular mass; and decreased regional bulging, aneurysm frequency and left ventricular dysfunction. However, the decrease in asynergy and increase in volume ejection fraction were less with captopril or captopril plus <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> than with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Infarct thinning and bulging at 6 weeks was also less with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> than with captopril. Although initial left ventricular asynergy, final scar sizes and noninfarct collagen content at 6 weeks were similar among the groups, collagen {{in the center of}} the infarct scar was less with captopril or captopril plus <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> than with placebo or <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Conclusions. Monotherapy with captopril or <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> or their combination, improved all remodeling variables, but <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> improved function more than captopril or captopril plus <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Inhibition of infarct collagen content by captopril suggests that benefits with captopril represent a balance between positive and negative effects, and its combination with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> might be advantageous...|$|E
40|$|Three {{times daily}} {{administration}} of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> may avoid {{much of the}} tolerance seen with more frequent dosing. To determine the daylong pattern of the antianginal effect of three times daily <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> eight men with stable exertional angina and a positive exercise test were studied. The subjects had demonstrated increased exercise duration in response to oral <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> therapy and absence of complete tolerance to long-term three times daily <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Treadmill exercise to onset of angina was performed over 2 days at 8 am, 9 am, 11 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 4 pm, 6 pmand 7 pm. On one day each patient received <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> at 8 am, 1 pmand 6 pmin a previously titrated dose (mean 27. 5 mg), which had been taken three times daily for at least 2 weeks. On the other day at the same hours each patient received double blind a placebo identical in appearance to <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> One hour after the 8 amdose of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> mean systolic blood pressure at rest had fallen by 19 mm Hg and mean exercise time to angina increased by 200 s.

At 7 pm, 1 h after the third dose of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> exercise duration increased by only 70 s. Thus, at best, patients receiving long-term therapy with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> three times daily obtain a total {{of no more than}} 6 h of antianginal benefit during a 24 h period, and the magnitude of the benefit declines with each succeeding dose during the day...|$|E
40|$|In a randomized, double blind, {{crossover}} study, 10 {{patients with}} stable exercise-induced angina pectoris were studied during acute and sustained therapy with oral <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Circulatory changes and exercise performance were evaluated before and 2 and 6 hours after medication. Sublingual nitroglycerin was administered 30 {{minutes after the}} 2 and 6 hour exercise tests and the exercise test was repeated after another 5 minutes. Systolic blood pressure at rest 2 hours after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> decreased by 25 % during the acute phase, but by only 11 % during the sustained phase (probability [p] < 0. 05). Systolic blood pressure was not decreased further by nitroglycerin during acute therapy, but was decreased during sustained therapy (p < 0. 05). Six hours after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> administration, systolic blood pressure remained significantly below the control value during sustained therapy. Treadmill walking time to moderate angina was significantly prolonged 2 hours after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> administration during both the acute and sustained phases. During the sustained phase, {{there was no difference}} from control values after 6 hours. Nitroglycerin did not increase walking time 2 1 / 2 hours after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> during either acute (567 ± 122 versus 560 ± 119 seconds) or sustained (582 ± 115 versus 567 ± 129 seconds) therapy, but at 6 1 / 2 hours, nitroglycerin increased walking time from 473 ± 125 to 547 ± 107 seconds (p < 0. 05) during sustained therapy. This study demonstrates that 1) tolerance to the hemodynamic and antianginal effects of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> develops rapidly, 2) nitroglycerin does not further prolong exercise duration 2 1 / 2 hours after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> administration, 3) nitroglycerin prolongs exercise duration when <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> is no longer exerting a beneficial effect, and 4) there is possible cross-tolerance between <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and nitroglycerin...|$|E

PATIENTS: 12 men with confirmed ischaemic heart disease and stable exertional class 3 angina (Canadian). All had episodes of horizontal or down sloping ST segment depression during 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring. All were nitrate responders. DESIGN: Each patient was given <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (10 - 30 mg four times a day) and placebo (four times a day) for three days in a randomised crossover trial.

40|$|Purpose: In {{an effort}} to improve {{radiotherapy}} treatments, methods aimed at increasing the quantity of oxygen delivered to tumors were investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of one nitric oxide (NO) donor (<b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate)</b> on pO 2 and blood flow in a murine tumor model. The effect was compared to carbogen, used as a reference treatment. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six liver tumors implanted in mouse thighs were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4. 7 Tesla with dynamic Gd-DTPA and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-enhanced imaging after administration of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> or carbogen. The effect on the pO 2 was also tested by EPR oximetry (1. 1 GHz) on 52 mice. Results: A significant increase in MRI intensity was observed for both treatments in comparison with the control group. EPR oximetry showed a dose-dependant increase in tumor pO 2 for <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (by 5. 9 mmHg at 0. 2 mg/kg) and a substantially greater change for carbogen breathing (by 23 mmHg). Conclusion: Both tumor blood flow and pO 2 were increased by <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and carbogen. Carbogen is more efficient than <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> in increasing the BOLD image intensity, as well as the tumor pO 2, but as efficient as <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> in the Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced imaging. We conclude that the effects of carbogen on improving tumor pO 2 involve both improved blood flow and improved hemoglobin oxygenation, whereas the effects of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> are predominantly mediated by improved blood flow alone. © 200...|$|E

We designed these studies with the aim of designing a Phase II trial to evaluate the drugs’ efficacy in patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. For the first trial, ISOFEN 1, a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, active control, three-treatment cross-over study, was aimed at comparing the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen 200 mg and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> 20 mg when given alone and concomitantly. The pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen given alone versus ibuprofen given concomitantly with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> were similar, as documented by the lack of statistically significant differences in the main drug’s pharmacokinetic parameters (time to maximal concentration [Tmax], maximal concentration [Cmax], area under the curve [AUC] 0 –t, and AUC 0 –∞). Similarly, we found that the coadministration of ibuprofen did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> No issues of safety were detected. The second trial, ISOFEN 2, was a single-site, dose titration study that was designed to select the maximum tolerated dose for <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> when coadministered with ibuprofen. Eighteen out of the 19 enrolled subjects tolerated the treatment well, and they completed the study at the highest dose of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> applied (80 mg/day). One subject voluntarily decided to reduce the dose of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> from 80 mg to 60 mg. The treatment-related adverse events recorded during the study were, for the large majority, episodes of headache that remitted spontaneously in 0. 5 – 1 hour – a known side effect of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> These studies demonstrate that the combination of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and ibuprofen does not lead to pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs; they also demonstrate that the combination of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and ibuprofen has optimal tolerability and safety profiles that are similar to those previously reported for <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and ibuprofen given alone.

These drugs act by different mechanisms. We aimed to compare the results of isoprenaline with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Methods and resultsWe studied 198 subjects referred for HUTT to our institute; those above the age of 35 years were not included in our study, because isoprenaline was not used commonly above this age; thus, only 90 subjects were analyzed. We found that <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> resulted in more HUTT-positive results than isoprenaline by absolute risk difference of 26 %; relative risk for positive isoprenaline was 60 %, confidence interval 0. 38 – 0. 93, and P value of 0. 03. There was no difference in frequency of types of responses, i. e. Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 between passive testing, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> and isoprenaline, confidence interval 1. 53 – 2. 02, and P value 0. 71. Time to get positive response was highest for passive testing followed by ISO and ISDN; the mean was 16. 85 ± 7. 00 min, 9. 85 ± 5. 84 min, and 7. 00 ± 3. 35 min, respectively.

Each patient was randomized to 10 mg slow-release nifedipine and 5 mg <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> in a single-blind, cross-over study. The exercise stress test was performed 30 minutes after drug administration. After nifedipine, three patients {{had a negative}} exercise stress test, whereas the test was negative after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> only in one patient. A significantly higher exercise tolerance was detected at peak exercise after nifedipine than after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> as shown by a longer exercise time (380 +/- 44 vs. 295 +/- 41 seconds, p less than 0. 001), a more increased maximum work load (355 +/- 89 vs. 255 +/- 55 W x min, p less than 0. 02), and a higher rate-pressure product (30, 300 +/- 2, 500 vs. 26, 100 +/- 2, 700, p less than 0. 01).

The patient was an 81 year-old female who was admitted to Yura Hospital because of attacks of precordial pain. Several minutes after the sublingual administration of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (10 mg) for an anginal attack, she developed a sensation of general weakness, and thereafter because unconscious. Arterial blood pressure fell and became unmeasurable. Electrocardiograms recorded during the syncopal attack showed sinus tachycardia and significant elevation of ST-segment in right precordial leads. In response to a drip infusion of noradrenaline, arterial blood pressure returned to normal with recovery of consciousness. Two similar syncopal attacks induced by sublingual <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> occurred {{in the next three}} days. These attacks were not due to augmentation of the vagal reflex. Decrease of venous return probably was the primary etiological factor. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nitroglycerin and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> are two drugs {{which are}} infused {{intravenously}} during {{the treatment of}} ischaemic heart disease. The availability of these two drugs in solutions infused from plastic infusion bags or glass infusion bottles through plastic giving sets has been investigated. During simulated infusions the concentration of nitroglycerin and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> appearing in the effluent of the giving set tubing {{was found to be}} much less than the concentration of the drug solution initially contained in the plastic infusion bag or glass infusion bottle. It was found that each component of the plastic infusion equipment sorbed the drugs to a significant extent and that the rate of disappearance of drugs from solutions stored in each component was in the rank order: giving set tubing > giving set burette > plastic infusion bag. There was no significant loss of either drug from solutions stored in glass bottles. The influence of formulation factors and storage conditions on the sorption of nitroglycerin, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and another organic nitrate compound, ethylene glycol dinitrate, by plastic infusion equipment was studied. The extent of loss during simulated infusions was also found to be dependent on flow rate of drug solution through the giving set. The sorption of nitroglycerin and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> has clinical and pharmacokinetic significance. Losses of nitroglycerin and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> associated with their infusion through plastic Lnfusion equipment were minimised by infusing drug solutions from a glass syringe through high density polyethylene tubing. This method was also successfully applied to overcome the previously reported loss of diazepam and chlormethiazole during infusions using conventional plastic administration equipment...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} (SNS) is an important regulator of cardiovascular function. Activation of SNS {{plays an important role}} in the pathophysiology and the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmia, and possibly hypertension. Vasodilators such as adenosine and sodium nitroprusside are known to activate SNS via baroreflex mechanisms. Because vasodilators are widely used in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of clinically used dosages of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> and captopril on sympathetic nerve activity at rest and during stimulatory maneuvers. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were included in this double-blind placebo-controlled study, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA; with microelectrodes in the peroneal nerve), blood pressure, heart rate, and neurohumoral parameters were measured before and 90 minutes after the oral administration of 40 mg <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> or 6. 25 mg captopril. Furthermore, a 3 -minute mental stress test and a cold pressor test were performed before and 90 minutes after drug administration. Resting MSA did not change after captopril and decreased compared with placebo (P <. 05 versus placebo), whereas <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> led to a marked increase in MSA (P <. 05). Systolic blood pressure was reduced by <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (P <. 05), whereas captopril decreased diastolic blood pressure (P <. 05). The increases in MSA, blood pressure, and heart rate during mental stress were comparable before and after drug administration regardless of the medication. During cold pressor test, MSA and systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased to the same degree independent of treatment, but after <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> the increase in MSA seemed to be less pronounced. Heart rate did not change during cold stimulation. Plasma renin activity increased after captopril and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (P <. 05), whereas placebo had no effect. Endothelin- 1 increased after placebo and <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (P <. 05) but not after captopril. CONCLUSIONS Thus, captopril suppressed MSA despite lowering of diastolic blood pressure but allowed normal adaptation of the SNS during mental or physical stress. In contrast, the nitrate strongly activated the SNS under baseline conditions. These findings demonstrate that vasodilators differentially interact with the SNS, which could be of importance in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases...|$|E
