5|$|Oxford University and the Chatham-based Royal Engineers {{were among}} 28 {{entrants}} {{to the competition}} in the 1873–74 season.

5|$|Weinke's {{favorite}} {{target was}} wide receiver Peter Warrick, who led all Seminole receivers with 71receptions and 931yards in just nine games {{during the regular}} season. Five times, Warrick earned more than 100receiving yards in a game. Warrick's season was shortened by a two-game suspension following his arrest for underpaying for clothes, but he still was named an All-America selection at wide receiver, signifying his status {{as one of the}} best players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the position.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ireland, Daily {{first began}} playing {{baseball}} professionally around the Baltimore area, often receiving more lucrative offers {{to play in}} more prominent leagues, all of which he declined, preferring {{to stay in the}} local area. His reputation, along with actions such as verbally assaulting umpires and fans, forced him to move on to other teams, which landed him in New York City playing for the Metropolitans, which was an all-professional club but had yet to join a major league; they later joined the National League in 1883. He became the team's ace pitcher, winning 38games, including notable victories against Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings, and most of the other top professional teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham was working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> Petworth, gave Brettingham {{another opportunity to}} design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known {{at the time as}} Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's {{defense was}} ranked No. 43 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the {{conclusion}} of the regular season. The Seminoles allowed 356.36 yards per game, on average. State's rushing defense was ranked No. 32 (126 ypg), while its passing defense was ranked No. 76 (230.36 ypg). The Seminoles' defensive squad was led by middle linebacker Bradley Jennings, who had 121 tackles during the regular season—the most on the team. Defensive tackle Darnell Dockett also was a standout performer statistically for the Seminoles, leading the team in tackles for loss and setting the single-season and single-game Florida State records in that category.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Wales, Beadles played for his local side Newtown during the 1919–20 season, winning the Montgomeryshire & District Football League. The {{following}} year, he moved to Merseyside, where he turned out for amateur team Graysons of Garston of the West Cheshire Association Football League, an amateur side that represented a local shipping company, whilst also working for the company. Beadles often commented on his role at the company to family members, believing he was only employed due to his footballing skills as he would spend most working days making tea. In June 1921, he signed for Liverpool, {{one of the leading}} teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the time, along with teammate Danny Shone.|$|E
5|$|The Manila Storm are the city's rugby {{league team}} {{training}} at Rizal Park (Luneta Park) and playing their matches at Southern Plains Field, Calamba, Laguna.

The stadium hosts games of Baseball Philippines; Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth were the first players to score a home run at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2, 1934. Another popular sport in the city are cue sports, and billiard halls are a feature in most barangays. The 2010 World Cup of Pool was held at Robinsons Place Manila.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have been exposed to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the time is suspected to have been exposed to these agents.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{remained}} {{much the}} same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the topmast of the , {{one of the first}} iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} squad was more highly {{regarded}} than its defense. Overall, Virginia Tech was 14th nationally in net punting and 37th in kickoff returns. Punter Jimmy Kibble was the No. 10 player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> his position, averaging 45.1 yards per kick {{during the regular}} season. Because of Virginia Tech's success at blocking kicks—the Hokies blocked seven during the season—North Carolina made a special effort to prepare for Virginia Tech's kick blockers on special teams. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham set Big East single-season records for field goals made (19) and points scored by kicking (92) during the season. He was 35 of 36 on extra points and 19 for 23 on field goals, but caught the flu prior to the Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could have expected to earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> large.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Sooners {{competed with}} a {{relatively}} young team. Oklahoma listed 72players on the roster and only nine of them were scholarship seniors. Following the dismissal of quarterback Rhett Bomar, fifth-year senior Paul Thompson reconverted back to his former role of quarterback after spending 2005 as a wide receiver. Junior college transfer Joey Halzle was slotted as his backup. Thompson had several wide receivers to look to in 2006, including Malcolm Kelly, Manuel Johnson, and Juaquin Iglesias. Not to mention junior Adrian Peterson, the team's main running back. Most of the Sooners' experience {{was on the other}} side of the ball. The Sooner linebackers were the most experienced players on the team. The squad was anchored by Rufus Alexander and Zach Latimer. Alexander was ranked as the third best linebacker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the season by College Football News. Behind them were other key players such as Demarrio Pleasant and Lewis Baker. Sophomore Ryan Reynolds, a notable player coming out of high school, was injured in the preseason and therefore was unable to contribute in 2006. In addition to a veteran linebacker squad, Oklahoma had a number of big-name defensive ends. During the preseason, College Football News ranked Larry Birdine, Calvin Thibodeaux and C.J. Ah You in the top 25 best defensive ends for the 2006 season (ranked 14th, 20th, and 22nd, respectively). Oklahoma was the only team with three players in the top 25.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May, Falke {{arrived in}} Port of Spain in Trinidad before being ordered {{to the coast}} of Venezuela to {{safeguard}} German interests {{during a period of}} unrest there. While en route, she stopped in Fort-de-France, Martinique to pick up a load of food and medical supplies for the people living around Mont Pelee, which had recently erupted. She then proceeded to La Guaira and Carúpano in Venezuela to protect German nationals from expected fighting, and from June evacuated German and French nationals from the two cities to Saint Thomas. She was based out of the port of Charlotte Amalie in the Virgin Islands. During this period, she made stops in Carúpano, La Guaira, and Puerto Cabello, along with a visit to Willemstad in Curaçao. On 30 September, she was sent to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to protect German nationals there during a revolution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>At</b> times, landing parties had to be sent ashore to protect the German consulate in Gonaïves.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the piece is {{outstanding}} and {{comparable to that of}} the artefacts found at the famous Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. Its design is unique and has no known parallels elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon jewelcrafting; its creator must {{have been one of the}} best craftworkers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the time. Its shape is a significant link with early Christianity. The scallop had long been associated with love, fertility and birth and was a symbol of the classical goddesses Aphrodite and her Roman counterpart Venus, who was said to have floated ashore on a scallop shell (as in Sandro Botticelli's famous depiction of The Birth of Venus). By the 4th century, however, Christians had adopted the scallop as a symbol of rebirth through baptism and life as a journey towards a heavenly reunion with God. It came to be particularly associated with pilgrimages and was later adopted as a pilgrim's badge.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Goble and Williams {{was such that}} it was later alleged that {{government}} practice was {{to ensure that they}} were never <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the same time. In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain for a naval co-operation course; his place on the Air Board was taken by Squadron Leader Bill Anderson. Goble married Kathleen Wodehouse in London on Anzac Day, 1922, and returned to Australia later that year. His first term as CAS began when Williams left the country in December 1922 for study in England. Goble developed a plan to establish a small seaplane base at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney, but Williams cancelled this shortly after he returned to Australia in February 1925 to resume the position of CAS. Goble's suggestion of a separate Fleet Air Arm fostered suspicions that he was too closely aligned with naval interests. He departed for England to undertake study at the British Army Staff College in Camberley and RAF Staff College, Andover, as Williams had done two years before. Goble also served as Air Liaison Officer with the Australian High Commission in London from May 1926 to September 1927. He was promoted to group captain on 1 April 1928.|$|E
5|$|The two stands {{which were}} not altered after the fire were both {{improved}} during the 1990s. The Bradford end of the ground was made a double-decker, all-seater stand, with a new scoreboard, in 1991. City's promotion to Division One in 1996 meant that chairman Geoffrey Richmond announced {{the construction of a}} 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. It was first used for a Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United on Boxing Day 1996, before being officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 March 1997. Richmond continued his plans to redevelop the ground as City continued to rise through the league. The roof of the Kop, which was the largest safe-standing terrace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> the time, was removed and the capacity reduced during City's 1998–99 promotion season, to prepare for a summer £6.5million rebuilding programme. The Kop was converted into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. An additional 2,300-seat capacity corner section was built, which filled in the corner between the main stand and Kop. When opened in December 2000 it took the capacity of Valley Parade to more than 20,000 {{for the first time since}} 1970. A suite of offices and a shop were added at the same time. Once the work was completed, a second tier was added to the main stand at the cost of £6.5million. It was opened in 2001, increasing the main stand's capacity to 11,000, and the ground's capacity to 25,000.|$|E
