2500|$|On 11 July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued a}} {{regulation}} requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements. The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board, even {{for companies that}} petitioned for extensions, on 1 January 2008. However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5grams per serving can be listed as 0grams trans fat on the food label. According to {{a study published in}} the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. In fact, without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at risk for heart disease, may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel. The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as [...] "trans fat free" [...] or [...] "low trans fat", as they could not determine a [...] "recommended daily value". Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods. However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on <b>institutional</b> <b>food</b> packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{regulation}} {{in the food}} safety domain {{has been in the}} form of mandatory, inflexible food safety controls that are applied to firms. There has been a trend away from this regulatory paradigm towards more co-regulation and self-regulation by industry. This paper investigates the potential for systemic failure in the provision of safe food that might arise as a consequence of this new regulatory paradigm. These systemic failures occur owing {{to the fact that the}} food safety outcome depends on the behaviour of the three sets of agents (firms, consumers and the regulator). These populations of agents have generally been treated in the literature as homogeneous in terms of their behaviour and strategies. Further, the actions taken by any one agent are assumed to be independent of those taken by others. The institutional economics model that is developed assumes heterogeneity and inter-agent strategic interactions. Given this (more realistic) depiction of behaviour, instances of potential regulatory inefficiencies arise. In particular, the model challenges the trend towards voluntarism and self-regulation. co-regulation, strategic behaviour, food safety, ex ante regulation, <b>institutional</b> economics, <b>Food</b> Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, <b>Institutional</b> and Behavioral Economics,...|$|R
