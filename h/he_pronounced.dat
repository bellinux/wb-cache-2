5|$|After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's {{shirt and}} found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> the wound mortal.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer {{wrote a letter to the}} king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E

25|$|Some {{common themes}} appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with {{outspread}} fingers {{indicated that the}} dead man was descended from priestly stock (Kohanim) who blessed {{the people in this}} fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the Levites as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> the blessing.|$|E
25|$|The second great {{influence}} on Bracton's thinking was William Raleigh, {{also known as}} William de Raley, a native of Devon. He was a resident in and around Bratton Fleming in 1212, when Bracton was born there. Raleigh was a justice of the bench in 1228. In 1234 <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though {{he was not a}} justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 {{he was elected to the}} See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He had much to do with the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons to change the law of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton that we get the majority of the history of the law at this time. Bracton is thought to have had a notebook with 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} accounts and traditions concerning {{the arrival of}} Jews in various regions in Southern Arabia. One tradition suggests that King Solomon sent Jewish merchant marines to Yemen to prospect for gold and silver with which to adorn his Temple in Jerusalem. In 1881, the French vice consulate in Yemen wrote to {{the leaders of the}} Alliance (the Alliance Israelite Universelle) in France, that he read in a book by the Arab historian Abu-Alfada that the Jews of Yemen settled in the area in 1451BC. Another legend says that Yemeni tribes converted to Judaism after the Queen of Sheba's visit to king Solomon. The Sanaite Jews have a tradition that their ancestors settled in Yemen forty-two years before the destruction of the First Temple. It is said that under the prophet Jeremiah some 75,000 Jews, including priests and Levites, traveled to Yemen. Another legend states that when Ezra commanded the Jews to return to Jerusalem they disobeyed, whereupon <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> a ban upon them. According to this legend, as a punishment for this hasty action, Ezra was denied burial in Israel. As a result of this local tradition, which can not be validated historically, it is said that no Jew of Yemen gives the name of Ezra to a child, although all other Biblical appellatives are used. The Yemenite Jews claim that Ezra cursed them to be a poor people for not heeding his call. This seems to have come true in the eyes of some Yemenites, as Yemen is extremely poor. However, some Yemenite sages in Israel today emphatically reject this story as myth, if not outright blasphemy.|$|E

500|$|As farms failed, {{many young}} people {{migrated}} from farms to Alberta's cities, where the situation was scarcely better. [...] As the unemployment rate rose, so did labour militancy. [...] December 1932 saw a [...] "hunger march", {{in which more than}} a thousand unemployed men and women attempted to hold a protest march to the Alberta legislature. [...] Brownlee requested the Edmonton city government to prohibit such a display. While <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> himself sympathetic to the workers' ordeal, he said he felt such an event would create a volatile atmosphere that would breed radicalism and communism. [...] It was through this lens that he had viewed the 1932 founding of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Though many UFA members supported this new party, which saw itself as a partnership between farmers and labourers, Brownlee considered it dangerously socialist. When the Hunger March-ers attempted to go ahead without government sanction and were brutally dispersed by Mounties and Edmonton city police, Brownlee took much of the blame.|$|E
500|$|In August 1765, he reprised his pen name [...] "Humphrey Ploughjogger" [...] {{and contributed}} four {{articles}} to the Boston Gazette (republished in The London Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America, {{also known as}} A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law). He delivered a speech in December before the governor and council in which <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> the Stamp Act invalid {{on the ground that}} Massachusetts had not given its assent to it, being without representation in Parliament. He later observed that many protests were sparked by an oft-reprinted sermon of Boston minister Jonathan Mayhew, invoking Romans 13 to justify insurrection. In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected John Adams as a selectman. [...] Adams strongly supported the right of all Americans to jury trials. Adams protested the 1765 passage of the Stamp Act, which gave jurisdiction to British Vice Admiralty Courts, rather than common law courts. [...] Many colonists, including Adams, believed these courts, which operated without a jury, were corrupt and unfair.|$|E
500|$|Unemployment bred labour militancy. In December 1930, Brownlee asked John Lymburn, his attorney-general, {{to prepare}} a list of known Communist leaders so he could arrange for their {{deportation}} where possible. [...] He staunchly opposed the activities of organizations that he viewed as communist, including the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association and the Farmers' Unity League. [...] In December 1932, labour organizers staged a [...] "Hunger March", at which 1,000 unemployed met in Edmonton's Market Square and marched to the legislature building. [...] Brownlee refused to grant permission for the march and requested and received police assistance in breaking it up. [...] While <b>he</b> <b>pronounced</b> himself willing {{to meet with a}} delegation of the march's leaders, he believed that the atmosphere at the march would be dangerously volatile and refused to address it. [...] One participant said [...] "A lot of us understood that [...] couldn't do too much, but we figured since it's a farmers' government, least he can do is come out and explain.

500|$|To do this, every able-bodied Athenian male {{would be}} {{required}} to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon Athens. Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly {{one of the highlights of}} Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: [...] "What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases <b>he</b> <b>pronounced,</b> we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles' audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded." [...] His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.|$|E
