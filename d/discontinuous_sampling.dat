40|$|Wound {{healing of}} soft tissue and bone defects {{is a complex}} process in which {{cellular}} differentiation and adaption are regulated by internal and external factors, among them are many different proteins. In contrast to insights into the significance of various single proteins based on model systems, the knowledge about the processes at the actual site of wound healing is still limited. This {{is caused by a}} general lack of methods that allow sampling of extracellular factors, metabolites, and proteins in situ. Sampling of wound fluids in combination with proteomics and metabolomics is one of the promising approaches to gain comprehensive and time resolved data on effector molecules. Here, we describe an approach to sample metabolites by microdialysis and to extract proteins simultaneously by adsorption. With this approach it is possible (i) to collect, enrich, and purify proteins for a comprehensive proteome analysis; (ii) to detect more than 600 proteins in different defects including more than 100 secreted proteins, of which many proteins have previously been demonstrated to have diagnostic or predictive power for the wound healing state; and (iii) to combine continuous sampling of cytokines and metabolites and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>sampling</b> of larger proteins to gain complementary information of the same defect...|$|E

We use the results of Monte Carlo simulations {{to account for the}} biases introduced by the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>sampling</b> and the low-count regime. We confirm that variability is a ubiquitous property of AGNs, with no clear dependence on the density of the environment. The variability properties of high-z AGNs, over different temporal time-scales, are most consistent with a power spectral density (PSD) described by a broken (or bending) power law, similar to nearby AGNs. We confirm the presence of an anticorrelation between luminosity and variability, resulting from the dependence of variability on black hole (BH) mass and accretion rate. We explore different models, finding that our acceptable solutions predict that BH mass influences the value of the PSD break frequency, while the lambda(Edd) ington ratio lambda(Edd) affects the PSD break frequency and, possibly, the PSD amplitude as well. We derive the evolution of the average. Edd as a function of redshift, finding results in agreement with measurements based on different estimators. The large statistical uncertainties make our results consistent with a constant Eddington ratio, although one of our models suggest a possible increase of lambda(Edd) with lookback time up to z similar to 2 - 3. We conclude that variability is a viable mean to trace the accretion history of supermassive BHs, whose usefulness will increase with future, wide-field/large effective area X-ray missions...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Fargesia decurvata {{is closely}} allied with F. dracocephala and differs in 5 major {{characters}} (i. e. the culm sheath blade base shape, {{the width of}} the culm sheath blade base, the auricle shape, and the lower surface of leaf blade) in Fargesia.

The aims of this paper are to (i) investigate whether the variation of the characters is continuous or not; (ii) reveal whether the publishment of F. dracocephala was the result of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>sampling</b> of F. decurvata or not. Methods: Ten populations of F. decurvata and F. dracocephala were investigated in their entire distribution (including type localities). The statements of 5 major characters were measured from 693 annual and 693 perennial culms of 231 individuals in 10 populations, and analyzed at population, individual and culm levels. UPGMA cluster analysis was carried out based on 29 characters from 10 populations of F. decurvata and F. dracocephala and 2 populations of F. qinlingensis as outgroup. The ITS sequences were also sequenced and analyzed. Important Findings: Five major characters exhibited great variation not only at population level, but at individual level within a population, even the culm level within an individual and {{in different parts of the}} same culm.

40|$|The {{canonical}} transient receptor potential channel subfamily (TRPC 3, TRPC 6, and TRPC 7) contains Ca 2 + permeable non-selective cation {{channels that}} are widely {{expressed in a}} variety of tissues. There is increasing evidence implicating TRPC channels, particularly TRPC 3 and 6, in physiological and pathophysiological processes, eliciting interest in these channels as novel drug targets. Electrophysiology remains a benchmark technique for measuring ion channel function and accurately determining the pharmacological effects of compounds. In this report we describe the development of TRPC inhibitor assays on 2 automated planar patch clamp platforms - the IonWorks® Quattro™ and QPatch® systems. To enable activation of TRPC channels by carbachol, Chinese Hamster Ovary-K 1 cells stably expressing the muscarinic M 3 receptor were transduced with human TRPC 3, TRPC 6, or TRPC 7 using BacMam viruses. TRPC 3, 6, and 7 currents could be recorded on both platforms. However, the design of each platform limits which assay parameters can be recorded. Due to its continuous recording capabilities, the QPatch can capture both the activation and decay of the response. However, the transient nature of TRPC channels, the inability to reactivate and the large variation in peak currents limits the ability to develop assays for compound screening. The IonWorks Quattro, due to its <b>discontinuous</b> <b>sampling,</b> did not fully capture the peak of TRPC currents. However, due to the ability of the IonWorks Quattro to record from 64 cells per well, the variation from well to well was sufficiently reduced allowing for the development of medium-throughput screening assays. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014...|$|E

Field effect measurements performed at low temperature using MOS-like devices exhibited an unexpected symmetrical effect, the InOx channel conductance G increasing when small gate fields of either sign were applied. Moreover these G(Vg) characteristics (where Vg is the gate voltage) were shown to relax very slowly (over hours) after Vg or T were changed. These effects have been attributed to a glassy state of the electrons, promoted by the disorder and the electron correlations.

40|$|The use of futures {{contracts}} as {{hedging instruments}} to reduce risk {{has been the}} focus of much research. Various risk measures have been developed and have subsequently been employed in an effort to create hedging strategies and to calculate optimal hedge ratios. This thesis proposes a more generalized risk model to measure the risk of hedged assets. The five-parameter model presented herein assumes that each investor has a different target return, level of risk aversion, and degree of sensitivity to lower and higher partial moments. The optimal hedging activity for each investor should then seek to minimize the unique generalized risk measure. This paper utilizes an out-of-sample test on a hedged position in the S&P 500 index in the period from December 1982 to December 2004. Tests are conducted to determine whether the change of target returns and sensitivity parameters will affect optimal hedge ratios. In addition, whether hedging effectiveness changes significantly in-sample versus out-of-sample, and between each model and a naïve hedging strategy is investigated. Also, mean returns of hedged portfolios are compared for various models. This thesis makes three important contributions. First, this study is the first to implement both higher and lower partial moments in the determination of optimal hedge ratios.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} darning of general {{symmetric}} Markov processes by shorting {{some parts of}} the state space into singletons. A natural way to construct such processes is via Dirichlet forms restricted to the function space whose members take constant values on these collapsing parts. They include as a special case Brownian motion with darning, which has been studied in details in Chen, CF, CFR. When the initial processes have <b>discontinuous</b> <b>sample</b> paths, the processes constructed in this paper are the genuine extensions of those studied in Chen and Fukushima CF. We further show that, up to a time change, these Markov processes with darning can be approximated in the finite dimensional sense by introducing additional large intensity jumps among these compact sets to be collapsed into singletons to the original Markov processes. For diffusion processes, it is also possible to get, up to a time change, diffusions with darning by increasing the conductance on these compact sets to infinity. To accomplish these, we extend the semigroup characterization of Mosco convergence to closed symmetric forms whose domain of definition may not be dense in the L^ 2 -space. The latter is of independent interest and potentially useful to study convergence of Markov processes having different state spaces. Indeed, we show in Section 5 of this paper that Brownian motion in a plane with a very thin flag pole can be approximated by Brownian motion in the plane with a vertical cylinder whose horizontal motion on the cylinder is a circular Brownian motion moving at fast speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaf area index}} (LAI) {{is defined}} as the one-side leaf area per unit ground area, and is {{probably}} the most widely used index to characterize grapevine vigor. However, LAI varies spatially within vineyard plots. Mapping and quantifying this variability is very important for improving management decisions and agricultural practices. In this study, a mobile terrestrial laser scanner (MTLS) was used to map the LAI of a vineyard, and then to examine how different scanning methods (on-the-go or <b>discontinuous</b> systematic <b>sampling)</b> may affect the reliability of the resulting raster maps. The use of the MTLS allows calculating the enveloping vegetative area of the canopy, which is the sum of the leaf wall areas for both sides of the row (excluding gaps) and the projected upper area. Obtaining the enveloping areas requires scanning from both sides one meter length section along the row at each systematic sampling point. By converting the enveloping areas into LAI values, a raster map of the latter can be obtained by spatial interpolation (kriging). However, the user can opt for scanning on-the-go in a continuous way and compute 1 -m LAI values along the rows, or instead, perform the scanning at <b>discontinuous</b> systematic <b>sampling</b> within the plot. An analysis of correlation between maps indicated that MTLS can be used discontinuously in specific sampling sections separated by up to 15 m along the rows.

Firstly, all factors of market orientation and creativity have positive influence upon new product performance. Secondly, in terms of the relationship between market orientation and creativity and new product performance, the results showed significant differences between continuous innovation and <b>discontinuous</b> innovation <b>samples.</b> Based on the findings, implications and direction...|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{started at}} Compass Point Studios in July 1980. The album's creation required {{the use of}} additional musicians, particularly extra percussionists. TalkingHeads used the working title Melody Attack throughout the studio process after watching a Japanese game show of the same name. Harrison has commented that the ambition was to blend rock and African genres, rather than simply imitate African music. Eno's production techniques and personal approach were key to the record's conception. The process was geared to promote the expression of instinct and spontaneity without overtly focusing on {{the sound of the}} final product. Sections and instrumentals were recorded one at a time in a <b>discontinuous</b> process. <b>Samples</b> and loops played a key part at a time when computer programs could not yet adequately perform such functions. The band's performances and jam sessions acted as sampling and looping mechanisms. Eno has compared the creative process to [...] "looking out to the world and saying, 'What a fantastic place we live in. Let's celebrate it.'" ...|$|R
40|$|The optimal rate of {{convergence}} of estimators of the integrated volatility, for a <b>discontinuous</b> Itô semimartingale <b>sampled</b> at regularly spaced times and over a fixed time interval, has been a long-standing problem, at least when the jumps are not summable. In this paper, we study this optimal rate, in the minimax sense and for appropriate "bounded" nonparametric classes of semimartingales. We show that, if the rth powers of the jumps are summable for some r∈[0, 2), the minimax rate is equal to (√(n),(n n) ^(2 -r) / 2), where n {{is the number of}} observations.
