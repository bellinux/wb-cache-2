40|$|AbstractEU Member States are in {{the process}} of {{transposing}} European regulatory requirements that define the high-level conditions of a storage permit into their national laws. This regulatory framework defines a range of performance standards which recognise specific high-level uncertainties and long-term issues which storage developers will have to address. However, with one or two notable exceptions, the level of site characterisation required to obtain a storage permit has not been systematically evaluated. To determine the required geological site characterisation necessary to demonstrate adequate understanding of site performance, two storage case studies identify those issues that might remain challenging in the permitting process. These case studies, an onshore aquifer and an offshore multi-store site, produce credible dry-run storage permit applications from site geological characterisation activities, which are evaluated by a separate team, acting as a regulator. The applications, though necessarily reduced in scope from those anticipated for full storage projects, comprise the key elements of a permit. Issues identified during this process include:•Defining the storage complex boundaries, which for certain sites may be challenging, especially where expected pressure responses may extend for some distance or where lateral boundaries may not be clearly defined. We present examples of how these regulatory boundaries have been defined for the two case studies. •Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include a range of metrics against which site performance can be measured, both during the operational and closure phases, providing a basis for the design of the <b>geological</b> <b>monitoring</b> program and the corrective measures plan. Defining qualitative terms such as ‘expected’ or ‘acceptable’ in appropriate quantitative metrics has been attempted for site ‘sufficient’ measured, both during the operational and closure phases, providing a basis for the design of the <b>geological</b> <b>monitoring</b> program and the corrective measures plan-specific KPIs in the case studies described.

40|$|Mathematical {{hydrogeology}} {{model of}} the territory of Kowsar Project was created with account {{for the results of}} the engineering surveys and hydro <b>geological</b> <b>monitoring,</b> which was conducted in the process of Kowsar Project construction. In order to create the model in the present work a universal computer system Ansys was used, which implements the finite element method and solid modeling technology, allowing to solve the filtration problem with the use of thermal analogy. The three-dimensional geometric model was built with use of the principle “hard body” modeling, which displays the main line of the territory relief, including the created water reservoir, geological structure (anticline Duk) and the main lithological complexes developed within the territory. In the limestone mass As here is a zone characterized by water permeability on territory of Kowsar Project, and a layer characterized by seepage feeding, which occurs outside the considered territory. The water reservoir is a source of the change of hydro geological situation. The results of field observations witness, that the levels of underground waters within the area of the main structures reacts almost instantly on the water level change in the water reservoir; the delay period of levels change is not more than 1, 5 … 2, 0 weeks at maximum distance from the water reservoir. These particularities of the hydro geological regime allow using the steady-state scheme of the decision of forecast problems. The mass of limestone As, containing the structures of the Kowsar Project, is not homogeneous and anisotropy in its seepage characteristics. The heterogeneity is conditioned by exogenous influence on the mass up to the depth of 100 … 150 m. The seepage anisotropy of the mass is expressed by the difference of water permeability of the mass along and across the layers for almost one order. The structures of Kowsar Project is presented by a dam, grouting curtain on axis of the dam and consolidation curtain in its both banks, drainage structures. Underground waters of the territory are formed by infiltration. They unload in river Heirabad. In accordance with this circumstance, the northwest (the right bank) and the south-east (the left bank) hydro geological borders of the model are the borders with constant discharge seepage, entering from the area of the feeding in the area of unloading. The borders are distanced from the river on 2, 5 km. In accordance with the regional direction of the flow of underground waters, the model is limited {{along the lines of the}} current (the impervious borders) at northeast (upwards on river) and south-west (down on river). Those borders are distanced from river on 2, 2 … 2, 3 km. As a result, the area of model is 28 km. Aroofing of almost watertight marls of the retinue Pb is the bottom border of the model. Theinternal borders are presented by the river Heirabad, the water reservoir and the drainage structures. The calibration of the model was conducted at the reservoir water mark of 580 m and 606 … 610 m. The correctness criterion of the decision had shown the convergence of the obtained values of discharge level of underground waters with the data of natural observations. In the process of calibration the revision of the input data was carried out - a seepage characteristic of thick limestone mass As and discharge, entering from the right and left bank borders of the model. The forecast calculation was performed for water reservoir level of 620 m. The creation of water reservoir has influenced the seepage regime of the territory by the area of more than 25 km. As a result of the buttress of the natural inflow there occurred the redistribution of the natural inflow and change of the direction of the natural inflow that has caused the appearance of springs in downstream of dam near the contact of the series As-Gs. The design inflow of underground waters in the river Heirabad on the area from dam up to the contact of the suites As and Gs in downstream is 2, 4 … 2, 6 m /s including springs. The share of the direct seepage from water reservoir forms ~ 40 % of this values, the rest 60 % correspond to the unload natural inflow redistributed as a result of buttress. It is possible to define the level and discharges of underground waters on the territory of hydro unit under any elevation of water reservoir with the help of the created geo seepage model. The model can be used for effectiveness evaluation of the grouting curtain in the operation period...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} to {{complete}} {{the description of the}} special mapping method which theoretical basis and principles were published in [Seminsky, 2014]. With reference to data on the Ulirba site located in Priolkhonie (Western Pribaikalie), the content of special mapping is reviewed in detail. The method is based on paragenetical analysis of abundant jointing which specific feature is the lack of any visible displacement indicators. There are three stages in the special mapping method (Fig. 3) as follows: Stage I: Preparation and analysis of previously published data on the regional fault structure (Fig. 1, А–Г), establishment of a networks of stations to conduct structural <b>geological</b> <b>monitoring</b> and mass measurements of joints, re­cord of rock data (Fig. 2, А), general state of the fault network (Fig. 1, Д–З), fracture density (Fig. 2, Б) and, if any, structures of the above-jointing level (Fig. 1, Е, З; Fig. 2, А). Stage II is aimed at processing of field data and includes activities in four groups (II. 1 –II. 4) as follows: Group II. 1 : construction of circle diagrams, specification of characteristics of joint systems and their typical scatters (Fig. 4, А), identification of simple (generally tipple) paragenesises, and determination of dynamic settings of their formation (translocal rank) (Table 1), evaluation of densities and complexity of the joint networks, analysis of their spacial patterns within the site under mapping, and identification of the most intensively destructed zones in the rock massif (Fig. 2, Б–В). Group II. 2 : comparison of jointing diagrams with reference ones showing joint poles (Fig. 4, Б–В; Е–З; Л–Н), and, in case of their satisfactory correlation, making a conclusion of potential formation of a specific joint pattern in the local zone of strike-slip, normal faulting or reverse faulting (Fig. 4,  Г–Д, И–К, О–П; Fig. 5; Fig. 7, Б), and determination of relative age relationships between such zones on the basis analysis of the scatter of joint systems, shearing angles and other relevant information. Group II. 3 : construction of a circle diagram for the specified mapping site with local fault poles (Fig. 8, Б), identification of conjugated systems and dynamic settings of their formation (Fig. 2), plotting the information onto the schematic map of the location under study, and marking the transregional fault zones (Fig. 7, В–К) with observation sites showing similar settings and paragenesises of local faults. Group II. 4 : comparison between diagrams of fault poles of local ranks with reference patterns selected according to the availability of conjugated pairs of fractures (Fig. 9, Б–Г); based on the above comparison, decision making on potential formation of a paragenesis of local faults in the strike-slip, normal and reserve/thrust fault zones (Fig. 9, Д–Ж), and delineation of boundaries of such zones in the schematic map by connecting the observation sites with similar solutions (Fig. 7, Л–Н). Stage III is aimed at interpreting and includes comprehensive analyses of mapping results and priori information, construction of a final scheme of the fault zones showing their subordination by ranks (Fig. 7, О) and schemes of fault zones for various structure formation stages, showing types of faults and specific features of their internal patterns, i. e. definition of the peripheral sub-zone, sub-zones of fractures of the 2 nd order and, if established, the sub-zone of the major fault (Fig. 7, Л–Н). Prospects of the special mapping method can be highlighted upon its comparison with the conventional structural methods applied in studies of faults. On the one side, the method requires time-consuming mass mea­surements and special processing of 'dumb' joints; on the other side, it provides for analyses of abundant jointing data, ensures a high level of detail in mapping of patterns of fault zones, reveals rank subordination of faults and helps to determine other specific features of fractures and faults. Hence, a conventional study of sites with evident tectonics can be based on traditional structural methods, while the special mapping method is recommendable as an additional means of analyses providing information on specific elements of the fault patterns, including establishment of the internal zoning of faults, hierarchy of dynamic settings of faulting etc. In cases when direct observation of faults is limited as the study area is poorly outcropped, or in case of specialized studies such as drilling of wells, the special mapping method can be most useful when applied in its full scope. With account of its specific features, this method is a promising tool for solution of theoretical problems related to studies of divisibility of the Earth's crust into zones and blocks and researches of regularities in development of fault zones in space and time. It can be useful for application-oriented surveys in geology, ore geology, engineering geology and hydrogeology that require detailed mapping of fault zones controlling many associated processes of key importance. </p...|$|E
