40|$|Objective—To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} a single dose of <b>ibutilide,</b> a new class III antiarrhythmic drug, with that of DL-sotalol in terminating chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter in haemodynamically stable patients.  Design—Double blind, randomised study.  Setting— 43 European hospitals.  Patients— 308 patients (mean age 60  years, 70 % men, 48 % with heart disease) with sustained atrial fibrillation (n =  251) or atrial flutter (n =  57) (duration three hours to 45  days) were randomised to three groups to receive a 10  minute infusion of 1  mg <b>ibutilide</b> (n =  99), 2  mg <b>ibutilide</b> (n =  106), or 1. 5  mg/kg DL-sotalol (n =  103). Infusion was discontinued at termination of the arrhythmia.  Main outcome measure—Successful conversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter, defined as termination of arrhythmia within one hour of treatment.  Results—Both drugs were more effective against atrial flutter than against atrial fibrillation. <b>Ibutilide</b> was superior to DL-sotalol for treating atrial flutter (70 % and 56 % v 19 %), while the high dose of <b>ibutilide</b> was more effective for treating atrial fibrillation than DL-sotalol (44 % v 11 %) and the lower dose of <b>ibutilide</b> (44 % v 20 %, p <  0. 01). The mean (SD) time to arrhythmia termination was 13  (7) minutes with 2  mg <b>ibutilide,</b> 19  (15) minutes with 1 mg <b>ibutilide,</b> and 25  (17) minutes with DL-sotalol. In all patients, the duration of arrhythmia before treatment was a predictor of arrhythmia termination, although this was less obvious in the group that received 2  mg <b>ibutilide.</b> This dose converted almost 48 % of atrial fibrillation that was present for more than 30  days. Concomitant use of digitalis or nifedipine and prolongation of the QTc interval were not predictive of arrhythmia termination.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This multicenter study {{compared}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>ibutilide</b> versus procainamide for conversion of recent-onset atrial flutter or fibrillation. Background. <b>Ibutilide</b> fumarate is an intravenous (IV) class III antiarrhythmic agent that {{has been shown to}} be significantly more effective than placebo in the pharmacologic conversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Procainamide is commonly used for conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. Methods. One hundred twenty-seven patients (age range 22 to 92 years) with atrial flutter or fibrillation of 3 h to 90 days’ (mean 21 days) duration were randomized to receive either two 10 -min IV infusions of 1 mg of <b>ibutilide</b> fumarate, separated by a 10 -min infusion of 5 % dextrose in sterile water, or three successive 10 -min IV infusions of 400 mg of procainamide hydrochloride. Results. Of the 127 patients, 120 were evaluated for efficacy: 35 (58. 3 %) of 60 in the <b>ibutilide</b> group compared with 11 (18. 3 %) of 60 in the procainamide group had successful termination within 1. 5 h of treatment (p < 0. 0001). Seven patients were found to have violated the protocol and were not included in the final evaluation. In the patients with atrial flutter, <b>ibutilide</b> had a significantly higher success rate than procainamide (76 % [13 of 17] vs. 14 % [3 of 22], p = 0. 001). Similarly, in the atrial fibrillation group, <b>ibutilide</b> had a significantly higher success rate than procainamide (51 % [22 of 43] vs. 21 % [8 of 38], p = 0. 005).

Seven patients who received procainamide became hypotensive. Conclusions. This study establishes the superior efficacy of <b>ibutilide</b> over procainamide when administered to patients to convert either atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm.

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that conversion of atrial flutter in humans by <b>ibutilide,</b> a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, is characterized by an increase in atrial cycle length variability. Background. Conversion of tachyarrhythmias has been associated with increased oscillations of cycle length. Methods. Electrograms and monophasic action potentials from the fight atrium in 35 patients with spontaneous, sustained atrial flutter were recorded before, during and after intravenous <b>ibutilide</b> (0. 005 to 0. 025 mg/kg body weight, n = 25) or placebo (n = 10). Atrial cycle length, cycle length variability (coefficient of variation), diastolic interval and diastolic interval variability were measured from 10 consecutive cycles at baseline and 3 min before, 1 min before, 30 s before and immediately before conversion. Similar measurements were made in patients who received <b>ibutilide</b> or placebo but did not convert. Results. <b>Ibutilide</b> converted atrial flutter in 14 of 25 patients 25 ± 16 min (mean ± SD) after initiation of the infusion, whereas placebo converted no patients. Atrial cycle length was prolonged to the same extent in <b>ibutilide</b> converters and nonconverters (36 ± 19 vs. 38 ± 21 ms, p = NS) and was not affected by placebo. Beat-to-beat variability in atrial cycle length (baseline 1. 2 ± 0. 7 vs. preconversion 7. 3 ± 4. 9, p < 0. 01) and diastolic interval (baseline 11 ± 8 vs. preconversion 33 ± 23, p < 0. 05) increased significantly just before atrial flutter conversion and remained unchanged in <b>ibutilide</b> nonconverters and placebo group patients.

40|$|Introduction Intravenous <b>ibutilide</b> is used {{to convert}} atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR) due to its Class III antiarrhythmic mechanisms. However, the effects of <b>ibutilide</b> on local electrograms (EGMs) during AF have not been elucidated. Methods and Results We used EGM analysis techniques to characterize how <b>ibutilide</b> administration changes the frequency, morphology, and repeatability of AF EGM signals, thereby providing insight into ibutilide's antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. AF recordings were collected from 21 patients with AF, {{both before and after}} <b>ibutilide</b> administration. The effects of <b>ibutilide</b> on the following AF EGM parameters were assessed: (1) dominant frequency (DF), (2) variations in EGM amplitude and overall morphology, (3) repetition of EGM patterns, and (4) complexity of the AF frequency spectra. When comparing pre- versus post-ibutilide administration EGMs, DF decreased from 5. 45 Hz to 4. 02 Hz (P < 0. 0001). There was an increase in the variability of both AF EGM amplitudes (P = 0. 003) and overall AF EGM morphologies (P = 0. 003). AF EGM pattern repetitiveness decreased (P = 0. 01), and the AF frequency spectral profile manifested greater complexity (P = 0. 02). Conclusions Novel EGM signal analysis techniques reveal that <b>ibutilide</b> administration causes increased complexity in the atrial electrical activation pattern with decreasing rate. These findings may be explained by the progressive destabilization of higher frequency, more homogeneous primary drivers of AF over the course of <b>ibutilide</b> administration, and/or less uniform propagation of atrial activation, until AF maintenance becomes more difficult and either transforms to atrial tachycardia or terminates to SR...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{a common}} cardiac arrhythmia, {{and has been a}} significant financial burden. Class III antiarrhythmics such as dofetilide, <b>ibutilide,</b> and amiodarone are indicated for rhythm control. Magnesium may possess intrinsic antiarrhythmic properties, and may potentially increase the efficacy of class III antiarrhythmics when used concomitantly. Objective: The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the literature on the efficacy of magnesium in addition to Class III antiarrhythmics, specifically amidarone, <b>ibutilide,</b> and dofetilide for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Methods: Databases Pubmed and CINAHL are utilized along with the search terms amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutlide, magnesium, atrial fibrillation, conversion, rhythm control, and cardioversion. Results: One study on dofetilide and 5 studies on <b>ibutilide</b> were identified. No studies were found on amiodarone. Patients with atrial fibrillation who received dofetilide and magnesium had higher rates of successful cardioversion as compared to those who only received dofetilide. Conversion rates were similar between the 2 treatment groups for patients with atrial flutter. As for <b>ibutilide,</b> 4 studies have shown that the addition of magnesium significantly increases conversion rates for patients with atrial fibrillation or typical atrial flutter. Conversion rates were similar for patients with atypical atrial flutter. One study showed that addition of magnesium did not improve efficacy of <b>ibutilide.</b> Higher doses of magnesium (4 g) were associated with improved outcomes. Adverse effects of magnesium were mild and included flushing, tingling, and dizziness. Patients who received magnesium had shorter corrected QT intervals and smaller increase in corrected QT interval from baseline. Compare to previous studies, studies included in this review had higher conversion rates for dofetilide and <b>ibutilide</b> as well as dofetilide and magnesium or <b>ibutilide</b> and magnesium combination therapies. However, only 2 <b>ibutilide</b> studies and 1 dofetilide study reported baseline characteristics such as left atrial size, history of heart failure, and duration of atrial fibrillation, which are significant predictors of successful cardioversion. Therefore, differences in baseline demographics may have influenced the results. Conclusion: Magnesium may be used as adjunct for dofetilide and <b>ibutilide</b> due to potential improved efficacy and minimal toxicity. Dose ranging studies should be conducted in the future to establish the optimal dose and duration of therapy as well as the optimal serum magnesium concentration in order for the clinician to manage and monitor patients appropriately...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{evaluated}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of <b>ibutilide</b> when added to propafenone in treating both paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). BackgroundThe effects of <b>ibutilide</b> in patients with paroxysmal or chronic AF/AFL who were pre-treated with propafenone have not been previously evaluated. MethodsOral propafenone was initially given in 202 patients with AF/AFL without left ventricular dysfunction. Intravenous <b>ibutilide</b> was administered in 104 patients in whom propafenone failed to convert the arrhythmia. Two different propafenone dosage regimens were used according to {{the duration of the}} presenting arrhythmia: patients with paroxysmal arrhythmia (n = 48) received 600 mg loading dose, and patients with chronic arrhythmia (n = 56) were receiving 150 mg three times a day as stable-dose pre-treatment. ResultsIbutilide offered an overall conversion efficacy of 66. 3 % (69 of 104 patients), 70. 8 % for patients with paroxysmal AF/AFL and 62. 5 % for patients with chronic AF/AFL. <b>Ibutilide</b> significantly decreased the heart rate (HR) and further prolonged the QTc interval (p < 0. 0001). The degree of HR reduction after <b>ibutilide</b> administration emerged as the sole predictor of successful arrhythmia termination (p < 0. 001). After <b>ibutilide,</b> one patient (1 %) developed two asymptomatic episodes of non-sustained torsade de pointes, and 10 patients (9. 6 %) manifested transient bradyarrhythmic events; however, all bradyarrhythmic effects were predictable, occurring mostly at the time of arrhythmia termination. None of 82 patients who decided to continue propafenone after successful cardioversion had immediate arrhythmia recurrence.

Including the results after crossover, immediate recurrence of atrial fibrillation occurred in 8 of 12 patients (67 %) who received verapamil, compared to 3 of 16 patients (19 %) who received <b>ibutilide</b> (P= 0. 02). Verapamil and/or <b>ibutilide</b> successfully prevented immediate recurrence of atrial fibrillation in 17 of 20 patients (85 %). After 700 days of fol-low-up, {{there was no significant difference}} in the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation betwee...|$|E
40|$|Verapamil and <b>Ibutilide.</b> Introduction: Early {{recurrence}} of atrial brillation (AF) after cardioversion {{may be related}} to shortening of the atrial effective refractory period (ERP). This study compared the effects of verapamil and <b>ibutilide</b> on AF cycle length (AFCL), atrial ERP, and susceptibility to recurrent AF. Methods and Results: In 33 adults, the atrial ERP was measured at basic drive CLs of 350 and 500 mse...|$|E
