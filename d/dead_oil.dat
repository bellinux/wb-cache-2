However, the gas content of foamy oil is higher than that of saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil.</b> The gas content of foamy oil is 1.11 and 16.9 times higher than that of saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> when the dissolution time and pressure are 20  MPa and 35.22  h, respectively.|$|E
30|$|A {{comparison}} of diffusion coefficients {{of natural gas}} in foamy oil, saturated oil, and <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> {{at the same pressure}} indicates that diffusion coefficients of natural gas in foamy oil are lower than that of gas in saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil.</b> For example, the diffusion coefficients of natural gas in <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> are 3.02 and 4.02 times than that of gas in saturated oil and foamy oil when the pressure is 20  MPa. This is the reason why the cumulative diffusion volume of gas in <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> is larger than that of gas in saturated oil and foamy oil.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{non-linear}} regression method, using relatively a large set of experimental data, new comprehensive correlations for prediction of viscosity of the Iranian heavy and light <b>dead</b> crude <b>oils</b> have been developed. The new models correlate viscosity, °API gravity and temperature for a quite wide range, i. e. 2 - 570 cP for viscosity and 17 - 45 for °API gravity. Absolute average deviation (%AAD) of 19. 5 % and 15. 3 % are achieved for the heavy (°API= 17 ~ 28) and light (°API= 28 ~ 45) crude oils, respectively. A comparison with previous works reveals good prediction {{ability of the}} new correlations for the Iranian <b>dead</b> crude <b>oils...</b>|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analyses}} were conducted randomly for 376 data points of the 30 <b>dead</b> crude <b>oil</b> samples. The results based on these numbers were randomly divided between training and testing parts in a ratio of 3 : 1.|$|R
30|$|From Fig.  11, it is {{observed}} that diffusion coefficients of natural gas in foamy oil, saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> increase linearly with increasing operating pressure. The slope of the straight line for <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> is larger than that for saturated oil and foamy oil. This means that the growth rate of the diffusion coefficient with increasing pressure in foamy oil is less than that in saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
30|$|Pressure had an {{important}} effect on gas diffusion in foamy oil, saturated oil, and <b>dead</b> <b>oil.</b> The cumulative diffusion volumes and gas contents of {{the three types of}} oil increased with an increase in pressure. For gas diffusion in foamy oil, the cumulative diffusion volume at 20  MPa was 4.8 times of that at 8.65  MPa when the diffusion time was 35.22  h. The cumulative diffusion volumes of gas in <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> were larger than that in saturated oil and foamy oil at the same pressure and time. When the dissolution time was 35.22  h, the cumulative dissolution volume of gas in <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> was 1.43 times larger than that in foamy oil, indicating that natural gas has a better diffusion capacity in <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> than in foamy oil. However, the gas content in foamy oil was higher than that in saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil.</b> For example, when the dissolution time and pressure were 35.22  h and 20  MPa, the gas content in foamy oil was 1.11 and 16.93 times higher than that in saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil.</b> This increase is because of the foamy oil system which is a non-equilibrium system and has an amount of trapped gas and solution gas. For this reason, it is harder for natural gas to diffuse into foamy oil.|$|E
30|$|Natural gas {{diffusion}} experiments in saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> {{at the same}} pressures were studied in a similar process except the method to simulate saturated oil and <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> before the diffusion process. The saturated oil was simulated by decreasing the cell pressure from the reservoir pressure to 4.0  MPa, and disengaging the released solution gas from oil by strong agitation in the PVT cell. The <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> was made by decreasing the cell pressure to atmospheric pressure to release all the solution gas in the recombined oil, and then the cell pressure increased to 4.0  MPa.|$|E

40|$|A geochemical {{correlation}} study was undertaken {{to attempt to}} provide further information on the prospectivity of the Deer Lake Basin. Five samples were chosen for the geochemical analyses: of these, three samples were of <b>dead</b> <b>oils</b> (so called "bitumens") and two samples were from the Rocky Brook shales, which were considered source rock. The study confirms that oil has been generated {{in the vicinity of}} the basin and has undergone migration into potential reservoir rocks. The highly degraded oil (bitumen) samples from the Goose Arm road do not yield enough information to allow correlation with source rocks, but the bitum en sample from drillcore in the Howley Formation is less degraded, and is tentatively correlated with the Rocky Brook shale samples, based on isotopic and gas chromatographic results. In general, the terrestrial geochemical character of the Howley bitumen points to its origin from lacustrine algae, given the lack of any landplant-dominated source rocks in the basin. The two Rocky Brook samples are different from each other both in bulk and in isotopic composition, but both are lacustrine in origin...|$|R

This is the first annual progress report submitted to the DOE. It reports on the work completed during the reporting period even if it may have started before this period. This project is a partnership between Professor George J. Hirasaki at Rice University and Professor Kishore Mohanty at University of Houston.

30|$|Recent {{developments}} in improved oil technologies {{have increased the}} demand for heavy oil in the international market. Crude oil is classified as light or heavy oil based on different physical properties, such as molecular weight, viscosity, density, and API gravity. The most common definition of heavy crude oil is crude oil with API gravity less than 20, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and US geological survey (USGS). Viscosity and density play very important roles in oil production, transportation through pipelines, and oil recovery processes. Obtaining reliable viscosity and density measurements can be difficult, especially for live oil. These properties are very important and should be evaluated precisely for reservoir simulation. Measuring the viscosity and the density of <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> is easier using empirical correlations at temperatures other than the reservoir temperatures (Ahrabi et al. 1987). These <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> measurements {{can be used as}} the starting point for live oil viscosity and density predictions. The difficulty and high costs of viscosity and density measurements at reservoir conditions are the main reasons for the lack of such data at other temperatures. Additionally, viscosity and density are important guidelines for numerical simulations to determine the economics of the Enchanted oil recovery (EOR) project and {{the success or failure of}} a given EOR scheme. Consequently, a correlation must estimate these values under different temperatures (Miller 1995). The viscosity of crude oil depends on many factors, such as the source chemical composition (Sattarin et al. 2007). Therefore, developing a comprehensive model of viscosity to include different regions of the world seems to be a very challenging task. Several correlations for predicting <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity are available in the literature. Some of these models are discussed in this paper, such as the Beggs and Robinson (1975) model for temperatures ranging from 21 to 146  °C and the Elsharkawy and Alikhan (1999) model based on crude oil samples from the Middle East for temperatures ranging from 38 to 150  °C. Naseri et al. (2005) presented a model for temperatures ranging from 40 to 146  °C. Other authors suggest that the variation in compositions is why correlating the viscosity of heavy crude with high accuracy is improbable (Beal 1946). Beal created a chart that described the viscosities of 655 <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> samples at 38  °C, representing 492 oil fields around the world and covering viscosities ranging from 0.8 to 155  cP, gravities ranging from 10.1 ° to 52.5 °API and temperatures from 38 to 105  °C. In addition, Kartoatmodjo and Schmidt (1994) developed an empirical correlation to predict the viscosity of <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> with 3588 data points from 661 <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> samples that covered gravities ranging from 14.4 ° to 58.9 °API, viscosities ranging from 0.5 to 682  cP, and temperatures ranging from 75 to 320  °F. Labedi (1992) also correlated the <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity in the range of 0.66 to 4.79  cP and gravity in the range from 32.2 ° to 48.0 °API as a function of API gravity and temperature covering the range from 38 to 152  °C. Using 91 data points, Labedi (1992) claimed that his equation was more accurate than previous efforts (Beal 1946) and (Beggs and Robinson 1975), which might have been true for this tight viscosity range; however, large errors were observed when this model was applied outside of these temperature, viscosity, or API ranges. Hossain et al. (2005) statistically analyzed a data bank covering the <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity range of 22 – 415  cP and the temperature range of 51 to 93  °F for oil samples with gravities in the range of 15.8 ° to 22.3 °API. In this work, a temperature range between 20 C and 160 C was set to perform the experimental measurements of viscosity and density of the <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> samples. This range was chosen because this is the most common range of operation in reservoirs and pre-refinery processes.|$|E

30|$|The {{diffusion}} coefficient {{of natural gas}} in foamy oil {{is one of the}} key parameters to evaluate the feasibility of gas injection for enhanced oil recovery in foamy oil reservoirs. In this paper, a PVT cell was used to measure {{diffusion coefficient}}s of natural gas in Venezuela foamy oil at high pressures, and a new method for determining the diffusion coefficient in the foamy oil was developed on the basis of experimental data. The effects of pressure and the types of the liquid phase on the diffusion coefficient of the natural gas were discussed. The results indicate that the diffusion coefficients of natural gas in foamy oil, saturated oil, and <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> increase linearly with increasing pressure. The diffusion coefficient of natural gas in the foamy oil at 20  MPa was 2.93 times larger than that at 8.65  MPa. The diffusion coefficient of the natural gas in <b>dead</b> <b>oil</b> was 3.02 and 4.02 times than that of the natural gas in saturated oil and foamy oil when the pressure was 20  MPa.

40|$|Abstract: A “common {{knowledge}} ” in petroleum {{science and}} technology is that the bulk properties of a crude oil are monotonic functions of its asphaltene content. However unbiased analysis of world’s crude oil databases reveals common peaking of oil density as well of a frequency of oil appearance at specific asphaltene contents, close to structural phase boundaries observed in asphaltene and oil solutions. Another result of database analysis is a new analytical expression for the general trend of density-asphaltene relationship in world’s recovered (<b>dead)</b> crude <b>oils...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, food {{industrial}} unctuous wastes {{represent a}} serious problem in industrial wastewater treatment processes. As a consequence of their hydrophobic characters, their emission results in dramatic environmental and economical effects. Unctuous materials, depositing in the pipelines, block the waste flow, furthermore reduce {{the efficacy of the}} wastewater treatment. However, bioremediation processes - using microorganisms to degrade these hazardous materials - can provide a solution for this problem. Several rhodococci are able to assimilate many hydrophobic materials converting them into biomass and CO 2. These bacteria use surfactants for making these hydrophobic materials suitable for aqueous bioconversion processes. Additionally, surfactant producing bacteria are capable to decompose many types of hydrocarbons present in diesel <b>oil</b> or <b>dead</b> <b>oils,</b> as well. Rhodococci also have monooxygenase enzymes capable to catalyze the oxidation of numerous hazardous hydrocarbons. Moreover, these strains might harbor lipase enzymes as well, which might help in the degradation of unctuous wastes, such as pig lard or poultry fat. In this study, our aim was to demonstrate the qualitative ability of Rhodococcus sp. strain to degrade unctuous wastes released by food industry and domestic activity. The strain shows high similarity in its physiology to the R. erythropolis PR 4 (NBRC 100887), but apparently of their surfactants are different. Nevertheless, this Rhodococcus sp.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Wax {{deposition}} during {{crude oil}} production {{is a major}} problem that has plagued the oil industry for decades especially in cold environments such as Alaska North Slope (ANS) fields, with adverse consequences in huge mitigation cost and lost production. It is therefore imperative to adequately and accurately identify the conditions for wax precipitation and deposition in order to optimize operation of the production systems of ANS. In order to assess ANS crude's potential for wax precipitation, Viscometry and Cross Polarization Microscopy (CPM) are used to determine the temperature at which paraffins begin to precipitate from ANS <b>dead</b> <b>oils.</b> Wax dissolution temperatures (WDT) are also determined by CPM. Results show that wax precipitation is possible at temperatures as high as 41 °C (106 °F) while it takes up to 50 °C (122 °F) to get all waxes back into solution. The CPM technique was more sensitive while Viscometry results did not provide a high level of certainty in some samples and therefore appear over-estimated relative to CPM results. Previous thermal history was observed to influence test results. Pour point, viscosity, density and specific gravity have also been measured. Pour point results indicate that oil could form gel in the temperature range 12 °C (53. 6 °C) to less than - 31 °C (- 23. 8 °F) ...|$|R
