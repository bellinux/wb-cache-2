5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E

5000|$|The adarga {{was a hard}} leather shield used {{originally}} by the Moors of Spain, {{its name}} derived from the Arabic [...] "al-daraqa" [...] ("shield"). An important center of manufacture of the adarga was the city of Fes, Morocco. The adarga was typically made from the hide of the antelope (probably the Arabian Oryx) and was extremely resistant to the blows of sword, lance and arrow, but other kinds of leather were used as well. Inside, in the center, {{was a pair of}} leather grips held in the hand or strapped to the forearm with a small cushion beneath to absorb impact. Originally the adarga was round, then heart shaped, then finally it took the form of a pair of overlapping ellipses or ovals, measuring 69 - 80 cm in the long axis. Two or more layers of <b>hide</b> were <b>glued</b> and sewn together to make the adarga both rigid and elastic, and often decorated with incised and gilt ornaments, Moorish inscriptions, and metal appliques and borders.|$|R

50|$|The {{artifact}} {{can then}} be inserted into the slit, and fixed to the shaft by tying around the flanges with a suitable material. Materials such as Australian Sea Grass Cordage, and split deer intestine can {{be used due to}} its high strength and durability once installed. Some people will wrap the material around the handle as well to add grip. The main disadvantage with wrapping the tool onto the shaft arises after usage when the fibers lose their tension and become loose. High humidity is also a contributing factor to the fibers losing tension. On occasion, glue is added for extra support. When glue or any other resin is used, the hafting is said to be mastic. Mastic hafts are also very strong and reliable since there is little to no movement of the tool. Glue also has an advantage of absorbing shock when hardened, which helps with cushioning. Back before glue was readily available, people would process deer <b>hide</b> into <b>glue.</b> The main downside of mastic hafts is the time consuming and difficult construction process. Alternatively, the head may simply be forced into the shaft, if the shaft is soft enough, eliminating the need for a slit (and perhaps improving durability). If a strap is used, it is tied directly to the flanges of the artifact.|$|R
500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with <b>hide</b> <b>glue,</b> finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E
500|$|One of four {{surviving}} Bruegel {{paintings in}} distemper, {{the work is}} a tüchlein, a type of light painting that uses tempera made from pigment mixed with water-soluble glue. This medium was widely used in painting and manuscript illumination {{before the advent of}} oil paint. [...] It is not known from whom Bruegel learnt its use, but amongst those speculated are his mother-in-law, illuminator Mayken Verhulst; his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst; and painter and illuminator Giulio Clovio, with whom he resided in Italy and whom he helped paint miniatures in distemper. Due to the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of <b>hide</b> <b>glue,</b> tüchleins do not preserve well and are difficult to restore.

50|$|This {{adhesive}} {{is mostly}} used as glue, sizing, or varnish, {{although it is}} not as frequently used as other adhesives because it is water-soluble. Other aspects, such as difficulty of storage in a wet state, requirement for fresh raw materials (the animal skin cannot be rotten or grease-burned), make this product more difficult to find and use. Factories now produce other forms of adhesives, as the process for animal glue is complex and tricky to follow. Animal glues will also darken with age and shrink as they dry, giving them the potential to harm wood, paper, or works of art. Too much handling and too many changes in temperature or humidity could cause further harm. Some companies, such as those in Canada, still produce animal, <b>hide</b> and hoof <b>glues</b> from horses. Recently, animal glue has been replaced by other adhesives and plastics, but remains popular for restoration.|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{established}} a novel LC–MS method for animal source identification of glue using detection patterns of 12 type I collagen-derived marker peptides. This database-independent approach enables discrimination between eight animals {{regardless of whether}} their type I collagen sequences are known. In addition, our method is applicable not only to simple glue samples but also to samples containing two animal origins. We demonstrated its application in glue certification by detecting undeclared animal species and blends or contamination of different animal origins in commercial glue products. Furthermore, we clarified that both cattle- and sheep-originated animal glues {{were used in the}} ground and size layers of The Harvest. Many studies have investigated glues present in artworks and identified their animal origins using MS [15 – 19]. However, only one glue species was determined for each sample in almost all of the investigations, except for the simultaneous detection of bovine- and fish-specific peptides in a polychromy sample [18]. Our novel method may uncover <b>hidden</b> facts about <b>glue</b> used for artworks, which will be helpful to understand the use of artist’s materials in historic objects. We could not determine the animal source of four commercial products. These were assumed to be derived from more than three animals or other unexpected animals. Species identification under these situations will be an area of future work. We consider that reselection of marker peptides in response to the target animals should lead to successful determination of the animal source for such complicated glue samples.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of glued joints in the instrument use animal <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> rather than common white glue {{for a number}} of reasons. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues, it is reversible (brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force, and removable with very warm water) when disassembly is needed, and since fresh <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> sticks to old <b>hide</b> <b>glue,</b> more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves scraping off some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running {{around the edge of the}} spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, referred to as flame, fiddleback, or tiger stripe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the glue begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may glue the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot <b>hide</b> <b>glue,</b> and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> starts to gel, {{at which point the}} glue becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> pulls the joint together as it hardens.|$|E
50|$|The {{significant}} {{disadvantages of}} <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> - its thermal limitations, short open time, and vulnerability to micro-organisms - are offset by several advantages. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> joints are reversible and repairable. Recently glued joints will release easily with {{the application of}} heat and steam. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> sticks to itself, so the repairer can apply new <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> to the joint and reclamp it. In contrast, PVA glues do not adhere to themselves once they are cured, so a successful repair requires removal of the old glue first - which usually requires removing some of the material being glued.|$|E
5000|$|Animal glue, {{especially}} <b>hide</b> <b>glue,</b> was {{the primary}} adhesive of choice for a great many types of woodworking, including furniture and lutherie, for many centuries. It is manufactured from rendered collagen from the skins (hides) of animals. It is chemically similar to edible gelatin and is non-toxic if ingested. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> is still used today in specialized applications: musical instruments (lutherie), for replica furniture, and for conservation-grade repairs to antique woodwork. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> is measured {{on the basis of}} its gel strength, a measure of how many grams of force it requires to depress a 1/2 in plunger 4 mm into a 12.5% protein solution of the glue at 10 C. Glue is manufactured in standard grades from 32 - 512 g. 192 g strength is the most commonly used for woodworking; 251 g is the highest normally used for instrument building; 135 g is the lowest used for general woodwork. Glue above 250 g strength requires excessive dilution and so leaves too little glue in joints for effective adhesion, so it is not commonly used. Liquid versions of <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> are now available; typically they have urea added to keep the glue liquid at room temperature and to extend drying time. Examples of liquid <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> are Old Brown Glue or Titebond Liquid Hide. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> does not creep. <b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> joints are easy to repair, by just heating and adding more <b>hide</b> <b>glue.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Hide</b> <b>glue</b> {{is used in}} woodworking. It may be {{supplied}} as granules, flakes, or flat sheets, which have an indefinite shelf life if kept dry. It is dissolved in water, heated and applied warm, typically around 60°C (140°F). Warmer temperatures quickly destroy the strength of <b>hide</b> <b>glue.</b> Commercial glue pots, simple water baths or double boilers {{may be used to}} keep the glue hot while in use. As <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> cools, it gels quickly. At room temperature, prepared <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> has the consistency of stiff gelatin, which is in fact a similar composition. Gelled <b>hide</b> <b>glue</b> does not have significant strength, so it is vital to apply the glue, fit the pieces, and hold them steady before the glue temperature drops much below 50°C (120°F). All glues have an open time, the amount of time the glue remains liquid and workable. Joining parts after the open time is expired results in a weak bond. Hide glue's open time is usually a minute or less. In practice, this often means having to heat the pieces to be glued, and gluing in a very warm room, though these steps can be dispensed with if the glue and clamp operation can be carried out quickly.|$|E
