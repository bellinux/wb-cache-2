5|$|On the {{hardware}} <b>driver</b> <b>side,</b> for instance the UniATA project provides Serial ATA drivers for ReactOS. The project has also experimented with using the FullFAT library in its rewrite of its FAT Installable File System.

25|$|The Corolla 2.0D Saloon has {{the same}} engine as the Corolla 2.0D. The model is only {{available}} with a 5-speed manual. The 2.0D Saloon comes equipped with alloy rims, side skirts, optitron speedometer, wooden inserts in the interior and a single <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> airbag. Optional extra on the model is the sunroof.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} line, for now, {{is limited}} to the Highline version, with respect to Active, added {{automatic}} climate (climatronic), electric mirrors, electric windows with automatic up/down and full <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> control, chrome inserts on the dashboard, gear shift lever, steering wheel and speed brake handles and lined in leather, finally with fog lights.|$|E
50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> sliding door, the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> sliding door with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> sliding door was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R

25|$|On October 17, Labonte {{announced}} the GEICO 500 {{is to be}} his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg's design from his 1996 title run on the <b>driver</b> <b>side,</b> the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year on the passenger side, and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> and passenger {{side of the car}} for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, but because of the unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start {{at the tail end of}} the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.|$|E
25|$|The {{facelift}} for the Corolla {{was launched}} on 11 April 2011. Initially only the XLi and GLi trims were available, with {{modifications to the}} front and rear lights, front grill, and bumpers, along with a revised interior colour scheme. The 1.8L Corolla Altis with 1ZZ-FE engine was suspended replaced with the 1.6L Corolla Altis with the 1ZR-FE engine producing 124bhp. The facelift Altis was launched in May 2011. The Altis comes equipped with sideskirts, wooden inserts in the interior, optitron speedometer, 5-spoke alloy rims, fog lamps, power windows, power seats, ABS with EBD, <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> SRS airbag and a 6-speed (forward) manual transmission. Optional on the Altis is a 4-speed super ECT automatic transmission and sunroof.|$|E
25|$|At Florence and Halldale, two {{officers}} issued {{a plea for}} assistance in apprehending a young suspect who had thrown an object at their car and whom they were now pursuing on foot. Approximately two dozen officers, commanded by 77th Street Division LAPD officer Lieutenant Michael Moulin, arrived and arrested the youth, 16-year old Seandel Daniels, forcing him {{into the back of}} a car. The rough handling of the young man, a minor who was well known in the community, further agitated an uneasy and growing crowd, who began taunting and berating the police. Among them was Bart Bartholemew (who was later attacked and had his <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> window broken), a freelance photographer for The New York Times, and Timothy Goldman, who began to record events with a camcorder over the next two hours. The police formed a perimeter around the arresting officers as the crowd grew more hostile, leading to further altercations and arrests (including that of Damian Williams' older brother, Mark Jackson). Fearing police would resort to deadly force to repel the growing crowd, Lieutenant Moulin ordered officers out of the area altogether. Moulin later said that officers on the scene were outnumbered and unprepared to handle the situation because their riot equipment was stored at the police academy.|$|E

25|$|In May, Nadeau was {{involved}} in what was regarded {{at the time as}} one of the most serious accidents in NASCAR history. While practicing for the race at Richmond International Raceway, Nadeau lost control of the No. 01 while trying to avoid another car in turn one and slammed into the wall <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> first. This was before the advent of SAFER barriers being installed at racetracks to dissipate the force from racing accidents, resulting in Nadeau impacting the unprotected concrete wall. He suffered fractures to his skull and several of his ribs along with a collapsed lung and temporary paralysis on his left side, and the cumulative effects would lead to his retirement as a driver. Busch Series veteran Jason Keller replaced Nadeau at the Richmond race finishing 32nd, and the team used several temporary substitutes for the rest of the year. Mike Wallace ran the next four races, then four more races afterwards (skipping Sonoma) with a best finish of 19th at Dover. Mike Skinner ran 11 races with the team after being released from Morgan McClure Motorsports, earning a pole at Richmond. Boris Said ran both road course races, also earning a pole as well as a sixth-place finish (both at Sonoma). Finally, the team signed Joe Nemechek, who had been released from Hendrick Motorsports' 25 car (where he had replaced Nadeau), to permanently drive the No. 01 car, running the last four races of the year and earning a top 10 at Atlanta. Said and Skinner earned spots in the 2004 Budweiser Shootout for their respective pole runs, with Boris in the 01 finishing 10th, and Skinner finishing 15th in the 10 Valvoline car.|$|E
500|$|Physical {{effects were}} {{not an issue}} for the series regulars. Allison Mack {{performed}} her own stunts for the scene in [...] "Hothead" [...] where her character's office is set on fire, and again in [...] "Kinetic", when she was cabled off and dangled [...] above the ground. For [...] "Nicodemus", the stunt coordinator received twice the help. Kristin Kreuk was expected {{to go to the}} tenth rung of a water tower, in a scene which involved her character climbing to the top and falling off. As filming progressed, Kreuk climbed to the top, so the crew cabled her off and dropped her [...] to the bottom. John Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard led to him performing the stunt driving for his character. The scene required Schneider to slide his truck around a corner, while yelling at some pedestrians on the sidewalk. The previous scene had established the <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> window as closed, so Schneider improvised and opened the driver's door as he slid 90° around a corner.|$|E
500|$|Lancaster {{left the}} band in March 2007 citing {{a lack of}} writing credit on the band's releases. Lenzo and Bundrick filled in for Lancaster's vocals, while Garcia and Betts {{performed}} Lancaster's guitar parts. Garcia said this change made the guitars [...] "sound more clear" [...] and not [...] "clutter"; on the other hand, the group found it hard working out who should sing Lancaster's parts. Lancaster's departure hurt Sanders personally as [...] "he was a good friend". Later that month, the band supported Plain White T's on their U.S. tour. On April 4, [...] "Black Cat" [...] was made available for streaming via Hot Topic's Myspace profile. On April 13, the release of A Lesson in Romantics was announced. Between early May and late June, the band went on tour with support from Bedlight for Blue Eyes, <b>Driver</b> <b>Side</b> Impact, and Sick City. The track listing was revealed on May 18. On June 6, the band made [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] available for streaming via their Myspace profile. [...] "Jamie All Over" [...] was made available for streaming on June 19 via AbsolutePunk.|$|E

2500|$|The GTO was {{assembled}} by GM's Holden subsidiary at Elizabeth. It {{was equipped with}} the 5.7 liter LS1 V8 engine for the 2004 model year, the same engine found in the concurrent model year Chevrolet Corvette, {{with a choice of}} a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Changes from the Australian-built Monaro included bracing additions to the body to meet U.S. crash standards, a [...] "corporate Pontiac" [...] front facia, new badging, [...] "GTO" [...] stitching on the front seats, and a revised exhaust system. GM Engineers benchmarked the sound of the 1964 GTO held in the Pontiac historical collection, as well as other LS1-powered vehicles, while working with the exhaust vendor to tune the system. The effort was made to make the new GTO invoke the same sound as the original while still meeting the noise threshold required by some states. The 2004 GTO exhaust was a true dual system that followed the original Monaro exhaust routing, thus both tailpipes exited on the <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle. General Motors claimed performance of 5.3 seconds to 60 and a 13.8 second quarter mile time, which was closely verified by several magazine tests.|$|E
