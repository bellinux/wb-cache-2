5|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent recession highlighted limitations of existing macroeconomic theories, models, and <b>econometrics.</b> The popular press discussed post-Keynesian economics and Austrian economics, two heterodox traditions that have little influence on mainstream economics.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian School of {{economics}} began with Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of Economics. Menger's followers formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} Austrian economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including <b>econometrics.</b> Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University <b>Econometrics</b> to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of SAS began in 1966 after North Carolina State University re-hired Anthony Barr to program {{his analysis of}} variance and regression software {{so that it would}} run on IBM System/360 computers. The project was funded by the National Institute of Health and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve crop yields. Barr was joined by student James Goodnight, who developed the software's statistical routines, and the two became project-leaders. In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines. In 1972, after issuing the first release of SAS, the project lost its funding. According to Goodnight, this was because NIH only wanted to fund projects with medical applications. Goodnight continued teaching at the university for a salary of $1 and access to mainframe computers for use with the project, until it was funded by the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations the following year. John Sall joined the project in 1973 and contributed to the software's <b>econometrics,</b> time series, and matrix algebra. Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.|$|E

25|$|The {{parameterization}} with k and θ {{appears to}} be more common in <b>econometrics</b> and certain other applied fields, where for example the gamma distribution is frequently used to model waiting times. For instance, in life testing, the waiting time until death is a random variable that is frequently modeled with a gamma distribution.|$|E
25|$|This {{model is}} also known in <b>econometrics</b> as the rank ordered logit model and it was {{introduced}} in that field by Beggs, Cardell and Hausman in 1981.

25|$|The Dutch became internationally active again. Dutch corporations, {{particularly}} Royal Dutch Shell and Philips, became internationally prominent. Business people, scientists, {{engineers and}} {{artists from the}} Netherlands made important international contributions. For example, Dutch economists, especially Jan Tinbergen (1903–1994), Tjalling Koopmans (1910–1985) and Henri Theil (1924–2000), made major contributions to the mathematical and statistical methodology known as <b>econometrics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is occasionally referred as orthodox economics whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as <b>econometrics,</b> game theory, analysis of market failure and imperfect competition, and the neoclassical model {{of economic growth}} for analysing long-run variables affecting national income.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, {{just before}} {{going off to}} Columbia he was offered and {{accepted}} an Assistant Professorship in the Economics Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At M.I.T. he taught courses in statistics and <b>econometrics.</b> Solow's interest gradually changed to macroeconomics. For almost 40 years, Solow and Paul Samuelson worked together on many landmark theories: von Neumann growth theory (1953), theory of capital (1956), linear programming (1958) and the Phillips curve (1960).|$|E
25|$|Economic {{theories}} are frequently tested empirically, largely {{through the use}} of <b>econometrics</b> using economic data. The controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and uncommon in economics, and instead broad data is observationally studied; this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation, and the conclusions typically more tentative. However, the field of experimental economics is growing, and increasing use is being made of natural experiments.|$|E
25|$|In 2013–2014, the University of Waikato {{was ranked}} in the 301–350 band {{in the world by}} Times Higher Education World University Rankings and in the 401–410 band by QS World University Rankings. The QS Subject Rankings put five subject areas taught at the University of Waikato in the top 150 worldwide. They are Computer Science and Info Systems (101–150), Economics and <b>Econometrics</b> (101–150), Education (46), Law and Legal Studies (101–150) and Languages (101–150).|$|E
25|$|Yield {{management}} and <b>econometrics</b> center on detailed forecasting and mathematical optimization of marginal revenue opportunities. The opportunities arise from segmentation of consumer willingness to pay. If {{the market for}} a particular good follows the simple straight line Price/Demand relationship illustrated below, a single fixed price of $50 there is enough demand to sell 50 units of inventory. This results in $2500 in revenues. However the same Price/Demand relationship yields $4000 if consumers are presented with multiple prices.|$|E
25|$|The son of Secretary of Agriculture Henry Cantwell Wallace, Henry A. Wallace {{was born}} in Adair County, Iowa. After earning a degree in animal {{husbandry}} from Iowa State University, Wallace worked as a farmer and newspaper editor. He founded the Hi-Bred Corn Company, which experienced immense success and made Wallace wealthy. Wallace also helped introduce the use of statistics and <b>econometrics</b> in agriculture. Starting in the 1920s, he explored various religions, becoming interested in theosophy and befriending figures such as George William Russell and Nicholas Roerich.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{developments}} were {{against the backdrop of}} improvements in both <b>econometrics,</b> that is the ability to measure prices and changes in goods and services, as well as their aggregate quantities, and in the creation of macroeconomics, or the study of whole economies. The attempt to combine neo-classical microeconomics and Keynesian macroeconomics would lead to the neoclassical synthesis which has been the dominant paradigm of economic reasoning in English-speaking countries since the 1950s. Hicks and Samuelson were for example instrumental in mainstreaming Keynesian economics.|$|E
25|$|The future {{demographics}} of Europe is most favourable to France where the fertility rate {{is closest to}} the replacement level.

25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is also {{often seen as}} relying too heavily on complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and doomed to failure. A famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events {{rather than by the}} realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and <b>econometrics.</b> Some see mathematical models used in contemporary research in mainstream economics as having transcended neoclassical economics, while others disagree. Critics of neoclassical economics are divided into those who think that highly mathematical method is inherently wrong and those who think that mathematical method is potentially good even if contemporary methods have problems.|$|E
25|$|Wallace {{attended}} Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, {{graduating in}} 1910 with a bachelor's degree in animal husbandry. During {{his time at}} Iowa State, Wallace {{was a member of}} the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He worked on the editorial staff of the family-owned paper Wallaces' Farmer in Des Moines from 1910 to 1924, and took the role of chief editor from 1924 to 1929. Wallace experimented with breeding high-yielding hybrid corn, and wrote a number of publications on agriculture. In 1915, he devised the first corn-hog ratio charts indicating the probable course of markets. Wallace was also a practicing statistician, writing an influential article with pioneering statistician George W. Snedecor of Iowa State University on computational methods for correlations and regressions and publishing sophisticated statistical studies in the pages of Wallaces’ Farmer. Snedecor invited Wallace to teach a graduate course on least squares. It was Wallace, more than any other individual, who introduced <b>econometrics</b> (a form of statistical analysis used by economists) to the field of agriculture.|$|E
25|$|At the Cowles Commission, Simon’s {{main goal}} was to link {{economic}} theory to mathematics and statistics. His main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and <b>econometrics.</b> He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate {{that began in the}} 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit-maximization was not accomplished, in part, {{because of the lack of}} complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only “bounded rationality” and must make decisions by “satisficing,” or choosing that which might not be optimal, but which will make them happy enough. Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a free market think tank, found that legalization of low-skilled illegal {{resident}} workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years. The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants. In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS. Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an <b>econometrics</b> study by a Rutgers economist found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods, but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.|$|E
