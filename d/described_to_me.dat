He said that he [...] "had a very clear view from household slides and projectors about the history of Israel, about the trials and tribulations of the Jewish people, about the enormous suffering and loss during the Holocaust, as well as the extraordinary struggle that he <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> of people to create this magnificent homeland".|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement {{that her husband had}} handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata {{as part of}} {{his application}} for the position of [...] in Leipzig, the official title being [...] (Cantor and Director of Music). As cantor, he was responsible for the music at four Lutheran churches, the main churches Thomaskirche (St. Thomas) and the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas), but also the Neue Kirche (New Church) and the Peterskirche (St. Peter). As director of music, the Thomaskantor was Leipzig's [...] "senior musician", responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages. Functions related to the university took place at the Paulinerkirche. The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722. Bach was interested, mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig: [...] "...but this post was <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in such favorable terms that finally (particularly since my sons seemed inclined to [...] studies) I cast my lot, {{in the name of the}} Lord, and made my journey to Leipzig, took my examination, and then made the change of position." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crown Prince Wilhelm, in his memoirs, {{tells of}} the wonderment of the German troops at these futile but heroic attacks: [...] "The {{commander}} of a machine-gun company... <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the overwhelming view of the battleground, on which France's best regiments were being destroyed in continually renewed, hopeless attacks". [...] (Griffiths, p.39) ...|$|E
2500|$|Maria Pavlovna wrote {{later that}} she felt her aunt had rushed her into the marriage. However, {{at the time she}} enjoyed the {{attention}} and was eager to escape from the nursery.

2500|$|In February 2015, Khan stated {{his views}} at a popular online comedy group All India Bakchod for its celebrity Roast episode. He said, [...] "I {{completely}} believe in freedom of speech, no issues. But {{we have to}} understand that we all have a certain responsibility. When I heard what was being <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I felt it was a violent event." [...] He further said violence is not just physical but it has verbal aspects to it. Calling the roast a shameless act, Khan did not spare even his friends from the film industry Karan, Ranveer and Arjun.|$|E

6000|$|Expression {{on these}} {{subjects}} was precipitated from E. Rushmore Coglan {{by the third}} corner to our table. While Coglan was <b>describing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the topography along the Siberian Railway the orchestra glided into a medley.

2500|$|According to Nathalie Babel Brown, [...] "Babel came to Paris in {{the summer}} of 1935, as part of the {{delegation}} of Soviet writers to the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> these last conversations with my father many times." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, George's lawyers {{sought an}} appeal on fresh {{evidence}} based on medical examinations suggesting {{he was not}} capable of committing the crime because of his mental disabilities. The defense brought in neuropsychiatrist Michael Kopelman to dispute the prosecution's claim that George showed signs of [...] "histrionics, paranoia and narcissism" [...] and had a personality disorder. Kopelman testified that [...] " [...] <b>described</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that he can be}} aware of what's going on around him but he just can't respond," [...] and concluded that George was not calculating enough to have committed the crime. A second defence argument was that two new witnesses say they saw armed police at the scene when George was arrested, contrary to official reports about the circumstances of his arrest – the Metropolitan Police maintain there were no armed officers present during the arrest of George. [...] There was scientific evidence linking Barry George to the murder {{in the form of a}} single microscopic particle of what was said to have been gunshot residue, together with evidence as to the character of a fibre found on his clothing. It was argued by the defence that the presence of armed officers and their involvement in his arrest might have been responsible for the gunshot residue.|$|E
