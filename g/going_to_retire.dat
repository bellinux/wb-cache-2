5|$|On {{his first}} {{overseas}} trip, McCabe struggled badly {{in his first}} four weeks in England. In six matches in that time, he scored only 51 runs at 7.28 and failed to take a wicket after being asked to bowl only 18 overs. After being dismissed {{in the last of}} these matches, McCabe came off the field and despondently said that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire.</b> Teammate Clarrie Grimmett suggested that McCabe play with a fuller face of the bat, advice that the batsman accepted. McCabe's fortunes changed in the next match against Oxford University; he scored 91 and took 1/5 in an innings win. He added 65 in the next match against Hampshire and starred with both bat and ball against Cambridge University, the final tour match before the First Test. McCabe scored 96 before being run out, and took 4/25 and 4/60, which would remain his career best match bowling figures, as Australia completed a commanding innings victory.|$|E

However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It was a shock to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire</b> while he {{was at the top of}} his game and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E
25|$|England {{started the}} day {{with the news that}} former captain and talisman Andrew Flintoff was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire</b> from Test cricket after the Ashes, Monty Panesar had been dropped in favour of Graham Onions and Steve Harmison had been left out of the squad. England started {{exceptionally}} well with Strauss and Cook opening and going in for lunch 126/0. There was bad luck for the Australians after the interval when Strauss hit a ball back towards bowler Nathan Hauritz who, in trying to take the catch, dislocated his finger. England's pre-lunch form continued into the afternoon, until, with the score 196/0, Cook was dismissed LBW by Johnson just short of his century on 95. England soon lost Bopara for 18 and, from 222/2, England started to collapse: the next four middle order batsmen fell for just 74 with Australia's bowlers looking far better than they had done earlier in the day. Strauss continued past 150 to reach 161 with Broad on 7 going into day 2 and England on a possible shaky 364/6.|$|E
500|$|... 2006: In an {{interview}} with ESPN in January, after the Packers had finished with a 4-12 record, Favre admitted {{that if he had}} to make a decision right away he would not come back.

[...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot."

500|$|Shankly was 60 when Liverpool won the 1974 FA Cup {{and said}} in his {{autobiography}} that, on returning to the dressing room {{at the end of}} the match, he [...] "felt tired from all the years". His mind was made up and he knew he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire.</b> His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly's feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which was that he did not win the European Cup.|$|E
500|$|The other {{predominant}} match {{from the}} Raw brand was an unsanctioned match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho.

Jericho, however, interrupted the announcement and, {{in an attempt to}} punch Michaels, accidentally struck Michaels' wife Rebecca. On the August 18 episode of Raw, Jericho stated that he had no remorse for what he did to Michaels wife, claiming that Michaels [...] "had it coming". The following week on Raw, Michaels announced he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire</b> and asked Jericho for an unsanctioned match.

500|$|In 1955, Chamberlain joined KU. At KU, Chamberlain {{became a}} player for the Kansas Jayhawks {{freshman}} team under coach Phog Allen, whom he admired, {{and also a}} member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, where he was the president of his pledge class. Announced as [...] "looking lighter than his 240 pounds, [...] reach 9'6" [...] up in the air , and [...] 7'2", his debut was highly anticipated, and he delivered: in Chamberlain's debut game for the freshman squad, the freshman Jayhawks were pitted against the varsity Jayhawks, who were favored to win their conference that year. Chamberlain dominated his older college mates by scoring 42 points (16–35 from the field, 10–12 on free throws), grabbing 29 rebounds and registering four blocks. Chamberlain's prospects of playing under Allen ended, however, when the coach turned 70 shortly after and was forced to retire by KU regulation. Chamberlain had a bad relationship with Allen's successor, Dick Harp, fueled by resentment and disappointment: Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry has doubted whether Chamberlain would have chosen KU if he had known that Allen was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire.</b>|$|E
500|$|Louise O'Malley {{arrives at}} the hospital, and asks Torres to decide if O'Malley's organs will be donated. The victim of a {{speedboat}} accident, Clara Ferguson (Zoe Boyle), {{arrives at the}} hospital in an ambulance, with both of her arms {{and one of her}} legs amputated. She is attended to by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who informs her that her cut-off arms can be reattached. The hospital's president, Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), explains to neurosuregon Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) that Webber has not been substantially completing his role as chief of surgery, and offers Shepherd the job. Karev reveals O'Malley's death to Stevens, and Torres seeks her help in deciding whether or not to donate O'Malley's organs. Stevens opinionates that O'Malley would give all his organs, and the two come to a mutual conclusion that donation is the correct option. Prior to the harvesting of his organs, O'Malley's former mentor Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) is uneasy about donating his organs, but soon comes to terms with the situation. Several days later, at O'Malley's funeral, the woman O'Malley saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio) is shown hysterically crying while Karev, Stevens, Meredith, and Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) are laughing—unable to deal with their true emotions. After the funeral, O'Malley's former best friend Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is designated the job of emptying out his locker, but breaks down. Bailey subsequently discharges Stevens, and Robbins' body pain patient returns, with chronic pain, though Robbins is unable to diagnose him. Torres approaches Webber, seeking information {{as to whether or not}} her application to become an attending surgeon has been accepted. Webber explains that the job is no longer available, as the surgeon who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>retire,</b> ultimately did not. Torres becomes enraged, saying that the current surgeon who has the job is a dinosaur, and storms out while yelling: [...] "I'm a superstar". The episode closes with Lexie consoling the speedboat victim, Ferguson.|$|E
