40|$|Clinicians become {{experts in}} their fields {{commensurate}} to the experiences they have across many and varied patient cases (Norman, 2005). However, changes in clinical education, notably the 80 -hour resident <b>duty</b> <b>week,</b> have narrowed trainees ’ opportunities for case exposure (Graber, 2007). Online interactive patient cases that simulate clinical scenarios, virtual patients (VPs), may help fill this gap (Cook & Triola, 2009). However, no VP instructional design (ID) theory exists to guide their development and use. Research Objective To develop an instructional design theory of VPs to foster diagnostic (clinical reasoning) skills in medical trainees. Goal-based Scenarios (GBS) Two defining characteristics of VPs are that they are problem-oriented (patient condition) and goal-based (diagnosis or treatment). GBS theory (Schank, Berman, & Macpherson, 1999) therefore, provides a logical {{point of departure for}} initiating research to develop a VP ID theory. GBS is grounded in the descriptive theories of case-based reasoning (Schank et al., 1999) and experiential learnin...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patient {{contact is}} the favored {{strategy}} for increasing diagnostic expertise. However, changes in clinical education, notably the 80 -hour resident <b>duty</b> <b>week,</b> have narrowed trainees’ opportunities for case exposure. Online interactive cases, virtual patients (VPs), may help fill this gap. Design and development heuristics have been advanced, however {{there is no}} instructional design (ID) theory of VPs. PURPOSE: Our aim is to develop an ID theory of VPs to enhance the development of diagnostic skills in medical trainees. Intrapartum EFM data interpretation serves as an initial instructional case for theory development. METHODOLOGY: Formative research {{will be used to}} refine an existing ID theory, Goalbased Scenarios (GBS), {{to address the needs of}} EFM novice learners. Residents, midwivesin- training, and nurses will interact with an experimental EFM VP that exposes learners to both branching logic and game technology-based VP platforms. Both objective and perceptual data will be captured and analyzed. RESULTS: Based on preliminary work, the potential of game technology to reduce the determinism inherent in branching logic VPs and provide more nuanced options for exploring decision-making paths enhanced its preferability. However, the meaningfulness of diagnostic and intervention tasks afforded, both in terms of clinical relevance and learners’ own health care roles, was seen as more fundamental to VP design. CONCLUSIONS: Situationality is intrinsic to ID theory-building. The theory emerging from this research may be informative in the design of VPs teaching processes similar to EFM interpretation...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests long work hours adversely affect mental health across a variety of domains. Mental health issues have been found to negatively affect work performance. This finding was highlighted in the aviation industry by the 2015 Germanwings incident in which 150 people died. Further investigation into work hours and their associated factors (e. g., demographic characteristics and experiences of sleep and fatigue in the cockpit) contributing to mental health issues among pilots is warranted. A cross-sectional survey investigating attitudes and experiences of fatigue was developed and distributed to commercial airline pilots. Results found pilots who reported typically spending longer hours on <b>duty</b> per <b>week</b> were twice as likely to report feeling depressed or anxious. Pilots' experiences of job-related sleep disturbance and fatigue may explain why pilots who typically spend long hours on <b>duty</b> each <b>week</b> are more likely to report feeling depressed or anxious...|$|R

5000|$|The British Chain Home radar defence {{system was}} able to warn of enemy {{aircraft}} approaching the British coast, but once having crossed the coastline the Observer Corps provided {{the only means of}} tracking their position. During the period from July to October 1940, the Observer Corps was at full stretch operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, plotting enemy aircraft and passing this essential information to RAF Fighter Command Groups and Sector Controls. (ROC personnel were deployed in two specific roles: Those in Class A were required to undertake 56 hours <b>duty</b> per <b>week,</b> while Class B personnel undertook up to 24 hours <b>duty</b> per <b>week).</b> The Battle of Britain also saw the introduction of the Blitz campaign and the shift of German bombing from airfields to cities. Again, the Observer Corps provided vital information which enabled timely air-raid warnings to be issued, thereby saving countless lives. The Blitz itself continued until early in the summer of 1941 and bombing continued, albeit on a reduced scale, until March 1945.
