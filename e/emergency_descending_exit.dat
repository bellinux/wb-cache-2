40|$|The {{consideration}} of safety {{issues in the}} operation of helicopters involves the capability to perform <b>emergency</b> <b>descending</b> maneuvers through the autorotation principle when the engine is no longer supplying power. When comparing manned and unmanned helicopters, the lower rotor inertia of UAV configurations makes this functionality even more challenging for the pilot since more accurate timing and speed control of the flare phase are required. This paper presents a complete set of guidelines to design a controller for the autonomous autorotation landing of an UAV. This analysis is based on experimental data that corresponds to autorotation landings of a small-size helicopter carried out by a skillful pilot. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1968, the first {{documented}} mountaineering party succeeded in crossing the icefield.

500|$|Less {{common in}} the 1950s to 1970s was an R-valve which was {{equipped}} with a restriction that caused breathing to become difficult as the cylinder neared exhaustion, but that would allow less restricted breathing if the diver began to ascend and the ambient water pressure lessened, providing a larger pressure differential over the orifice. [...] It was never particularly popular because if {{it was necessary for}} the diver to <b>descend</b> during <b>exit</b> from a cave or wreck, breathing would become progressively more difficult as the diver went deeper, eventually becoming impossible until the diver could ascend to a low enough ambient pressure.|$|R

50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each locking cycle. When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper caisson 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom caisson. The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the caisson {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any <b>descended</b> vessels <b>exit,</b> allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThoracic {{endovascular}} aortic repair (TEVAR), initially {{developed for}} the treatment of degenerative aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta, has been applied to the entire spectrum of descending thoracic aortic pathology in both the elective and emergent settings. This single center study evaluates the effectiveness of TEVAR {{for the treatment of}} acute surgical <b>emergencies</b> involving the <b>descending</b> thoracic aorta, including traumatic aortic disruption (TAD), ruptured descending thoracic aneurysm (RDTA), and acute complicated Type B dissection (cTBD). MethodsA retrospective review of the medical records of all patients undergoing emergent TEVAR at the University of Mississippi Medical Center between August 2007 and November 2010 was undertaken. Patients were studied for 30 -day survival, complications, type of device used for the repair, and technical aspects of the procedure. ResultsA total of 44 patients (59 % male) with an average age of 49 years (range, 16 - 87 years) underwent emergent TEVAR during the study period. The technical success rate was 100 %, with no patient requiring emergent open surgery for conditions involving the descending thoracic aorta at our institution during the study period. The majority (73 %) of the repairs were accomplished using commercially available thoracic stent grafts. Abdominal endograft proximal extension cuffs were used in 12 (38 %) of the 32 patients undergoing repair of TAD. Twenty-one patients (48 %) required coverage of the left subclavian artery, two (10 %) of whom subsequently required subclavian artery revascularization. Procedure-related complications included two strokes, one spinal cord ischemia, one unintentional coverage of the left carotid artery, one episode of acute renal failure, and three access site injuries. One patient undergoing repair of TAD had collapse of the stent graft in the early postoperative period. He was successfully treated by placement of an additional stent graft. Seven patients (16 %) died within 30 days of surgery. Three of the deaths occurred in patients who had successfully undergone repair of a TAD and died of associated injuries. ConclusionsEmergent TEVAR has become the treatment of choice for acute surgical <b>emergencies</b> involving the <b>descending</b> thoracic aorta. Short-term morbidity and mortality compare favorably with historic results for emergent open surgical procedures on the descending thoracic aorta. Survival is highest in patients undergoing repair of TAD. Using current endograft technology, nearly all emergent conditions of the descending thoracic aorta can be successfully treated with TEVAR...|$|R
50|$|On {{reaching}} Brighstone Forest, {{signs for}} the Tennyson Trail appear. After following these signs the track starts to descend and crosses Bridleway BS58 shortly before reaching a five-way crossing. After continuing {{straight at the}} crossing, a signpost appears showing the Worsley Trail and Shorwell {{to the left and}} the Tennyson Trail to the right. Following this leads to Brighstone Down. The trail continues west along this track with sea views to the left before <b>descending</b> steadily to <b>exit</b> at a picnic area onto Lynch Lane. Turning right, then left will lead through the National Trust Jubilee Car Park and onto the National Trust information board. After passing the Forestry Commission Brighstone Forest entrance, the trail follows the down following the ancient road to the summit. After leaving National Trust land through a gate and continuing ahead on level ground, the path will immediately pass ancient burial mounds on the right. The track then descends to a further gate into a field where the Tennyson Trail is signposted. It will then descend through the field to reach the B3399 road to Freshwater and Yarmouth to the right and Brook to the left.|$|R

500|$|The magistrates (magistratus) {{were elected}} by the People of Rome, which {{consisted}} of plebeians (commoners) and patricians (aristocrats). Each magistrate was vested {{with a degree of}} power, called [...] "major powers" [...] or maior potestas. Dictators had more [...] "major powers" [...] than any other magistrate, and thus they outranked all other magistrates; but were originally intended only to be a temporary tool for times of state <b>emergency.</b> Thereafter in <b>descending</b> order came the censor (who, while the highest-ranking ordinary magistrate by virtue of his prestige, held little real power), the consul, the praetor, the curule aedile, and the quaestor. Any magistrate could obstruct (veto) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers. If this obstruction occurred between two magistrates of equal rank, such as two praetors, then it was called par potestas (negation of powers). To prevent this, magistrates used a principle of alteration, assigned responsibilities by lot or seniority, or gave certain magistrates control over certain functions. If this obstruction occurred against a magistrate of a lower rank, then it was called intercessio, where the magistrate literally interposed his higher rank to obstruct the lower-ranking magistrate. By definition, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles were technically not magistrates since they were elected only by the plebeians. As such, no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions.|$|R
