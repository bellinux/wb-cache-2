5|$|CMDCM {{insignia}} {{are similar}} to the insignia for Master Chief, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet or Force Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMDCMs wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
5|$|From {{the pound}} {{down to the}} scruple, the English apothecaries' system was {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> troy pound and its subdivisions were {{slightly}} heavier than the Roman pound and its subdivisions.

5|$|In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature. After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein– concanavalin A– <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ends were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.|$|E
5|$|John Gaughan, an American {{manufacturer}} of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 building {{his own version}} of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E
5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|Since {{there is}} no MRT station near Pathlight School and only bus pass by the school, one can take 45, 55, 261 and CT8 to both campuses, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Townsville Primary School Stop does not serve CT8. 55 is {{accessed}} to Bishan MRT Station while 261 is accessed to Ang Mo Kio MRT Station. Since no bus entered to Ang Mo Kio Street 44 for Campus 2, they have to walk.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} the Lorentz group on the space of field {{configurations}} (a field configuration is the spacetime history of a particular solution, e.g. the electromagnetic field in all of space over all time is one field configuration) resembles the action on the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commutator brackets are replaced by field theoretical Poisson brackets.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Kotor earned Tvrtko the enmity of George I of Zeta's brother and successor, Balša II, who also desired the city. Nothing {{is known about}} Balša's {{military}} conflict with Tvrtko <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter asked Venice, whose trading opportunities were threatened by the clashes, to mediate with the Lord of Zeta. The mediation was thwarted by Balša's death in a 1385 battle with the invading Ottoman Turks. Balša's nephew and successor, George II, maintained Zeta's hostility toward Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|The key {{activities}} of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature). The rules associated with naming plants are {{separate from the}} methods, principles or purposes of classification, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> units of classification, the taxa, are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera, and genera within families. There are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a climb {{in the middle}} of it, but no KOM points were on offer. The course was technical and featured several turnarounds. It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> finish line was not situated at the same place. Midway through the stage, the riders took on the difficulty of the day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of partially competitive inhibition {{is similar to}} that of non-competitive, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or even higher (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex. This inhibition typically displays a lower Vmax, but an unaffected Km value.|$|E
