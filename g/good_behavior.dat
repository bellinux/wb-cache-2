5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Goldman {{moved with}} her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she {{enrolled}} in a Realschule. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of <b>good</b> <b>behavior</b> and {{she was unable to}} attend.|$|E

During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia Clemm held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, as {{a result}} of Wise's <b>good</b> <b>behavior</b> in prison, Ohio {{governor}} Michael DiSalle commuted Wise's sentence to second-degree murder and she was paroled at age 79. Wise's remaining family refused to take her in, and a number of rest homes for the elderly similarly declined her residency; within three days Wise returned to prison, lacking anywhere else to go. Her parole and the commutation of her sentence were revoked. Wise died in prison on June 28, 1971.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{incident}} that occurred was {{the assassination of}} Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India who had visited the islands on an inspection tour. He had visited the Ross Island penal settlement. The attack on Lord Mayo {{was carried out by}} Sher Ali, one of the convicts of the penal colony who was on a sick leave; the assassination was carried out while Mayo was returning after a pleasant trip to Mount Harriet on the evening of 8 February 1872. Another political prisoner who suffered the longest period of 47 years of incarceration was Musai Singh who was released for <b>good</b> <b>behavior</b> in July 1907 {{on the occasion of the}} 50th anniversary of India's First War of Independence in 1857.|$|E
5|$|As {{they reach}} the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, {{revealing}} the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for <b>good</b> <b>behavior.</b> Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|Progress Charts are tools used in classrooms, {{in child}} care centers, and in homes across the world. They are used to promote <b>good</b> <b>behaviors</b> and reward {{children}} for those behaviors, {{which is why they}} are also known as behavior charts.

50|$|A {{progress}} chart is a reward system. It involves stickers or stars, and a chart {{that can be}} either printed off or made by hand. The main goal of a {{progress chart}} is to track children's learning or behavior. It {{can be used to}} curb bad behaviors and to encourage <b>good</b> <b>behaviors.</b> It is inexpensive and can be changed to fit different situations. The child earns stickers for the desired behavior and after so many stars, earns a reward.|$|R
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for <b>good</b> <b>behavior,</b> the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two if they demonstrated <b>good</b> <b>behavior</b> during that time.|$|E
5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on <b>good</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{computational}} model that facilitates agents in a MAS to collaboratively evolve their norms {{to reach the}} best norm conventions. Our approach borrows from the social contagion phenomenon to exploit the notion of positive infection: agents with <b>good</b> <b>behaviors</b> become infectious to spread their norms in the agent society. By combining infection and innovation, our computational model helps a MAS establish better norm conventions even when a sub-optimal one has fully settled in the population. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose {{stochastic}} multi-symplectic conservation law for stochastic Hamiltonian partial differential equations, and develop a stochastic multi-symplectic method for numerically solving a kind of stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equations. It is shown that the stochastic multi-symplectic method preserves the multi-symplectic structure, the discrete charge conservation law, and deduces the recurrence relation of the discrete energy. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the <b>good</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the stochastic multi-symplectic method in cases of both solitary wave and collision...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's <b>good</b> <b>behavior,</b> part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Lori Fortier were {{considered}} accomplices for their foreknowledge {{of the planning}} of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten {{and a half years of}} his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for <b>good</b> <b>behavior</b> into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.|$|E
5|$|One {{week after}} the clash at Stillman's Run, on May 21, 1832, the Indian Creek {{massacre}} occurred well south of Fort Blue Mounds, near present-day Ottawa, Illinois. During the attack, two teenage girls were kidnapped by a raiding band of Potawatomi. The girls, Sylvia and Rachel Hall, were released on June 1 at Fort Blue Mounds by the party of Ho-Chunk who had helped secure their release; the party included several important chiefs. Commander of the Michigan Territory militia Henry Dodge arrived with a company to retrieve the girls but became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner {{in an attempt to}} secure the alliance and <b>good</b> <b>behavior</b> of other Ho-Chunk in the vicinity of Blue Mounds. The chiefs were soon released but friction between white settlers at Moundville and the Ho-Chunk residing in the area increased. Indian Agent Henry Gratiot tried to calm the situation by appeasing the Ho-Chunk through gifts. Despite Gratiot's attempts, the tension exploded into violence a few days later.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{yelling at}} a student {{displaying}} negative behaviors, a teacher/leader might recognize a student behaving {{well with a}} [...] "thank you Billy for joining the line", or [...] "I {{like the way you}} helped Billy find his notebook." [...] Recognizing a positive behavior can bring a group's focus away from the students displaying negative behavior, who might just be [...] "acting out" [...] for attention. Seeing this, students seeking attention might try displaying <b>good</b> <b>behaviors</b> to get the recognition of the leader.|$|R
3000|$|However, {{they do not}} {{consider}} exponential fitting conditions.

The construction of exponentially fitted RK(N) methods is originally due to Paternoster [19]. After this, the exponentially fitted methods drew a lot of attention. As a result, there are many different types of exponentially fitted RK(N) methods such as [7, 8, 12, 16, 25, 26, 32].|$|R

5|$|Sharpe James, who {{defeated}} Gibson in 1986 {{and declined}} {{to run for}} a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by {{a federal grand jury}} sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty {{for his role in the}} conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain.

Both Sheela and Puja were released on parole early for <b>good</b> <b>behavior,</b> after serving twenty-nine months of their sentences in a minimum-security federal prison. Sheela's Green Card was revoked; she moved to Switzerland. She remarried there and went on to run two nursing homes in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months (however, due to <b>good</b> <b>behavior,</b> he was out in four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E
