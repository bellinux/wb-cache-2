5000|$|Flanging [...] is {{an audio}} effect {{produced}} by mixing two identical signals together, one signal delayed {{by a small}} and gradually changing period, usually smaller than 20 milliseconds.

50|$|Another reason CDMA is {{resistant}} to multipath interference {{is because the}} delayed versions of the transmitted pseudo-random codes will have poor correlation with the original pseudo-random code, and will thus appear as another user, which is ignored at the receiver. In other words, {{as long as the}} multipath channel induces at least one chip of delay, the multipath signals will arrive at the receiver such that they are shifted in time by at least one chip from the intended signal. The correlation properties of the pseudo-random codes are such that this slight <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> the multipath to appear uncorrelated with the intended signal, and it is thus ignored.|$|E

50|$|Due to its anatomy, the pinna largely {{eliminates}} a small {{segment of}} the frequency spectrum; this band is called the pinna notch. The pinna works differently for low and high frequency sounds. For low frequencies, it behaves similarly to a reflector dish, directing sounds toward the ear canal. For high frequencies, however, its value {{is thought to be}} more sophisticated. While some of the sounds that enter the ear travel directly to the canal, others reflect off the contours of the pinna first: these enter the ear canal after a very slight delay. This <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> phase cancellation, virtually eliminating the frequency component whose wave period is twice the delay period. Neighboring frequencies also drop significantly. In the affected frequency band - the pinna notch - the pinna creates a band-stop or notch filtering effect. This filter typically affects sounds around 10 kHz, though it can affect any frequencies from 6 - 16 kHz. It also is directionally dependent, affecting sounds coming from above more than those coming from straight ahead. This aids in vertical sound localization.|$|E
5000|$|The output {{signals of}} all {{amplifiers}} exhibit a time delay {{when compared to}} their input signals. This <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> a phase difference between the amplifier's input and output signals. If there are enough stages in the amplifier, at some frequency, the output signal will lag behind the input signal by one cycle period at that frequency. In this situation, the amplifier's output signal will be in phase with its input signal though lagging behind it by 360°, i.e., the output will have a phase angle of &minus;360°. This lag is of great consequence in amplifiers that use feedback. The reason: the amplifier will oscillate if the fed-back output signal is in phase with the input signal at the frequency at which its open-loop voltage gain equals its closed-loop voltage gain and the open-loop voltage gain is one or greater. The oscillation will occur because the fed-back output signal will then reinforce the input signal at that frequency. [...] In conventional operational amplifiers, the critical output phase angle is &minus;180° because the output is fed back to the input through an inverting input which adds an additional &minus;180°.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Time, {{quality and}} economy {{constitute}} {{the three main}} factors in a construction project, of which time {{plays a significant role}} in construction. Delay in any task or operation is a time overrun which influences the completion of the work. The common problems in civil engineering projects all around the world are mainly due to delay in construction. These problems occur frequently during project duration leading to disputes and litigation. Thus it’s essential to study and analyse causes of construction delays. This study is based on a list of construction <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> retrieved from literature reviews. The feedback of construction experts was obtained through interviews.

40|$|International {{construction}} {{contractors are}} increasingly expanding their business into emerging markets {{that are often}} characterized by high geopolitical risk. Working in these regions poses unique challenges that lead to unconventional causes for construction delay. As such, this research aims to (1) develop {{a better understanding of}} the causes of delays that may be encountered in countries with high geopolitical risks, (2) gauge the relative impact these <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> are expected to have on project completion, and (3) capture how <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> are influenced by project and country characteristics. Research findings are based on two distinct data sources: quantitative and qualitative data. First, a window delay analysis is conducted of six project schedules and narratives with extensive quantitative data informed of the probability and impact of various <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> in countries with high geopolitical risks. This quantitative source was then complemented with qualitative data based on interviewing 18 experts who were involved in 36 projects, which spanned 16 countries with high geopolitical risks. Results of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis were merged to create an integrated delay cause database. This merging helps to leverage the advantages of both approaches, i. e., accuracy of data and breadth of coverage, and enables construction companies to better anticipate the future causes of delay on their international construction projects. For an upcoming project in a country with high geopolitical risk, the database can be used to suggest or predict the most likely causes of delay based on matching the similarity (location and project type) with existing cases. Comparison of results with the literature on construction <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> in developing countries suggests that there are several <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> that are unique, and also substantial, in countries with high geopolitical risks.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used for predicting the issuance durations of occupancy permit applications. The model is constructed {{to predict the}} issuance durations of least once rejected applications made to Izmir Konak Municipality during year 2008. Then, sensitivity analysis is carried out to detect the most significant <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> affecting the issuance duration. Permit data are examined to reveal the <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> of occupancy permit process. Six inputs are generated from the <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> and used in ANN model: 1) Number of missing approval letters, 2) Number of missing payment documents, 3) Number of non-conformances of project to codes and regulations, 4) Number of all missing documents, 5) First permit application season, 6) First permit rejection season. Total issuance durations of the occupancy permit applications are used as the output parameters of the model. The results of the analysis indicate that the prediction accuracy of the model is 86 % and the number of missing approval letters, the number of missing payment documents, and the first application season are respectively the three most significant inputs affecting the prediction performance of the model. This study proves that the total issuance durations are so bound to the <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> in the permit process that it can be learned and predicted by the ANN model and the occupancy permit process is required to be reengineered...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConstruction delays are {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in civil engineering projects in Egypt including road construction projects. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} study and analyze causes of road construction delays. This paper studied a list of construction <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> gathered from literature having different types of construction, different countries, different periods and different numbers of <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> and delay groups. A questionnaire and personal interviews have formed the basis of this paper listing 293 <b>delay</b> <b>causes.</b> The questionnaire survey was distributed to 500 construction participants and 389 were received who represent consultants, contractors and site/design engineers excluding the owner representing the government in road projects as one party only. Relative Importance Index (RII) is calculated and according to the highest values the top twenty and the least twenty <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> of construction projects in Egypt are determined. A case study is analyzed and compared to the most important <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> in the paper. The test results reveal good correlation of causes and groups between contractors and site/design engineers and between consultants and site design engineers and a somewhat low correlation between contractors and consultants. So there are no root causes that can be taking for granted to be most or least effective <b>delay</b> <b>causes.</b> Proposed model for predicting actual road construction project duration was developed; a real case study tested the accuracy of proposed model. According to the analysis of case study, the most contributing causes and groups to delays were discussed, and some future recommendations were proposed in order to control and minimize delays in road construction projects. These findings can be helpful for project managers to mitigate the road construction delays in Egypt. In order to effectively overcome the road construction delays in developing countries, suggestions are made for fundamental and large‐scale reforms in procurement systems and stakeholders’ management. Also, this paper is useful for both researchers and road construction parties and allows detailed and repeatable analysis of the progress of a road construction project in order to facilitate and achieve a competitive level of time, cost and quality for effective road construction projects...|$|E

40|$|Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is an {{emerging}} type of network which facilitates vehicles on roads to communicate for driving safety. It requires {{a mechanism to}} help authenticate messages, identify valid vehicles, and remove malevolent vehicles which do not obey the rules. Most existing solutions either {{do not have an}} effective message verification scheme, or use the public key infrastructure (PKI). In this network, vehicles are able to broadcast messages to other vehicles and a group of known vehicles can also communicate securely among themselves. So group communication is necessary for the network. However, most existing solutions either do not consider this or use pairing operation to realize this. They are either not secure or not effective. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive set of secure schemes with Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) in VANETs to overcome their shortcomings. Of course, we still need to use Pairing operation in some place. Our scheme is composed of three schemes: (1) Communications between Vehicles and Road-Side Units (RSUs), (2) One to One Communications within a Group, (3) One to One Communications without a Group. Based on our simulation study, we show that our schemes are effective and the <b>delay</b> <b>caused</b> is much lower. The average <b>delay</b> <b>caused</b> by our first scheme is nearly thousands of times lower than prior schemes. The average <b>delay</b> <b>caused</b> by our second scheme is 0. 312 ms, while the <b>delay</b> <b>caused</b> by prior scheme is 12. 3 ms.

30|$|In this article, we have {{investigated}} the BER of TDD downlink MU-MIMO ZF systems {{in the presence of}} imperfect CSI. By exploiting the correlation between the actual channel and the estimated one as well as channel time-correlation, we have developed the novel BER expression for TDD downlink MU-MIMO systems with M-QAM-modulated signals. Furthermore, we find that CSI delay and channel estimation error degrade system performance and even cause error floor, among which channel estimation error causes array gain loss while CSI <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> diversity gain loss. At high SNR, CSI <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> more performance degradation than channel estimation error. Especially, our research is valuable for the design of the adaptive modulation and coding scheme as well as the optimization of MU-MIMO systems.

30|$|One can {{see that}} the {{simulation}} curves match the analytical ones very well, demonstrating the correctness of our average BER expression. It is also observed that, the BER increases as the channel estimation error and/or CSI delay (or mobile velocity) increase(s), and an error floor is evident at high SNR for the cases with CSI delay, which agrees with our summary about imperfect CSI impact. Furthermore, one can find that channel estimation error causes array gain loss by comparing the curves of the same mobile velocity but with different pilot SNR while CSI <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> diversity gain loss by comparing the curves of the same pilot SNR but with different mobile velocities. Moreover, CSI <b>delay</b> <b>causes</b> more performance degradation at high SNR than channel estimation error as the latter diminishes when the SNR is high.|$|E
