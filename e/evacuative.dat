40|$|BACKGROUND: Transanal {{endoscopic}} microsurgery (TEM) after radiochemotherapy (RCT) {{has been}} reported in selected cases of locally advanced rectal cancer as an alternative to traditional radical resection with total mesorectal excision with a curative intent or as diagnostic tool to confirm a pathological complete response of the primary tumor. No study has evaluated functional outcome after TEM in preoperatively irradiated patients. METHODS: This study was designed to evaluate short-term morbidity (according to Clavien's classifications) and establish (by a questionnaire) continence and <b>evacuative</b> function after RCT and TEM, at 1 year from surgery, analyzing the impact of RCT on postoperative outcomes. Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated by RCT and TEM (group 1) or with early T 1 or adenomas treated only by TEM (group 2) entered this cohort comparative study. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients entered the study as group 1 and 25 as group 2. No postoperative mortality occurred. The morbidity rate was 36. 4...|$|E
40|$|Background: Axillary lymphadenectomy or {{sentinel}} biopsy {{is integral}} part of breast cancer treatment, yet seroma formation occurs in 15 - 85 % of cases. Among methods employed to reduce seroma magnitude and duration, fibrin glue has been proposed in numerous studies with controversial results. Methods: Thirty patients over 60 years underwent quadrantectomy or mastectomy with level I/II axillary lymphadenectomy; a suction drain was fitted in all patients. Fibrin glue spray were applied to the axillary fossa in 15 patients; the other 15 patients were treated with harmonic scalpel. Results: Suction drainage was removed between post-operative Days 3 and 4. Seroma magnitude and duration were not significant in patients receiving fibrin glue compared with the harmonic scalpel group. Conclusions: Use of fibrin glue does not always prevent seroma formation, but can reduce seroma magnitude, duration and necessary <b>evacuative</b> punctures. Background Axillary dissection represents an {{integral part of}} the treatment for breast cancer for prognostic and curative purposes. There is still a significant incidence (15 - 81 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{pelvic floor}} {{is a complex}} {{multifunctional}} structure that corresponds to the genito- urinary-anal area and consists of muscle and connective tissue. It supports the urinary, fecal, sexual and reproductive functions and pelvic statics. The symptoms caused by pelvic floor dysfunction often {{affect the quality of}} life of those who are afflicted, worsening significantly more aspects of daily life. In fact, in addition to providing support to the pelvic organs, the deep floor muscles support urinary continence and intestinal emptying whereas the superficial floor muscles are involved in the mechanism of erection and ejaculation. So, conditions of muscle hypotonia or hypertonicity may affect the efficiency of the pelvic floor, altering both the functionality of the deep and superficial floor muscles. In this evolution of knowledge it is possible imagine how the rehabilitation techniques of pelvic floor muscles, if altered and able to support a voiding or <b>evacuative</b> or sexual dysfunction, may have a role in improving the health and the quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cytomegalovirus is {{the most}} common cause of {{congenital}} infection in the developed countries. Gastrointestinal involvement has been extensively described in both adult and paediatric immunocompromised patients but it is infrequent in congenital or perinatal CMV infection. Case presentation: We report on a case of coexistent congenital Cytomegalovirus infection with intestinal malrotation and positive intestinal Cytomegalovirus biopsy. At birth the neonate showed clinical and radiological evidence of intestinal obstruction. Meconium passed only after <b>evacuative</b> nursing procedures; stooling pattern was irregular; gastric residuals were bile-stained. Laparatomy revealed a complete intestinal malrotation and contextually gastrointestinal biopsy samples of the appendix confirmed the diagnosis of CMV gastrointestinal disease. Intravenous ganciclovir was initiated for 2 weeks, followed by oral valgancyclovir for 6 month. Conclusion: CMV-induced proinflammatory process may be responsible of the interruption of the normal development of the gut or could in turn lead to a disruption in the normal development of the gut potentiating the mechanism causing malrotation. We suggest the hypothesis that an inflammatory process induced by CMV congenital infection may be responsible, in the early gestation, of the intestinal end-organ disease, as the intestinal malrotation. CMV infection should always be excluded in full-term infants presenting with colonic stricture or malrotation...|$|E
40|$|Background- Defecography, {{along with}} other radiologic modalities, {{can be used to}} {{evaluate}} rectal abnormalities such as functional disorders of the rectum. It appears that ethnic habits can influence the <b>evacuative</b> function of the rectum. The main goal {{of this study was to}} compare Iranian and European habits of bowel evacuation on defecographic measurements. Methods- Thirty Iranian patients (21 male, 9 female) referred for barium enema were enrolled in the study. The patients were instructed to defecate using two types of toilet: an unraised, ground-level style (common in Iran), and a bowl with attached tank style (common in Western countries). Radiographs were taken of each patient while defecating into both types of toilet, during which the anorectal angle and other defecographic indices were measured. Results- Use of the Iranian-style toilet yielded a much wider anorectal angle, and a larger distance between the perineum and the horizontal plane of the pelvic floor than the European style. Bowel evacuation was also more complete using the Iranian-style toilet. Conclusion- Use of the Iranian-style toilet seems to be more a more comfortable and efficient method of bowel evacuation than the European style. Further studies are needed to ascertain the optimal approximation of the measurements to standard height of toilets for ordinary use...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPrimary ovarian carcinoid is a {{very rare}} disease. Carcinoid heart disease occurs in about one-third of {{patients}} with carcinoid syndrome. Cardiac involvement may be a {{cause of death in}} this syndrome. Presentation of caseWe presents the unfavourable outcome of a 78 -year-old woman admitted to the hospital complaining severe dyspnea and peripheral oedemas. Because of the presence of a large pericardial effusion with compression of cardiac chambers, an <b>evacuative</b> pericardiocentesis was performed. Computed tomography showed a solid pelvic mass with ascites. She underwent a complete surgical staging. Histological findings revealed an insular carcinoid stage IA. Three weeks later she was readmitted to the hospital and echocardiography demonstrated a right tricuspid valvular involvement with stenosis and severe regurgitation with a 2 cm masses in the posterior mitral leaflet. Hemoculture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Patient was not suitable for surgical intervention and decease due to sepsis and because secondary complications of the mitral endocarditis. DiscussionHigh level of 5 -HIAA has a rule in the development and progression of the carcinoid heart syndrome and could lead the right tricuspid valvular involvement. In the case we presented the bacterial endocarditis worsened the cardiac functions and the clinical conditions before she deceased. ConclusionOvarian primary carcinoid tumors are very rare tumors that require appropriate preoperative diagnosis. Even if survival is usually excellent, when carcinoid syndrome with heart involvement is present, a high level of attention is mandatory to prevent and limit damage caused by the vasoactive amine secreted by the tumor...|$|E

I used informations from the special literature and websites and then from my practical experience from my profession of rescuer. In {{the first part of}} my bachelor thesis I am engaged in basical items of history of Citizen Protection from Emergency Situations with details concerning the evacuation and emergency survival. Then I mention legislative regulation, laws and instructions connected with this problem and I try to bring analysis of the present state. In the chapter Emergency Situations I mention possible exposures of citizens in the Czech Republic, in which the evacuation is needed and I indicate the particular examples of these situations. Thereinafter I decribe the activities and duties of authorities and Integrated Emergency System as the mean subjects responsible for the evacuation and emergency survival of citizens. In the second part of my bachelor thesis I give a summary of the evacuation in the most important points: its provision, the ways of realization, problems of emergency survival. I mention my own ideas including recommendations of citizens. In the practical part I value the results of survey aplicated on the small specimen of citizens in my place of living. In the survey I examine knowledge of citizens relating to the subject of my bachelor thesis. In the conclusion there is a suggestion of <b>evacuative</b> bag by my own conception...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostic curettage, endometrial biopsy, and {{hysteroscopy}} {{are some}} diagnostic methods {{for patients who}} are hospitalized with abnormal uterine bleeding. In fact, curettage is implemented to diagnose uterine complications, treat forgotten abortions, and {{determine the cause of}} infertility. The main objective of the present study is investigating the prevalence of abnormal pathologies in <b>evacuative</b> curettage products in Amiralmomenin Hospital in Zabol from 2013 to 2016. The present descriptive study included 339 patients, aged more than 35 years old, who underwent diagnostic curettage because of abnormal bleeding in Amiralmomenin Hospital in Zabol from 2013 to 2016. Required data was collected using a researcher-made questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS, Version 18. Mean age of patients with cancer turned out to be 45. 75 Â± 1. 98, 54. 4 Â± 1. 33 for atrophy patients, 44. 31 Â± 0. 45 for miscellaneous diagnosis, and 43. 45 Â± 0. 95 for healthy subjects. According to the analysis of the results of sample curettage pathologies, 134 cases (39. 5 %) had Hyperplasia, 7 cases (2. 06 %) had cancer, 40 cases (11. 79 %) had atrophy, 107 cases (31. 5 %) had normal uterus, and 51 cases (15. 04 %) had miscellaneous complications; in case of abnormal bleeding complaints, 159 cases (46. 9 %) had Menorrhagia, 57 cases (16. 8 %) had metrorrhagia, 43 cases (13. 2 %) had menometrorrhagia, and 80 cases (23. 1 %) had postmenopausal bleeding. According to {{the results of the present}} study, abnormal uterine bleeding is the most important clinical sign of endometrial cancer; therefore, it is quite essential for women above 35 years old with uterine bleeding to undergo clinical examination. It is, also, recommended to conduct further studies on the causes of hyperplasia, endometrial cancer prevention, and the impact of hyperplasia treatment.
