5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fog,</b> and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E

In cases with severe defects in the capacity to form social relationships, dating and marriage may not be possible.|$|E

25|$|Ish {{spends most}} of his elderly life <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fog,</b> unaware of the world. Superstition has set in; the tribe has reverted to a {{traditional}} lifestyle, hunting with dogs and bow and arrow. Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack shows him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the gun, whose cartridges do not always work. Ish realizes that the former civilization is now completely gone. But he also wonders if the new world is that much worse off than the old world, and finds himself hoping that the new world will not rebuild civilization and its mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Collishaw {{had quite}} a few close escapes during the war. His plane was hit often by bullets, but Collishaw escaped unscathed in the air. His {{aircraft}} was shot down {{out of control and}} crashed several times. Once, lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fog,</b> he landed on a German aerodrome, and was actually taxiing to the tarmac when he saw German insignia on the grounded planes, and German troops rushing out to arrest him. He opened his throttle wide, took off, and escaped. On another occasion, his goggles were shattered by an enemy bullet. He once had his controls disabled by German machine gun fire from the ground and had to ride out the flight until the aircraft crash-landed – luckily near the British front trenches.|$|E
25|$|Initially Fromentin's {{soldiers}} on the left flank and Florent Joseph Duquesnoy's troops on the right gained ground. Though Jourdan believed {{it was not yet}} time, the powerful politician Lazare Carnot of the Committee of Public Safety insisted that Balland's men immediately assault the village of Dourlers. The attack was launched and was beaten back with losses of about 1,500 men. At the same time Fromentin was repulsed and Duquesnoy was stopped at Wattignies, with a loss of 12 guns. During the night, Jourdan took 6,000 troops from Balland to help Duquesnoy's men capture Wattignies and Coburg assembled 16,400 foot and 6,000 horse to oppose the French. On 16 October, the French moved into position <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> but their first two attacks were defeated; the third assault succeeded and the battle was won.|$|E

500|$|Ring laser {{gyroscopes}} (RLGs) and {{fibre optic}} gyroscopes (FOGs) are interferometers used in navigation systems. [...] They {{operate on the}} principle of the Sagnac effect. The distinction between RLGs and FOGs is that in a RLG, the entire ring is part of the laser while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>FOG,</b> an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an optical fiber ring, and rotation of the system then causes a relative phase shift between those beams. In a RLG, the observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation, while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>FOG,</b> the observed phase shift is proportional to the angular velocity.|$|E
