50|$|An <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> works {{differently}} {{by providing}} an A and a B pulse output that provide no usable count information {{in their own}} right. Rather, the counting {{is done in the}} external electronics. The point where the counting begins depends on the counter in the external electronics and not on the position of the encoder. To provide useful position information, the encoder position must be referenced to the device to which it is attached, generally using an index pulse. The distinguishing feature of the <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> is that it reports an incremental change in position of the encoder to the counting electronics.|$|E
50|$|A {{pseudorandom}} encoder is an electro-mechanical device {{used for}} measuring distance and finding position. It {{is different from}} the conventional absolute and <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> in its disk pattern, which gives it aspects of the other two designs.|$|E
40|$|An <b>incremental</b> shaft <b>encoder</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} and developed for measuring angular velocity of a shaft. The construction of the circuit was achieved using disc of a plastic materials with fifteen slots. Infrared light emitting diode, comparator, photo transistor (sensor), 555 timer, encoder, decoder, differentiator (control logic) and display. Bubble resolver was {{also included in the}} circuits to eliminate ± 1 counting error which is inherent in most digital device. The <b>incremental</b> shaft <b>encoder</b> designed and developed was able to measure maximum speed of 2500 rpm and the corresponding frequency of 625 Hz of a 12 V dc motor after proper calibration in laboratory and testing. The circuit designed and developed is a prototype of an industrial <b>incremental</b> shaft <b>encoder,</b> which replace the imported incremental shaft encoders because of its reliability...|$|R
40|$|Our {{recently}} developed patented instrument, the <b>Incremental</b> Motion <b>Encoder</b> (IME), {{is able to}} monitor the rotation of mechanical systems. Using the disc from an <b>Incremental</b> Shaft <b>Encoder,</b> but with three or more read heads instead of one, the IME is able to resolve small transverse movements of the shaft as well as angular position. However, {{the accuracy of the}} measurements is limited by small distortions in the grating lines of the disc, due either to damage or to manufacturing errors. This paper presents algorithms which use data from the IME to compensate for such errors in the disc, thus enabling automatic self-calibration of the IM...|$|R
50|$|An <b>incremental</b> rotary <b>encoder</b> {{provides}} cyclical outputs (only) {{when the}} encoder is rotated. They {{can be either}} mechanical, optical or magnetic. The mechanical type requires debouncing and is typically used as digital potentiometers on equipment including consumer devices. Most modern home and car stereos use mechanical rotary encoders for volume control. Due to the fact the mechanical switches require debouncing, the mechanical type are limited in the rotational speeds they can handle. The <b>incremental</b> rotary <b>encoder</b> is {{the most widely used}} of all rotary encoders due to its low cost and ability to provide signals that can be easily interpreted to provide motion related information such as velocity.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} on the <b>Incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> is the sine wave encoder. Instead of producing two quadrature square waves, the outputs are quadrature sine waves (a sine and a cosine). By performing the arctangent function, arbitrary levels of resolution can be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Such {{encoders}} can {{be either}} absolute or incremental. The signal from an absolute encoder gives an unambiguous position within the travel range without requiring knowledge of any previous position. The signal from an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> is cyclical, thus ambiguous, and requires counting of cycles to maintain absolute position within the travel range. Both can provide the same accuracy, but the absolute encoder is more robust to interruptions in transducer signal.|$|E
50|$|The disk of a {{pseudorandom}} encoder has an evenly spaced notch design {{just as an}} <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> {{to measure}} distance. A second track of code is used to find the position just like an absolute encoder; however, an absolute encoder tells position from reading from multiple parallel tracks while a pseudorandom encoder uses one single track. This aspect allows pseudorandom rotary encoders to have smaller diameters and larger through-holes. To know its position, the encoder must first move a certain distance to read the code. This distance is generally small, about 1-2 degrees for rotary encoders and 1 mm for linear encoders, though this idiosyncrasy does hinder its usefulness in some applications such as track-balls since position is not immediately known when the system starts.|$|E

One such tool is the Student Design Center (SDC). The SDC utilizes Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology for digital control of motor applications. One of the key factors in motor control is having the capability to measure the rotor position. This thesis lays the ground work for motor position control, and also focuses on the design and implementation of an electrical interface for an <b>Incremental</b> Shaft <b>Encoder</b> with the SDC.

50|$|ST Robotics uses {{technology}} {{which is}} based on hybrid stepping motors as opposed to the more usual DC servo motors. For some years the technology had problems from lack of power and motor resonance. These problems were solved with the advent of rare-earth hybrid motors, high voltage micro-stepping drives and <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> feedback. The robots calibrate themselves by driving each axis slowly to a target sensed by a proximity detector. Incremental optical encoders then track along with the motors to check for errors. This is called closed loop control which differs from servo control in that the stepping motors run essentially an open loop — the loop is only closed {{at the end of each}} movement of the arm. ST’s latest arm, the R12 Mk2, has the encoders only as an option.|$|E

50|$|Though not {{commonly}} referred to as optical mice, nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using LEDs and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and didn't pass through holes in an <b>incremental</b> rotary <b>encoder</b> wheel. Thus the primary distinction of “optical mice” is not their use of optics, but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement, in lieu of an entirely solid-state system.|$|R

40|$|Precise {{motion control}} {{requires}} high-accuracy and high- bandwidth feedback speed information, often calculated by direct {{measurement of the}} rotor position available through the <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> equipping the drive.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{algorithm}} using signals from an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> for estimating a rotating shaft's speed. This algorithm eliminated the oscillations appearing in classical fixed-time and fixed-space algorithms, even when speed was constant. A fixed-time algorithm measures angular displacement at fixed-time intervals, while a fixed-space algorithm measures time every fixed-angular displacement. Time and displacement measurements {{were used to}} generate estimations for speed. The new algorithm generated a unique value for estimating speed due to synchronising encoder pulses and a signal formed by impulses every time increase (delta). A first modification of the proposed algorithm was defined, resulting in the harmonic mean between these two proposed alternatives having the smallest relative error possible. This error was always smaller than half the error with fixed-time and fixed-space algorithms. Experimental setup and algorithms are shown, as well as Simulink results using signals acquired from an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{estimation}} of rotating speed {{is a very important}} problem, specially for systems that works with high dynamics. Actually the most common way to measure velocity is to use an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder.</b> However the precision of the velocity estimation is yet a not completely solved problem. Typically, it is possible to increase the accuracy of the measure increasing the observation time, but during dynamic phenomena this could be dangerous for the efficiency and the stability of the control of the system. In the paper authors have proposed an innovative algorithm for the estimation of velocity starting from the output signal of an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder.</b> The algorithm proposed can be used either at steady state or in dynamic conditions because it has a self adjustable observation time in function of velocity and acceleration of the system.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} a new procedure to identify {{at the same}} time the electrical parameters of a permanent magnet stepper motor (PMSM) and the initial offset of an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder.</b> The model considers effects due to the permanent magnet and to variable reluctance, and the resulting theory is applicable to cases where both or only one of these terms is present. The standard DQ model of PMSM's assumes that the permanent magnet is lined up with a winding when the position is zero. When an <b>incremental</b> <b>encoder</b> is used, an initialization procedure is required to zero the initial offset. In contrast, this paper computes a transformed model that accounts for the initial offset. then develops a least-squares identification algorithm that estimates the machine's electrical parameters together with the offset angle. Experiments show that the estimation procedure and a closed-control method using the estimated offset perform similarly compared to when the offset is reset to zero using an initialization procedure...|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} a {{reflective}} diffraction grating as the medium {{to develop a}} multi-DOF <b>incremental</b> optical <b>encoder</b> for motion stage. The optical encoder can measure three angular displacements, roll, yaw and pitch of the motion stage simultaneously, {{as well as the}} horizontal straightness and linear displacement, summed to five DOF errors of motion stage by only using the positive and negative first-order diffracted light. The grating diffraction theory, Doppler effect, and optical interference technique were used. Two quadrant photodetectors were used to measure the changes in three-dimensional space of diffraction direction of diffracted light, in order to construct a multi-DOF <b>incremental</b> optical <b>encoder.</b> Considering the working stability of a laser diode and preventing the influence of the zeroth-order diffracted light returning to the laser diode, an additional optical isolation system was designed and a wavelength variation monitoring module was created.
