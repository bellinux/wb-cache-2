5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the <b>forward</b> <b>tilt,</b> and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E

It would normally be tilted towards the right. Originally, the hat was worn for horseriding and travelling.|$|E
6000|$|At eleven {{they went}} to church in Crocusville. The back of the pine bench on which she sat had a penitential <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> that would have brought St. Simeon down, in jealousy, from his pillar. The preacher singled her out, and thundered upon her vicarious head the damnation of the world. At each side of her an adamant parent held her rigidly to the bar of judgment. An ant crawled upon her neck, but she dared not move. She lowered her eyes before the congregation--a hundred-eyed Cerberus that watched the gates through which her sins were fast {{thrusting}} her. Her soul {{was filled with a}} delirious, almost a fanatic joy. For she was out of the clutch of the tyrant, Freedom. Dogma and creed pinioned her with beneficent cruelty, as steel braces bind the feet of a crippled child. She was hedged, adjured, shackled, shored up, strait-jacketed, silenced, ordered. When they came out the minister stopped to greet them. Mary could only hang her head and answer [...] "Yes, sir," [...] and [...] "No, sir," [...] to his questions. When she saw that the other women carried their hymn-books at their waists with their left hands, she blushed and moved hers there, too, from her right.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Postural {{control is}} {{important}} for daily activities like reaching and sitting. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) form {{the largest group of}} children with disturbances in postural control. Two levels can be distinguished in postural control: 1) a basic level of direction-specificity, meaning that perturbations inducing a forward sway of the body are accompanied by primary muscle activity on the dorsal side of the body and vice versa and 2) fine-tuning of the direction-specific activity on the basis of afferent input. This pilot study explores the influence of different sitting positions on the stability of the head in space, the kinematic quality of reaching and EMG-parameters of postural control in school-aged children with CP. Methods: Four children aged 8 - 12 years, GMFCS level I-II with unilateral or bilateral spastic CP participated in the study. They were assessed during reaching in four different sitting positions: horizontal seat surface with and without foot support and <b>tilted</b> <b>forward</b> 15 ° with and without foot support. Postural control was measured using surface EMGs of arm, neck, trunk and leg muscles. Movements were recorded kinematically using the SIMI Motion System. Data analysis was carried out with the PedEMG program and the SIMI Motion 3 D program. Data were interpreted by ‘eye balling’ graphs of the effect of sitting condition of the individual children. Results: Overall, posture and reaching of the children with CP was characterized by variation. The data suggested that in the conditions without foot support a <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> seat surface in comparison to the horizontal situation was associated with a better quality of reaching and an inconsistent effect on head stability and postural muscle activity. In the horizontal position addition of foot support seemed to be associated with an inconsistent effect on head stability, but a better quality of reaching, and better postural muscle activity. However, foot support in the <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> condition seemed not to be associated with improved head stability, reaching and posture. Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study indicate that in the situation of the absence of foot support <b>forward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the seat surface may be associated with a better quality of reaching without affecting postural control. Also the addition of foot support in the horizontal position may {{have a positive effect on}} the quality of reaching without a consistent positive effect on posture. A similar positive effect of foot support seemed absent in the <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> position. Further research with larger groups is needed for scientific evidence on the effect of the various sitting conditions on reaching and posture of children with CP. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose Because it is {{debatable}} whether seat surface inclination improves motor function {{in children with}} cerebral palsy (CP), the effect of seat surface tilting on postural control and quality of reaching was studied. Subjects The subjects were 58 children with CP aged 2 to 11 years (34 with unilateral spastic CP, 24 with bilateral spastic Cl?). Methods During the task of reaching movements, surface electromyographic and kinematic data were recorded for posture and reaching with the dominant arm in 3 sitting conditions: horizontal seat surface, seat surface <b>tilted</b> <b>forward</b> 15 degrees, and seat surface tilted back-ward 15 degrees. Results In the children with unilateral spastic CP, <b>forward</b> <b>tilting</b> improved postural efficiency and quality of reaching. In the children with bilateral spastic CP, both <b>forward</b> and backward <b>tilting</b> of the seat surface was associated with more postural instability and {{did not affect the}} quality of reaching. Discussion and Conclusion The results suggest that, in terms of postural control and quality of reaching, children with unilateral spastic CP benefit from a forward-tilted position and children with bilateral spastic CP benefit from a horizontal sitting position...|$|R

30|$|Squat {{biomechanics}} {{differ significantly}} between cam-FAI patients and controls; the former exhibiting less pelvic sagittal rotation (in accordance with point 1) and squatting higher, especially if cheating with knee separation is not allowed. The reduced sagittal back tilt keeps FAI-associated pelves <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> even in maximum squat depth, when femoroacetabular engagement {{is more likely}} to occur. Surgical correction of cam deformity allows deeper squat, but does not significantly affect the pelvic kinematics. Remarkably, sagittal pelvic ROM is found to be a relevant variable to determine whether a hip affected by cam deformity will be symptomatic or not. Unfortunately squat biomechanics of pincer-FAI has not yet been explored.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{hemisphere}} is horizontal, {{it is like}} a spinning top, and applies negligible torque to its contact point on the ground. When tipped on edge, however, it pulls like a traditional circular wheel. The torque can be quickly vectored in any direction by tilting {{the hemisphere}} side-to-side and/or front-to-back. For example, if the hemisphere is spinning clockwise, tilting it to the right will [...] "pull" [...] the vehicle <b>forward,</b> <b>tilting</b> it to the left will [...] "push" [...] the vehicle backward, and front-to-back tilt will push left or right. Notably, the torque is proportional to the hemisphere's tilt, providing performance similar to an infinite gear ratio, but without any gears.|$|R
5000|$|Faucalized voice, {{also called}} hollow voice or yawny voice, is a vocal quality of speech {{production}} {{characterized by the}} vertical expansion of the pharyngeal cavity due to the lowering of the larynx. It is termed faucalized because of the stretching of the fauces and visible narrowing of the faucial pillars {{in the back of}} the oral cavity. During faucalized voice, the sides of pharynx expand outward and the larynx descends and <b>tilts</b> <b>forward.</b> The term [...] "yawny voice" [...] is appropriate to compare this voice quality to the physiological act of yawning. Its opposite is harsh voice, a vocal quality produced when the pharynx is contracted and the larynx raised. Faucalized voice is not to be confused with breathy voice, which involves relaxed vocal folds, greater velocity of airflow through the glottis and produces a lower pitch sound. Faucalized voice involves the <b>forward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the larynx which stretches the vocal folds and produces a higher pitch sound, despite the increased volume of the pharyngeal cavity.|$|R

It was surprising to find that his knee kinematics still revealed a crouch gait pattern when comparing GRAFOs and shoes only conditions. It appears that the orthotics in this case prevented lower limb flexion rather than facilitated extension. The subject wore standard sports shoes with a higher heel than the forefoot, which might have caused <b>forward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the tibia, leading to flexion at all levels. The GRAFOs also supported him and, with proprioceptive feedback, facilitated leaning forward against the orthotics rather than knee extension.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} the Abeille was {{directed}} by René Dorand at the helicopter division of SNCAC. An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the hub, tapered strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. <b>Forward</b> <b>tilt</b> of the rotor shafts was automatically linked to forward speed. A single lever controlled both the collective pitch and the throttle through an electrical link. The Abeille was powered by a [...] Renault 12S, an inverted, liquid-cooled V-12 engine.|$|E
50|$|The Romantic era {{marked the}} rise of the {{ballerina}} as a central part of ballet, where previously men had dominated performances. There had always been admiration for superior dancers, but elevating ballerinas to the level of celebrity came into its own in the nineteenth century, especially as female performers became idealized and objectified. Marie Taglioni became the prototypical Romantic ballerina, praised highly for her lyricism. The movement style for Romantic ballerinas was characterized by soft, rounded arms and a <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> in the upper body. This gave the woman a flowery, willowy look. Leg movements became more elaborate due to the new tutu length and rising standards of technical proficiency. Important Romantic ballerinas included Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Lucille Grahn, Fanny Cerrito, and Fanny Elssler. The plots of many ballets were dominated by spirit women—sylphs, wilis, and ghosts, who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men and made it impossible for them to live happily in the real world.|$|E

Subjects were asked to set their extended arm normal to gravity for different pitch body tilts up to 9 degrees. True FB were provided at all body tilt angles, whereas false FB were provided only at 6 degrees backward and 6 degrees <b>forward</b> body <b>tilts</b> for half of the trials. Our data confirmed previous results about the egocentric influence of body tilt itself upon SPH: estimates were linearly lowered with <b>forward</b> <b>tilts</b> and elevated with backward tilts. In addition, results showed a significant effect {{of the nature of the}} external FB provided to the subjects. When subjects received a false FB inducing a 3 degrees forward bias relative to physical body tilt, they set their SPH consequently higher than when they received a false FB inducing a 3 degrees backward bias. These findings clearly indicated that false cognitive information about body tilt might significantly modify the judgement of a geocentric direction of space, such as the SPH.
