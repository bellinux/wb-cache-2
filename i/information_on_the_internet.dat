A few authors of popular literature {{have noted the}} church, even using it as background for various works. Notes regarding the Two by Twos appeared even more infrequently in religious journals and sociological works, with some writers assuming that the church had greatly declined, with nothing published regarding it.

2500|$|According to Chinese studies expert Johan Lagerkvist, {{scholars}} Pierre Bourdieu and Michel de Certeau {{argue that}} this culture of satire is a weapon of resistance against authority. [...] This is because criticism against authority often resulted in satirical parodies that “presupposes and confirms emancipation” of the supposedly oppressed people. [...] Academic writer Linda Hutcheon argues that some people, however, may view satirical language used to criticize the government as “complicity,” which can “reinforce rather than subvert conservative attitudes.” Chinese experts Perry Link and Xiao Qiang, however, oppose this argument. They claimed that when sarcastic terms develop into common vocabulary of netizens, these terms would lose their sarcastic characteristic. They then become normal terms that carry significant political meanings that oppose the government. Xiao believes that the netizens’ freedom to spread <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> has forced the government to listen to popular demands of netizens. For example, the Ministry of Information Technology’s plan to preinstall mandatory censoring software called Green Dam Youth Escort on computers failed after popular online opposition against it in 2009, {{the year of the}} 20th anniversary of the protest.|$|E

2500|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{estimated}} that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old {{results in a}} relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were {{just as likely to}} die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect might be less in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is “no longer effective” at preventing deaths and “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet.</b> [...] The review also concluded that [...] "half or more" [...] of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment. They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because these changes would not have progressed into invasive cancer.|$|E
