5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. <b>Euchromatin</b> is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a widespread}} mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation. In eukaryotes the structure of chromatin, controlled by the histone code, regulates access to DNA with significant impacts on the expression of genes in <b>euchromatin</b> and heterochromatin areas.|$|E
25|$|Interphase: The {{structure}} of chromatin during interphase of mitosis is optimized to allow simple access of transcription and DNA repair factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the nucleus. The structure {{varies depending on}} the access required to the DNA. Genes that require regular access by RNA polymerase require the looser structure provided by <b>euchromatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|DNA {{packaged}} in heterochromatin, {{such as the}} Xi, is more condensed than DNA {{packaged in}} <b>euchromatin,</b> such as the Xa. The inactive X forms a discrete body within the nucleus called a Barr body. The Barr body is generally located {{on the periphery of}} the nucleus, is late replicating within the cell cycle, and, as it contains the Xi, contains heterochromatin modifications and the Xist RNA.|$|E
25|$|The X {{chromosome}} is notably {{larger and}} has a more active <b>euchromatin</b> region than its Y chromosome counterpart. Further comparison of the X and Y reveal regions of homology between the two. However, the corresponding region in the Y appears far shorter and lacks regions that are conserved in the X throughout primate species, implying a genetic degeneration for Y in that region. Because males have only one X chromosome, {{they are more likely}} to have an X chromosome-related disease.|$|E
25|$|Acetylated histones, octameric {{proteins}} that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent {{a type of}} epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing {{the interaction of the}} N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as <b>euchromatin.</b> More condensed (tightly packed) DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.|$|E
25|$|In {{organisms that}} use {{this method of}} dosage compensation, the {{presence}} {{of one or more}} X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name “MSL” is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male Drosophila. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family—maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3—are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of <b>euchromatin.</b> Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread {{along the length of the}} chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.|$|E

2500|$|The {{eukaryotic}} genome {{is organized}} into a compact chromatin structure that allows only regulated access to DNA. The chromatin structure can be globally [...] "open" [...] and more transcriptionally permissive, or globally [...] "condensed" [...] and transcriptionally inactive. The former (<b>euchromatin)</b> is lightly packed and rich in genes under active transcription. The latter (heterochromatin) includes gene-poor regions such as telomeres and centromeres but also regions [...] with normal gene density but transcriptionally silenced. Transcription can be silenced by histone modification (deaceltylation and methylation), RNA interference, and/or DNA methylation.|$|E
2500|$|Active {{transcription}} {{units are}} clustered in the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories or <b>euchromatin.</b> Such sites can be visualized by allowing engaged polymerases {{to extend their}} transcripts in tagged precursors (Br-UTP or Br-U) and immuno-labeling the tagged nascent RNA. Transcription factories can also be localized using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} or marked by antibodies directed against polymerases. There are ~10,000 factories in the nucleoplasm of a HeLa cell, among which are ~8,000 polymerase II factories and ~2,000 polymerase III factories. Each polymerase II factory contains ~8 polymerases. As most active transcription units are associated with only one polymerase, each factory usually contains ~8 different transcription units. These units might be associated through promoters and/or enhancers, with loops forming a [...] "cloud" [...] around the factor.|$|E
2500|$|Q-banding is a {{fluorescent}} pattern obtained using quinacrine for staining. The pattern of bands {{is very similar}} to that seen in G-banding.They can be recognized by a yellow fluorescence of differing intensity. Most part of the stained DNA is heterochromatin. Quinacrin (atebrin) binds both regions rich in AT and in GC, but only the AT-quinacrin-complex fluoresces. Since regions rich in AT are more common in heterochromatin than in <b>euchromatin,</b> these regions are labelled preferentially. The different intensities of the single bands mirror the different contents of AT. Other fluorochromes like DAPI or Hoechst 33258 lead also to characteristic, reproducible patterns. Each of them produces its specific pattern. In other words: the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in AT. Rather, the distribution of AT and the association of AT with other molecules like histones, for example, influences the binding properties of the fluorochromes.|$|E
2500|$|Chromatin's {{structure}} is currently poorly understood despite {{being subjected to}} intense investigation. Its structure depends on several factors. The overall structure depends {{on the stage of}} the cell cycle. During interphase, the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to RNA and DNA polymerases that transcribe and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the genes present on the DNA. [...] That DNA which codes genes that are actively transcribed ("turned on") is more loosely packaged and associated with RNA polymerases (referred to as <b>euchromatin)</b> while that DNA which codes inactive genes ("turned off") is more condensed and associated with structural proteins (heterochromatin). Epigenetic chemical modification of the structural proteins in chromatin also alters the local chromatin structure, in particular chemical modifications of histone proteins by methylation and acetylation. As the cell prepares to divide, i.e. enters [...] mitosis or meiosis, the chromatin packages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the chromosomes during anaphase. During this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual chromosomes in many cells visible by optical microscope.|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>euchromatin</b> {{appears as}} light-colored bands when stained in G banding and {{observed}} under an optical microscope, {{in contrast to}} heterochromatin, which stains darkly. This lighter staining {{is due to the}} less compact structure of <b>euchromatin.</b> The basic structure of <b>euchromatin</b> is an elongated, open, 10 nm microfibril, as noted by electron microscopy. In prokaryotes, <b>euchromatin</b> is the only form of chromatin present; this indicates that the heterochromatin structure evolved later along with the nucleus, possibly as a mechanism to handle increasing genome size.|$|E
50|$|<b>Euchromatin</b> {{participates in}} the active {{transcription}} of DNA to mRNA products. The unfolded structure allows gene regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase complexes to bind to the DNA sequence, which can then initiate the transcription process. Not all <b>euchromatin</b> is necessarily transcribed, but in general that which is not is transformed into heterochromatin to protect the genes while {{they are not in}} use. There is therefore a direct link to how actively productive a cell is and the amount of <b>euchromatin</b> that can be found in its nucleus. It is thought that the cell uses transformation from <b>euchromatin</b> into heterochromatin as a method of controlling gene expression and replication, since such processes behave differently on densely compacted chromatin, known as the 'accessibility hypothesis'. One example of constitutive <b>euchromatin</b> that is 'always turned on' is housekeeping genes, which code for the proteins needed for basic functions of cell survival.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eu{{chromatin}}</b> is {{a lightly}} packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA and protein) that is enriched in genes, {{and is often}} (but not always) under active transcription. <b>Euchromatin</b> comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus. 92% {{of the human genome}} is euchromatic. The remainder is called heterochromatin.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} of <b>euchromatin</b> {{is reminiscent of}} an unfolded set of beads along a string, wherein those beads represent nucleosomes. Nucleosomes consist of eight proteins known as histones, with approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wound around them; in <b>euchromatin,</b> this wrapping is loose so that the raw DNA may be accessed. Each core histone possesses a 'tail' structure, which can vary in several ways; {{it is thought that}} these variations act as [...] "master control switches", which determine the overall arrangement of the chromatin. In particular, it is believed that the presence of methylated lysine 4 on the histone tails acts as a general marker for <b>euchromatin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Chromatin {{is found}} in two varieties: <b>euchromatin</b> and heterochromatin. Originally, the two forms were {{distinguished}} cytologically by how intensely they stained - the <b>euchromatin</b> is less intense, while heterochromatin stains intensely, indicating tighter packing. Heterochromatin is usually localized to {{the periphery of the}} nucleus.Despite this early dichotomy, recent evidence in both animals and plants has suggested that there are more than two distinct heterochromatin states, and it may in fact exist in four or five 'states', each marked by different combinations of epigenetic marks.|$|E
50|$|Epigenetic {{factors are}} also {{thought to be}} {{involved}} in the actual reprogramming of somatic cells in order to induce pluripotency. It has been theorized that certain epigenetic factors might actually work to clear the original somatic epigenetic marks in order to acquire the new epigenetic marks that are part of achieving a pluripotent state. Chromatin is also reorganized in iPSCs and becomes like that found in ESCs in that it is less condensed and therefore more accessible. <b>Euchromatin</b> modifications are also common which is also consistent with the state of <b>euchromatin</b> found in ESCs.|$|E
5000|$|Artemis {{functions}} in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks that arise by induced oxidative reactions, or by endogenous reactions. [...] Such DNA repair occurs in heterochromatin {{as well as in}} <b>euchromatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{regions of}} DNA {{packaged}} in facultative heterochromatin {{will not be}} consistent between the cell types within a species, and thus a sequence in one cell that is packaged in facultative heterochromatin (and the genes within are poorly expressed) may be packaged in <b>euchromatin</b> in another cell (and the genes within are no longer silenced). However, the formation of facultative heterochromatin is regulated, and {{is often associated with}} morphogenesis or differentiation. An example of facultative heterochromatin is X chromosome inactivation in female mammals: one X chromosome is packaged as facultative heterochromatin and silenced, while the other X chromosome is packaged as <b>euchromatin</b> and expressed.|$|E
50|$|Heterochromatin mainly {{consists}} of genetically inactive satellite sequences, and many genes are repressed to various extents, although some cannot {{be expressed in}} <b>euchromatin</b> at all. Both centromeres and telomeres are heterochromatic, as is the Barr body of the second, inactivated X-chromosome in a female.|$|E
50|$|More than 95% {{of cases}} of FSHD are {{associated}} with the deletion of integral copies of a tandemly repeated 3.2kb unit (D4Z4 repeat) at the subtelomeric region 4q35 on Chromosome 4 of the human genome, of which a normal chromosome includes between 11-150 repetitions of D4Z4. There are both heterochromatin and <b>euchromatin</b> structures within D4Z4 and one putative gene called DUX4. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, though up to one-third of the cases appear to be from de novo (new) mutations. The heterochromatin is specifically lost in the deletions of FSHD while the <b>euchromatin</b> structures remain. If the entire region is removed, there are birth defects, but no specific defects on skeletal muscle. Individuals appear to require the existence of 11 or fewer repeat units to be at risk for FSHD.|$|E
50|$|TERRA {{can also}} {{regulate}} telomere length by increasing <b>euchromatin</b> formation. On the other hand, nonsense-mediated decay factor enrichment at telomeres may exist to prevent TERRA inhibition of telomerase. TERRA levels vary during the cell cycle, decreasing during S phase, and increasing {{in the transition}} from G2 phase to G1 phase.|$|E
50|$|Centric {{heterochromatin}} {{is usually}} formed on alpha satellite DNA in humans; however, {{there have been}} cases where centric heterochromatin and centromeres have formed on originally <b>euchromatin</b> domains lacking alpha satellite DNA; this usually happens {{as a result of}} a chromosome breakage event and the formed centromere is called a neocentromere.|$|E
50|$|However, on {{a larger}} scale, {{chromosomes}} are heterogeneous {{in the context of}} <b>euchromatin</b> and heterochromatin composition. As well, there is evidence of gene rich and poor regions and various domains associated with cell differentiation, active or repressed gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA recombination and repair. All of these help determine chromosome territories.|$|E
