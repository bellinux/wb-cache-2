5|$|Makemake is {{currently}} visually the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 {{in the constellation}} Coma Berenices. This <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> enough to be visible using a high-end amateur telescope.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> deep orange, marbled with numerous dark lines. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> orange, suffusedly margined with dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 40-42 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow, {{the base}} with a bluish-black shining streak. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow, the apical part dull brownish black.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 30-32 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> orange, but blue blackish at the base. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> orange with a purple-blackish streak {{along the}} dorsum. The apical fifth is purple blackish.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> {{enough to}} be seen with the naked eye, even with some light pollution. Andromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the Northern Hemisphere, when from {{mid-latitudes}} the galaxy reaches zenith and can be seen almost all night. From the Southern Hemisphere, it is a springtime object and does not reach a high altitude over the northern horizon, thus making it difficult to observe. Binoculars can reveal some larger structures and its two brightest satellite galaxies, M32 and M110. An amateur telescope can reveal Andromeda's disk, dark dust lanes, the large star cloud NGC 206, and even some of its brightest globular clusters.|$|E
50|$|Altogether three {{regions of}} HRD are present here: low mass {{end of the}} main sequence, {{complete}} red giant branch and horizontal branch. In infrared red stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter,</b> that's why red stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter</b> in this diagram making the lower main sequence shallower than usual. On the other hand, the horizontal branch becomes steeper in this diagram due to IR effects (on the HB the blue end is fainter and the red end <b>is</b> <b>brighter).</b>|$|R
5|$|Coma Berenices <b>is</b> not {{particularly}} <b>bright,</b> as {{none of its}} stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter</b> than fourth magnitude, although there <b>are</b> 66 stars <b>brighter</b> {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5.|$|R

5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is {{medium-sized}} for its genus, being larger than, for example, O.bicolor, but {{smaller than}} O.concolor and O.mamorae. Its short, soft, and fine fur <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> ochraceous brown to pale tawny on the upperparts, changing moderately abruptly into the generally gray underparts. The fur on the chin, throat, {{and part of}} the belly is entirely white. The head is more grayish {{than the rest of the}} upperparts and the eyelids are black. Short hairs thinly cover the external ears, which are brown to gray-brown in color. The short and broad hindfeet are dirty white and show some characters that are typical of the genus, including well-developed pads and tufts of hair on the digits and a long fifth digit. The tail is slightly longer than the head and body on average, but relatively short for the genus. It is uniformly brown, but with a somewhat paler portion below near its base. Sparsely haired, the tail ends in a rudimentary pencil. There is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|The Sanjō branch, {{named after}} a street in Kyoto and founded by Sanjō Munechika around 1000, is the oldest school in Yamashiro Province. In the early Kamakura period {{it was the most}} {{advanced}} school of swordsmanship in Japan. Sanjō Munechika's pieces, together with those of Yasutsuna from Hōki Province, consist of some of the oldest curved Japanese swords and mark the start of the old sword (kotō) period. Sanjō school's sugata is characterized by a much narrower upper area compared to the bottom, small kissaki, torii-zori and deep koshi-zori. The jihada uses good quality steel with abundant ji-nie and chikei, small mokume-hada mixed with wavy, large hada. The hamon <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> and covered with thick nioi. It is based on suguha mixed with small chōji midare. Hataraki appear along the temper line.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 34 mm. The head and thorax <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> grass green with whitish edges. The abdomen is paler green. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> grass green with a straight darker green postmedial line. The hindwings are paler green and the underside is green.|$|R

5|$|The Triangulum Galaxy, {{also known}} as Messier 33, was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> enough {{to be seen by}} the naked eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts {{from its}} crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna resurrected {{the question of}} which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern–Levison parameter estimated to be much less than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> enough, and therefore large enough, that this {{is expected to be}} the case, and several astronomers have called it one.|$|E

5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

25|$|The blacktip trevally's {{colouration}} is distinctive, {{with the}} upper body being dark bronze to yellow green while the lower body fades to silvery white below. The caudal fin <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> to olive yellow, with the top half normally black to dark, giving the species its common name. Other fins range from bright yellow to dusky with little yellow at all. The species also lacks the dark spot on the opercular margin that many related species possess.|$|E
25|$|The word {{peridotite}} {{comes from}} the gemstone peridot, which consists of pale green olivine. Classic peridotite <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> green with some specks of black, although most hand samples tend to be darker green. Peridotitic outcrops typically range from earthy bright yellow to dark green in color; this is because olivine is easily weathered to iddingsite. While green and yellow {{are the most common}} colors, peridotitic rocks may exhibit a wide range of colors such as blue, brown, and red.|$|E
