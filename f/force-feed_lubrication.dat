50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inclined cylinders, arranged {{outside the}} plate frames. The piston valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, while the reversing gear {{was controlled by}} a combination of hand and steam mechanism. The locomotives were superheated and their smokeboxes were equipped with Stone's Patent louvre spark arrestors. Their coupled wheel axleboxes were provided with mechanical <b>force-feed</b> <b>lubrication.</b> They were the first locomotives in South Africa to be equipped with exhaust steam injectors, which were of the Davies and Metcalfe pattern.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary bench {{tests have}} been carried out on an original-design 2 -stroke single-cylinder {{prototype}} engine, which is equipped with an electronically controlled gasoline direct injection apparatus. The main design and operating features of the engine concern: a unidirectional airflow during the scavenging process (from the inlet ports near the BDC to overhead cam-actuated valves), an external air pump (a Roots volumetric type driven by an electric motor) and a <b>force-feed</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, like those usually exploited in mass-produced 4 -stroke engines. Experimental bench tests were carried out under low load, intermediate rotational speed operating conditions. The performances were compared to those obtained from a commercial crankcase-scavenged 2 -stroke engine using an indirect injection fuel feeding system. Encouraging results were obtained as far as fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are concerned. Other improvements are expected thanks to scheduled modifications regarding a new piston design along with a new arrangement of both the spark-plugs and the injector positio...|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} 2 -stroke prototype engine, {{equipped with}} an electronically controlled gasoline direct-injection apparatus, has been tested {{over the last few}} years, and the performances of these tests have been compared with those obtained using a commercial crankcase-scavenged 2 -stroke engine. Very satisfactory results have been obtained, as far as fuel consumption and unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas are concerned. Large reductions in fuel consumption and in unburned hydrocarbons have been made possible, because the injection timing causes all the injected gasoline to remain in the combustion chamber, and thus {{to take part in the}} combustion process. Moreover, a <b>force-feed</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, like those usually exploited in mass-produced 4 -stroke engines, has been employed, because of the presence of an external pump. In fact, it is no longer necessary to add oil to the gasoline in the engine, as the gasoline does not pass through the crankcase volume. The aim of this paper is to present the main features of a new 2 -stroke engine, which mainly pertain to the adoption of a turbo compressor for the scavenging and supercharging processes, as well as a small volumetric impeller for the start transitory. Because of its limited size, weight and high specific power output, this engine should be of particular interest for range extender applications in electric vehicles. A numerical simulation has been carried out, to confirm results of the experimental phase, by means of a one-dimensional model that has furnished encouraging results...|$|E
