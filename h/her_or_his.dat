5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> tricks.|$|E
5|$|The rider's {{experience}} {{is dependent upon}} the location of <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> seat on the train. Screens are located {{on both sides of}} the track but the only continuous screen on the track is on the right-hand side. The train makes several tight turns during the ride; riders facing forward experience all the animations while riders facing backward miss some scenes because of the lack of screen space. The cars rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face the screens; forward-facing riders rotate toward the continuous screen.|$|E

25|$|A person {{perceives}} {{something that}} provokes anxiety. The person tries {{to reduce the}} anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms {{a sense of security}} and reduces anxiety. The person returns to <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> everyday activities.|$|E

25|$|The events {{begin the}} same way as the security-based strategy. A person {{perceives}} something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.|$|E

50|$|Personality is {{the overall}} {{characteristics}} {{that a person}} possesses. All of these characteristics are acquired within a culture. However, when a person changes <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> culture, <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> personality automatically changes because the person learns to follow the norms {{and values of the}} new culture, and this, in turn, influences the individual's personal characteristics.|$|R

25|$|Abraham Maslow {{states that}} {{psychological}} health {{is not possible}} unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted, loved and respected by others and by <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> self. Self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence, benevolence and optimism, and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} has taken a firm stance against human trafficking both within its borders and beyond. Domestically, human trafficking is a federal crime under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1584 makes {{it a crime to}} force a person to work against <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> will, or to sell a person into a condition of involuntary servitude.|$|E
25|$|Jealousy {{refers to}} the thoughts, feelings, and {{behaviors}} that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, {{it is not surprising}} that attachment also relates to jealousy.|$|E

5000|$|Macrosystem: Describes {{the culture}} in which {{individuals}} live. Cultural contexts include developing and industrialized countries, socioeconomic status, poverty, and ethnicity. A child, <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> parent, <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> school, and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> parent's workplace {{are all part of}} a large cultural context. Members of a cultural group share a common identity, heritage, and values. The macrosystem evolves over time, because each successive generation may change the macrosystem, leading to their development in a unique macrosystem.|$|R
25|$|Resistance is often, at the least, understandably protective: As {{anyone who}} can {{remember}} <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> own first uneasy encounters with particularly challenging new theories or theorists can attest, resistance serves to shield us from uncomfortable shifts or all-out upheavals in perception and understanding-shifts in perception which, if honored, force us to inhabit the world in fundamentally new and different ways.|$|E

25|$|The old Tsarist Copyright law of 1911 was not {{immediately}} invalidated after the October Revolution. The old law, with its copyright term of 50 years after the author's death and its possibility of transferring copyrights in their entirety from an author to a publisher, continued to be valid initially. But the nationalizations {{in all areas of}} the economy soon considerably restricted the avenues through which an author could publish <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> work, even if <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> copyright remained initially untouched. All publishing activities were placed {{under the supervision of the}} State Publishing house by a decree of May 21, 1919. On July 29, 1919, the government declared a state monopoly on unpublished works of deceased authors; and on April 20, 1920, all books (including those in private possession) were nationalized, except those in public libraries. Theatres and film studios as well as the photographic industry were nationalized in August 1919. Private publishing houses were eventually liquidated as well. The right to translate foreign publications into Russian was also monopolized by the government.|$|E

25|$|The {{ruling was}} a three-part {{definition}} comprising descent, self-identification and community identification. The first part – descent – was genetic descent and unambiguous, but led to cases where {{a lack of}} records to prove ancestry excluded some. Self- and community identification were more problematic as they meant that an Indigenous person separated from <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> community due to a family dispute could no longer identify as Aboriginal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} the Old Lady finally agrees {{to sit for}} George, losing herself in fond {{memories}} of his childhood that George repeatedly disputes. She bemoans Paris's changing skyline, and he encourages her to see the beauty {{in the world as}} it is, rather than how it has been ("Beautiful"). The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> child, able to offer only a feeble apology as Dot departs sadly.|$|E
25|$|Although Lee {{seemed to}} invite a {{full-scale}} reconsideration {{of the doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, subsequent Supreme Court decisions in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corporation, 337 U.S. 682 (1949) and Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643 (1962) sharply limited the impact of the Lee Court's decision. Larson and Malone specifically carved out only two areas in which an officer of the United States may be sued: 1) If the officer acts outside <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> legally prescribed scope of authority, or 2) If the officer acts {{in a way that is}} unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|An I/O psychologist, {{whether an}} academic, a consultant, or an employee, must {{maintain}} high ethical standards. The APA's ethical principles apply to I/O psychologists. For example, ethically, the I/O psychologist should only accept projects {{for which he}} or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an I/O psychologist works outside <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while adhering to the ethical standards set at home.|$|E
25|$|Impeachment {{proceedings}} may be commenced by {{a member}} of the House of Representatives on <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> own initiative, either by presenting a list of the charges under oath, or by asking for referral to the appropriate committee. The impeachment process may be initiated by non-members. For example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a federal judge be impeached, a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment may come from a special prosecutor, the President, or state or territorial legislature, grand jury, or by petition.|$|E
25|$|Sickle-cell {{conditions}} have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance from parents.

If one parent has sickle-cell anaemia and the other has sickle-cell trait, then the child has a 50% chance of having sickle-cell disease and a 50% chance of having sickle-cell trait. When both parents have sickle-cell trait, a child has a 25% chance of sickle-cell disease, 25% do not carry any sickle-cell alleles, and 50% have the heterozygous condition.|$|E

In other words, a process that departs from that which is particular and takes an interest in that which is universal, like a horizon that retreats the more we approach it and as a process constructed with the Other. In this sense, three conditions underlie trust: hope, love, and faith...|$|R
