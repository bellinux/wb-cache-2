5|$|First-team coach Ronnie Moran {{took charge}} of team affairs for several weeks before Graeme Souness was named as Dalglish's successor. Under Souness, Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1992, but nothing else. He made way for Roy Evans, who also won just one trophy, the League Cup, before Gérard Houllier was {{appointed}} <b>joint</b> <b>manager</b> with Evans in 1998. This arrangement lasted only 18 games before Evans resigned, leaving Houllier—Liverpool's first non-British manager—in sole charge. Houllier won nothing until a treble in 2001, consisting of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season, but the squad was unaffected and managed {{to hold on to}} a second-place finish. Although Phil Thompson stepped in as temporary manager while Houllier was recovering from heart surgery, the matches played under Thompson are included in Houllier's record. Another League Cup was won in 2003, but this was to be Houllier's last trophy as Liverpool manager as he and the club parted by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, to be replaced by Valencia manager, Rafael Benítez.|$|E

Brigadier Green was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a semi-conscious condition, suffering from a probable fractured nose, and Brown was treated for cuts to the head and left knee. Brown, who had four stitches inserted in his left knee and two in his head, is reported to have said soon after the accident that he would play today. Doctors at the hospital, however, think it is doubtful, because he will be suffering from stiffness. Brown told the police that he was driving along North Terrace when he swerved to avoid another car. In doing so he crashed head-on into a tram standard {{in the middle of the}} road.|$|E

25|$|The 1964–65 league season {{started with}} an Edinburgh derby defeat by Hearts, but Hibs managed {{to recover from}} this setback. Stein then invited Real Madrid for a {{friendly}} game in Edinburgh, which Hibernian won 2–0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 32,000, further boosting his prestige. Wolves asked Stein if he wanted to replace Stan Cullis as their manager. Stein then approached Celtic chairman Bob Kelly, ostensibly to ask his advice about the Wolves job, but in the hope that he would be offered the Celtic manager's post. Kelly first offered Stein the position of assistant manager (to Sean Fallon), which Stein rejected. Kelly then offered Stein the chance to be <b>joint</b> <b>manager</b> with Fallon, but this was also rejected by Stein, who insisted on full control and suggested he would take the Wolves job instead. Billy McNeill believed that Kelly's initial reluctance was due to Stein's religion. Kelly eventually agreed to offer Stein full powers over team selection. Hibs tried to convince Stein to stay, even attempting to persuade his wife Jean, but becoming Celtic manager had been his long-held ambition. While Stein was still Hibs manager, he arranged for Celtic to sign Bertie Auld from Birmingham City and allowed Hibs goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson to join Celtic. Some people claimed with hindsight that he had deliberately allowed Simpson to join Celtic before moving himself, but in fact it was due to a wage dispute.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineering}} of the Morden {{extension of}} the C from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding, running in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station, which was constructed in a cutting. The line then runs under the wide station forecourt and public road outside the station, to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, in which the UERL held a stake, but agreements were made with the Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. The Southern Railway later built the surface line from Wimbledon to Sutton, via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension opened in 1926, with seven new stations, all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally, Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing these designs Frank Pick, Assistant <b>Joint</b> <b>Manager</b> of the UERL, decided Holden should take over the project. With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed impressive buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the famous London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and, lit from within at night, welcoming. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.|$|E
500|$|Chris Kinnear {{returned}} for a second spell to manage the team {{at the start of}} the 2011–12 season. [...] The following season Margate were sitting at top of the table in January, however, after much speculation Kinnear accepted the vacant manager's position at Dover Athletic. [...] Goalkeeper Craig Holloway was placed in temporary charge of the side, and brought in Simon Osborn as <b>joint</b> <b>manager.</b> [...] The club dropped from the top of the table and finished outside the play-offs. [...] After a poor start to the 2013–14 season, Holloway resigned his role as <b>joint</b> <b>manager,</b> leaving Osborn in sole charge. [...] Results failed to improve and Osborn was sacked at the beginning of December 2013.|$|E

Club chairman David Newton revealed he was beginning legal proceedings against the pair and Grimsby Town, for breach of contract. The Pilgrims wasted no time appointing former Boston player Jason Lee and current player Lee Canoville as <b>joint</b> caretaker <b>managers.</b> With only 7 Conference North games remaining, the pair guided United to a 3rd-place finish in the league setting up a play-off tie against Guiseley. Boston lost the first leg 1-0 at Nethermoor Park but fought back in the return leg winning 3-2 at the Jakemans Stadium to take the match to extra-time and penalties. Boston went out losing 2-3.|$|R

In 1887, Alexander Low Bruce became Deputy Chairman of Younger’s, and had other significant financial interests.

2500|$|As a favour to {{chairman}} Martin Griffiths (who was {{in charge}} of Aymes' benefit committee in 2000), he became <b>joint</b> <b>manager</b> of football side Fleet Town in 2002–03 alongside Mark Dennis, steering them away from near-certain relegation, and winning the Russell Cotes Cup. It was even necessary for Aymes to put on his boots and play in goal for Fleet. When goalkeeper Tyrone King fell awkwardly and went to hospital, Aymes played in goal for the second half. He let in two goals as Fleet lost to Sittingbourne 3–0. After Dennis left the club to become Director of Football at Eastleigh Town in June 2003, Aymes followed him out of Fleet saying it was [...] "geographically not possible" [...] to stay on in charge at Calthorpe Park for another season. On joining Havant & Waterlooville as fitness coach during the 2005–06 season he had a [...] "tremendous impact on the stamina of the players", and took on the responsibilities of the club manager the following year.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1958, {{three days}} after Birmingham lost 8–0 at Preston North End, former Bristol City manager Pat Beasley joined the club. He was {{expected}} to be Turner's assistant, but chairman Harry Morris Jr. announced his appointment as <b>joint</b> <b>manager,</b> that Turner had recommended him, and that secretary Walter Adams was also to have input into team matters. At the time, Turner was quoted as being happy with the arrangement, but was later reported to have only found out about it from the press and to have needed persuading not to resign. The experiment did not work. Turner and the board found themselves at odds over aspects of managerial policy, the players unsure as to who was in charge. With the team lying 21st after a 6–0 defeat against West Bromwich Albion, Turner quit in September 1958. Beasley was named acting manager, and would have to submit his team selections to the board for discussion, though not for alteration: Morris insisted that [...] "The manager and not the directors will pick the team as long as I am chairman." [...] He led the team to a 9th-place finish.|$|E
