500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a <b>highlighter</b> pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E

40|$|Objective Physicians {{typically}} {{respond to}} {{roughly half of}} the clinical decision support prompts they receive. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that selectively <b>highlighting</b> prompts in yellow would improve physicians' responsiveness. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial using the Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation clinical decision support system in 4 urban primary care pediatric clinics. Half of a set of electronic prompts of interest was <b>highlighted</b> in yellow when presented to physicians in 2 clinics. The other half of the prompts was <b>highlighted</b> when presented to physicians in the other 2 clinics. Analyses compared physician responsiveness to the 2 randomized sets of prompts: <b>highlighted</b> versus not <b>highlighted.</b> Additionally, several prompts deemed high priority were <b>highlighted</b> during the entire study period in all clinics. Physician response rates to the high-priority <b>highlighted</b> prompts were compared to response rates for those prompts from the year before the study period, when they were not <b>highlighted.</b> Results Physicians did not respond to prompts that were <b>highlighted</b> at higher rates than prompts that were not <b>highlighted</b> (62 % and 61 %, respectively; odds ratio 1. 056, P =. 259, NS). Similarly, physicians were no more likely to respond to high-priority prompts that were <b>highlighted</b> compared to the year before, when the prompts were not <b>highlighted</b> (59 % and 59 %, respectively, χ 2 = 0. 067, P =. 796, NS). Conclusions <b>Highlighting</b> reminder prompts did not increase physicians' responsiveness.

This study investigated the effect of the <b>highlighting</b> and its validity on comprehension performance on LED display for Chinese reading. Four levels of validity (0 %, 33 %, 67 % and 100 %) and a control condition with no <b>highlighting</b> were tested. Each subject was required to perform the five experimental conditions in which different passages were read and comprehended. The results showed that the condition with 100 % validity of <b>highlighting</b> was found to have better comprehension performance than other validity levels and conditions with no <b>highlighting.</b> The comprehension score of the condition with no <b>highlighting</b> effect was comparatively lower than those <b>highlighting</b> conditions with distracters, though not significant...|$|R

40|$|Fig. 1. The {{stereoscopic}} <b>highlighting</b> technique {{illustrated with}} separate images {{for the left}} and right eye images. The <b>highlighted</b> yellow node and all of its immediate neighbors are rendered at a depth closer to the viewer. Abstract — In this paper we present a new technique and prototype graph visualization system, stereographic <b>highlighting,</b> to visualize node and link diagrams that exploits stereo displays in order to help answer accessibility and adjacency queries. The technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to <b>highlight</b> regions of interest in a 2 D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other <b>highlighting</b> techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereo <b>highlighting</b> also enables focus+context views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual <b>highlighting</b> to stereoscopic <b>highlighting</b> on 2 D and 3 D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereo <b>highlighting</b> alone and static visual <b>highlighting</b> is not statistically significant, users performed better when both <b>highlighting</b> methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3 D layout with static visual <b>highlighting</b> outperformed 2 D layouts with a single <b>highlighting</b> method. However, it did not outperform the 2 D layout utilizing both <b>highlighting</b> techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic <b>highlighting</b> is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases.
