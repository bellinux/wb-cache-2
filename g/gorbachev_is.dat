5|$|The {{value of}} all {{consumer}} goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail <b>Gorbachev,</b> <b>is</b> considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

[...] At a press conference Yanayev's hands were shaking rather violently, leading many journalists to focus on Yanayev's apparent drunkenness instead of Gorbachev's allegedly bad health.|$|E
500|$|A {{subsequent}} book, Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended {{describes the}} relationship of the two men and their efforts to reach agreement on arms reductions between the superpowers. Matlock takes the position that the military build-up by Ronald Reagan in the early-1980s has contributed to the inaccurate characterization of Reagan as a war hawk. [...] The quote atop the first page of Reagan and <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>is</b> by Ronald Reagan, speaking in 1981 during the beginnings of a one trillion dollar defense spending surge, that states [...] "I've always recognized that ultimately there's got to be a settlement, a solution." ...|$|E
500|$|After Gorbachev {{announced}} his {{proposal for a}} New Union Treaty to form the Union of Sovereign States, as a reorganisation of the Soviet Union into a new confederation, he went on vacation to his dacha in the Crimea. Believing that this new Union treaty {{would lead to the}} disintegration of the USSR, the State Committee of the State of Emergency placed Gorbachev under house arrest on 19August, one day before the treaty was due to be signed. On that same day the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) issued the coup plotters' decree, which stated: [...] "Owing to the conditions of his health, Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>is</b> no longer capable of carrying on the duties of the President of the USSR. In accordance with article 127, clause 7 of the USSR constitution, Vice President Gennady Yanayev has assumed the duties of the President of the USSR." [...] The decree made references to the growing problems facing the country such as ethnic tensions, political confrontations and chaos, which according to the coup leaders threatened the very existence of Soviet life and the territorial integrity of the USSR. Yanayev further claimed that the danger of collapse was imminent, and if the economic situation was not handled quickly, the Soviet Union would collapse. In addition, Yanayev {{and the rest of the}} state committee ordered the Cabinet of Ministers to alter the then current five-year plan to relieve the housing shortage. All city-dwellers were given one third of an acre each to combat winter food shortages by growing fruit and vegetables.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{alternate}} {{history has}} often shown how nuclear war could have arisen for certain crises. In the 1998 German-American mockumentary Der dritte Weltkrieg, Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>is</b> ousted during his October 1989 visit to East Germany, after which the new hard-line government violently suppresses or preempts the Revolutions of 1989, and starts a seemingly contained conventional war which leads to an accidental nuclear exchange; the film then rewinds to show Gorbachev in East Berlin and ends with jubilant scenes from the [...] "different path" [...] of recorded history. [...] In 2013's What If...Armageddon 1962, John F. Kennedy is assassinated before becoming President (killed by an actual would-be assassin who lost his nerve after realizing his attack would also kill Kennedy's wife and children), and under Lyndon B. Johnson's leadership, the Cuban Missile Crisis leads to an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1998 ZDF/TLC mockumentary Der Dritte Weltkrieg, {{consisting}} {{largely of}} real-life footage {{of military and}} political figures presented out of context, Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>is</b> ousted by an anti-reformist coup in October 1989 {{during his visit to}} East Germany (with the Soviet Union still in effective control of Eastern Europe, and hard-line rulers still firmly entrenched in nearly all of the satellite states – as such the events of that autumn are either brutally repressed by [...] "Chinese" [...] methods or simply never occur), and the actions of the paranoid, ruthless new General Secretary lead first to a brief conventional war (the filmmakers accessed previously classified war plans and consulted numerous high-ranking military officials on both sides). Just when the conflict seems to have ended, a Soviet radar malfunction, while US forces are on full SIOP alert, results in a civilization-killing nuclear exchange ("There is no further historical record of what happens next"); after [...] "ending" [...] just as the annihilation begins, the film rewinds to Gorbachev in East Berlin, and actually concludes with a montage of celebrations in Berlin as the Berlin Wall is freely crossed, danced upon and dismantled and the country is reunited ("History... took a different path").|$|E
5000|$|His {{loyalty to}} <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>was</b> unquestioned, {{and he was}} with him at many of the key moments as Soviet leader. He was at his side when Gorbachev failed to {{convince}} the East German Politbüro to reform at a strained meeting in East Berlin in October 1989. The two shared a celebratory private glass of champagne when <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>was</b> elected the first (and last) Soviet president in March 1990.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 August 1991, a coup against <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} by the government members opposed to perestroika. <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>was</b> held in Crimea while Yeltsin raced to the White House of Russia (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow to defy the coup, making a memorable speech from atop the turret of a tank onto which he had climbed. The White House was surrounded by the military but the troops defected {{in the face of}} mass popular demonstrations. By 21 August most of the coup leaders had fled Moscow and <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>was</b> [...] "rescued" [...] from Crimea and then returned to Moscow. Yeltsin was subsequently hailed by his supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.|$|R

50|$|During the Gorbachev years, a reformist {{official}} ideology {{clashed with}} a conservative operational ideology, and this conflict fractured the party.

Indeed, freer expression of aspirations and grievances destabilized as well as de-Stalinized state-society relations and disintegrated as well as democratized the Soviet polity and society.|$|E
