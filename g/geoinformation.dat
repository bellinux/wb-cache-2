This height is referenced to the Amsterdam Gauge and is given by the Bavarian State Office for Survey and <b>Geoinformation.</b> The same height is recorded against the Trieste Gauge used in Austria, which is 27cm lower. Originally the Zugspitze had three peaks: the east, middle and west summits (Ost-, Mittel- and Westgipfel). The only one that has remained in its original form is the east summit, {{which is also the}} only one that lies entirely on German territory. The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the Wehrmacht. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as [...]|$|E
