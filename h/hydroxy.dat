5|$|Mycena polygramma {{contains}} the unusual <b>hydroxy</b> fatty acids 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid (0.05% {{of the total}} fatty acids) and 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid (0.01%).|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the lipid and {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} revealed that D.confragosa contains 20.1% total lipids (mg/g dry weight), 32.9% neutral lipids, 53.8% phospholipid, and 13.3% glycolipids. An analysis of <b>hydroxy</b> fatty acid content showed that D.confragosa contains, {{as a percentage}} of total fatty acids, 0.02% 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid and 0.01% 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid.|$|E
5|$|Non-nucleoside phosphoramidites are the phosphoramidite {{reagents}} {{designed to}} introduce various functionalities at the termini of synthetic oligonucleotides or between nucleotide residues {{in the middle}} of the sequence. In order to be introduced inside the sequence, a non-nucleosidic modifier has to possess at least two <b>hydroxy</b> groups, one of which is often protected with the DMT group while the other bears the reactive phosphoramidite moiety.|$|E
5|$|ZnO reacts {{slowly with}} fatty acids in oils {{to produce the}} {{corresponding}} carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement-like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc <b>hydroxy</b> chlorides. This cement was used in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and <b>hydroxy</b> radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha <b>hydroxy</b> acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal <b>hydroxy</b> group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|Mycena polygramma, {{commonly}} known as the grooved bonnet, is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. The inedible fruit bodies are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical caps, pinkish gills. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally coniferous trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M.polygramma contains two uncommon <b>hydroxy</b> fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose intensity of light emission follows a diurnal pattern.|$|E
5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal <b>hydroxy</b> group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E
5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a <b>hydroxy</b> group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Hydroperoxy-, hydroxyl-, and oxo-eicosanoids {{possess a}} hydroperoxy (-OOH), <b>hydroxy</b> (-OH), or oxygen atom (=O) substituents {{link to a}} PUFA carbon by a single (-) or double (=) bond. Their trivial names {{indicate}} the substituent as: Hp or HP for a hydroperoxy residue (e.g. 5-hydroperooxy-eicosatraenoic acid or 5-HpETE or 5-HPETE); H for a <b>hydroxy</b> residue (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid or 5-HETE); and oxo- for an oxo residue (e.g. 5-oxo-eicosatetraenioic acid or 5-oxo-ETE or 5-oxoETE). The number of their double bounds is indicated by their full and trivial names: AA-derived <b>hydroxy</b> metabolites have four (i.e. 'tetra' or 'T') double bonds (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid or 5-HETE; EPA-derived <b>hydroxy</b> metabolites have five ('penta' or 'P') double bonds (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid or 5-HEPE); and DGLA-derived <b>hydroxy</b> metabolites have three ('tri' or 'Tr') double bonds (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid or 5-HETrE).|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is {{an alpha}} <b>hydroxy</b> acid {{and used as}} an active {{ingredient}} in chemical peels.|$|E
25|$|References to 'light' and 'heavy' {{magnesium}} carbonates actually {{refer to the}} magnesium <b>hydroxy</b> carbonates hydromagnesite and dypingite (respectively).|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxy</b> {{are derived}} form mead acid, is metabolized to the 3 double bond-containing analog of 5-HETE viz., 5-HETrE (see arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase#mead acid).|$|E
25|$|These {{results show}} that a {{medium-sized}} <b>hydroxy</b> alkyl group, such as CHMeOH and CMe2OH, is favorable for the substituent of the 4-position on the imidazole ring. Furthermore, the ionizable group is favorable for the binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|Hydrolysis of ZrCl4 {{gives the}} {{hydrated}} <b>hydroxy</b> chloride cluster called zirconyl chloride. This reaction is rapid and virtually irreversible, {{consistent with the}} high oxophilicity of zirconium(IV). For this reason, manipulations of ZrCl4 typically require air-free techniques.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that an <b>hydroxy</b> group in the 4-position on the imidazole ring, {{plays an important role}} in the binding affinity and compensates for the disadvantage of lipophilicity of the bulky alkyl group.|$|E
25|$|DHA can be metabolized into DHA-derived {{specialized}} pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), DHA epoxides, electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of DHA, neuroprostanes, ethanolamines, acylglycerols, docosahexaenoyl amides of {{amino acids}} or neurotransmitters, and branched DHA esters of <b>hydroxy</b> fatty acids, among others.|$|E
25|$|Manganese – Nearly all mitochondria, {{and many}} bacteria, contain a form with {{manganese}} (Mn-SOD): For example, the Mn-SOD found in human mitochondria. The ligands of the manganese ions are 3 histidine side-chains, an aspartate side-chain and a water molecule or <b>hydroxy</b> ligand, {{depending on the}} Mn oxidation state (respectively II and III).|$|E
25|$|An amine {{functional}} group displaces the adjacent halide in an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate an aziridine. Amino alcohols {{have the same}} reactivity, but the <b>hydroxy</b> group must first be converted into a good leaving group. The cyclization of an amino alcohol is called a Wenker synthesis (1935), and that of a haloamine the Gabriel ethylenimine method (1888).|$|E
25|$|The Pictet–Gams {{reaction}} and the Pictet–Spengler reaction are both {{variations on the}} Bischler–Napieralski reaction. A Pictet–Gams reaction works similarly to the Bischler–Napieralski reaction; the only difference being that an additional <b>hydroxy</b> group in the reactant provides a site for dehydration under the same reaction conditions as the cyclization to give the isoquinoline rather than requiring a separate reaction to convert a dihydroisoquinoline intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid (from Latin salix, willow tree) is a {{lipophilic}} monohydroxybenzoic acid, {{a type of}} phenolic acid, and a beta <b>hydroxy</b> acid (BHA). It has {{the formula}} C7H6O3. This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It {{is derived from the}} metabolism of salicin. In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products. The salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates.|$|E
25|$|The {{covalent}} pair-wise {{interaction between}} boronic acids and <b>hydroxy</b> groups {{as found in}} alcohols and acids is rapid and reversible in aqueous solutions. The equilibrium established between boronic acids and the hydroxyl groups present on saccharides has been successfully employed to develop a range of sensors for saccharides. One of the key advantages with this dynamic covalent strategy lies {{in the ability of}} boronic acids to overcome the challenge of binding neutral species in aqueous media. If arranged correctly, the introduction of a tertiary amine within these supramolecular systems will permit binding to occur at physiological pH and allow signalling mechanisms such as photoinduced electron transfer mediated fluorescence emission to report the binding event.|$|E
25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free <b>hydroxy</b> group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E
25|$|More specifically, the {{biosynthesis}} of (−)-menthol {{takes place}} in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant. Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), first catalyzes the reaction of IPP and DMAPP into geranyl diphosphate. Next (−)-limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate to (−)-limonene. (−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and NADPH, then catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol. (−)-Trans-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the <b>hydroxy</b> group on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone. (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-cis-isopulegone. (+)-Cis-isopulegone isomerase (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone. (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) then reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone. (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol.|$|E
25|$|The plasma {{membrane}} or bacterial cytoplasmic membrane {{is composed of}} a phospholipid bilayer and thus has all of the general functions of a cell membrane such as acting as a permeability barrier for most molecules and serving as the location for the transport of molecules into the cell. In addition to these functions, prokaryotic membranes also function in energy conservation as the location about which a proton motive force is generated. Unlike eukaryotes, bacterial membranes (with some exceptions e.g. Mycoplasma and methanotrophs) generally do not contain sterols. However, many microbes do contain structurally related compounds called hopanoids which likely fulfill the same function. Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria can have {{a wide variety of}} fatty acids within their membranes. Along with typical saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, bacteria can contain fatty acids with additional methyl, <b>hydroxy</b> or even cyclic groups. The relative proportions of these fatty acids can be modulated by the bacterium to maintain the optimum fluidity of the membrane (e.g. following temperature change).|$|E
25|$|Human 15-LOX-1 prefers {{linoleic}} acid over arachidonic acid as its primary substrate, oxygenating it at carbon 13 to form 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid (13-HpODE or 13(S)-HpODE) which may then be reduce to the corresponding <b>hydroxy</b> derivative, 13(S)-HODE or 13-HODE (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). In addition to 13(S)-HpODE, non-human 15-LOX1 orthologs such as mouse 12/15-LOX and soybean 15-LOX metabolize {{linoleic acid}} to 9-hydroperoxy-10E, 12Z-octadecaenoic acid (9-HpODE or 9(S)-HpODE), which is rapidly converted to 9(S)-HODE (9-HODE) (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid)). 13(S)-HODE acts through Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the TRPV1 and human GPR132 receptors to stimulate {{a variety of}} responses related to monocyte maturation, lipid metabolism, and neuron activation (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid##Activities of 13-HODEs; 9(S)-HODE is a marker for diseases involving oxidative stress and may contribute to this disease {{as well as to}} pain perception and atherosclerosis (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid##Biological and clinical relevancy of 9-HODEs). The two HODEs can be further metabolized to their ketones, 13-oxo-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid and 9-oxo-10E, 12Z-octadecaenoic acid; these ketones have been implicated as biomarkers for and possible contributors to the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Steatohepatitis, and other pathological conditions.|$|E
25|$|Arachidonic acid (AA) has double {{bonds between}} carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; these double bonds {{are in the}} cis (see Cis–trans {{isomerism}} or Z {{as opposed to the}} trans or E configuration. ALOX15 adds a hydroperoxy residue to AA at carbons 15 {{and to a lesser extent}} 12 to from 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HpETE) and 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E, 15S-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE); the purified enzyme makes 15(S)-HpETE and 12(S)-HpETE in a product ratio of ~4-9 to 1. Both products may be rapidly reduced by ubiquitous cellular Glutathione peroxidase enzymes to their corresponding <b>hydroxy</b> analogs, 15(S)-HETE (see 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 12(S)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE bind to and activate the Leukotriene B4 receptor 2, activate the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and at high concentrations cause cells to generate toxic reactive oxygen species; one or more of these effects may be at least in part responsible for their ability to promote inflammatory responses, alter the growth of various times of human cancer cell lines, contract various types of blood vessels, and stimulate pathological fibrosis in pulmonary arteries and liver (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE are esterified into membrane phospholipids where they may be stored and subsequently released during cell stimulation. As one aspect of this processing, the two products are progressively esterified in mitochondria membrane phospholipids during the maturation of red blood cells (see erythropoiesis) and thereby may serve to signal for the degradation of the mitochondria and the maturation of these precursors to red blood cells in mice. This pathway operates along with two other mitochondria-removing pathways and therefore does not appear essential for mouse red blood cell maturation.|$|E
500|$|Pauling's second rule is {{that the}} value of the first pKa for acids of the formula XOm(OH)n depends {{primarily}} on the number of oxo groups m, and is approximately independent of the number of <b>hydroxy</b> groups n, and also of the central atom X. Approximate values of pKa are 8 for m=0, 2 for m=1, −3 for m=2 and < −10 for m = 3. Alternatively, various numerical formulas have been proposed including pKa = 8 − 5m (known as Bell's rule), pKa=7−5m, or pKa=9−7m. The dependence on m correlates with the oxidation state of the central atom, X: the higher the oxidation state the stronger the oxyacid. For example, pKa for HClO is 7.2, for HClO2 is 2.0, for HClO3 is −1 and HClO4 is a strong acid (...) [...] The increased acidity on adding an oxo group is due to stabilization of the conjugate base by delocalization of its negative charge over an additional oxygen atom. This rule can help assign molecular structure: for example phosphorous acid (H3PO3) has a pKa near 2 suggested that the structure is HPO(OH)2, as later confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and not P(OH)3 which would be expected to have a pKa near 8.|$|E
2500|$|... 9-HODE may {{be further}} metabolized to 9-oxo-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxoODE or 9-oxo-ODE), {{possibly}} {{by the same}} <b>hydroxy</b> fatty acid dehydrogenase which metabolizes other <b>hydroxy</b> fatty acids, such as 13-HODE, to their oxo derivatives.|$|E

2500|$|Chemical exfoliants include scrubs {{containing}} salicylic acid, glycolic acid, fruit enzymes, citric acid, or {{malic acid}} {{which may be}} applied in high concentrations by a medical professional, or in lower concentrations in over-the-counter products. Chemical exfoliation may involve the use of products that contain alpha <b>hydroxy</b> acids (AHAs), beta <b>hydroxy</b> acids (BHAs), or enzymes that act to loosen the glue-like substance that holds the cells together, allowing them to ease away. This type of exfoliation is recommended for people treating acne. [...] In beauty spa treatment on continental Europe, the chemical properties of wine producing grapes are exploited {{in the practice of}} vinotherapy which is becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
2500|$|In the laboratory, acyl {{chlorides}} {{are generally}} prepared {{in the same}} manner as alkyl chlorides, by replacing the corresponding <b>hydroxy</b> substituents with chlorides.

2500|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the eicosanoid products formed {{may differ}} among the pathways. For prostaglandins, {{this is often}} indicated by Greek letters (e.g. PGF2α versus PGF2β). For hydroperoxy and <b>hydroxy</b> eicosanoids an S or R designates the chirality of their substituents (e.g. 5S-hydroxy-eicosateteraenoic acid [...] is given the trivial names of 5S-HETE, 5(S)-HETE, 5S-HETE, or 5(S)-HETE). Since eicosanoid-forming enzymes commonly make S isomer products either with marked preference or essentially exclusively, the use of S/R designations has often been dropped (e.g. 5S-HETE is 5-HETE). Nonetheless, certain eicosanoid-forming pathways do form R isomers and their S versus R isomeric products can exhibit dramatically different biological activities. Failing to specify S/R isomers can be misleading. Here, all hydroperoxy and <b>hydroxy</b> substituents have the S configuration unless noted otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{at times}} it may be {{desirable}} to make a section of a molecule into an alkane-like functionality (alkyl group) using the above or similar methods.
