40|$|AbstractElastomers exhibit complex {{fracture}} mechanical properties. The {{crack growth}} rate depends on {{various factors such as}} polymer type, fillers, curing state. For numerous applications elastomeric parts often work under complex periodic loadings. The new Fatigue Test Analysers of Metravib ACOEM allows performing fatigue crack growth tests at controlled tearing energy in pure shear samples. This method of loading is strongly recommended to compare dynamic fatigue properties of elastomers. This study deals with {{crack growth rate}} measurements and performance comparison of several rubber compounds. The influence of the formulation and mixing parameters of formulation and mixing would be presented on an SBR compound: the dispersion of filler, the antioxidant quantity, and the curing system. All compounds are characterized with normalized mechanical tests such as uniaxial tensile, monotonic tearing, hardness; one is also tested with normalized fatigue tests as FTFT (Fatigue To Failure Tensile), DeMattia <b>Flexing</b> <b>Fatigue</b> Tester (in initiation and propagation) ...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{shot peening}} is {{the science of}} surface {{treatment}} to enhance fatigue life or load range by work hardening a surface and creating residual compressive stresses. By monitoring and controlling parameters of the process a consistent result can be obtained. This paper will discuss attributes and implications of the process elements. Shot peening is useful in extending the fatigue life, stress corrosion resistance, and load carrying capacity of metal components. Peening variables affect workpiece performance. Uncontrolled peening results in a widely scattered range of component life, sometimes canceling out the benefits of shot peening. For this reason the designer of parts is reluctant to use the increased strength of a shot peened part and resorts to it only after field failures force engineering to go to shot peening for a margin of safety. With {{the lack of a}} non-destructive inspection for shot peening, one must have confidence in the process. To gain this confidence the process must be consistent, repeatable and uniform. Process parameters must be monitored and controlled. Shot peening has evolved from a crude art initiated by an accidental discovery of the beneficial effects caused by creating compressive stresses on the surface of a part subjected to <b>flexing.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> failures always occur in areas of tension. By creating compressive stresses on the surface the fatigue life can be enhanced. A process flow chart is shown in Figure 1 that represents the process of controlled shot peening. The chart is separated by a dashed line to denote process input (&quot;cause&quot;) items below the line and process result (&quot;effect&quot;) items above the line. This article will describe each box in the flow chart and show how consistency in &quot;effect &quot; can be achieved by maintaining consistency in &quot;cause &quot; (process control). All of the process inputs are directly and easily controlled and monitored by the machine operator. It merely remains a task of the process engineer to describe what final properties are required. Once the process inputs are identified they can be consistently maintained...|$|E

The fatigue sensitivity coefficient is calculated by the linear fitting curve of normalised stress versus logarithm of bending cycles. The residual modulus is investigated during the <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> processes.

It is indicated that the <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> of POFs might be sensitive with high swing angle or swing speed.

40|$|Abstract. Side {{emitting}} plastic {{optical fibers}} {{can be used}} in textile structures for some special optical activities due to the light leaking out from their surface. One significant characteristic of plastic optical fibers is their tendency to weaken side emitting capability under mechanical deformation, which can be simulated as repeated bending cycles under prescribed pretension. The principle of evaluation of <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> was based on the repeated bending cycles until break. Q-Q plot and three-parameter Weibull distribution were used for estimation of numbers of bending cycles of plastic optical fibers with different diameters.

40|$|Abstract: The {{essence of}} this {{research}} paper is to gauge the effect of particle size and particle size distribution of filler on rubber compounds. It also involves the comparison {{of the level of}} reinforcement and gauge the possibility of utilizing the low cost locally sourced filler [(rice husk and wood flour) with a commercial filler calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) ] as an alternative material in rubber compounding. Thus, the use of rice husk and wood flour as filler will in no doubt promote self employment among the teaming unemployed youths thereby reducing poverty and creating wealth for the people. Test like moisture content, pH, ash content, hardness resistance, abrasion resistance, compression set and <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> were subsequently carried out on the vulcanizate. These properties were compared with that of CaCO 3 filled vulcanizate. The result reveals that at 212 um, rice husk has hardness resistance of 50 (IRHD) and flex resistance 8690 rpm and wood flour has better hardness resistance of 57 (IRHD), <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> resistance of 10955 rpm (yet to fail) and abrasion resistance o...|$|R

Hybrid filler {{were used to}} prepare a natural rubber vulcanizate {{in order to determine}} testing data for the mechanical properties of the compound. In the sample preparation, six levels of filler loading were designed, which include variation in carbon black volume content.

40|$|Sodium {{montmorillonite}} (Na-Mt) {{was modified}} by cetyltriemethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) through cation exchange technique followed by grafting with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APT). The effects of organophillic surface treatments of montmorillonite on compatibilization of natural rubber (NR) /acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) blends was investigated. Physico-mechanical properties of rubber nanocomposites compatibilized with organomodified montmorillonite revealed strong nanocomposite with high tensile properties, impact strength and good resistance to <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue,</b> abrasion and compression set. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) revealed a marked increase in storage modulus (E') and lesser damping characteristics of organically modified clay mineral polymer nanocomposites (CPN) due to intercalation of organophilic montmorillonite by rubber matrix. The morphology of the blends became homogeneous and smoother {{with the presence}} of exofoliated/intercalated organically modified montmorillonite. Organomodified layered silicate sheets of montmorillonite greatly enhanced barrier properties by creating tortuous path that retarded the progress of solvent molecules through rubber matrix...|$|R
40|$|The <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> of nylon and {{polyester}} fibres {{is measured}} by pulling them backwards and forwards over a pin in an environmental chamber. The fatigue lives vary over a 20 -fold range as temperature and humidity changes. For nylon 6, the plots show a consistent increase to a maximum value and then a decrease as the temperature is increased from 20 – 120 °C. The peak lifetimes occur at higher temperatures at lower humidities. The results for nylon 6. 6 show peaks at intermediate humidities, but little change at low and high humidities. The peak life temperature increases as humidity decreases for nylon 6. 6, but is unchanged for polyester. The nylon 6 results follow the same trend as the loss modulus in variation with temperature and humidity, with a high loss correlating with a long life. A possible reason for this {{and the influence of}} other complicating factors, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|After {{analyzing}} excavated 17 - 18 th century silk fibers {{through a}} scanning electron microscopy, we disco-vered seven {{different kinds of}} fracture morphology. Using Morton & Hearle fiber fracture morphology, we classified the findings into four different categories. Type I is tensile failure resulting from brittle fracture, granular fracture, and ductile fracture. Type II is fatigue failure caused by tensile <b>fatigue,</b> <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and axial split (fibrillation). Type III is bacterial deterioration discovered only in excavated artifacts. Type IV {{is a combination of}} the three above. Humid underground conditions and the infiltration of bacteria caused the fibers to swell and weaken its interfibrillar cohesion. Fractures occur when drying and processing an exca-vated artifact that is already in a fragile condition. Therefore, one must minimize damage through a prompt cleaning process and make sure that the least possible force is exerted on the fabric during any treatmen...|$|R
40|$|Composites of {{styrene-butadiene-styrene}} {{triblock copolymer}} (SBS) matrix with curauá fiber and/or a nanoparticulate mineral (montmorillonite clay - MMT) used as reinforcing agents were prepared by melt-mixing. The influence of clay addition on properties like tensile and tear strength, rebound resilience, <b>flex</b> <b>fatigue</b> life, abrasion loss, hardness and water absorption of composites with 5, 10 and 20 wt% of curauá fiber was evaluated in presence of maleic anhydride grafted styrene-(ethylene-co-butylene) -styrene triblock copolymer (MA-g-SEBS) coupling agent. Furthermore, {{the effect of}} mineral plasticizer loading on tensile strength of selected composites was investigated. The hybrid SBS composite that showed the best overall mechanical performance was composed by 2 wt% of MMT and 5 wt% of curauá fiber. Increasing fiber content up to 20 wt% resulted in a general decrease in all mechanical properties as well as incorporation of 5 wt% MMT caused {{a decrease in the}} tensile strength in all fiber contents. The hybrid composites showed clay agglomerates (tactoids) poorly dispersed that could explain the poor mechanical performance of composites at higher concentrations of curauá fiber and MMT nanoparticles. The addition of plasticizer further decreased the tensile strength while the addition of MMT nanoparticles decreased water absorption for all SBS composites...|$|R
40|$|Vickers {{microhardness}} indentations, {{tension and}} notch toughness tests, {{as well as}} controlled static and cyclic strain experiments via bending over mandrels of different diameter have been performed on 30 μm thick Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 metallic glass ribbons. Vickers microhardnesses of 910 ± 100 kg/mm 2 and 1030 ± 40 kg/mm 2 were obtained for the air side and wheel side, respectively. Tensile strengths were 1640 MPa ± 35, somewhat less than the strength predicted from microhardness. The notch toughness values obtained were 94. 5 ± 5. 5 MPam 1 / 2. The static “bend over mandrel” tests revealed that the ribbons simply deformed via shear banding for mandrel diameter as small as 0. 225 mm.

50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake hose {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to <b>flex</b> invites metal <b>fatigue</b> and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{thermal fatigue}} of vias in {{rigid-flex}} {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB) is considered in the paper. Dedicated printed circuit boards have been designed with different geometrical configurations (plating thickness, drilled hole diameter and PCB thickness). The PCB is made of hundreds of vias or holes which are wired by copper path to create a daisy chain. The PCB is subject to cyclic thermal loading (- 55 degrees C, + 125 degrees C). Electrical connectivity is recorded during tests. Cross sectioning is performed finally to characterize the loss of electrical connectivity. Fracture of plated copper, due to the thermal expansion mismatch between constituents, is shown {{to be responsible for}} the failure of the PCB. In addition to environmental tests, finite element model is developed to analyze the deformation of PCBs during thermal cycling. Areas of strain concentration determined by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are consistent with locations where cracks were observed in experiments. In addition, the numerical estimation of the plastic strain increment per cycle enables the prediction of the fatigue life. The results confirm that for rigid <b>flex</b> boards, the <b>fatigue</b> life of vias increases with higher plating thickness, larger drilled hole size and lower PCB thickness. Numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with experiments...|$|R
