40|$|Effects of mould flux {{contaminant}} on scale-steel adhesion and hydraulic <b>descaling</b> {{of scale}} formed on slabs were investigated. In this investigation, stainless steel type 304 (austenitic with 18 % Cr and 8 % Ni) and specific mould fluxes were used when growing the scale on contaminated samples under simulated industrial reheating conditions, with subsequent {{high pressure water}} hydraulic <b>descaling.</b> The basic hypothesis was that the steel-scale adhesion depends on the microstructure of different phases present in the scale, the segregation of specific elements at the interface and the interfacial morphology of the scale after reheating. It was found that mould flux contaminant decreases scale-steel adhesion and therefore improved the <b>descaling</b> effectiveness significantly compared to non contaminated stainless steel. The <b>descaling</b> effectiveness of contaminated and uncontaminated slab was dependent {{to the presence of}} metal free paths (chromite layers along the austenite grains boundaries) and the presence of unoxidized metal in the scale due to nickel enrichment at the interface.

50|$|Braga {{has noted}} five stages of {{development}} in João de Deus' artistic life: the imitative, the idyllic, the lyric, the pessimistic and the devout phases. Under each of these divisions is included much that is of extreme interest, especially to contemporaries who have passed through the same succession of emotional experience, and it is highly probable that Caturras and Gaspar, pieces as witty as anything in Bocage but free from Bocage's coarse impiety, will always interest literary students. But it is as the singer of love that João de Deus will delight posterity as he delighted his own generation. The elegiac music of Rachel and of ma, the melancholy of Adeus and of Remoinho, the tender and sincerity of Meu casto lírio, of Lágrima celeste, of <b>Descale</b> and a score more songs are distinguished by the large, vital simplicity which withstands time. It is precisely {{in the quality of}} unstudied simplicity that João de Deus is incomparably strong. The temptations to a display of virtuosity are almost irresistible for a Portuguese poet; he has the tradition of virtuosity in his blood, he has before him the example of all contemporaries, and he has at hand an instrument of wonderful sonority and compass. Yet not once is João de Deus clamorous or rhetorical, not once does he indulge in idle ornament. His prevailing note is that of exquisite sweetness and of reverent purity; yet with all his caressing softness he is never sentimental, and, though he has not the strength for a long fight, emotion has seldom been set to more delicate music. Had he included among his other gifts the gift of selection, had he continued the poetic discipline of his youth instead of dedicating his powers to a task which, well as he performed it, might have been done no less well by a much lesser man, there is scarcely any height to which he might not have risen.|$|E

40|$|This work is {{focussed}} on hydraulic <b>descaling</b> of hot surfaces. Hydraulic <b>descaling</b> is {{a process}} when layers of oxides are removed from hot steel surfaces during continuous rolling. High pressure water beam is used. Quality of <b>descaled</b> surfaces is important for final quality of rolled product. Insufficient <b>descaling</b> causes drop of final quality, degradation of rolls and lost of yields. High-pressure water beam has two effects on a scale layer. The first effect is mechanical caused by impact pressure. The second one is a relatively intensive thermal shock depending {{on a set of}} parameters (water pressure, nozzle type, distance from the surface, inclination angle, speed of product moving). There are a lot of theories about principles of scales removing. Main task of this work is to make it clear which theory is acceptable and which is just,,theory”. For this purpose mathematical modelling and experimental work were used. In experimental part, three types of experimental measurement were done. First one, measurement of dynamical effect of water beam – impact pressure. Second one, measurement of temperature drop when a product is passing under the nozzle. Measured data (temperatures) from this measurement are evaluated with inverse task and heat transfer coefficient is obtained. And the third experimental measurement is simulation of whole process of <b>descaling.</b> Quality of <b>descaled</b> surfaces is valuated according to amount of remained oxide scales. Data from firs and second experimental measurement are used as boundary conditions for mathematical modelling. For mathematical simulations, FEM (finite element method) system ANSYS was used.

40|$|Abstract. Some {{surface defects}} on hot rolled steels arise due to poor <b>descaling.</b> Generally reheated slabs are {{efficiently}} <b>descaled</b> but, now and then, residual scale {{remains on the}} slab after primary <b>descaling.</b> Commonly {{it is difficult to}} trace the few poorly <b>descaled</b> slabs since there often is no scale monitoring system. In the work presented here an image based primary scale monitoring- and evaluation system is presented. It is a stand-alone online vision system consisting of a camera connected to a computer. The camera is located directly after the <b>descaling</b> unit and the computer in the control room. The program automatically locates the boundaries of the top surface of a slab and calculates the quantity of residual scale on the top surface. The quantity of residual scale is logged and can afterwards be evaluated together with process parameters and downstream surface defects to identify problem areas. The system has been tested in industrial scale in the Ruukki plate mill. This work is a cooperation between Swerea MEFOS and Ruukki. The result of the test demonstrated the feasibility of using vision system for detection of residual scale. Some problems were identified and suggestions for solving them are reported. If the suggested modifications are carried out, it is believed that the vision system can be an on-line tool for the operator and also be an off-line resource for the ongoing quality work at the hot rolling mill...|$|R

40|$|Periodontal disease (PD) is a {{significant}} problem in dogs affecting between 44 % and 63. 6 % of the population. The main etiological agent for PD is plaque, a microbial biofilm that colonizes teeth and causes inflammation of the gingiva. Understanding how this biofilm initiates on the tooth surface is of central importance in developing interventions against PD. Although the stages of plaque development on human teeth have been well characterized {{little is known about}} how canine plaque develops. Recent studies of the canine oral microbiome have revealed distinct differences between the canine and human oral environments and the bacterial communities they support, particularly with respect to healthy plaque. These differences mean knowledge about the nature of plaque formation in humans may not be directly translatable to dogs. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the bacterial species important in the early stages of canine plaque formation in vivo and then use isolates of these species in a laboratory biofilm model to develop an understanding of the sequential processes which take place during the initial colonization of enamel. Supra-gingival plaque samples were collected from 12 dogs at 24 and 48 hour time points following a full mouth <b>descale</b> and polish. Pyrosequencing of the 16 S rDNA identified 134 operational taxonomic units after statistical analysis. The species with the highest relative abundance were Bergeyella zoohelcum, Neisseria shayeganii and a Moraxella species. Streptococcal species, which tend to dominate early human plaque biofilms, had very low relative abundance. In vitro testing of biofilm formation identified five primary colonizer species, three of which belonged to the genus Neisseria.

To achieve all goals of this work and to get a comprehensive view of <b>descaling</b> process, few experimental measurements and numerical analyses were performed. All experimental measurements were focused on obtaining data about fundamental parameters and effects of the hydraulic <b>descaling.</b> The data obtained from measurements were applied to numerical analyses, which aimed to discover a deeper relation and to confirm the experimental results. This thesis can be divided into two main parts. The first part is devoted to parameters of the water jet study. The main studied characteristics of the high pressure hydraulic water jet were heat transfer coefficient and impact pressure at different modes such as standard or pulsating water jet. Experimentally measured data of these parameters were applied in numerical analyses. The numerical analyses were focused on studying the impact of the water jet parameters on the stresses in the oxide scale layers. A further water jet analysis was focused on the influence of the individual parts of the hydraulic system (such as water chamber or stabilizer) on its characteristics. In this part different types of the water chambers in combination with different types of stabilizers on the impact pressure values were investigated. These measurements were supported by fluid flow analysis through the hydraulic system. The second part of this work was focused on getting mechanical properties of the oxide scales from specimens prepared from standard structural steel and specimens from silicon steel. In this thesis, the influence of various parameters and characteristics was studied on these two types of steel. Mechanical properties of oxide scale structures were carried out by the Small Punch Test method. To obtain the fundamental mechanical properties such as Young´s modulus, yield strength and ultimate strength, material parameters based on the measured data were optimized.
