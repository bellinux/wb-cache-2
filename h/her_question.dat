Fascinated by the early Christians and Tolstoy's book , she was baptized a Christian in the Cedarville Presbyterian Church, {{in the summer of}} 1886. Reading Giuseppe Mazzini's Duties of Man, she began to be inspired by the idea of democracy as a social ideal. Yet she felt confused about her role as a woman. John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women made <b>her</b> <b>question</b> the social pressures on a woman to marry and devote her life to family.|$|E

On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or <b>her</b> <b>question.</b> The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the Blorenge, cited as [...] "a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in Wales. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected {{to walk away from}} the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.|$|E

She and Kevin prevent Julie from being impaled on a harrow while being dragged by a panicked horse, and Wendy asks Julie who {{was sitting next to}} her on the roller coaster, since they are next on Death's list. <b>Her</b> <b>question</b> is quickly answered when Julie's friend, Perry Malinowski, is impaled by a flagpole launched by a rope tied to the horse. Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister and is confronted by a deranged Ian, who blames her for Erin's death and is determined to ensure that she will not survive from her impending demise. Fireworks go off and nearly hit Wendy, but she dodges and they strike a nearby elevating work platform instead. Ian shouts that Death cannot kill him, and the platform collapses and crushes him.|$|E

It was then the turn of Gargi {{to take up the}} challenge. Gargi, as one of the disputants in the debate, questioned Yajnavalkya on his claim of superiority among the scholars. She held repeated arguments with him. Gargi and Yajnavalkya's exchange centered on the ultimate [...] "warp" [...] of reality ("warp" [...] means [...] "the basic foundation or material of a structure or entity). Her initial dialogue with Yajnavalkya tended to be too metaphysical, such as unending status of the soul, away from practical situations. She then changed her approach and asked him pointed questions related to the environment existing in the world, the question of the very origin of all existence. <b>Her</b> <b>question</b> was specific when she asked him [...] "since this whole world is woven back and forth on water, on what then is woven back and forth", a question that related to the commonly known cosmological metaphor that expressed the unity of the world, its essential interconnectedness.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was <b>her</b> <b>question</b> to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E

In 1870, he submitted the libretto to the state censor for examination, and the score to the literary and music committees of the Imperial Theatres.

Mara told Filmmaker that she felt that her Nancy was [...] "completely different from the original" [...] and [...] "the loneliest girl in the world".

Then, Emma runs up to a peddler, only to become consumed by Rumplestiltskin's guidance, [...] to the point of nearly using her dark magic to kill the peddler. The Dark One guides Emma through using a transportation spell, and she sees a will-o-the-wisp. The Dark One tells her that for the Wisp to answer <b>her</b> <b>question,</b> she will have to catch it. As she chases it, Emma comes upon a red-headed archer named Merida, who nabs the wisp and places it in her bag. Emma confronts Merida, accidentally using dark magic, and tries to convince her that she needs it to find Merlin. Merida is reluctant to trust Emma, but decides to go with her, keeping the wisp in her bag. Merida informs Emma that more wisps can are born at the Hill of Stones, so they head in that direction.|$|E

2500|$|When {{she breaks}} with German {{practice}} and asks the judge at her trial [...] "What {{would you have}} done?" [...] about whether she should have left her job at Siemens and taken the guard position, <b>her</b> <b>question</b> indicates {{that she does not}} know that she could have acted differently, and her statement that there was [...] "no alternative" [...] claims a lack of moral responsibility. As a result of her shame at being illiterate, she has not only let the bulk of the crime be pinned on her, she has let those with a greater share of responsibility escape full accountability. Franklin writes that this is the moral center of the novel—that Hanna, as Michael puts it, chooses exposure as a criminal over exposure as an illiterate—and in Franklin's view the novel cannot recover from the weakness of this position. Franklin regards it not only as implausible, but the implication that Hanna chose the job and acted as she did because of her illiteracy appears intended to exonerate her. Her Nazism was accidental, and Franklin writes that Schlink offers no guidance about how to punish a brutality of convenience, rather than of ideology.|$|E
