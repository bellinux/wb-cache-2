50|$|From 1939 to 1956 Merton was {{treasurer}} of the Royal Society, where his knowledge and experience of business were of considerable benefit. He formed a committee of experts to control its finances, {{and it was on}} his initiative that charitable bodies were given power to invest in equities, where they had previously been limited to <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>stock.</b> The income of all the society's funds showed a large increase during his treasurership.|$|E
50|$|Other gilding {{processes}} involved {{using the}} gold as pigment in paint: the artist ground the gold into a fine powder and mixed {{it with a}} binder. Then the gold was applied {{in the same way}} as with any paint. Sometimes, after either gold-leafing or gold-painting, the artist would heat the piece enough to melt the gold slightly, ensuring an even coat. These techniques remained the only alternatives for materials like wood, leather, the vellum pages of illuminated manuscripts, and <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Colonel The 6th Baron Langford (1849-1931), who {{had only}} {{inherited}} the barony the previous year, sought compensation from the conservative Government of the Irish Free State. After three years of negotiation with the Compensation Board, a sum of £43,500 was paid to Colonel Lord Langford, approximately {{one third of the}} value of the house and contents destroyed in the fire. The elderly Lord Langford invested the money in <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>stocks</b> and moved to Middlesex in England.|$|R
6000|$|It was a fatal resolve. The {{very next}} day came the {{historic}} crash, the record crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of Wall Street, and the whole body of <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>stocks</b> dropped ninety-five points in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his bread in the Bowery. Aleck sternly held her grip and [...] "put up" [...] {{as long as she}} could, but at last there came a call which she was powerless to meet, and her imaginary brokers sold her out. Then, and not till then, the man in her was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway. She put her arms about her husband's neck and wept, saying: ...|$|R
25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>stocks.</b> This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders {{to have to find}} their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|R
5000|$|When the Panic of 1907 {{threatens the}} banking system of the United States, a {{committee}} appeals to Hannah for a desperately needed loan. She is uninterested, until they show her a list of <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>stocks</b> they are offering as security; she spots Burton's own railroad shares and provides the money as a demand loan (on which she can demand repayment at any time). Just after Burton receives {{his share of the}} loan to satisfy his bank clients, Hannah notifies him that she wants the loan paid back. Instead of returning the money, he decides to forfeit his stock rather than abandon his depositors. Hannah is delighted to finally avenge herself on her former fiance, having wrested control of the railroad away from him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Land!" [...] he said, [...] "it's a {{stunning}} catch! He's got a gambling-hall, and a graveyard, and a bishop, and a cathedral--all his very own. And all <b>gilt-edged</b> five-hundred-per-cent. <b>stock,</b> {{every detail of}} it; the tidiest little property in Europe; and that graveyard--it's the selectest in the world: none but suicides admitted; YES, sir, and the free-list suspended, too, ALL the time. There isn't much land in the principality, but there's enough: eight hundred acres in the graveyard and forty-two outside. It's a SOVEREIGNTY--that's the main thing; LAND'S nothing. There's plenty land, Sahara's drugged with it." ...|$|R
50|$|Jacob {{was born}} into poverty in Hornsey, north London, and became a Methodist at a young age. After working his way up from office boy, he became a {{stockbroker}} specialising in <b>gilt-edged</b> and fixed-interest <b>stocks.</b> In 1972 {{he was asked to}} manage the Methodist Church's investment fund and his interest in ethical investment developed from there. He became a director of a number of investment companies and was the director and patron of the UK Sustainable Investment & Finance Association.|$|R
