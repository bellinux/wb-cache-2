25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, injera compares to the <b>French</b> <b>crêpe</b> and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked {{in a circle}} and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} smooth texture, while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the injera to be a good bread to scoop up sauces and dishes.|$|E

50|$|Central European Palatschinke (palačeke) {{are thin}} pancakes {{similar to the}} <b>French</b> <b>crêpe.</b> The main {{difference}} between the French and Central European version of the dish is that the mixture for palatschinken can be used straight away unlike that of crepes which is suggested to be left at rest for several hours. Palatschinken are made by creating a runny dough from eggs, wheat flour, milk, and salt and frying it in a pan with butter or oil. Unlike thicker types of pancakes, palatschinken are usually served with different types of fillings and eaten for lunch or dinner.|$|E
5000|$|In Belgium, a thicker {{variety of}} fries is used, frieten in Dutch and frites in French. They are mainly sold by street vendors (see picture), {{in a little}} place called a frituur in Dutch, a friterie in French. In Belgium, French fries are {{traditionally}} fried in suet (beef fat) but this has become less common and people tend to fry them in oil. Liège-style waffles (Dutch wafel or French gaufre) are served warm as a street snack, somewhat similar to what is known in other countries as [...] "Belgian waffles" [...] (which are called in Belgium [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] or [...] "Brusselse Wafels") but richer, denser and sweeter. The pancake is fluffier than the <b>French</b> <b>crêpe</b> or the Russian blin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} and describe the mechanisms occurring during the baking of a <b>French</b> <b>crêpe</b> product with a focus on the impact of the baking temperature on the formation of the " leopard " appearance. A <b>French</b> <b>crêpe</b> is a very thin bakery product (ca. 0. 7 mm thick), which is baked in less than 20 s at 240 C ± 20 C in industrial conditions. Different microscopic techniques were used to understand the impact of the process parameters on the crêpe structure and the formation of the " fleur ". Crêpe baking is a very rapid process during which boiling occurs at selected locations of the crêpe-surface contact zone. The onset of boiling leads to the detachment of the crêpe batter from the baking surface: it is related to the balance between the resistance of the batter undergoing the baking transition and the vapor pressure inside the blister formed between the baking surface and the crêpe...|$|E

5000|$|English pancakes {{are like}} wheat flour crêpes, and are served with golden syrup or {{lemon juice and}} sugar. Swedish pancakes, also called Nordic pancakes, {{are similar to the}} <b>French</b> <b>crêpes.</b> In some of the Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, {{especially}} lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savory fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in Swedish and räiskäle in Finnish, which resemble the <b>French</b> <b>crêpes</b> and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has plättar/lettu which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter (fläskpannkaka); these are baked in the oven. Potato pancakes called raggmunk contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing rårakor). Raggmunk and rårakor are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and lingonberry jam. A special Swedish pancake is saffron pancake from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special [...] "Swedish pancake" [...] is the äggakaka (eggcake), also called skånsk äggakaka (scanian eggcake), it is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also a lot more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1½ to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry jam) or sugar.|$|R
50|$|German {{doughnuts}} (which have no hole) {{are usually}} balls of yeast dough with jam or other fillings, and {{are known as}} Berliner, Pfannkuchen (only in Berlin and Eastern Germany), Kreppel or Krapfen, depending on the region. Eierkuchen or Pfannkuchen are large (usually around 20-24 cm in diameter), and relatively thin (~5mm) pancakes, comparable to the <b>French</b> <b>crêpes.</b> They are served covered with sugar, jam or syrup. Salty variants with cheese, ground meat or bacon exist as well as variants with apple slices baked in (called Apfelpfannkuchen, literally for apple pancakes), but they are usually considered to be main dishes rather than desserts. In some regions, Eierkuchen are filled and then wrapped; in others, they are {{cut into small pieces}} and arranged in a heap (called Kaiserschmarrn, often including raisins baked in). The word Pfannkuchen means pancake in most parts of Germany.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{the batter}} should be cooked in a {{specific}} device called billig in Breton, galetiere in the local French dialect (galettoire or tuile in Upper Brittany). The batter is spread out onto a disc with a small spatula called a rozell (Breton), rouable or raclette in the local <b>French</b> dialect. <b>Crêpes</b> based on the Breton recipes are usually made with a simple crêpière (or frying pan).|$|R
50|$|English pancakes {{have three}} key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk, though Gervase Markham's 1615 version in The English Huswife used water instead of milk, and added sweet spices. The batter is runny and forms {{a thin layer}} {{on the bottom of}} the frying pan when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to <b>French</b> <b>crêpes</b> and Italian crespelle. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the {{traditional}} topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with golden syrup, or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course. On Shrove Tuesday, it is custom to eat pancakes, and lemon juice and sugar may be added on top. Yorkshire pudding is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. Oatcakes are a savoury variety of pancake particularly associated with Staffordshire.|$|R

5000|$|A crêpe or crepe ( [...] or , , Quebec French: [...] ) {{is a type}} of {{very thin}} pastry, usually made from wheat flour (crêpes de froment) or {{buckwheat}} flour (galettes). Crêpes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (τίγανος), meaning [...] "frying pan", which in English is literary translated to Pancakes Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3. The <b>French</b> term, <b>crêpe,</b> derives from the Latin crispa, meaning tiganitai with [...] "creases". While crêpes are often associated with Brittany, a region in the northwest of France, their consumption is widespread in France, Belgium, Canada, and many parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Southern Cone of South America. Crêpes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to flambéed crêpes Suzette or elaborate savoury galettes.|$|R
5000|$|Crêpes are {{especially}} popular throughout France. The common ingredients include flour, eggs, milk, butter, and {{a pinch of}} salt. Crêpes are usually of two types: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) made with wheat flour and slightly sweetened; and savoury galettes (crêpes salées) made with buckwheat flour and unsweetened. The name [...] "galette" [...] came from the French word galet ("pebble") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire. Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or intolerance to eat this type of crêpe. Mille <b>crêpes</b> is a <b>French</b> cake made of many crêpe layers. The word mille means [...] "a thousand", implying the many layers of <b>crêpe.</b> Another standard <b>French</b> and Belgian <b>crêpe</b> is the crêpe Suzette, a crêpe with lightly grated orange peel and liqueur (usually Grand Marnier) which is subsequently lit upon presentation.|$|R
