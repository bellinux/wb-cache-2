40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} use of Fractional Order Calculus (FOC) in {{conventional}} Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) systems. Two modifications to the conventional MRAC are presented, i. e., {{the use of}} <b>fractional</b> order parameter <b>adjustment</b> rule and the employment of fractional order reference model. Through examples, benefits {{from the use of}} FOC are illustrated together with some remarks for further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{convergence}} rate of {{the sample}} mean of fractionally integrated processes is exploited to build test statistics for the fractional integration parameter d of univariate series, {{as well as for}} the rank of fractional cointegration of multivariate series with known or unknown order of <b>fractional</b> integration. Recursive <b>adjustment</b> is employed when dealing with deterministic components. The suggested test statistics are easy to compute and possess standard limiting distributions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lateral {{control of}} an {{autonomous}} guided vehicle is influenced strongly {{by both the}} longitudinal speed and the position input command (magnitude of the reference signal) of the vehicle. For that reason some suitable strategies for governing the vehicle are adaptive and robust controllers. In this article, an adaptive scheme which combines a model reference approach with a <b>fractional</b> order <b>adjustment</b> rule for a feedforward gain adjustment is proposed. Two parameters can be tuned to obtain robustness with respect to variations in speed and magnitude of the reference signal: Adaptation gain, and derivative order of the adjustment rule. A model is developed for the vehicle, the design procedure is discussed, and simulation results are obtained to show the advantages the proposed fractional adaptation scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{lateral control}} of an {{autonomous}} guided vehicle (AGV) is highly inuenced {{both for the}} longitudinal speed and the position input command (magnitude of the reference signal) of the vehicle. For that reason, a suitable strategy to govern the vehicle would be to use an adaptive and robust controller. In this paper an adaptive scheme is proposed which combines a model reference approach and a <b>fractional</b> order <b>adjustment</b> rule for a feedforward gain adjustment. Two parameters can be tuned to obtain robustness against speed and magnitude of the reference signal variations: adaptation gain, and derivative order of the adjustment rule. A model is developed for the vehicle, the design procedure is exposed, and simulation results are obtained to show the advantages of using the proposed fractional adaptation scheme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the ability of}} the general production-inventory replenishment policy to maintain desired level of service. Key control parameters that affect stability of the replenishment policy are the <b>fractional</b> rates of <b>adjustments</b> of discrepancies in WIP and inventory. The effect of these control parameters on the service level (order fill rate) of the production-inventory system which face independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) random demand is investigated. A replenishment policy that explicitly accounts for the safety stock, and thus improves the service levels, has been proposed. The range of parameter settings that assures the desired service level without affecting system stability has been determined...|$|R
