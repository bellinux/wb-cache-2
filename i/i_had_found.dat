25|$|Meantime, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower {{walked up and down}} with his traffic.|$|E
25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, broad bands of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally broad bands arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> a means to identify the mystery sample after all. I could distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, the moment of truth was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond any doubt, that the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of broad bands in the plane of the section with equally broad bands arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, that in my octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but the implications are fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|E

500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> my savior." [...] She {{went on to say}} that it was her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: [...] "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church– / I keep it, staying at Home".|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1886, Butcher {{conceived}} the idea of writing an illustrated history of Custer County. [...] This, he thought, would {{be the key to}} fame and riches. [...] "At last, Eureka! Eureka! [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> it. [...] I was so elated that I lost all desire for rest and had to take morphine to make me sleep." [...] To embark upon this project, he needed financing. [...] Unlike Butcher, his father had succeeded as a farmer, running a gristmill and a freighting business as well; it was to him that Butcher turned for assistance. [...] Thomas Jefferson Butcher was initially skeptical; but after his son had arranged to photograph 75 homesteads, he agreed to provide a team and wagon for the project.|$|E

[...] While attending Yale, McCullough studied Arts and earned his bachelor's degree in English, with the intention of becoming a fiction writer or playwright. He graduated with honors in English literature (1955).|$|E

2500|$|In 1945 {{she fell}} in love with {{director}} Roberto Rossellini while working on Roma, Città Aperta aka Rome, Open City (1945). [...] "I thought at last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the ideal man... had lost a son of his own and I felt we understood each other. Above all, we had the same artistic conceptions." [...] Rossellini had become violent, volatile and possessive, and they argued constantly about films or out of jealousy. [...] "In fits of rage they threw crockery at each other." [...] As artists, however, they complemented each other well while working on neorealist films. The two finally split apart when Rossellini fell in love with and married, Ingrid Bergman.|$|E
2500|$|Gerbic's {{interest}} in paranormal and fringe topics began during childhood, {{when she was}} most frightened by spontaneous human combustion, [...] "the idea {{that you could be}} walking down the street and suddenly, BOOM!" [...] She grew up in Salinas as a Southern Baptist who became interested in skepticism in the 1990s. [...] "I had never heard the word atheist until I was in my late teens," [...] Gerbic told Skeptical Inquirer editor Benjamin Radford. [...] "Once I found out there were other people who felt the way I did, I read everything I could on the subject". In 2000, Gerbic discovered that there was a community of skeptics and went to her first conference, Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon a month later. [...] "I felt like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> my people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morath {{was briefly}} {{married to the}} British {{journalist}} Lionel Birch and relocated to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph {{during a visit to}} Venice. [...] "It was instantly clear to me that from now on I would be a photographer", she wrote. [...] "As I continued to photograph I became quite joyous. I knew that I could express the things I wanted to say by giving them form through my eyes." [...] Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that [...] "after the isolation of Nazism I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> my language in photography." [...] After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman's secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. [...] She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym [...] "Egni Tharom", her name spelled backwards.|$|E

2500|$|By 1902, he {{had changed}} his {{approach}} in historiography to include and illustrate his belief in emotional attachment as a positive value of cultural nationalism. He would speak of historians as [...] "elders of [...] nation", and dismissed academic specialization as a [...] "blindfold". Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: [...] "The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity,... the exact contrary of tendencies <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, {{when it came to}} criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature." [...] The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show [...] "the nation itself as a living being". According to literary historian Victor Iova: [...] " [...] overall activity... did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own patriotic ideal." [...] The 1911 speech Două concepții istorice nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: [...] "The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others' lives." ...|$|E
