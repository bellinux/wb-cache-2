In a farcical Evening Gown match on {{an episode of}} WCW Thunder on January 12, Madusa defeated Oklahoma by stripping off <b>his</b> <b>dress,</b> but he attacked her after the match. She eventually lost the Cruiserweight belt to Oklahoma at Souled Out on January 16, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Even before {{retiring}} from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931, he {{took part in a}} commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier. The commission laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931, he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lieutenant John Wehle. Her wedding was the only time that he wore <b>his</b> <b>dress</b> blue uniform after he left the Marines.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Rundell and Bridge {{sold the}} diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7,200 pounds (today about £). Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted the diamond in the handle of <b>his</b> <b>dress</b> sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by <b>his</b> <b>dress,</b> by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

This gesture was believed to be an apotropaic symbol, and was thought to convey good fortune upon the viewer.|$|E
25|$|On {{the ground}} in front of Wolfe are his musket, {{cartridge}} box, and bayonet. Wolfe went into battle armed as his men were, although his musket was of higher quality. <b>His</b> <b>dress</b> is also of note.

25|$|In {{other respects}} too, Stevenson was {{moving away from}} his upbringing. <b>His</b> <b>dress</b> became more Bohemian; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a {{velveteen}} jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress.

To avoid setting a precedent among his fans, he made sure that the roles he accepted did not require him to smoke or drink or utter swear words, and extended this decision to real life. <b>His</b> <b>dress</b> code always consisted of simple white dhoti and shirt. He {{spent most of his}} vacations in his hometown, Gajanur, near the forest area where he was later abducted.|$|E

25|$|The Emperor {{is about}} five feet ten inches in height, and of a slender but elegant form; his {{complexion}} is comparatively fair, though his eyes are dark; his nose is rather aquiline, and the whole of his countenance presents a perfect regularity of feature, which, by no means, announce the great age {{he is said to}} have attained; his person is attracting, and his deportment accompanied by an affability, which, without lessening the dignity of the prince, evinces the amiable character of the man. <b>His</b> <b>dress</b> consisted of a loose robe of yellow silk, a cap of black velvet with a red ball on the top, and adorned with a peacock's feather, which is the peculiar distinction of mandarins of the first class. He wore silk boots embroidered with gold, and a sash of blue girded his waist.|$|E

25|$|The Brahmin was {{expected}} to maintain the customary English reserve in <b>his</b> <b>dress,</b> manner, and deportment, cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and {{assume the role of}} community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against avarice and insisted upon personal responsibility. Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools, colleges, and private clubs, and heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belong to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists. Politically they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans. They were marked by their manners and once distinctive elocution, the Boston Brahmin accent, a version of the New England accent. Their distinctive Anglo-American manner of dress has been much imitated and is the foundation of the style now informally known as preppy. Many of the Brahmin families trace their ancestry back to the original 17th- and 18th-century colonial ruling class consisting of Massachusetts governors and magistrates, Harvard presidents, distinguished clergy and fellows of the Royal Society of London (a leading scientific body), while others entered New England aristocratic society during the 19th century with their profits from commerce and trade, often marrying into established Brahmin families.|$|E

500|$|After Neil Young {{played a}} few concerts with Pearl Jam and {{recorded}} the album Mirror Ball with them, {{some members of}} the media gave him the title [...] "Godfather of Grunge". This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps—but also <b>his</b> <b>dress</b> and persona. A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "Neurotica was a life changer for me and {{for a lot of people}} in the Seattle music community." ...|$|E

500|$|Though an {{accomplished}} student, Luís Alves was often reprimanded for bullying new students. With time, he matured, eventually being regarded by his peers {{as a very}} reasonable and honest person. He had an ordinary appearance, with a round face, brown hair, brown eyes and average height. Luís Alves' unremarkable features were compensated by his bearing. Historian Thomas Whigham described him as someone who [...] "learned the art of giving orders early in life. Immaculate in <b>his</b> <b>dress,</b> he was soft spoken, polite, and smoothly in control of himself. He seemed to radiate calm composure and authority." ...|$|E
500|$|Kefka's {{appearance}} {{was designed by}} Yoshitaka Amano, who was given complete creative freedom in Final Fantasy VI, with only brief character outlines as guidelines. His approach was to create [...] "real" [...] and [...] "alive" [...] characters, though with consideration for the representation as small computer sprites. Kefka {{is well known for}} his clown-like apparel, which has been compared to the Joker from Batman. <b>His</b> <b>dress</b> has been described as [...] "garish", with [...] "makeup smeared across his face" [...] and [...] "a shrill, girlish laughter" [...] that is thought to [...] "punctuate his madness". In Dissidia: Final Fantasy, he also bore lip makeup patterned in a way that resembled a Glasgow smile.|$|E
500|$|Wilde, who {{had first}} {{set out to}} irritate Victorian society with <b>his</b> <b>dress</b> and talking points, then outrage it with Dorian Gray, his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally {{found a way to}} {{critique}} society on its own terms. Lady Windermere's Fan was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: [...] "it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure". The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics.|$|E
