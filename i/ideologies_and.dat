In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage.

Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory.

40|$|Background Studies on {{political}} <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> health have found associations between individual <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> health {{as well as}} between ecological measures of political <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> health. Individual <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> aggregate measures such as political regimes, however, were never examined simultaneously. Methodology/Principal Findings Using adjusted logistic multilevel models to analyze data on individuals from 29 European countries and Israel, we found that individual <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> political regime are independently associated with self-rated health. Individuals with rightwing ideologies report better health than leftwing individuals. Respondents from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics report poorer health than individuals from social democratic, liberal, Christian conservative, and former Mediterranean dictatorship countries. In contrast to individual <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> political regimes, country level aggregations of individual ideology are not related to reporting poor health. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that although both individual political <b>ideology</b> <b>and</b> contextual political regime are independently associated with individuals' self-rated health, individual political ideology appears to be more strongly associated with self-rated health than political regime...|$|R

These governments advocated and implemented <b>ideologies</b> <b>and</b> policies that were racist, xenophobic and, in the case of Nazism, genocidal.

25|$|There {{were several}} {{exceptions}} {{from the general}} rule of quick civil wars during this period. The American Civil War (1861–1865) was unusual {{for at least two}} reasons: it was fought around regional identities as well as political <b>ideologies,</b> <b>and</b> it ended through a war of attrition, rather than with a decisive battle over control of the capital, as was the norm. The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) proved exceptional because both sides in the struggle received support from intervening great powers: Germany, Italy, and Portugal supported opposition leader Francisco Franco, while France and the Soviet Union supported the government (see proxy war).|$|E
