40|$|Atomically thin {{two-dimensional}} chalcogenides such as MoS 2 monolayers are structurally ideal channel {{materials for}} the ultimate atomic electronics. However, a <b>heavy</b> <b>thickness</b> dependence of electrical performance is shown in these ultrathin materials, and the device performance normally degrades while exhibiting a low carrier mobility as compared with corresponding bulks, constituting a main hurdle for application in electronics. In this brief review, we summarize our recent work on electrode/channel contacts and carrier scattering mechanisms to address the origins of this adverse thickness dependence. Extrinsically, the Schottky barrier height increases at the electrode/channel contact area in thin channels owing to bandgap expansion caused by quantum confinement, which hinders carrier injection and degrades device performance. Intrinsically, thin channels tend to suffer from intensified Coulomb impurity scattering, resulting from the reduced interaction distance between interfacial impurities and channel carriers. Both factors {{are responsible for the}} adverse dependence of carrier mobility on channel thickness in two-dimensional semiconductors. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|The ASME SA- 542 /SA- 542 M {{steel is}} {{currently}} used for various large size, <b>heavy</b> <b>thickness</b> components that must withstand severe service {{conditions in the}} petrochemical industry. Frequently in field welding operations have {{to be carried out}} either for fabrication or repairing purposes; as a consequence, a Post Weld Heat Treatment is required to stress relieve both the weld metal and the heat affected zone, and to decrease their hardness. This PWHT unavoidably results in a further tempering treatment also of the base metal whose hardness and mechanical strength are further diminished. In addition, in field PWHT are not simple to carry out; heating panels are used, consisting of electrical resistances, embedded in ceramic tiles, under a proper insulation. Notwithstanding each panel is controlled by a thermocouple, temperature may vary from zone to zone, and even under a single panel differences of +/- 5 ° C can be recorded. Furthermore, K type thermocouples that are usually used have an allowable max. error at the PWHT temperature of 0, 5 %. Last, but not least, some degree of freedom is also left for the selection of the PWHT maximum temperature and time. Under these premises, tempering of base metal not only produces a redistribution of carbides, which increase their size and are increasingly located at grain boundaries, but may also result in some increase of the ferrite grain size. All these microstructural modification may produce an embrittlement of the base metal.

30|$|Large-scale {{high-quality}} reservoirs {{have developed}} in the giant oil and gas fields in the PLP marine carbonate strata, with a distribution area ranging from a few {{to tens of thousands}} of square kilometers. They may be thick monolayers or vertically stacked reservoir layers of various types. The formation of high-quality reservoirs is integrated and controlled by many factors, such as the structure, deposition, diagenesis, and fluid (Tucker and Wright 1990; Moore 2001; Lucia 2007; Ma et al. 2011; Du et al. 2014; He et al. 2011 b, 2016). Although the characteristics and formation mechanisms of the high-quality reservoirs may be different (Table  3), they have some similarities. First, the original sedimentary environments are all high-energy facies, such as open platform, shallow continental shelf, tidal flat, platform edge reef, and shoal sedimentary facies of large area and <b>heavy</b> <b>thickness.</b> Second, they experienced diagenetic epigenesis evolution conducive to reservoir development; among these, dolomitization and supergene karstification play an important role for the development of high-quality reservoirs (Kupecz and Land 2009). Third, they experienced multiperiod tectonic movements, where structure–pressure coupling controlled the development of the fractures in the reservoirs. These fractures not only expanded the reservoir spaces but also improved the reservoir permeability, providing spaces for the interaction between the rocks and acid fluids: CO 2, in the early stage, and acid fluids such as H 2 S in the late stage (Gale and Gomez 2007; Zhu et al. 2007; Xiang et al. 2010; Ma et al. 2011; Husnitdinov 2014). The multiperiod tectonic movements resulted in the uplift and erosion of strata, forming large unconformities and providing conditions for the formation of weathering crust karst reservoirs. For example, the multiperiod tectonic movements in the PLP marine strata in the Tarim, Sichuan, East Siberian, and Permian basins produced large-scale karst reservoirs (Postnikova et al. 2002; Dutton et al. 2005; Kang 2008; Zhang et al. 2007 b; Luo et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2012 b; Wang et al. 2013 b; Zhou 2013; Du et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014).|$|E

In this type of flow, fluid properties (e. g. density, viscosity, and temperature) are different at {{the two sides of the}} interface of the two fluids. The most challenging part of the numerical simulation of two-phase flow is to determine the location of interface accurately. In the present work, a coupled interface tracking algorithm is developed based on Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach using a cell-centered, pressure-based, coupled solver. To validate this algorithm, an analytical solution for fully developed two-phase flow in presence of gravity is derived, and then, the results of the numerical simulation of this flow are compared with analytical solution at various flow conditions. The results of the simulations show good accuracy of the algorithm despite using a nearly coarse and uniform grid. Temporal variations of interface profile toward the steady-state solution show that a greater difference between fluids properties (especially dynamic viscosity) will result in larger traveling waves.

The impression of Rome was repeatedly to renew itself for the author of these now rather antique and artless accents; was to overlay itself again and again with almost <b>heavy</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of experience, the last of which is, as I write, quite fresh to memory; and he has thus felt almost ashamed to drop his subject (though it be one that tends so easily to turn to the infinite) as if the law of change had in all the years had nothing to say to his case. It's of course but of his case alone that he speaks--wondering little what he may make of it for the profit of others by an attempt, however brief, to point the moral of the matter, or in other words compare the musing mature visitor's [...] "feeling about Rome" [...] with that of the extremely agitated, even if though extremely inexpert, consciousness reflected in the previous pages. The actual, the current Rome affects him as a world governed by new conditions altogether and ruefully pleading that sorry fact in the ear of the antique wanderer wherever he may yet mournfully turn for some re-capture of what he misses.

My genial, my helpful tag, at this point, would doubtless properly resolve itself, for the reader, into a clue toward some such successful ingenuity of quest; a remark I make, I may add, even while reflecting that the Paradise isn't apparently at all [...] "lost" [...] to visitors not of my generation. It is the seekers of that remote and romantic tradition who have seen it, from one period of ten, or even of five, years to another, systematically and remorselessly built out from their view. Their helpless plaint, their sense of the generally irrecoverable and unspeakable, is not, however, what I desire here most to express; I should like, on the contrary, with ampler opportunity, positively to enumerate the cases, the cases of contact, impression, experience, in which the cold ashes of a long-chilled passion may fairly feel themselves made to glow again. No one who has ever loved Rome as Rome could be loved in youth and before her poised basketful of the finer appeals to fond fancy was actually upset, wants to stop loving her; so that our bleeding and wounded, though perhaps not wholly moribund, loyalty attends us as a hovering admonitory, anticipatory ghost, one of those magnanimous life-companions who before complete extinction designate to the other member of the union their approved successor.

This opens {{the possibility of}} application over {{the full range of}} fluid contacting operations, including distillation, absorption, extraction and multiphase reaction with separation. A device has been developed that enables wide-ranging experimental studies to support model refinement and design of first-generation applied devices. In this first work with the new device hydrodynamic characteristics are studied for gas–liquid systems as functions of phase flow rates, rotation rate and liquid viscosity. Measurement of the <b>heavy</b> phase layer <b>thickness,</b> using image analysis based on the Young–Laplace theory for interface shape, and measurement of volume flow rate of each phase and pressure and temperature in the spiral channel allows rigorous comparisons with an existing ‘wide-channel’ model relating flow rates and layer thicknesses to phase properties, geometry and rotation rate. The measured thickness of the heavy-phase layer is predicted well by the wide-channel model at high rotation and phase flow rates, where the deviation from a uniform layer thickness due to menisci at the channel end walls and interface tilt from gravity are small. At low rotation rates, where significant meniscus height and tilt develop, the layer thickness is over-predicted by the wide channel model.

40|$|Offshore {{pipelines}} {{are increasingly}} being required to operate at high temperature and pressure as more petroleum deposits are explored further away from the shore. These extra-long pipelines are usually placed in deep sea; normally trenching to bury them becomes impractical, and therefore they are placed directly on the seabed, embedding partially only by the self-weight. As the length of pipeline increases along with the operating temperature, the likelihood for the pipeline to expand during heating cycles increases. Therefore, during heating and cooling cycles, the pipeline can experience continued expansion or the behaviour known as “pipeline walking” amounting to metres of expansion. The pipe-soil interaction behaviour could be classified into three dimensions, corresponding to axial, vertical and lateral directions. Commonly, {{all three of these}} interaction behaviours are studied in isolation, and the understanding developed combined to predict the overall response of the pipe under combined loadings. In recent years, some efforts are also reported to characterise the combined behaviour of the pipe in two or more directions. In particular, extensive research is undertaken to investigate both the vertical and lateral pipe displacement behaviours. However, the pipe axial interaction phenomenon, which is considered as the prime reason for pipe instability, is yet to be clearly established either in isolation or in combination with the interaction behaviours in the other two directions. Another unique characteristic to offshore pipe embedment is the low effective stresses at the interface. In submerged condition, significant buoyant effect (Bruton et al. 2005) would act on the sealed pipe walls and reduces the effective stresses on the soft seabed soil. As a common practice these petroleum pipes are provided with thick concrete coatings which serve as corrosion barriers. Although such coatings make the pipe <b>heavier,</b> the <b>thickness</b> of the pipe (nearly twice the diameter) counteracts the weight by enhancing buoyancy. Therefore, in deep seabed conditions, the pipe interaction occurs at very low effective contact stresses on soil, thereby providing very low interface shear strengths. As these conditions are not very common to geotechnical applications (e. g., strip footings), the soil behaviour at such low effective stresses has rarely been investigated. Funded by the CSIRO Cluster Pipe Project, the main research objectives of the current study are to interpret the axial interaction behaviour of offshore pipelines to be laid on the seabeds of the North Western Shelf of Australia. A special sophisticated 2 D actuator setup (Monash Advanced Pipe System or MAPS) was purpose built to simulate the pipe walking on a model clay seabed. Element pipe testing was conducted for both drained and undrained pipe displacement rates The results led to the characterisation of the governing parameters on the axial pipe-soil interaction behaviour. The problem was also studied by means of extensive numerical studies. The models provided the means to study the soil behaviour that cannot normally be measured by real time experiments...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt’s {{fatigue and}} modulus {{characteristics}} {{play an important}} role in pavement design. Ultimately they govern the required thickness of asphalt to structurally support <b>heavy</b> vehicles. The <b>thickness</b> of the asphalt layer is a major contributor to the cost of construction. In New Zealand, the design of structural asphalt layers has been a problem for some time and gives rise to two areas of concern. First, the present fatigue failure criterion, the Shell fatigue transfer function, which has been adopted from overseas, not only underestimates the fatigue life of the country’s asphalts, but does not accurately characterise the fatigue behaviour of our local asphalt mixes. Consequently, asphalt thicknesses are overdesigned. Second, asphalt’s fatigue behaviour is influenced by numerous factors and therefore can be difficult to characterise. The primary objective of this thesis is to develop fatigue and modulus models, by carrying out fatigue and modulus tests, to characterise the behaviour of two typical New Zealand structural asphalts. Both resilient and stiffness moduli tests were performed at a range of temperatures and loading rates developing moduli master curves, which predict the asphalt’s modulus for any pavement temperature and vehicle speed. A general full factorial experiment was carried out utilising the four-point flexural beam fatigue test. Tests were carried out at different strain levels, temperatures, and loading rates. An analysis of variance showed that the impacts of strain amplitude, temperature, binder type, the interaction of strain amplitude and temperature, and the interaction of strain amplitude and binder type have a significant effect on fatigue behaviour. The developed models, which account for temperature effects give the pavement engineer the ability to undergo a more accurate assessment of fatigue damage than at present for different climatic temperatures demonstrated by using an incremental damage analysis approach. The research shows that with such characterisation for the given pavement’s design life, thinner and less expensive roads can be constructed in New Zealand...|$|R
