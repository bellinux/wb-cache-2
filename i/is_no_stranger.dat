2500|$|Berry's {{fiction to}} date {{consists}} of eight novels and forty-seven short stories (forty-three {{of which are}} collected in That Distant Land, 2004 and A Place in Time, 2012) which, when read as a whole, form a chronicle of the fictional small Kentucky town of Port William. Because of his long-term, ongoing exploration {{of the life of}} an imagined place, Berry has been compared to William Faulkner. Yet, although Port William <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to murder, suicide, alcoholism, marital discord, and the full range of losses that touch human lives, it lacks the extremes of characterization and plot development that are found in much of Faulkner. Hence Berry is sometimes described as working in an idealized, pastoral, or nostalgic mode, a characterization of his work which he resists: [...] "If your work includes a criticism of history, which mine certainly does, you can't be accused of wanting to go back to something, because you're saying that what we were wasn't good enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|About this work, Allen Tate wrote: [...] "The {{new form}} is most interesting, the poems quite {{beautiful}} and distinguished." [...] Encouraged by {{this and other}} commendatory responses to her twelve-tone poems by poets, musicians, and composers including Stephen Sondheim, Bartlett continued to develop the new form. The House of Sleep, published in 1975, was the result, consisting of 68 poems related to dreams and written in the new form. [...] Of these poems, William Stafford wrote: [...] "There is a trancelike progression in these poems, in which all unfolds quietly, with a steady holding of a certain pervasive tone." [...] Robert M. Hutchins wrote: [...] "I am much impressed. The poems seem to me what is called an important contribution, and a beautiful one." [...] A third collection of twelve-tone poems, In Search of Identity, was published in 1977, further establishing the diversity and versatility {{of ways in which}} Bartlett was able {{to make use of the}} new form. A fourth collection of twelve-tone poems was published in 1981, Memory <b>Is</b> <b>No</b> <b>Stranger.</b>|$|E
