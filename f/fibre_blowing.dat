For metro networks, fibre cable are used with fibre counts ranging from eight to 96 SM and <b>blown</b> <b>fibre</b> with bundles of 8 fibers or less, for connecting houses and apartments. Competitors to Telia, the Swedish incumbent, helped to drive the early development of fiberbased broadband installations made by Bredbandsbolaget and others.

Active elements are in white tubes and yellow fillers or dummies are laid in the cable to fill it out depending on how many fibres and units exists - can be up to 276 fibres or 23 elements for external cable and 144 fibres or 12 elements for internal. The cable has a central strength member normally made from fiberglass or plastic. There is also a copper conductor in external cables.|$|R
40|$|The supermolecular {{structure}} of dissolving pulps produced from hardwood by the organosolv processes Acetosolv, Formacell, and Milox {{was characterized by}} physical methods (TEM, WAXS, SAXS, NMR) and compared with conventional Sulfite and standard commercial dissolving pulps. The suitability of the pulps for the NMMO technology was tested by spinning <b>fibres</b> and <b>blowing</b> films, whose structural and mechanical properties have also been determined. With TEM it was shown that the TCF-bleached organosolv pulps have only the primary (Formacell), the primary and S 1 (Milox), or mainly the S 1 (Acetosolv) layers exposed to the surface, whereas Sulfite pulping exposes the S 2 cell wall layer. Especially for Milox and Acetosolv Eucalyptus wood pulps, a reduced degree of crystallinity was found, both with WAXS and NMR. The SAXS results indicate a lower pore intersection length for the new pulps as compared to conventional pulps. Unbleached organosolv pulps show a lower crystallinity, very low pore intersection lengths, and an average crystallite shape different from their bleached counterparts. The dissolution behaviour in NMMO and the processability of the bleached organosolv pulps was satisfactory so far. Fibres and films could be produced with structural and mechanical properties comparable with conventional Sulfite and standard commercial dissolving pulp products. However, unbleached organosolv pulps {{did not meet the}} requirements of the NMMO process...|$|R

Gel <b>fibres</b> were successfully <b>blow</b> spun from this doped sol, which on subsequent heating produced ceramic fibres of orthorhombic strontium zirconate.

The fibres were found to begin forming SrZrO 3 at 400 degrees C and were present as single phase orthorhombic strontium zirconate at 800 degrees C and above. The ceramic fibres had no discernible grain structure a nd the average crystallite size was calculated to be on ly 20 nm at th is temperature, but the fibres contained small surface pores (< 0. 2 mu m) which continued to increase in size on subsequent heating, resulting in a weak and brittle fibre.

40|$|The {{reinforcement}} of polyamides with nanometric layered silicates represents nowadays an innovative strategy to produce high performance plastics with enhanced structural and functional properties. Even if {{the presence of}} very low silicate content allows polymer nanocomposites to be produced with the conventional processing equipments, the difficulty in conveniently tuning materials and processing parameters to control the developed nanomorphology represents a great limit for the applications on industrial scale. The elongational flow is common in many plastic manufacturing processes such as <b>fibre</b> spinning, film <b>blowing,</b> extrusion coating, foaming, so that a better understand of its effects on degree of silicate exfoliation and orientation inside the polymer matrix represent a crucial point to optimize the final nanostructure, to set properly the processing conditions and to control the end properties of the product. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of elongational flow on clay dispersion, exfoliation and orientation of polyamide based nanocomposites. Hybrids at different loadings of a commercial organoclay were produced by melt compounding using two polyamide matrices: a nylon 6 and a copolyamide with similar molecular weight. The elongational flow characterization was performed both in isothermal and non-isothermal conditions by using, respectively, elongational rheometer (SER) and fibre spinning technique. The rheological response of the different nanocomposites, correlated to TEM results, was used to probe the nanoscale arrangement developed within the uniaxial stretching and to explore the degree of silicate dispersion and orientation in function of initial nanomorphology and the different polymer-clay affinity due to the copolyamide structure...|$|R
40|$|Hexagonal ferrites are {{a family}} of {{magnetic}} oxides which include M ferrite, {{the most commonly used}} magnetic material in the world today. They also have more specialist potential applications, such as microwave absorption and catalysis. They are highly complex crystal structures which usuaUy require high temperatures to form a well sintered product, at the expense of grain growth, which in tum affects the magnetic properties of the material. They all exhibit magneto crystalline anisotropy; depending upon the ferrite they can have a preferred direction of magnetisation along the c axis of the hexagonal crystal (uniaxial), or in the hexagonal plane or in a cone at an angle to the plane (ferroxplana). A material made in a fibrous form has many properties; firstly it can be incorporated into a matrix to form a composite material, imparting any special properties into the whole composite. Provided their microstructure is sufficiently fme, fibres tend to be stronger than the bulk ceramic form, and if fme enough they can even be woven into a cloth. It has also been suggested that some properties, such as magnetisation, will be enhanced when the material is an aligned fibre, although this specific case has never been proven previously. This thesis presents the manufacture of a range of hexagonal ferrite fme fibres from an inorganic aqueous sol-gel precursor, and their subsequent characterisation both physically and magnetically. The <b>fibres</b> were <b>blow</b> spun from a viscous solution using a modified commercial process, and they were collected in both random and aligned forms. The sols were made from the peptisation of a precipitated iron(III) hydroxide with a mineral acid, and various combinations of iron (III) salt and acid were investigated using PCS. The best results were found to come from iron(III) chloride precipitated by ammonia and peptised with HBr, with totally nitrate and chloride based systems proving inferior. Chloride was found to add structuring to the sol, aiding spinning but resulting in a thixotropic gel if too much was present. The stoichiometric ferrite sols were made by doping the iron (I II) sol with solution of metal salts, and these were found to be critical to the stability of the sol, with barium causing particular problems, and titania was added as a second colloidal species. Stoichiometric sols of BaM, SrM, BaCoxTixFel 12 - 12 xO 19, SrCoxTixFe 12 2 x 019, CozY, COzZ, COzW, CozX and CozU ferrites were made, among others, and aU were successfully spun as fibres.

40|$|Optical fibre {{sensors can be}} used {{to measure}} a wide variety of properties. In some cases they have {{replaced}} conventional electronic sensors due to their possibility of performing measurements in environments suffering from electromagnetic disturbance, or in harsh environments where electronics cannot survive. In other cases they have had less success mainly due to the higher cost involved in fibre-optic sensor systems. Intensity modulated fibre-optic sensors normally require only low-cost monitoring systems principally based on light emitting diodes and photo diodes. The sensor principle itself is very simple when based on coupling between fibres, and coupling based intensity modulated sensors have found applications over a long time, mainly within position and vibration sensing. In this thesis new concepts and applications for intensity modulated fibre-optic sensors based on coupling between fibres are presented. From a low-cost and standard component perspective alternative designs are proposed and analyzed in order to find improved performance. The development of a sensor for an industrial temperature sensing application, involving aspects on multiplexing and fibre network installation, is presented. Optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) is suggested as an efficient technique for multiplexing several coupling based sensors, and sensor network installation with <b>blown</b> <b>fibre</b> in micro ducts is proposed as a flexible and cost-efficient alternative to traditional cabling. A new sensor configuration using a fibre to a multicore fibre coupling and an image sensor readout system is proposed. With this system a high-performance sensor setup with a large measurement range can be realised without the need for precise fibre alignment often needed in coupling based sensors involving fibres with small cores. The system performance is analyzed theoretically with complete system simulations on different setups. An experimental setup is made based on standard fibre and image acquisition components, and differences from the theoretical performance are analyzed. It is shown that sub-µm accuracy should be possible to obtain, being the theoretical limit, and it is further suggested that the experimental performance is mainly related to two error sources: core position instability and differences between the real and the expected optical power distribution. Methods to minimize the experimental error are proposed and evaluated...|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{work was}} carried out at autumn 2006 on Metso Panelboard in Sundsvall (Sweden). Metso Panelboard {{is one of the}} leading {{suppliers}} of engineering know-how, technology and after-market services for the production of medium density fibreboards (MDF). The objective for this thesis is to design a way of adding the resin into the blow line such that the resin (glue) consumption is reduced. The resin stands for 30 % of the total cost of a MDF board. By keeping the resin consumption down i. e. the mixing as efficient as possible, the total cost of the boards can hence be significantly reduced. The resin binds the fibres in the MDF board together and gives the board its strength. One way to improve the board strength is to increase the number of connections from fibre to fibre, with is achieved by better blending and resin distribution. The resin injector is positioned on the <b>blow</b> line where <b>fibre</b> and steam are flowing from the refiner to the dryer. After a litterature survey of the research and the theories about resin consumption, four main issues was identifyed. These are resin drop size, <b>blow</b> line turbulence, <b>fibre</b> penetration and pre-curing. This led to the design guidelines atomisation, adjustment, placing, angles of the injectors and maintenance. Because of the lack of information and reports regarding this subject the design could not be connected directly to resin consumption. Compared to today’s design, the design proposed in this thesis is a more mechanical advanced and probably more reliable design with a self-cleaning function. This concept was chosen based on the idea to use one self-controlling resin injector. The injector controls the pressure difference with the plunger that adjusts the column to get the right area of the annular gap. Controlling the pressure difference gives a possibillity to minimise the drop size regardless of the flow rate. The plunger will also clean the orifice between resin recipe changes or when the resin flow stops. The plunger will further protect the internal of the injector from <b>fibres</b> in the <b>blow</b> line, when there is no flow through the injector. To ensure the function, flow calculation and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed. Complete drawings were produced for the design so that a prototype can be manufactured and tested in the future. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
