50|$|Around 1813 {{some large}} sailing vessels experimented with double strikers: these had two downward-pointing spars forming an {{inverted}} V {{in the middle}} of the bowsprit. However, the practice was short-lived as it did not seem to provide any additional benefit. The <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker's</b> length was typically half the length of the spritsail yard or, when spreaders were used, the same length as one spreader.|$|R
50|$|Prod- a very strong, light, hollow tapered pole, {{often made}} of carbon fibre, {{attached}} to the bow of a modern racing yacht, enabling it to carry a spinnaker or other down-wind sail with the luff {{in line with the}} centreline of the boat. In some yachts, such as the modern 49er, the prod is retracted {{through a hole in the}} bow when sailing upwind. Larger prods, such as on an AC72, are secured by <b>dolphin</b> <b>strikers</b> to prevent the prod bending upwards or breaking.|$|R
5000|$|Other modern {{features}} are carbon fibre prods (bowsprits) supported by bob stays, <b>dolphin</b> <b>strikers</b> and bow struts. This enabled quicker setting and dropping {{of the large}} downwind sails. Huge spinnakers could be set quickly by having halyards geared by mini blocks running internally in the mast. Dacron sails were replaced by much lighter stiffer less porous material such as mylar plastic. Weights of the bare hulls dropped quickly when New Zealand designer Bruce Farr, using his experience in Moth and Cherub designs used thin 3mm ply supported by multiple lightweight stringers and stiffened with tissue fibreglass. These were quickly followed by foam and fibreglass hulls first designed by Russell Bowler. Bare hulls weigh 120 lbs but are very strong {{with the use of}} carbon and kevlar to locally reinforce mast steps, centreboard cases, chain plates and wing attachment points. Rudders were placed 500mm aft of the hull to give more control in extreme planing conditions when only the last few feet of the hull was in contact with the water.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> (an older {{term for}} a {{martingale}} boom or simply a martingale; sometimes called a striker) is a small vertical or near vertical ancillary spar spanning between the bowsprit and martingale thereby redirecting {{the tension in the}} forward end of the martingale slightly more vertically. This vertical component is necessary to more effectively oppose the forestays' mostly upward tension on the forward end of the bowsprit than would be the case {{in the absence of the}} <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> - A short spar fitted mid-way and {{vertically}} downwards, midway along a bowsprit {{that holds}} the bobstay and prevents the outboard end of the bowsprit riding upwards under the load of a tensioned headsail.|$|E
50|$|On a {{catamaran}} {{such as the}} Tornado and the Cobra {{where the}} mast is stepped on a beam between the hulls the <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> provides support for the beam {{in order to support}} the mast load.|$|E
5000|$|Spar - A {{length of}} timber, aluminium, steel or carbon fibre of {{approximately}} round or pear shape {{that is used}} to support sails. Such as a mast, boom, gaff, yard, bowsprit, prod, boomkin, pole or <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> [...]|$|E
50|$|The full-rigged {{ships of}} {{the golden age of}} sail had no spritsails, as the area under the {{bowsprit}} was instead occupied by rigging (martingales and <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker)</b> that reinforced the bowsprit and jib-boom against the forces of an increasing number of jibs.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} {{it is not}} always possible to align the capsized boat with bows pointing into wind, particularly in the presence of waves. If the boat is righted from a position where the mast is to some degree upwind of the hull, the boat’s inertia, coupled with the wind pressure, can cause it to immediately capsize in the opposite direction. The crew can mitigate this tendency by grabbing hold of the <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> on the windward side of the boat as it passes through the horizontal position. In the interests of safety the crew must be prepared to release the <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> and allow the boat to capsize for a second time if it appears that they are in danger of being lifted clear of the water.|$|E
50|$|The {{spritsail}} yard is used {{to support}} the jib-boom and flying jib-boom. The spritsail yard is mounted under the bowsprit, abaft the <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker.</b> The guys supporting the jib-booms are spread along the spritsail yard. Some ships employed a square sail, known as a spritsail, that was bent-on the spritsail yard.|$|E
50|$|From the Newport AC45 World Series {{through all}} the second season of racing, all Oracle Racing boats (including those loaned to Ben Ainslie and HS Racing) {{were found to have}} raced out of measurement, with a 3 kg ballast surplus in the <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker.</b> All points are {{therefore}} subject to change and a new winner for both seasons to be declared.|$|E
50|$|A bobstay {{is a part}} of {{the rigging}} of a sailing boat or ship. Its purpose is to {{counteract}} the upward tension on the bowsprit from the jibs and forestay. A bobstay may run directly from the stem to the bowsprit, or it may run to a <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker,</b> a spar projecting downward, which is then held to the bowsprit or jibboom by a martingale stay.|$|E
50|$|The stay of {{the fore}} {{topgallant}} mast {{is attached to}} the jib-boom at the extremity of its point. The stay for the jib sail {{is attached to the}} shouldering at its heel. Just as the bowsprit has bobstays, in order to counteract the upward force from the jib and fore topgallant stays a martingale hangs down from the point of the jib-boom to a <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker,</b> pulling downwards on the jib-boom.|$|E
5000|$|The Hobie 14 was the {{original}} catamaran designed by Hobie Alter. The general shape and design of the boat {{is very similar to}} the later Hobie 16. They share many of the same parts. The 14 was originally designed to be sailed as a unirig with just a main sail. It is possible to convert a standard 14 into a Hobie 14 [...] "Turbo", also known as the JT14, or H14T by adding a jib, trapeze and <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker.</b> No longer manufactured by Hobie North America, the Hobie 14 is still produced in limited numbers by Hobie Europe and Hobie Brazil.|$|E
5000|$|A {{year later}} he partnered with Alpheus Appleton Packard to found Burgess & Packard, Naval Architects and Engineers. In {{the same year}} he {{designed}} the revolutionary 52 LOA feet scow sloop [...] "Outlook", a highly radical racing yacht which featured a steel truss along the deck midline allowing the hull to be flat, low and light {{by the standards of}} the day. The design featured a large, balanced, club foot, self-tacking jib set on an 8 feet bowsprit supported by a <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker.</b> It was very fast and a winner against the more conventional keel boat designs of the day. In 1905 he established a yacht yard in Marblehead, Massachusetts and began designing and building yachts and boats.|$|E
50|$|The {{hoisting}} and hauling the spritsail top sail {{had to be}} done by a {{man standing}} on the spritsail platform without the security of any safety net. That the hauling of the sail usually {{had to be done}} specifically as the weather was turning bad meant that the task was particularly dangerous. When the implementation of the jib sail necessitated the removal of this topmast, few would mourn its passing. By the middle of the eighteenth century shipbuilders began using jibs to do the same job as the spritsail topmast with greater efficiency and less risk to human life. The stays for the jib sails made the spritsail top both irrelevant and inconvenient. By 1720 it ceased to be incorporated into new ship designs. Its place was taken by the jibboom, and its function and stay were replaced with the <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> stay.|$|E
50|$|Her nine spars {{were shaped}} from old growth Douglas fir shipped from a mill in Washington State. She was {{originally}} rigged as a brigantine carrying three {{yards on the}} foremast. She has a bowsprit, jib boom and <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> which carry three sails, the mainmast is gaff rigged with mainsail and gaff topsail, between the masts is the main staysail and fisherman. Her rigging, standing and running, about one mile of it {{was done by the}} McQuistons and son-in-law Dave Wellens using old fashioned deadeyes and wooden blocks. Seventeen months later she went for her first sail in 20 knot winds off San Diego. In 1994 with a crew of six she sailed north for her new home port of Bellingham, WA where she cruised the San Juan Islands, participated in Tall Ships events, raced with schooners up the British Columbia coast and one trip to Alaska.|$|E
40|$|Brass is a {{versatile}} alloy suitable for making engineering components exposed to aqueous and marine environments. A failed Ni coated brass nut {{that was a}} part of a <b>dolphin</b> <b>striker</b> used in a sailing boat is analysed here. Preliminary investigation suggested that the fracture was brittle with no visible evidence of plastic deformation. Microhardness indicated that the general mechanical integrity was intact with hardness of 190 HV across random sections and this is consistent with expectation for high strength brass alloy. Point probe Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis provided evidence of dealloying through electrochemical loss of Zn. EDS of stains on Ni coating indicated the presence of Zn as corrosion and Cr as corrosion products. It was confirmed that a selective loss of Zn occurred from the underlying brass body through “gates” provided from damage of the normally protective Ni layer. Such selective loss of zinc due to corrosion attack would have led to loss of strength. However, the examination of fractured section suggested an intergranular brittle fracture. The finite element analysis (FEA) showed a maximum tensile stress of 90 MPa in the fracture region which is well below the expected fracture strength. It is therefore concluded that failure of the piece was due to a combined mechanism of dezincification followed by a stress provoked brittle fracture process. It is also proposed that such failures could be avoided by alloy design and surface treatment methods to harden the Ni coating...|$|E
