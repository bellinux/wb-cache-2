5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to take another with them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join without issue, is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of getting another dog.|$|E

[...] In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish-Ukrainian War, and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the Polish struggle in Lviv.|$|E
500|$|Breyfogle's {{characterization}} of Anarky has shifted on occasion, {{with him at}} times referring to Anarky as a villain, {{and at other times}} as a hero. In his 1998 introductory essay composed for , Breyfogle characterized Anarky as not being a villain, but rather a [...] "misunderstood hero", and continued [...] "he's a philosophical action hero, an Aristotle in tights, rising above mere 'crime-fighter' status into the realm of incisive social commentary." [...] A year later, Breyfogle conceded that Anarky was [...] "technically" [...] a villain, but insisted [...] "I don't consider him a villain..." [...] Breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview: [...] "Anarky isn't a villain, he's his own character. He's definitely not a superhero, although it <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> you talk to." ...|$|E

Rashad said, [...] "I think Bill and I are great role models as far as our TV professions are concerned. Kids learn by example, and I think we're very good ones." [...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes.

An example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word [...] (versus coworker) to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group cow (which might suggest cow (...) before backtracking and reparsing occurred). In such cases, styling varies depending on individual preference, regional preference, occupational specialty, or style guide preference, because the definition of [...] "awkwardness" [...] for any given word <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> is judging it.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the Polish–Soviet War, Polish {{politics}} were strongly influenced by Chief of State (naczelnik państwa) Józef Piłsudski. Piłsudski wanted to break up the Russian Empire and to set up a Polish-led [...] "Międzymorze Federation" [...] of independent states: Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and other Central and East European countries emerging out of crumbling empires after the First World War. He hoped that this new union would become a counterweight to any potential imperialist intentions on the part of Russia or of Germany. Piłsudski argued [...] "There can be no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine", but he may have been more interested in Ukraine being split from Russia than in Ukrainians' welfare. He did not hesitate to use military force to expand the Polish borders to Galicia and Volhynia, crushing a Ukrainian attempt at self-determination in the disputed territories east of the Southern Bug River, which contained a significant Polish minority, who made up {{the majority of the population}} in cities like Lwów, in contrast to the Ukrainian majority in the countryside. Speaking of Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said: [...] "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany," [...] while in the east, [...] "There are doors that open and close, and it <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> forces them open and how far." [...] In the chaos to the east the Polish forces set out to expand there as much as feasible. On the other hand, Poland had no intention of joining the Western intervention in the Russian Civil War or of conquering Russia itself.|$|E
