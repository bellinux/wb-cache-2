5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, <b>ketoconazole,</b> nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
25|$|Antifungal {{treatments}} including <b>ketoconazole,</b> {{zinc pyrithione}} and selenium disulfide {{have been found}} to be effective. <b>Ketoconazole</b> as a shampoo appears to be the most effective.|$|E
25|$|As an antiandrogen, <b>ketoconazole</b> {{operates}} {{through at}} least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of <b>ketoconazole</b> (e.g. 400mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading {{to a reduction in}} circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, <b>ketoconazole</b> has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, <b>ketoconazole</b> is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of <b>ketoconazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> is a {{pregnancy}} category C drug because animal testing has shown it to cause teratogenesis when administered in high doses. Recently, {{the administration of}} systemic <b>ketoconazole</b> to two pregnant women for treatment of Cushing's syndrome {{was reported to have}} no adverse effects, but this small sample precludes drawing any meaningful conclusions. A subsequent trial in Europe failed to show a risk to infants of mothers receiving <b>ketoconazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> has {{activity}} against {{many kinds}} of fungi that may cause human disease, such as Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces (although it is not active against Aspergillus). First synthesized in 1977, <b>ketoconazole</b> was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, <b>ketoconazole</b> has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as itraconazole, because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> shampoo in {{conjunction}} with an oral 5α-reductase inhibitor has been used off label to treat androgenic alopecia. The antifungal properties of <b>ketoconazole</b> reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to alopecia.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>ketoconazole</b> are {{sometimes}} harnessed {{in the treatment of}} non-fungal conditions. While <b>ketoconazole</b> blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, <b>ketoconazole</b> has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydoxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, <b>ketoconazole</b> has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. <b>Ketoconazole</b> has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with <b>ketoconazole</b> limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} antimycotic agent that is active against Candida and M. furfur. Of all the antifungals of the imidazole class, <b>ketoconazole</b> has become the leading contender among treatment options because of its effectiveness in treating seborrheic dermatitis as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> was {{discovered}} in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceutica. It was initially introduced in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in 1981. It was introduced as the prototypical drug of the imidazole antifungals. Oral <b>ketoconazole</b> has been replaced with oral itraconazole for many mycoses.|$|E
25|$|As an antifungal, <b>ketoconazole</b> is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} imidazole, and {{interferes with the}} fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, <b>ketoconazole</b> works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to <b>ketoconazole,</b> {{as they have been}} found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole,</b> another {{antifungal}} agent used in shampoos.|$|E
25|$|When {{administered}} orally, <b>ketoconazole</b> is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids {{or other}} causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption {{can be increased}} by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. <b>Ketoconazole</b> is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> is the drug's INN, USAN, BAN, and JAN.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{reduces the}} {{absorption}} of <b>ketoconazole</b> and itraconazole (which require a low pH).|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{and other}} {{corticosteroids}} are agonists, and mifepristone and <b>ketoconazole</b> are antagonists of the GR.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole,</b> {{along with}} miconazole, {{has been found}} to act as an {{antagonist}} of the glucocorticoid receptor.|$|E
25|$|Topically {{administered}} <b>ketoconazole</b> {{is usually}} prescribed for fungal infections {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical <b>ketoconazole</b> is also used {{as a treatment for}} dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> is a {{synthetic}} imidazole antifungal drug used primarily to treat fungal infections. <b>Ketoconazole</b> is sold commercially as a tablet for oral administration (although this use has been discontinued {{in a number}} of countries), and in a variety of formulations for topical administration, such as creams (used to treat tinea; cutaneous candidiasis, including candidal paronychia; and pityriasis versicolor) and shampoos (used primarily to treat dandruff—seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp).|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} use of sibutramine {{and drugs}} which inhibit CYP3A4, such as <b>ketoconazole</b> and erythromycin, may increase plasma levels of sibutramine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> is used orally in dosages of 200 to 400mg {{per day in}} the {{treatment}} of superficial and deep fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{study has been}} {{performed}} showing that <b>ketoconazole</b> {{may be useful in}} temporarily reducing erectile function in postoperative penile surgery patients.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{clinical}} studies suggest <b>ketoconazole</b> shampoo used either {{alone or in}} combination with other treatments may be useful in reducing hair loss.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of zonisamide is inhibited by <b>ketoconazole,</b> ciclosporin, miconazole, fluconazole and carbamazepine (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E
25|$|The {{substituted}} imidazole derivatives {{are valuable}} in treatment of many systemic fungal infections. Imidazoles {{belong to the}} class of azole antifungals, which includes <b>ketoconazole,</b> miconazole, and clotrimazole.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> is also {{sometimes}} prescribed by veterinarians {{for use on}} pets, often as unflavored tablets that {{may need to be}} cut to smaller size for correct dosage.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, <b>ketoconazole,</b> itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Oral use of <b>ketoconazole</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with hepatic toxicity, including some fatalities; however, such effects appear to be limited to doses taken over a period longer than 7 days.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin, <b>ketoconazole</b> and {{cyclosporine}} are CYP3A4 inhibitors {{and therefore}} inhibit the metabolic pathway of docetaxel. When used with anticonvulsants, which induce CYP3A4, an increased dose of docetaxel may be required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> {{shampoos}} and creams {{are currently}} {{shown to be}} the most effective medical treatment of moderate to serious cradle cap. Research indicates that this anti-fungal medication is not absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure. The typical {{treatment}} is with antifungal cream such as <b>ketoconazole.</b> Dandruff affects {{about half of}} adults. Onset is usually at puberty. Males are more often affected than females. Rates decrease {{after the age of}} 50.|$|E
25|$|Nevirapine is an inducer of {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It {{may reduce}} levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, {{as well as}} clarithromycin, <b>ketoconazole,</b> forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{that depend}} on an acidic stomach {{environment}} (such as <b>ketoconazole</b> or atazanavir) may be poorly absorbed, whereas acid-labile antibiotics (such as erythromycin {{which is a very}} strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) may be absorbed {{to a greater extent than}} normal due to the more alkaline environment of the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{that depend}} on stomach pH for {{absorption}} may interact with omeprazole; drugs {{that depend on}} an acidic environment (such as <b>ketoconazole</b> or atazanavir) will be poorly absorbed, whereas drugs that are broken down in acidic environments (such as erythromycin) will be absorbed {{to a greater extent}} than normal.|$|E
25|$|Anal fistulae*, {{known as}} perianal fistulae in dogs, are {{most common in}} German Shepherd Dogs. They are {{characterized}} by draining tracts in the skin around the anus. The cause is unknown. Surgical treatment is common, but recently use of cyclosporine in combination with <b>ketoconazole</b> {{has been shown to}} be effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketoconazole</b> is a {{racemic mixture}} {{consisting}} of cis-(2S,4R)-(−) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17α,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 μM, respectively) and in inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 μM, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam {{decreases}} {{the levels of}} carbamazepine, and, likewise, clonazepam's level is reduced by carbamazepine. Azole antifungals, such as <b>ketoconazole,</b> may inhibit the metabolism of clonazepam. Clonazepam may affect levels of phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin). In turn, Phenytoin may lower clonazepam plasma levels by increasing the speed of clonazepam clearance by approximately 50% and decreasing its half-life by 31%.|$|E
