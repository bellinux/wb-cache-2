40|$|Being {{excluded}} should motivate pro-social behaviors. Yet, <b>exclusion</b> can incite {{aggressive and}} anti-social responses. Two studies {{were conducted to}} examine how frequent experiences of <b>exclusion</b> impact self-esteem, perceptions that <b>exclusion</b> is typical of social experiences, and anti-social behaviors. In Study 1, participants completed pre and post-measures of <b>exclusion</b> typicality and self-esteem and reported, over eight weeks, feelings of <b>exclusion</b> and state self-esteem. Results supported the hypotheses in that experiences feeling excluded have direct and indirect effects on state and trait self-esteem {{as well as on}} <b>exclusion</b> typicality. In Study 2, participants were exposed to an <b>exclusion</b> manipulation and subsequent aggressive and anti-social behaviors were assessed. Results were inconsistent with hypotheses that <b>exclusion</b> typicality and self-esteem would moderate responses to <b>exclusion.</b> Discussion focuses on the implications for a model of <b>exclusion</b> elicited anti-social behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Dijkstra {{introduced}} mutual <b>exclusion</b> for an N-process {{system as}} the requirement “that {{at any moment}} {{only one of these}} N cyclic processes is in its critical section ” [1]. This requirement, which we call true mutual <b>exclusion,</b> is still the standard definition of mutual <b>exclusion.</b> Mutual <b>exclusion</b> algorithms for shared-memory multiprocessors do not guarantee true mutual <b>exclusion.</b> We give a simple example that shows why a mutual <b>exclusion</b> algorithm can permit two critical sections to be executing at the same time. We prove that a shared-memory mutual <b>exclusion</b> algorithm does provide true mutual <b>exclusion</b> if a processor does not knowin advance what memory operations will follow the critical section. Modern processors can look ahead at operations that followa critical section. If true mutual <b>exclusion</b> is needed, this look-ahead must be inhibited. However, as we will explain, true mutual <b>exclusion</b> is seldom useful in practice. One of the strongest and most common assumptions made about multiprocessor shared memory is sequential consistency. Sequential consistency i...|$|R

This research examines whether <b>exclusion</b> that {{is perceived to be}} due to lack of warmth or lack of competence influence the degree of pain. Across three studies, <b>exclusion</b> due to lack of warmth is more painful than <b>exclusion</b> due to lack of competence. In Study 3, malleability beliefs moderate the effects of warmth-based <b>exclusion</b> on pain, such that when warmth is believed to be less malleable, warmth-based <b>exclusion</b> leads to greater pain. These findings contribute to emerging recognition of the primacy of warmth-based judgments over competence judgments in social perceptions...|$|R
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or <b>exclusions.</b> Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between the northern and southern groups with minor <b>exclusions.</b> Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean to reach its feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be pelagic. In general, they prefer to stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These <b>exclusions</b> pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
40|$|Prosocial {{punishment}} {{has been}} {{proved to be a}} powerful mean to promote cooperation. Recent studies have found that social <b>exclusion,</b> which indeed can be regarded as a kind of punishment, can also support cooperation. However, if prosocial punishment and <b>exclusion</b> are both present, it is still unclear which strategy is more advantageous to curb free-riders. Here we first study the direct competition between different types of punishment and <b>exclusion.</b> We find that pool (peer) <b>exclusion</b> can always outperform pool (peer) punishment both in the optional and in the compulsory public goods game, no matter whether second-order sanctioning is considered or not. Furthermore, peer <b>exclusion</b> does better than pool <b>exclusion</b> both in the optional and in the compulsory game, but the situation is reversed in the presence of second-order <b>exclusion.</b> Finally, we extend the competition among all possible sanctioning strategies and find that peer <b>exclusion</b> can outperform all other strategies in the absence of second-order <b>exclusion</b> and punishment, while pool <b>exclusion</b> prevails when second-order sanctioning is possible. Our results demonstrate that <b>exclusion</b> is a more powerful strategy than punishment for the resolution of social dilemmas...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on social}} <b>exclusion</b> has mainly focused on {{situations}} in which <b>exclusion</b> is highly ambiguous and represents a violation of prevailing inclusion norms. However, it has rarely been accounted for that social <b>exclusion</b> situations are subjectively construed by the involved actors. In this dissertation, I suggest that subjective reactions to <b>exclusion</b> are cognitively mediated {{and do not necessarily}} depend on objective qualities of the <b>exclusion</b> experience. I further present a construal-based model of social <b>exclusion</b> that frames the construal of social <b>exclusion</b> as a function of norm consistency (whether social <b>exclusion</b> is consistent with or violating social norms) and the adopted perspective (targets, sources, and observers). This dissertation contains four manuscripts, which emphasize the important role of subjective construal. Rudert, Hales, Greifeneder, and Williams (2016) showed that minimal acknowledgement affects the subjective experience of <b>exclusion</b> more strongly than the objective amount of <b>exclusion.</b> Rudert and Greifeneder (2016) demonstrated that targets’ negative reactions to <b>exclusion</b> are attenuated if <b>exclusion</b> is perceived as consistent with compared to violating the prevailing social norm. Rudert, Janke, and Greifeneder (2016) investigated subjective <b>exclusion</b> experiences as a reaction to an anti-immigration popular vote in Switzerland and demonstrated differences due to personal norms and attitudes. Finally, Rudert, Reutner, Greifeneder, and Walker (2017) showed that observers’ moral judgment of social <b>exclusion</b> experiences is affected by facial characteristics of the excluded target. All manuscripts are discussed in terms of the presented model together with additional lines of research that can be derived from a perspective of subjective construal. ...|$|R
40|$|Social <b>exclusion</b> is a psychologically {{stressful}} experience that impairs people’s {{ability to control}} specific behaviors or events. In the current study, I attempted to reconcile competing predictions regarding whether <b>exclusion</b> is especially harmful to control, or self-regulate, when it is attributed to individual- or group-based characteristics of a person. Per the self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) model, social <b>exclusion</b> should be most detrimental to self-regulation when it is directed at a person’s unique traits, or individual self. In contrast, social identity theory (SIT) predicts that <b>exclusion</b> is especially damaging when it is directed at a person’s group membership. I examined whether the seemingly contradictory predictions made by SEM and SIT are because they relate to different circumstances concerning {{the fairness of the}} <b>exclusion</b> experience. Most research regarding individual-based <b>exclusion</b> involves situations in which the <b>exclusion</b> seems fair, or deserved, whereas research regarding group-based <b>exclusion</b> focuses on discrimination, or unfair <b>exclusion.</b> An online <b>exclusion</b> paradigm (i. e., “College Survivor”) was used to examine the role of fairness. During the Survivor game, Latina women experienced either individual- or group-based <b>exclusion</b> that was either fair or unfair. Afterwards, participants were asked to taste and rate three bowls of chocolate that were ostensibly manufactured in three countries that used different recipes. The findings demonstrated that participants consumed the most calories (i. e., showed the greatest loss of self-control) when <b>exclusion</b> was fair and directed towards their individual selves, or when <b>exclusion</b> was unfair and directed towards their group selves...|$|R

On 31 March 2016, Lauren Jackson announced her retirement from basketball, citing a chronic knee injury {{as the reason for}} her decision. The Olympic squad was announced on 12 July 2016 and included seven Olympic debutants and only three players from the 2012 squad. Notable <b>exclusions</b> included three-time Olympic medallist Suzy Batkovic, reigning WNBL MVP Abby Bishop and Rebecca Allen. Despite slow starts which had plagued Australia throughout the tournament, the Opals finished on top of their group with a 5–0 record, outscoring Japan 33–15 in the final quarter to win by 6 points. In the Quarter-final, the Opals suffered a shock 73–71 loss to Serbia, conceding 26 turnovers and eliminating them from medal contention. This ended a run of five successive Olympic medals dating back 20 years. One highlight was Liz Cambage breaking Lauren Jackson's Australian Olympic record of points scored in a single game with 37 against Japan.

A total of 776 childless female Australian residents aged 25 to 44 years completed a self-administered questionnaire.
