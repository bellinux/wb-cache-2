50|$|Each of the {{techniques}} listed above are known as indirect methods for characterization of quantum dynamics, since they {{require the use of}} quantum state tomography to reconstruct the process.

50|$|An {{important}} issue in molecular electronics is {{the determination of}} the resistance of a single molecule (both theoretical and experimental). For example, Bumm, et al. used STM to analyze a single molecular switch in a self-assembled monolayer to determine how conductive such a molecule can be.

50|$|Character {{creation}} is typically {{the first step}} taken by the players (as opposed to the gamemaster) {{in preparation for a}} game. The result of character {{creation is}} a <b>direct</b> <b>characterization</b> that is recorded on a character sheet. In its most comprehensive form it includes not only a game-specific representation of the character's physical, mental, psychological and social properties in terms of statistics, but also often less formal descriptions of the character’s physical appearance, personality, personal back-story (“background”) and possessions. During play, only a character’s appearance is usually described explicitly while other traits are characterized indirectly, with the exact statistics known to the character’s player and the game master, but not necessarily to other players.|$|E

Short current spikes were observed, suggestive of trapping/detrapping of individual nucleotides between the nanoelectrodes. The fall and rise features of the electrical signatures indicated signal retardation by capacitance effects with a time constant of about 10 microseconds. The high temporal resolution revealed current fluctuations, reflecting the molecular conformation degrees of freedom in the electrode gap.

40|$|The {{dominant}} view among macroeconomists is that macroeconomics reduces to microeconomics, both in {{the sense}} that all macroeconomic phenomena arise out of microeconomic phenomena and {{in the sense that}} macroeconomic theory-to the extent that it is correct-can be derived from microeconomic theory. More than that, the dominant view believes that macroeconomics should in practice use the reduced microeconomic theory: this is the program of microfoundations for macroeconomics to which the vast majority of macroeconomists adhere. The "microfoundational" models that they actually employ are, however, characterized by another feature: they are highly idealized, even when they are applied as <b>direct</b> <b>characterizations</b> of actual data, which itself consists of macroeconomic aggregates. This paper explores the interrelationship between reductionism and idealization in the microfoundational program and the role of idealization in empirical modeling. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
