Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired fine motor skills, neurosensory hearing loss, poor gait, clumsiness, poor eye-hand coordination. [...] Many soft signs have norm-referenced criteria, {{while others are}} determined through clinical judgment.

2500|$|Hayek {{wrote an}} essay, [...] "Why I Am Not a Conservative" [...] (included as an {{appendix}} to The Constitution of Liberty), {{in which he}} disparaged conservatism for its inability to adapt to changing human realities or to offer a positive political program, remarking, [...] "Conservatism <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> what it conserves." [...] Although he noted that modern day conservatism shares many opinions on economics with classical liberals, particularly {{a belief in the}} free market, he believed it's because conservatism wants to [...] "stand still," [...] whereas liberalism embraces the free market because it [...] "wants to go somewhere." [...] Hayek identified himself as a classical liberal, but noted that in the United States it had become almost impossible to use [...] "liberal" [...] in its original definition, and the term [...] "libertarian" [...] has been used instead. In this text, Hayek also opposed conservatism for [...] "its hostility to internationalism and its proneness to a strident nationalism," [...] with its frequent association with imperialism.|$|E
