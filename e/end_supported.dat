500|$|Emigration {{rose again}} {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, {{reaching}} a new peak of about 35,000 Swedes in 1903. Figures remained high until World War I, alarming both conservative Swedes, who saw emigration as a challenge to national solidarity, and liberals, who feared the disappearance of the labor force necessary for economic development. One-fourth of all Swedes had made the United States their home, and a broad national consensus mandated that a Parliamentary Emigration Commission study the problem in 1907. Approaching the task with what Barton calls [...] "characteristic Swedish thoroughness", the Commission published its findings and proposals in 21 large volumes. The Commission rejected conservative proposals for legal restrictions on emigration and in the <b>end</b> <b>supported</b> the liberal line of [...] "bringing the best sides of America to Sweden" [...] through social and economic reform. Topping the list of urgent reforms were universal male suffrage, better housing, and general economic development. The Commission especially hoped that broader popular education would counteract [...] "class and caste differences" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{public was}} outraged on hearing the verdict. [...] The {{following}} {{ran in the}} Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shinbun, a paper that publicly protested the event in print. [...] "No matter how ignorant you may think the Japanese are, to claim that they could stare {{into the face of}} danger and fail to recognize the gravity of the situation is absurd. [...] The idea that these people were too stupid to know how to save themselves or even get help from others is a grave fallacy." [...] Donations poured in {{from all over the country}} to support the families of the victims who lost their lives. [...] Entire newspapers covered nothing but stories about the incident for days on <b>end,</b> <b>supported</b> by mournful editorials and articles calling for the removal of the officials in question. [...] Even well-known legal scholars openly accused Captain Drake. [...] Fringe politicians across the land held open meetings in which they publicly condemned Britain's violence and record of violating human rights while they rallied for the return of political power to the Japanese people.|$|E
2500|$|A {{master of}} complex {{politics}} at home, Bismarck {{created the first}} welfare state in the modern world, {{with the goal of}} gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the Liberals (who were low-tariff and anti-Catholic) and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the Kulturkampf ("culture struggle"). He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming a powerful Centre party and using universal male suffrage to gain a bloc of seats. Bismarck then reversed himself, ended the Kulturkampf, broke with the Liberals, imposed protective tariffs, and formed a political alliance with the Centre Party to fight the Socialists. A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his king, who argued with Bismarck but in the <b>end</b> <b>supported</b> him against the advice of his wife and his heir. While the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, was elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government policy. [...] Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with {{power in the hands of}} a traditional Junker elite that consisted of the landed nobility in eastern Prussia. Under Wilhelm I, Bismarck largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs, until he was removed by the young Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, at the age of seventy-five.|$|E

60|$|Venn {{soon after}} went away, {{and in the}} evening Yeobright strolled as far as Fairway's cottage. It was a lovely May sunset, and the birch trees which grew on this margin of the vast Egdon {{wilderness}} had put on their new leaves, delicate as butterflies' wings, and diaphanous as amber. Beside Fairway's dwelling was an open space recessed from the road, and here were now collected all the young people from within a radius {{of a couple of}} miles. The pole lay with one <b>end</b> <b>supported</b> on a trestle, and women were engaged in wreathing it from the top downwards with wildflowers. The instincts of merry England lingered on here with exceptional vitality, and the symbolic customs which tradition has attached to each season of the year were yet a reality on Egdon. Indeed, the impulses of all such outlandish hamlets are pagan still: in these spots homage to nature, self-adoration, frantic gaieties, fragments of Teutonic rites to divinities whose names are forgotten, seem in some way or other to have survived mediaeval doctrine.|$|E
