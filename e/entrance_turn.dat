5000|$|In {{the final}} scene, A-ha once again {{makes fun of}} themselves: the VIP <b>{{entrance}}</b> <b>turns</b> {{out to be an}} entrance to a work hall for the crew.|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} or two {{somebody}} beat upon the door, and getting no answer drove it open. Then a sulphur match sputtered, and the trooper who stood in the <b>entrance</b> <b>turned</b> to a man behind him.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of Lodge 322 of Elks Hall, San Luis Obispo, ca. 1900. At center, {{a two-story}} concrete building is pictured, its <b>entrance</b> <b>turned</b> away towards the left distance where two horse-drawn carriages can be seen. At right, a man stands under {{the canopy of}} a horse-drawn cart, possibly a vending cart...|$|R

50|$|Back at the store, Neil is {{watching}} a film with his friend/employee Jonathan (Jason Sudeikis), when femme fatale Violet (Lucy Liu) makes her <b>entrance,</b> <b>turning</b> his head. Violet has no identification or credit card for her rental deposit, so she persuades {{him to take}} $50 cash, which he puts in an envelope under his antique cash register. When she returns, she surreptitiously steals back the deposit, making him think he lost it, but she says he can take her out for a $50 dinner {{to make it up}} to her.|$|R
6000|$|Ujarak led {{the youth}} to the berg with the sea-green cave. Stopping at the <b>entrance,</b> he <b>turned</b> a stern {{look on his}} pupil, and {{pointing}} to the cavern, uttered the single word--"Follow." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{remaining}} {{portions of the}} British Empire Exhibition's Palace of Arts were demolished in 2006. The only surviving Exhibition structure, the Palace of Industry, was finally demolished in February-March 2013. A lion's head corbel from the building was saved and is now {{on display in the}} green space on Wembley Hill Road, opposite York House. The former Wembley Conference Centre, and the Elvin House block, were also demolished in September 2006. Also in 2006, Wembley Arena, was refurbished at a cost of £34m and its <b>entrance</b> <b>turned</b> around to open onto a new public square with a fountain facing the new Wembley Stadium which then opened in 2007.|$|R
50|$|GH-12 {{is a short}} {{connector}} {{route that}} runs eastward from GH-2 through {{the northern part of}} residential Agat towards the Ordnance Annex Naval facility in Santa Rita. At the <b>entrance,</b> GH-12 <b>turns</b> north and connects to GH-5 running north then west.|$|R
50|$|Having run broadly west to {{east from}} Roding Valley through Chigwell to Grange Hill, the Hainault loop turns to the south to reach Hainault station. The depot is {{situated}} {{to the west of}} the loop, with the northern <b>entrance</b> <b>turning</b> off from the Central Line a little to the south of Grange Hill. Access to the loop at the southern end of the depot is to the north of Hainault station. The border between the county of Essex and the London Borough of Redbridge runs along the line of the railway from Grange Hill, and then runs along the western perimeter fence, before turning to the west before reaching the southern end of the site.|$|R
50|$|The mall now {{comprises}} over 100 {{shops and}} services, a food court, {{with about a}} dozen eateries, and a small format Barnes & Noble store adjacent to the food court. From the mall's opening until around 2003, the mall also had a six-screen movie theater, which {{from the middle of}} the 1980s to about 2003 was called Budget Cinemas and owned by Silver Cinemas. It closed in 2003 because Budget Cinemas Mall Wing Entrance and other stores near the entrance were bought by Steve & Barry's, with the mall <b>entrance</b> <b>turned</b> into the <b>entrance</b> for Steve & Barry's. Steve & Barry's closed in Dec 2008, and is now a Steinhafels, a local furniture chain.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} lap, Webber {{lost control}} out of turn eight, spun on the <b>entrance</b> to <b>turn</b> nine, and allowed Räikkönen and Ralf Schumacher to pass- on a circuit with very forgiving run-off areas, the spin upset {{the balance of}} Webber's car and flat-spotted his tyres.|$|R
50|$|Walther's car {{finally stopped}} at the <b>entrance</b> of <b>turn</b> one, with the driver's legs clearly visible {{sticking}} out of the broken nose. Walther was quickly rescued by track safety workers (with the help of Wally Dallenbach Sr.) and rushed to the hospital in critical condition.|$|R
25|$|After {{the main}} <b>entrance</b> and before <b>turning</b> to the Passage of Concubines is the Courtyard of the Queen Mother.|$|R
60|$|He saw no Little Dorrit {{on his way}} down, or in the yard. The {{last two}} or three stragglers were hurrying to the lodge, and he was following, when he caught sight of her {{in the doorway of the}} first house from the <b>entrance.</b> He <b>turned</b> back hastily.|$|R
5000|$|The road route was modified, and the {{circular}} plaza between the car {{park and the}} <b>entrance</b> was <b>turned</b> into a traffic circle. The section of the car park that was perpendicular to the plaza {{was made into a}} road, going further and joining the Boulevard des Merveilles in the [...] area.|$|R
60|$|One {{evening when}} he went to Four Winds he found the door open and, seeing the Captain in the living room, he stepped in unannounced. Captain Anthony was sitting by the table, his head in his hands; at Alan's <b>entrance</b> he <b>turned</b> upon him a haggard face, {{blackened}} by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence.|$|R
500|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} and station are located near Wicked Twister, Troika and maXair. The ride covers it initially runs parallel to Lake Erie then travels through the parking lot, over the main <b>entrance</b> then <b>turns</b> around {{in front of}} Blue Streak. As it passes through the main entrance plaza, it passes through two -tall towers that form Cedar Point's entrance gates.|$|R
50|$|During {{his first}} {{scheduled}} pit stop, Mario Andretti's car stalled several times {{trying to leave}} the pit lane. He lost several laps, but eventually rejoined the race. On the leaders' lap 68, Andretti spun out on the backstretch, and slammed into the inside wall near the <b>entrance</b> to <b>turn</b> three. He {{was out of the}} race after completing only 49 laps.|$|R
50|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} and station are located near Wicked Twister, Troika and maXair. The ride covers 3.5 acres; it initially runs parallel to Lake Erie then travels through the parking lot, over the main <b>entrance</b> then <b>turns</b> around {{in front of}} Blue Streak. As it passes through the main entrance plaza, it passes through two 100 ft-tall towers that form Cedar Point's entrance gates.|$|R
50|$|Some {{way behind}} Harper {{a figure in}} the scarlet drawers of Spain {{appeared}} in the <b>entrance,</b> <b>turned</b> the wrong way, was stopped, and then ran horribly round in little circles till he plunged on his face. Immediately another figure appeared, Sewell of the British team. He also tried to run the wrong way, was checked, and turned round, ran giddily a few yards, staggered, met another competitor, a Finn, also reeling, and the two fell together in a dreadful heap. Meanwhile a Frenchman had entered and ran three-quarters of {{the distance to the}} winning line, began to zig-zag, threw up his arms helplessly, and crashed full length on the ground. It was all heartbreaking to watch. Never, surely, in any race - not even in a Grand National - was there anything like the proportion of casualties; and the race ought never to have been run in the heat of such a day. It was altogether a terrible race. Harper’s performance was a fine one.|$|R
60|$|The first {{object of}} her diplomacy, the exit of the enraged Bruno, {{was at once}} achieved. He had already handed his spear in a lordly style, like a sceptre, to the piteous Parkinson, {{and was about to}} assume one of the {{cushioned}} seats like a throne. But at this open appeal to his rival there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence of the slave; he knotted his enormous brown fists for an instant, and then, dashing open the door, disappeared into his own apartments beyond. But meanwhile Miss Rome's experiment in mobilizing the British Army had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable. Cutler had indeed risen stiffly and suddenly, and walked towards the door, hatless, as if at a word of command. But perhaps there was something ostentatiously elegant about the languid figure of Seymour leaning against one of the looking-glasses that brought him up short at the <b>entrance,</b> <b>turning</b> his head this way and that like a bewildered bulldog.|$|R
50|$|Trail braking is a {{motorcycle}} riding and driving technique where the brakes are used beyond the <b>entrance</b> to a <b>turn</b> and are gradually released {{up to the}} point of apex.|$|R
50|$|Jo, Sherry, and Arthur meet {{after the}} play {{but no one}} is the wiser as to the reasons for Jo's mysterious <b>entrance.</b> Jo also <b>turns</b> down an offer to {{audition}} for Arthur's play.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of both serious incidents, Watkins Glen International track {{officials}} decided to reconfigure the track and added a chicane called the Inner Loop to the <b>entrance</b> to <b>Turn</b> 5, which was renamed the Outer Loop. As of 2016 the track is laid out {{in such a manner}} that race organizers can use the chicane or bypass it in favor of the traditional setup, depending on the series.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009: On lap 98, {{while running}} in 3rd place Kanaan {{suffered}} a drive shaft failure at speed down the backstraightaway. The car suddenly pitched {{into the wall}} at the <b>entrance</b> to <b>turn</b> 3. The car lost steering, bounced off the wall, then went straight into the wall in turn 3. In television interviews, Kanaan appeared visibly shaken. The next day Kanaan stated the hit was recorded at 175 Gs.|$|R
50|$|One {{entrance}} diverges off Eversholt Street opposite Grafton Place. Routes that terminate such as 18, 68, 253 and 476 usually enter via this {{entrance and}} continue to their designated stands, routes 59 and 91 which continue to King's Cross also use this <b>entrance</b> and <b>turn</b> on the roundabout to exit at the same point. Strangely, route 59 towards Holborn also passes through the bus station whereas route 91 turns left directly from Euston Road onto Upper Woburn Place.|$|R
50|$|MRN had {{the radio}} {{call for the}} race, which was {{simulcast}} on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Joe Moore, Jeff Striegle and six-time Richmond winner Rusty Wallace called the race from the booth when the field was racing down the front stretch. Dave Moody called the race from a scaffold inside the <b>entrance</b> to <b>turn</b> 3 when the field was racing down the backstretch. Alex Hayden, Winston Kelley and Steve Post worked pit road on the radio side.|$|R
50|$|A. S. Rugge House is a {{historic}} home located at Glens Falls, Warren County, New York. It was built about 1880 and is a -story, gable-roofed brick Italianate style residence. It features 1-story side and <b>entrance</b> porches with <b>turned</b> posts and paneled balustrades.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno nothin' about dat," [...] {{replied the}} mucker; [...] "but I do know dat if we {{wants to get}} out o' here we gotta get a hump on {{ourselves}} good an' lively. Come ahead," [...] and with his words he ran quickly through the <b>entrance,</b> and <b>turning</b> squarely toward the right skirted the perpendicular cliffs that extended {{as far as they}} could see to be lost to view in the forest that ran up to meet them from below.|$|R
50|$|During the Xfinity Series' Alert Today Florida 300 {{earlier in}} the year, a crash {{occurred}} in which Kyle Busch slammed into a concrete wall just past the exit to pit road, breaking his leg and sidelining {{him for the first}} eleven races of the Sprint Cup season. In response to the accident, the entire outer wall of the race track was fitted with SAFER barriers. The grass near the <b>entrance</b> of <b>turn</b> 1 and towards the exit of the tri-oval, where Busch's accident occurred, were paved over.|$|R
5000|$|Aaron {{decided to}} modify his {{approach}} to quad jumps, stating in August 2016: [...] "I'm using an inside three <b>turn</b> (<b>entrance).</b> ... It's kind of old school in a way, but it's been working. I wanted {{to try something new}} because obviously the three-turn wasn't working under pressure." ...|$|R
50|$|Camping by the River Styx {{with her}} new jackal pets, she located Cremator, lost after the battle for Hell, and <b>entranced</b> him, <b>turning</b> him against Lady Death and setting him to forge a magical sword for her to reclaim Lucifer's soul. Casting a spell to sever the psychic link between Lady Death and Evil Ernie and dealing harshly with Mary Young who had turned up in Hell to kill Lady Death, she set about tormenting Lady Death {{in order to make}} her blood all the richer and sweeter.|$|R
50|$|The oval {{configuration}} also {{forms the}} base of the FIA Formula E Championship circuit for the Mexico City ePrix; the oval is raced clockwise, but there is a chicane that will be used prior to the <b>entrance</b> of <b>Turn</b> 4, with a second chicane on the backstretch, followed by a modified Foro Sol section that exits for the full Peraltada, and a third chicane will be placed midway through the Peraltada (Turns 1 and 2 of the oval). FIA Formula E track design was modified by Agustin Delicado Zomeño.|$|R
