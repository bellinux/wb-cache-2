5|$|Until 19 August {{the weather}} was {{unsuitable}} for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping <b>Fairy,</b> Frances is shown in profile with a winged <b>fairy</b> close by her nose. The second, <b>Fairy</b> offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows a <b>fairy</b> either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, Fairies and Their Sun-Bath.|$|E
40|$|In Irish folktales, <b>fairies</b> appear quite frequently, {{providing}} an indispensable presence for the tales. The otherworld and <b>fairies</b> as its inhabitants are depicted in various literary works in Europe, {{with the idea}} of the otherworld and <b>fairies</b> considered to be greatly influenced by Celticideals. To investigate the aspects, and the details of the concepts in Celtic otherworld's, <b>fairies</b> in Irish folktales are examined in my study by the following five viewpoints: different terms for <b>fairies,</b> the appearance of <b>fairies,</b> the supernatural powers of <b>fairies,</b> the habitat of <b>fairies,</b> and plot patterns of Irish folktales involving <b>fairies.</b> Throughout this paper different terms for <b>fairies</b> are examined and explored...|$|R
25|$|Wings, while {{common in}} Victorian and later artwork of <b>fairies,</b> are very {{rare in the}} folklore; even very small <b>fairies</b> flew with magic, {{sometimes}} flying on ragwort stems or the backs of birds. Nowadays, <b>fairies</b> are often depicted with ordinary insect wings or butterfly wings. In some folklore, <b>fairies</b> have green eyes. Some depictions of <b>fairies</b> either have them wearing some sort of footwear and other depictions of <b>fairies</b> are always barefoot.|$|R

5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth <b>fairy.</b> Frightened by the <b>fairy</b> tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the <b>fairy,</b> not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the <b>fairy,</b> reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. <b>Fairy,</b> having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E

The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the <b>fairy</b> in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her <b>fairy</b> godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the <b>fairy</b> kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E

2500|$|A {{belief in}} <b>fairies</b> was {{formerly}} widespread. [...] Sussex {{was the focus}} of a romantic revival of interest in <b>fairies,</b> begun in Yorkshire with the Cottingley <b>Fairies,</b> and continued in Sussex {{for the benefit of the}} middle classes and wistful artists, who had little to do with the farm labourers who were the source of much of the original lore. [...] Known as 'pharisees' in Sussex dialect, Sussex <b>fairies</b> liked to dance. [...] In The Four Men: A Farrago (1912), Hilaire Belloc recounts the story that at Halloween the <b>fairies</b> come out into the woods to dance in 'fairy rings'. [...] Rudyard Kipling also wrote two Sussex stories involving <b>fairies,</b> Puck of Pook's Hill (1906) and Rewards and <b>Fairies</b> (1910) setting them in the Sussex Weald. [...] Harrow Hill near Worthing is the site of a small hillfort and some Neolithic flint mines. According to an old woman who lived on Lee Farm, the hill was the last home of the <b>fairies</b> in England. They finally left when the archaeologists came to dig on the hill.|$|R
