5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it <b>is</b> <b>vastly</b> {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E

25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated <b>is</b> <b>vastly</b> amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E
25|$|Leptothorax acervorum is a {{small brown}} to yellow ant in the {{subfamily}} Myrmicinae. It was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793. L. acervorum <b>is</b> <b>vastly</b> distributed across the globe, most commonly found in the coniferous forests of Central, Western and Northern Europe. The morphology of L. acervorum is extremely {{similar to that of}} other Leptothorax ants. The difference arises in the two-toned appearance of L. acervorum, with the head and metasoma being darker than the mesosoma segment of the body, and hair across its body. Following Bergmann's rule—unusually, for ectothermic animals—body size increases with latitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} of this class have great practical importance {{in computer science}} {{as they can be}} parsed much more efficiently than nondeterministic context-free languages. The complexity of the program and execution time of a deterministic pushdown automaton <b>is</b> <b>vastly</b> less than that of a nondeterministic one. In the naive implementation, the latter must make copies of the stack every time a nondeterministic step occurs. The best known algorithm to test membership in any context-free language is Valiant's algorithm, taking O(n2.378) time, where n is the length of the string. On the other hand, deterministic context-free languages can be accepted in O(n) time by an LR(k) parser. This is very important for computer language translation because many computer languages belong to this class of languages.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo {{from the}} tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan to march on the Black Gate to {{distract}} Sauron from his true danger. His army <b>is</b> <b>vastly</b> outnumbered by the great might of Sauron. Frodo and Sam reach {{the edge of the}} Cracks of Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on his finger. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. The Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.|$|E
25|$|At its peak, the Ottoman Empire {{stretched}} from the Caucuses down to northern Africa {{and parts of}} the middle east. This long reach meant that many aspects of Ottoman culture, including the davul and other janissary instruments, were likely introduced {{to other parts of the}} world. In Africa, the indigenous population took the basic idea of the davul – that is, a two-headed cylindrical drum that produces a deep sound when struck – and both increased the size of the drum and changed the material from which it was made, leading to the development of the long drum. The long drum can be made a variety of different ways, but is most typically constructed from a hollowed out tree trunk. This <b>is</b> <b>vastly</b> different from the davul, which is made from a thick shell. Long drums were typically 2 meters in length and 50 centimeters in diameter, much larger than the Turkish drums on which they were based. The indigenous population also believed that the tree from which the long drum was made had to be in perfect shape. Once an appropriate tree was selected and the basic frame for the long drum was constructed, the Africans took cow hides and soaked them in boiling hot water, in order to stretch them out. Although the long drum was an improvement on the davul, both drums were nevertheless played in a similar fashion. Two distinct sticks were used on the two distinct sides of the drum itself. A notable difference between the two is that long drums, unlike davuls, were used primarily for religious purposes.|$|E
