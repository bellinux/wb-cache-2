When she thinks she has finally made it, the band announces they have finished their career and the mall closes, leaving her in the dark.|$|E

5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a <b>good</b> <b>time</b> — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was {{the only}} active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and {{occasionally}} managed {{to put on a}} play, it was not a <b>good</b> <b>time</b> for Yiddish theater – or any theater – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Ann (Rashida Jones) {{goes to a}} singles mixer {{where she}} is {{extremely}} uncomfortable. She runs into Donna (Retta), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's awkward flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up having a <b>good</b> <b>time</b> at the mixer and gets several phone numbers.|$|E

5000|$|The longer {{version of}} the <b>Good</b> <b>Times</b> warning {{contained}} descriptions of what <b>Good</b> <b>Times</b> was supposedly capable of doing to computers. In addition to sending itself to every email address in a recipient's received or sent mail, the <b>Good</b> <b>Times</b> virus caused {{a wide variety of}} other nasty things to happen. For example, one version said that if an infected computer contained a hard drive, it could be destroyed. If <b>Good</b> <b>Times</b> was not stopped in time, an infected computer would enter an [...] "nth-complexity infinite binary loop" [...] (a meaningless term), damaging the processor. The [...] "ASCII" [...] buffer email described the mechanism of <b>Good</b> <b>Times</b> as a buffer overflow.|$|R

5000|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Roy Thomas Baker. Written and sung by Cars lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, it was released as the album's third single. Ocasek wrote the song as a sarcastic commentary on the <b>good</b> <b>times</b> in rock music, saying, [...] "That was my song about what the <b>good</b> <b>times</b> in rock ‘n’ roll really mean, instead of what they’re supposed to be.

5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, {{as the two men}} differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E
5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} <b>good</b> <b>time</b> during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could be a place where Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a <b>good</b> <b>time</b> in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

During each month she spent as a woman, Ilā had <b>good</b> <b>time</b> with Budha. During each month as a man, Ila turned to pious ways and performed austerities under the guidance of Budha. In the ninth month, Ilā gave birth to Pururavas, who grew to become the first king of the Lunar dynasty. Then, as per the advice of Budha and Ila's father Kardama, Ila pleased Shiva with a horse sacrifice and Shiva restored Ila's masculinity permanently.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|Musically, Animal {{draws from}} the electropop genre, while {{incorporating}} elements of dance-pop in its production and beats. Lyrically, {{the majority of}} the album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having a <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one on Canadian Albums Chart, US Billboard 200 and IFPI Greece Albums Chart, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. Animal was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies to the United States and has sold over two million copies worldwide.|$|E
