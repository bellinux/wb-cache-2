The main objective of these tests was to start the ASI within the anticipated J- 2 X engine start box, as well as outside of it, to check for ignition margin. The setup for the J- 2 X ASI component testing simulated, as much as possible, the tank-head start-up configuration of the ASI within the J- 2 X Engine. The <b>ignition</b> <b>tests</b> were divided into 124 vacuum start tests to simulate altitude start on a flight engine, and 77 sea-level start tests to simulate the first set of ground tests for the J- 2 X Engine at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Other ignition parameters that were varied included propellant tank pressures, oxidizer temperature entering the ASI oxidizer feedline, oxidizer valve timing, spark igniter condition (new versus damaged), and oxidizer and fuel feedline orifice sizes. Propellant blowdowns using venturis sized to simulate the ASI resistance allowed calculation of transient propellant mass flow rates as well as global mixture ratio for all <b>ignition</b> <b>tests.</b> Global mixture ratio within the ASI at the time of ignition varied from 0. 2 to 1. 2.

Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the glow wire <b>ignition</b> <b>test</b> (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the glow wire flammability test (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E

However, the viewpoint of ignition as a statistical phenomenon appears to be more consistent with the inherent variability in engineering test data. We have developed a very low-energy capacitive spark ignition system to produce short sparks with fixed lengths of 1 – 2 mm, and the ignition system is used to perform spark <b>ignition</b> <b>tests</b> using a range of spark energies in lean hydrogen–oxygen–argon test mixtures used in aviation safety testing.

A second low-energy spark ignition system was also developed to generate longer sparks with varying lengths up to 10 mm. A second set of <b>ignition</b> <b>tests</b> is performed in one of the test mixtures using a range of spark energies and spark lengths.
