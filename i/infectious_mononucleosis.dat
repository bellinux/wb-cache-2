25|$|A nonallergic {{amoxicillin}} rash {{may also}} be an indicator of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute Epstein Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> ("glandular fever") {{caused by}} the Epstein–Barr virus. This may cause {{significant}} lymph gland swelling and an exudative tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The heterophile test can be used if this is suspected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> (IM), {{also known}} as mono, is an {{infection}} commonly caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces little or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and tiredness. Most people get better in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen. In {{less than one percent}} of cases splenic rupture may occur.|$|E
25|$|Lymphadenopathy {{refers to}} one or more {{enlarged}} lymph nodes. Small groups or individually enlarged lymph nodes are generally reactive in response to infection or inflammation. This is called local lymphadenopathy. When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called generalised lymphadenopathy. Generalised lymphadenopathy may be caused by infections such as <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis,</b> tuberculosis and HIV, connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers, including both cancers of tissue within lymph nodes, discussed below, and metastasis of cancerous cells {{from other parts of the}} body, that have arrived via the lymphatic system.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{experience}} episodes of OSA {{for only a}} short period. This can {{be the result of}} an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, along with swelling of the throat, or tonsillitis that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection, and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug (such as alcohol) that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal from sleep mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people become}} {{infected}} with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States, {{about half of}} all five-year-old children and about 90 percent of adults have evidence of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. In the United States and other developed countries, many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence, it causes <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> 35 to 50 percent of the time.|$|E

This mark ranked him seventh globally that year. He was among Canada's top prospects for the 1964 Summer Olympics, but in 1963 he criticised the attitude of officials at the Canadian Amateur Athletic Union, {{saying that they were}} not sufficiently concerned with the well-being of the nation's athletes. Suffering heavily from <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis,</b> he ultimately missed the entire 1964 season, including the Olympic competition. The launch of the Canada Fitness Council, supported by the Royal Canadian Legion, marked a turnaround in his fortunes. Steen credited the organisation with improving his career by assisting with living costs and subsidising travel to international competitions.|$|E
500|$|As the {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, {{it can be difficult}} to make the diagnosis clinically. [...] Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat. The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever, and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Diseases {{that are}} {{transmitted}} primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing, or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette. Diseases {{that are known}} to be transmissible by kissing or by other direct or indirect oral contact include all of the diseases transmissible by droplet contact and (at least) all forms of herpes viruses, namely Cytomegalovirus infections [...] herpes simplex virus (especially HSV-1) and <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kissing on {{the lips}} can result in the {{transmission}} of some diseases, including <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> (known as the [...] "kissing disease") and herpes simplex when the infectious viruses are present in saliva. Research indicates that contraction of HIV via kissing is extremely unlikely, {{although there was a}} documented case in 1997 of an HIV infection by kissing. Both the woman and infected man had gum disease, so transmission was through the man's blood, not through saliva.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{best known}} as the cause of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> (glandular fever). It is also {{associated}} with particular forms of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas. There is evidence that infection with EBV is associated with a higher risk of certain autoimmune diseases, especially dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. [...] Some 200,000 cancer cases per year are thought to be attributable to EBV.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately $1.3 {{million was}} spent on Vetter's care, but {{scientific}} study failed to produce a true [...] "cure" [...] and no donor match had been identified. Physicians expressed concern that as a teenager Vetter could become unpredictable and uncontrollable. Vetter later received {{a bone marrow transplant}} from his sister, Katherine. While his body didn't reject the transplant, he became ill with <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> after a few months. He died 15 days later on February 22, 1984, from Burkitt's lymphoma at age 12. The autopsy revealed that the donor Katherine's bone marrow contained traces of a dormant virus, Epstein-Barr, which had been undetectable in the pre-transplant screening.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> {{is usually}} caused by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), {{also known as}} human {{herpesvirus}} 4, which {{is a member of}} the herpes virus family. A few other viruses may also cause the disease. It is primarily spread through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood. Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes. Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop. [...] Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies. Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are atypical. The monospot test is not recommended for general use due to poor accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|The white {{appearance}} {{is created by}} hyperkeratosis (overproduction of keratin) and epithelial hyperplasia. The causative agent implicated is Epstein-Barr virus, the same virus that causes <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> (glandular fever). After the primary EBV infection has been overcome, the virus will persist {{for the rest of}} the host's life and [...] "hides" [...] from the immune system by latent infection of B lymphocytes. The virus also causes lytic infection in the oropharynx, but is kept in check by a normal, functioning immune system. Uncontrolled lytic infection is manifested as oral hairy leukoplakia in immunocompromised hosts. OHL usually arises where the immunocompromise is secondary to HIV/AIDS. Rarely are other causes of immunocompromise associated with OHL, but it has been reported in people who have received transplants and are taking immunosuppressive medication. OHL may also accompany chronic graft versus host disease. Even more rare are reports of OHL in persons with competent immune systems.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{with both}} Epstein-Barr virus and <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> have cited an {{increase}} in the sizes of perceived objects, coinciding with other symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Additionally, it has been observed that Epstein-Barr patients who cite hallucinations display abnormal MRI scans. The MRI may show swelling of the cerebral cortex, transient T2 prolongation, and transient lesions. [...] Unlike in MRI's, no abnormalities have been reported in CT scans. It is thus recommended that an Epstein-Barr patient who cites visual hallucinations have an MRI scan. Macropsia may appear either before the onset, or after the resolution, of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness. The duration of the disturbances have been shown to range between two weeks and seven months. Almost all patients with macropsia due to infectious mononucleiosis make full recoveries. [...] Patients with Coxsackievirus B1 have reported numerous symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia.|$|E
2500|$|The Epstein–Barr {{virus was}} named after Michael Anthony Epstein (born 18 May 1921), now a {{professor}} emeritus at the University of Bristol, and Yvonne Barr (1932–2016), a 1966 Ph.D graduate from the University of London, who together discovered and, in 1964, published {{on the existence of}} the virus. In 1961, Epstein, a pathologist and expert electron microscopist, attended a lecture on [...] "The Commonest Children's Cancer in Tropical Africa—A Hitherto Unrecognised Syndrome." [...] This lecture, by Denis Parsons Burkitt, a surgeon practicing in Uganda, was the description of the [...] "endemic variant" [...] (pediatric form) of the disease that bears his name. In 1963, a specimen was sent from Uganda to Middlesex Hospital to be cultured. Virus particles were identified in the cultured cells, and the results were published in The Lancet in 1964 by Epstein, Bert Achong, and Barr. Cell lines were sent to Werner and Gertrude Henle at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who developed serological markers. In 1967, a technician in their laboratory developed mononucleosis {{and they were able to}} compare a stored serum sample, showing that antibodies to the virus developed. In 1968, they discovered that EBV can directly immortalize B cells after infection, mimicking some forms of EBV-related infections, and confirmed the link between the virus and <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Dr. Niederman and Robert W. McCollum {{collected}} sera from Yale University freshmen. Students who tested positive for EBV antibodies never developed <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> (IM). The pre-illness samples of students who later developed <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> tested negative for EBV antibodies. Therefore, the presence of EBV antibodies indicated immunity from <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> The study demonstrated that EBV {{is not simply a}} passenger virus, it is the etiologic agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> This was a remarkable discovery, since at the time the cause of IM was a mystery.|$|E
50|$|Cytomegalovirus, {{adenovirus}} and Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis) infections {{can cause}} symptoms similar to <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis,</b> but a heterophile antibody test will test negative and differentiate those infections from <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of an enlarged spleen, and swollen posterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> On the other hand, the absence of swollen cervical lymph nodes and fatigue are the most useful to dismiss the idea of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> as the correct diagnosis. The insensitivity of the physical examination in detecting an enlarged spleen means {{it should not be}} used as evidence against <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> A physical examination may also show petechiae in the palate.|$|E
