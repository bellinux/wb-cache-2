5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in collective memory. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the chronicle}} of Theophanes the Confessor, the invading Umayyad force totalled 90,000 men. 10,000 lightly armed men under al-Ghamr ibn Yazid {{were sent to}} raid the western coastlands, {{followed}} by 20,000 under Abdallah al-Battal and al-Malik ibn Su'aib who marched towards Akroinon, while the main force of some 60,000 (this last number <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> much inflated), under Sulayman ibn Hisham, raided Cappadocia.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari's account {{does not}} mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E

50|$|The Second Battle of Acentejo <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> not {{the last}} battle on Tenerife between the Spaniards and the Guanches, but <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the most decisive, {{resulting}} in the ultimate incorporation of the island into the kingdom of Castile and the final subjugation of the aborigines.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|Different {{camouflage}} methods {{employed by}} terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic animals, and in military usage, are compared in the table. Several methods are often combined, so {{for example the}} Bushbuck is both countershaded over its whole body, and disruptively coloured with small pale spots. Until the discovery of countershading in the 1890s, protective coloration {{was considered to be}} mainly a matter of colour matching, but while this <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> important, a variety of other methods are used to provide effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were not nearly as pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions that would have allowed for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> required.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion. There is no specific utilization data available, though this species <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> caught by commercial fisheries operating across many parts of its range. The meat {{is said to be}} of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, the Galapagos shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central America and its fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk. The populations at the Kermadec and Galapagos Islands are protected within marine reserves.|$|E

5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|The weapon dance employs weapons—or stylized {{versions}} of weapons—traditionally used in combat {{in order to}} simulate, recall, or reenact combat or the moves of combat {{in the form of}} dance, usually for some ceremonial purpose. Such dancing is quite common to folk ritual {{in many parts of the}} world. Weapon dancing <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> ancient; among the earliest historical references we have are those that refer to the pyrrhic, a weapon dance in ancient Sparta, in which the dance was used as a kind of ritual training for battle.|$|E

5|$|According to {{an account}} by Claude Hémeré, {{a friend and}} {{librarian}} of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used {{the records of the}} collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was an important center of royal patronage. Both Jean Mouton and Loyset Compère were buried there and it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> possible that Josquin acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin.|$|E
5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by light hair (usually white or cream in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> {{obvious that}} Jocelin {{was one of}} the most {{respected}} figures in the kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had the respect of the secular elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the brother of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King Alexander II, it was Jocelin who performed the baptism. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E
