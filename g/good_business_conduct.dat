40|$|The {{case for}} {{socially}} responsible <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> is often made from an economical or ethical perspective {{with the organization}} as level of analysis. This paper focuses {{on the relationship between}} the religious belief of corporate decision-makers and socially responsible <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> Based on in-depth interviews with twenty Dutch executives from different religious backgrounds, we find much inductive evidence of a relationship between their conception of God, norms and values and <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> We also find that executives with a monotheistic conception of God display a stronger orientation toward socially responsible <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> than executives with a pantheistic conception of God. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to analyse how stakeholder influence has transformed sustainability work from being primarily risk management into becoming {{an integral part of}} <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> and even <b>business</b> identities of today. To detect this trend I gather theoretical information that elaborate on the meaning and drivers of sustainable <b>business</b> <b>conduct,</b> sustainability as corporate identity, relevant stakeholders and ways of communicating to stakeholders. A case study of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream company is conducted, {{as an example of a}} market leader on sustainable <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> By demonstrating the extensive sustainability work that Ben & Jerry’s do, I argue that it has had a clear bottom-up influence on the trend for sustainable <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> Together with recent regulatory demands as a top-down influence in markets, I argue that there is evidence of a trend where sustainable <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> and/or sustainability as business identity is becoming the new norm. ...|$|R

Business history all over the world is replete with such examples that ultimately deremine whether the <b>businesses</b> <b>conducted</b> in an ethical or good manner survive and succeed and those conducted in an unethical manner flounder and fizzle out in due course of time. The reason is ‘Satyamev Jayate’ i. e., only the truth wins.

40|$|This paper studies {{institutional}} {{structures of}} prudential and <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> supervision of financial services in 98 high and {{middle income countries}} over the past decade. It identifies possible drivers of changes in these supervisory structures using the panel ordered probit analysis. The results show that (i) more developed, small open economies with better public governance tend to integrate their supervision, especially the prudential one; (ii) more financially developed countries integrate more their supervision; however, greater development of the non-bank financial system leads to less integrated prudential supervision but not <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> supervision; (iii) the lobbying power of concentrated and highly profitable banking sectors significant hinders <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> integration; (vi) countries that experienced financial crises integrate their supervisory structure relatively more and (v) greater central bank independence could cause less integration of prudential supervision, but not necessarily of <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> supervision.

40|$|Purpose: – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the insights and a proposal into the structure of standards of <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> and its intended applications. Design/methodology/approach: – The case study is based upon an inductive content analysis of corporate ethics artefacts. Findings: – It is concluded that the standards of <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> may be highly prescriptive in world wide corporations, but that there should be an explicit commitment to a flexible and dynamic approach to the application of standards of <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> Research limitations/implications: – An examination of the actual behaviour of a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s operations was beyond the scope of the present research, but such a study has potential for future research. This would open up the wider question of how corporations can minimise the gap between corporate intentions and actual outcomes in business operations across national and cultural boundaries. Practical implications: – These diverse national and cultural contexts that world wide corporations encounter must be taken into consideration in the content of their standards of <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> Originality/value: – The authors emphasise the concern of recognising that the contexts surrounding standards of <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> are dynamic. Corporate codes of ethics should be regarded as dynamic artefacts. A framework of application is proposed. <br /...|$|R
