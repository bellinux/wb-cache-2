5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>lines.</b> Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{observed}} the Sun's light using a prism, {{and showed that}} it {{is made up of}} light of many colors. In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum. The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>lines.</b> In {{the early years of the}} modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat. Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time. In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.|$|E

25|$|The {{observational}} {{history of}} the Uranian atmosphere is long and full of error and frustration. Uranus is a relatively faint object, and its visible angular diameter is smaller than 4″. The first spectra of Uranus were observed through a prism in 1869 and 1871 by Angelo Secchi and William Huggins, who found a number of broad dark bands, which {{they were unable to}} identify. They also failed to detect any solar Fraunhofer lines—the fact later interpreted by Norman Lockyer as indicating that Uranus emitted its own light as opposed to reflecting light from the Sun. In 1889 however, astronomers observed solar <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>lines</b> in photographic ultraviolet spectra of the planet, proving once and for all that Uranus was shining by reflected light. The nature of the broad dark bands in its visible spectrum remained unknown until the fourth decade of the twentieth century.|$|E

As in conventional fluorometers, concentration of a fluorescent substance is measured by comparison with standards. Quantitative use is probably accurate only at low altitudes but detection of luminescent substances should be possible from any altitude.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a new remote sensing technique that allows to monitor the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence of green vegetation superimposed to the reflectance spectra. In contrast to the <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>Line</b> Discriminator (McFarlane et. al. 1980) the new method uses the spectral absorption feature of atmospheric oxygen at 762 nm which better fits to the wavelength of chlorophyll fluorescence than the <b>Fraunhofer</b> absorption <b>line</b> at 656 nm. It will be shown how the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence can be derived from reflectance spectra measured on ground and from aircraft. The new method can even be applied to medium spectral resolution imaging spectrometers like ROSIS, MOS and MERIS with a spectral resolution better than 5 nm in the oxygen absorption band. In addition, it will be demonstrated that sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence is closely linked to photosynthesis and may thus be used in the future for areal observation of the photosynthetic status of plants. For a better understanding of sun induced fluorescence of plants the first leaf reflectance model is presented which includes chlorophyll fluorescence. Modeling results show the performance of the algorithm to determine sun induced fluorescence...|$|R
