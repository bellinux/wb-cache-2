40|$|The Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{verification}} of <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test</b> when analysis of hardenability of aluminium alloys is considered. The problem was solved experimentally, by developing end-quench curves of selected grades of aluminium alloys. Degree of hardenability of alloy is hardness after complete strengthening heat treatment. Samples of aluminium alloys commonly used for aircraft structures were prepared and then subjected to end-quench tests in various quenchants. On the basis of performed experiments, suitability of <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test</b> for comparison of hardenability of alloys was found.

40|$|The {{hardenability}} of {{wear resistant}} ductile iron austenitized at different temperatures was analyzed by <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quenching</b> <b>test,</b> and {{continuous cooling transformation}} (CCT) curves were determined by Gleeble 1500 D. The temperature variety curves were recorded by thermocouples during the test, and the cooling rate curves were obtained. It was indicated that there were significant influences of austenitizing temperature and Jominy distance (DJ) on the cooling rate. All specimens had undergone three different heat transfer mechanisms including film boiling mechanism, nucleate boiling mechanism and natural convection mechanism. Meanwhile, the cooling rate also had a distinct influence on the microstructure characteristics of ductile iron. The results of hardness test and microstructure observation indicated that the specimen austenitized at 830 °C had the most suitable hardness distribution, with high hardness on the quenching end and high toughness inside. That means that the grinding balls present function gradient characteristic can be obtained after continuous cooling. In addition, as to the specimen austenitized at 780 °C, the hardness was lower for the partially austenitized mixture microstructure. As to the specimen austenitized at 880 °C, the coarsing of the microstructure occurred, which affected the mechanical properties significantly. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of acoustic properties {{can be used}} for the nondestructive characterization of the microstructure of materials. We have measured the changes in longitudinal acoustic wave velocity and acoustic attenuation in steel specimens whose microstructure and properties differ widely because of differing compositions and heat treatment. The spatial variation of the relative acoustic velocity in standard <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> hardenability <b>test</b> specimens was found to correlate very well with Rockwell C hardness scans, indicating a potentially practical method for measuring the hardening response of heat treated steel. Absolute velocity measurements on steel specimens were found to be subject to random scatter related to minor compositional variations; this limits the utility of absolute velocity measurements for microstructural NDE. Attenuation measurements have also been performed on steel samples with different microstructures. The measurement utilized broadband acoustic pulses corrected for transducer response, liquid buffer/solid specimen reflection, and diffraction effects. Attenuation coefficients were seen to be proportional to frequency squared for martensite and to the fourth power of frequency for pearlite. Higher attenuation was observed for pearlitic than for martensitic microstructures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen {{zirconium}} alloys {{are used}} for fuel cladding in nuclear plants, they are β quenched and then extruded and rolled in the upper α range. At {{the start of this}} mechanical process, the alloys possess a lamellar, Widmanstätten microstructure. When the quenching is applied to large billets, the difference of cooling rates between the outer surface and the core of the piece produces variations in the microstructure. To investigate this phenomenon, the <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> device has been adapted here to Zircaloy- 4. The width of the lamellae, the size of the colonies and of the precipitates, the hardness are shown to depend strongly on the cooling rate. Other features of the quenched material are less rate-dependent: the sharp texture provoked by the α→β→α transformation, the disposition of the lamellae (intricated or parallel) and the number of the principal variants found within the former β grains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Copper alloys {{have many}} properties, which make them {{suitable}} in wide-ranging applications {{in all the}} engineering industries. For the investigated alloys the most important properties are hardness, strength and electrical conductivity. Precipitation hardenable alloys were studied by <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test,</b> {{in order to examine}} the change of hardness, electrical conductivity and microstructure as a length of the test bar (i. e. cooling rate). In the first step samples were solution treated at different temperatures, then water quenched followed by aging.

40|$|Hardenability {{of steel}} {{is defined as}} the {{susceptibility}} of the steel to hardening when quenched, and is related to the depth and distribution of hardness across a cross section. There are various factors which effect hardenability of steels such as austenite grain size, carbon content and alloying elements percentage. Hardenability property is so important that a simple test is essential to measure it. There are various methods to measure hardenability of steel such as Grossman critical diameter method, Jominy end quench test, estimation of hardenability from chemical composition and Fracture test. The <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test,</b> though inelegant from a scientific standpoint, fills this need. In this paper we discussed about the significance of hardenability and role of Jominy test in measurement of hardenability...|$|E
40|$|This work {{address the}} problem of extracting the Jominy {{hardness}} pro#les of steels directly from the chemical composition. Wavelet and Neural networks provide very intresting results, especially when compared with classical methods. A hierarchical architecture is proposed, with a #rst network used as a parametric modeler of the Jominy pro#le, and a second one estimating parameters from the steel chemical composition.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to summarise the microstructural changes which {{take place in}} aluminium bronzes during heat treatment. Another objective {{of this study was}} to map the potential of a certain type of aluminium bronzes for undergoing martensitic transformation. The methods, which were chosen for assessing the results of heat treatment with regard to their availability, included measurement of hardness and observation of microstructure using light and scanning electron microscopy, Additional tools for evaluation of microstructure comprised measurement of microhardness and chemical analysis by EDS. An important part of the experiment is observation of microstructural changes in the Jominy bar during the <b>end-quench</b> <b>test.</b> Upon completing experiments of this kind, one can define the heat treatment conditions necessary for obtaining optimum properties. In addition, the paper presents important findings on how to improve the corrosion resistance of aluminium bronzes by special heat treatment sequences...|$|R
40|$|With {{the sixth}} {{large-scale}} railway speed-up, {{the quality of}} the axles is essential to the safety of the locomotive. According to the high-speed axle technical standard for the control of alloy elements in axle steel, optimization experiments of 25 CrMo steel composition were performed by vacuum inductive melting. In order to study the hardenability of high-speed rail axles, an improved <b>end-quench</b> <b>test</b> was put forward. The advantage is that it enables the heat to transfer along the axial direction, thus avoiding edge effects. The hardenability of 25 CrMo axle steels with Mn content of 0. 60 wt. % and 0. 80 wt. % was investigated mainly by means of optical microscopy and hardness tests. The experimental results indicate that the Mn has a pronounced effect on the hardenability of the steel. With an increase in Mn content from 0. 60 wt. % and 0. 80 wt. %, the hardenability of 25 CrMo axle steel increases and the hard microstructure is maintained at an increasing distance from the quenched end. From {{the surface of the water}} quenched end to the center of the sample, the microstructure is martensite, martensite with bainite, and bainite...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} algorithm for simulating the <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test</b> and deriving continuous cooling diagrams. The underlying mathematical {{model for the}} austenite-pearlite phase transition is based on Scheil's Additivity Rule and the Johnson-Mehl equation. For the formation of martensite we compare the Koistinen-Marburger formula with a rate law, which {{takes into account the}} irreversibility of this process. We carry out numerical simulations for the plain carbon steels C 1080 and C 100 W 1. The results suggest that the austenite-pearlite phase change may be described decently by the Additivity Rule, except for the incubation time. On the other hand, using a rate law to describe the martensite formation is preferable to the Koistinen-Marburger formula, which leads to unphysical oscillations of the cooling curves in simulated CCT-diagrams.

40|$|This work compares a few {{attempts}} {{based on}} Neural and Wavelet networks, for extracting the Jominy hardness profile of steels {{directly from the}} chemical composition. In particular, the paper proposes a multi-networks architecture, where a first network {{is used as a}} parametric modeler of the Jominy profile itself, while a second one is used as a parameter estimator from the steel chemical composition. 1 Introduction Hardenability {{is one of the main}} features of steels: it is assessed by means of the <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test</b> [1], which produces a vector of hardness values measured along a specimen of heat-treated steel, at predefined positions. These values represent the Jominy (hardness) profile and are provided by the manufacturer to characterize steel quality.

40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) {{was used}} to develop a {{manufacturing}} route for high temperature aero-engine components from the Ni-superalloys CM 247 LC, focussing on improving the microstructure, mechanical properties, and processing route. A statistical design of experiments approach was applied to determine the optimum processing parameters leading to the least structural defects. High-speed imaging {{was used to}} observe the melt pool during SLM. Microstructural investigations showed that certain elements were selectively evaporated, then condensed {{in the form of}} particles. These were then re-incorporated within the build. Cracks and pores were found in SLM-processed samples and these were sometimes associated with these condensed particles. Residual stresses, developed within SLMprocessed samples, were measured using neutron diffraction, highlighting the role of the scanning strategy on the residual stress development. The solidification microstructures formed in SLM-processed samples were characterised using analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Cells, with identical orientation and 700 nm in width containing a high density of very small γʹ (up to 20 nm), were observed. Cell boundaries and grain boundaries were found to contain high densities of dislocations, Hf/Ti/Ta/W-rich precipitates and γ/γʹ eutectic containing larger particles of γʹ up to about 50 nm. The cooling rate derived from the cell size was estimated at 106 K/s, but the cooling rate, derived from the size of γʹ within grains was estimated as 104 K/s based on <b>Jominy</b> <b>end-quench</b> <b>test.</b> SLM-processed samples also showed high yield strength due to their fine microstructures, alongside poor ductility resulting from the presence of cracks. Post-SLM heat treatments were used to reduce the extent of cracking and porosity by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPping) and also to promote the precipitation of γʹ. These treatments improve the ductility in vertically built samples, but the ductility in horizontally built samples remains low. Though SLM-processed samples subjected to post-processing heat treatments showed poor creep strength, this was improved by HIPping. A novel approach for netshape SLM/HIP processing was assessed for manufacturing a blisk using powder CM 247 LC or dual materials...|$|E
