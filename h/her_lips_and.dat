5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
500|$|Girl with Ball {{depicts a}} woman wearing a bathing suit holding a beach ball with red stripes in {{the same color as}} <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> tongue. Lichtenstein used a painter's version of comic strip artist {{techniques}} to create his own rendition of the subject of a nostalgic photograph, resulting in a simplified work of art with its own appeal. He produced the work using Ben-Day dots of primary colors. The process is described as exaggerating the [...] "limitations of mechanical reproduction" [...] to strip the photograph of its polish in a startling and intense form. In 1961, this painting was groundbreaking. Facial features such as nose and mouth are depicted using [...] "commercial shorthand".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] was filmed in New York City by director, Isaac Ravishankara. The song's music video is {{relative}} to the song's theme: kissing. Foreman explained, [...] " [...] the video is a play on kissing in general, and lips, and getting close up {{to a bunch of}} lips, and people coming out of mouths and just, like, really cool transitions." [...] The video follows a similar theme that is {{relative to the}} song's title, [...] "My First Kiss". It features a lot of people (punks, teachers, sailors, soldiers, lesbians, nerds, an elderly couple and hirsute rockers) [...] "smooching, kissing, and making out." [...] The video is made up of different scenes all using multi-colored backdrops as the video's dominant backing. The main scenes present are of [...] "3OH!3 bouncing around and throw punches at the camera" [...] while singing their versus and occasional close-ups of different pairs of lips that are mouthing different lyrics of the song. Kesha is also present throughout the video, mainly on her verses where she is seen in close-ups of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> dancing around the screen on the chorus.|$|E
500|$|Sire Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Steve Barron. Madonna's friend Debi Mazar was hired as the make-up artist for the video while Maripol was the stylist with Madonna's then boyfriend Ken Compton appearing as her onscreen lover. By the time the video was released, MTV had begun to show dance music videos. Hence the music video of [...] "Burning Up" [...] became a minor hit on the channel. The narrative of the video shows Madonna in a white dress, as she sings the song proclaiming her helpless passion for her lover. She wore her famous rubber bracelets which were actually typewriter belts. Her love for the boy portrayed her as a helpless victim like the stereotyped female portrayed in many silent movies. At {{one point in the}} video Madonna is shown being hit by a car driven by a young man, played by Compton. By the end of the song Madonna is shown driving the car, with a knowing, defiant smile on <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> has ditched the man, thereby giving the message that she was in charge, a theme recurrent throughout her career. Barron explained the development process behind the video: ...|$|E

It involves {{a woman who has}} promised to kiss the idol of Ganapati if she achieves a particular (wholly legitimate) goal. [...] The mischievous idol grabs <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> wouldn't let go. [...] The husband has to make the idol laugh by simulating sex with a donkey to rescue his wife.|$|E

2500|$|Line 5 {{mentions}} jacks, {{which are}} the plucking mechanisms on the harpsichord. The jacks [...] "nimble leap" [...] which is both representative of the music being played {{and the men who}} are trying to show off to win the love interest's attention. Davis explains Shakespeare often uses the word [...] "Jack" [...] as a reference to ordinary other men but in this case it can have a double meaning of both the technology of the instrument and the woman's other male suitors. Line 13 also provides reference to [...] "saucy jacks" [...] which implies that the jacks are a rather impure and impudent lot. There is also a strong sexual innuendo where the word [...] "jacks" [...] makes a reference to fellatio. Shakespeare asserts that this woman can lend her fingers to these vulgar men but would much prefer <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> her loving affections.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, September 1, {{there was}} a third {{reported}} incident. A Mrs. Kearney, of Marshall Avenue, Mattoon, reported smelling a strong, sweet odor around 11:00 pm. At first she dismissed the smell, believing it to be from flowers outside of the window, but the odor soon became stronger {{and she began to}} lose feeling in her legs. Mrs. Kearney panicked and her calls attracted her sister, Mrs. Ready, who was in the house at the time. Mrs. Ready also noticed the odor, and determined that it was coming {{from the direction of the}} bedroom window, which was open at the time. The police were contacted, but no evidence of a prowler was found. At around 12:30 am, [...] Bert Kearney, Mrs. Kearney's husband (a local taxi driver who had been absent during the time of the attack), returned home to find an unidentified man hiding close to one of the house's windows. The man fled and Kearney was unable to catch him. Kearney's description of the prowler was of a tall man dressed in dark clothing, wearing a tight fitting cap. This description was reported in the local media, and became the common description of the gasser throughout the Mattoon incident. After the attack, Mrs. Kearney reported suffering from a burning sensation on <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> throat, which were attributed to the effects of the gas.|$|E
2500|$|On November 29, 1944, the {{procedure}} was first tried on an eighteen-month-old infant named Eileen Saxon. [...] The blue baby syndrome had made <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> fingers turn blue, {{with the rest of}} her skin having a very faint blue tinge. [...] She could only take a few steps before beginning to breathe heavily. Because no instruments for cardiac surgery then existed, Thomas adapted the needles and clamps for {{the procedure}} from those in use in the animal lab. During the surgery itself, at Blalock's request, Thomas stood on a step stool at Blalock's shoulder and coached him step by step through the procedure. Thomas performed the operation hundreds of times on a dog, whereas Blalock only once as Thomas' assistant. The surgery was not completely successful, though it did prolong the infant's life for several months. Blalock and his team operated again on an 11-year-old girl, this time with complete success, and the patient was able to leave the hospital three weeks after the surgery. Next, they operated upon a six-year-old boy, who dramatically regained his color {{at the end of the}} surgery. The three cases formed the basis for the article that was published in the May 1945 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, giving credit to Blalock and Taussig for the procedure. Thomas received no mention.|$|E

2500|$|The video {{begins in}} a futuristic {{cafeteria}} with kids, dubbed the [...] "Warriorettes", {{sitting down at}} tables wearing all white while the tables and walls are gray. Smith then enters the room in colorful attire, including a blue vest, orange pants and a belt with her name on it, while donning rhinestones on <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> extravagant nail tips. With her braids shaped to form a heart, she carries a boombox filled with paint and plays it while undoing her braids and dipping them into paint inside the stereo, using her hair as a paintbrush and enlivening the atmosphere with colors. Smith then performs dance moves and gets the classroom involved, which is intercut with the singer now donning a colorful mohawk, performing choreography with dancers with blue shirts {{in front of a}} light blue backdrop. She alternates different hairstyles, and then walks down a hallway with her backup dancers, donning a cotton candy-esque hairstyle. She further whips her hair to give color to the lockers and students' attire, before performing extensive choreography with the hallway students. Midway, Smith and her dancers perform a dance routine with music not in the original song. The last scenes involves Smith with puff braids and in a yellow jumpsuit with her backup dancers in a different classroom {{trying to get them to}} dance, which is intercut with previous paint-splashing scenes, as the students, including her brother Jaden, teachers, janitor, elderly lady, and toddler dance. A writer for Rap-Up said that Smith [...] "is in a class of her own in the breakout video for her empowering anthem", calling the video [...] "the birth of more B.S.".|$|E
