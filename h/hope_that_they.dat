5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had taken so long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their resistance against British imperialism in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could still be defeated.|$|E

5|$|As aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes Alcazar's {{decision}} to go to war with neighbouring Nuevo Rico over the oil-rich Gran Chapo, and is framed as a traitor by the international oil and weapon companies. He escapes imprisonment with the aid of the mercenary Pablo; and decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbayas, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish. From a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> crashed, as he realised {{that he could}} not match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E

The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will never be forgotten.|$|E

5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E
5|$|Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go out {{in search}} of Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz), {{following}} her mother Carol (Melissa McBride) weeping for her loss. Daryl tells Andrea about his childhood, and expresses <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will successfully locate Sophia. They stumble upon an abandoned campsite, where a person had committed suicide by hanging themselves from a tree and now has become an undead walker. Daryl insists that they leave the walker alone, but Andrea firmly refuses. He asks her {{if she wants to}} continue living, to which she exclaims uncertainty. Daryl euthanizes the walker as they leave. Upon returning to the camp, Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) attempts to reconcile with Andrea by returning her handgun.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E

5|$|PennDOT has {{recently}} begun the Route 1011-Pond Eddy Bridge Replacement Project. Route 1011 is the internal designation for Flagstone Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge. The state has proposed a four-span bridge with three connecting bridge piers, with four side options: replacing the bridge upstream, buying out the 26 residences on the Pennsylvania side, rehabilitating the structure to handle weights of 16-18 tons or maintain the bridge in its current form. Depending on which project is chosen, the estimated start would be in 2013, when the structure reaches its 110th year in use. The entire project would cost $8.5-11 million. Opponents of demolishing the bridge <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can find a place to move the bridge, which would cost $500,000, and have the new owners maintain it.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Final Fantasy XIII-2 follows on {{from that of}} Final Fantasy XIII, but as is typical for the series, it is {{unrelated}} to all other previous Final Fantasy games. In XIII, one of the fal'Cie—a god-like race—transformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit), in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would initiate {{the end of the}} world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|With Tropical Storm Cristobal {{bearing down}} on the {{recovery}} team, and time and money running out, the team {{made the decision to}} raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard Wotan, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be identified.|$|E

5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the left wing, and Dodge and the regulars the center element. As the Native Americans retreated toward the river, the militia's left wing were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had given their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling point about midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs {{to the site}} of the grounding with the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Gradually {{there were}} {{increased}} number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior, limiting their ability to participate in society, and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, {{and the number of}} believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land. Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis.|$|E

5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E
5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E
5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
