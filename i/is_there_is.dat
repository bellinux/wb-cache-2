5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

However it has been established that the change between the three subspecies is clinal (that <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no division between the subspecies), and hence they are no longer recognised.|$|E

For this study, which is descriptive in nature, the specialization model of Sorice, Ok Oh and Ditton. The statistical sample includes 420 staffs chosen from the four areas of education is the city of Shiraz. Sample size is estimated at 132 using the Cochrane method. For sampling the stratified method was used. Questionnaires were used for data collection. To measure specialization we used questionnaires developed by Sriwongsa. The results supported the main hypothesis. That <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> specialization among managers. The first subhypothesis <b>was</b> also confirmed: <b>there</b> <b>were</b> dimensions of specialization among managers. The second sub-hypothesis was confirmed as well; that <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> differences between the dimensions of specialization variable.

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{question}} as to whether having children really is such a positive contribution to the world in an age when there are many concerns about overpopulation, pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and overstate the costs. That <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> often a need for a non-zero birth rate.|$|E
25|$|These {{claims were}} that rates of {{geological}} change are always uniform and gradual {{and that the}} general {{state of the world}} also remains uniform (that <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no progression or directionality in the long run). Far from using Hutton's field data to show that the earth has passed through vast epochs of change, Lyell drew on the peculiarly static spirit of Hutton's vision to conceive an earth that, although unimaginably old, had changed hardly at all.|$|E

25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a set of}} ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements {{make it easy to}} distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, it is harder to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E
25|$|The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem {{shows that}} if a first-order theory of {{cardinality}} λ has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality {{greater than or equal}} to λ. One of the earliest results in model theory, it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first-order language. That <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no first-order formula φ(x) such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies φ if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).|$|E

Critics have reported that only around 3% of ASBO applications have been turned down. In July 2007 the Local Government Ombudsman published a report criticising Manchester City Council for serving an ASBO based purely on uncorroborated reports of nuisance by a neighbour, and the Council agreed to pay £2000 in compensation.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, every bivector can {{be written}} as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two {{orthogonal}} bivectors for this, and this is always possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{only one way to}} decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique. The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, some curves are non-rectifiable. That <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{upper bound}} on the lengths of polygonal approximations; the length can be made arbitrarily large. Informally, such curves {{are said to have}} infinite length. There are continuous curves on which every arc (other than a single-point arc) has infinite length. An example of such a curve is the Koch curve. Another example of a curve with infinite length is the graph of the function defined by f(x) =xsin(1/x) for any open set with 0 as one of its delimiters and f(0) = 0. Sometimes the Hausdorff dimension and Hausdorff measure are used to quantify the size of such curves.|$|E
25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E
