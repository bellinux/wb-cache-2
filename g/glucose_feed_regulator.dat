The proposed optimization strategy involves three key steps: developing a reliable mathematical model, computing the optimal control policy, and experimentally verifying {{the effectiveness of the}} optimal policy. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more commonly known as baker 2 ̆ 7 s yeast, is chosen as a model system. ^ An unstructured model for aerobic growth of baker 2 ̆ 7 s yeast is developed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate and compare, both technically and economically, various <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> concentrations and different redox potential settings on ethanol production under very-high-gravity (VHG) conditions. Laboratory data were collected for process modeling and two process models were created by two individual process simulators. The first one is a simplified model created and evaluated by Superpro Designer. The second one is an accurate model created by Aspen Plus and evaluated by Aspen Icarus Process Evaluator (Aspen IPE). The simulation results of the two models were also compared. Results showed that <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> concentration at 250 ± 3. 95 g/L to the fermentor resulted in the lowest unit production cost (1. 479 $/kg ethanol in the Superpro model, 0. 764 $/kg ethanol in the Aspen Plus model), with redox potential control effects accounted. Controlling redox potential at - 150 mV increased the ethanol yield under VHG fermentation conditions while no significant influences were observed when <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> concentration was less than 250 g/L. Results of product sales analysis indicated that for an ethanol plant with a production rate of 85 ~ 130 million kg ethanol/year, only maintaining the <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> concentration to the fermentor at around 250 g/L resulted in the shortest payout period of 5. 33 years in average,, with or without redox potential control. If 300 ± 6. 42 g/L <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> concentration to the fermentor is applied, it is essential to have the redox potential only controlled at - 150 mV in the fermentor to limit the process payout period within 6 years. In addition, fermentation processes with <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> concentration at around 200 g/L to the fermentor were estimated to be unprofitable under all studied conditions. For environmental concerns, two disposal alternatives were presented for CO 2 produced during fermentation process rather than emission into atmosphere. One is to sell CO 2 as byproduct, which brought 1. 52 million $/year income for an ethanol plant with a capacity of 100 million kg ethanol/year. Another option is to capture and transport CO 2 to deep injection sites for geological underground storage, which is already a safe and mature technology in North America, and also applicable to many other sites around the world. This would roughly add 4. 78 million dollars processing cost annually in the studied scenario.

40|$|Production of many {{proteins}} can today be {{made using}} genetically modified organisms. One {{of the most}} frequently used host organisms is the bacterium Escherichia coli. A difficulty encountered in cultivations of E. coli is the accumulation of the metabolic by-product acetate which inhibits cell growth and production of a desired protein. Formation of acetate occurs under anaerobic conditions but also in situations with excess of the carbon/energy source that usually is glucose. In fed-batch processes the <b>glucose</b> <b>feed</b> rate can be manipulated to avoid acetate formation, but most feeding strategies require considerable process knowledge to handle process variations. On-line measurements for the relevant process variables are far from being standard which complicates the realization of strategies based on feedback control. This thesis presents a <b>glucose</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy for E. coli cultivations that avoids acetate formation in spite of process variations and without prior knowledge of the particular strain and product. The key idea is to exploit a characteristic saturation in the cellular respiration at the onset of acetate formation. By superimposing short pulses in the <b>glucose</b> <b>feed</b> rate, on-line detection of acetate formation can be made using a standard dissolved oxygen sensor. This information is used in a feedback algorithm that adjusts the feed rate to avoid acetate formation while maintaining a high <b>glucose</b> supply. The <b>feed</b> rate is also restricted to ensure aerobic conditions when the maximum oxygen transfer capacity to the culture is reached. The feasibility is demonstrated by simulations as well as laboratory-scale experiments with several E. coli strains under various operating conditions. Tuning rules that assume a minimum of process specific information are derived and a stability analysis is given. The feeding strategy relies on good control of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Variations in the oxygen dynamics during a fed-batch cultivation often cause tuning problems when using a controller with fixed parameters.

Higher glucose concentrations supported higher biomass {{production by}} less volumetric and specific antibiotic production. Based on these data, cultivations were carried out at semi-industrial scale 15 L bioreactor in batch culture. At bioreactor level, cell growth and OTC production were higher compared to the shake flask culture by about 18 and 38 %, respectively.

A new method for on-line monitoring and fed-batch control based on fluorescence measurements has been developed. Via instantaneous in situ measurements and multivariate data analysis a chemometric model has been established, which enables the rapid detection of ethanol production at aerobic Saccharomyces cerevisiae fed-batch cultivations. The <b>glucose</b> <b>feed</b> rate is controlled by predicting the metabolic state directly from the fluorescence intensities. Thus, ethanol production could be avoided completely while increasing the biomass yield accordingly. The robust instrumentation is suitable for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of two Escherichia coli cultivations performed in a large scale industrial bioreactor. The experiments aimed at evaluating a probing feeding strategy that adresses the problem of acetate accumulation. The principle is to superimpose short pulses in the <b>glucose</b> <b>feed</b> and evaluate the response in the dissolved oxygen signal for the feed adjustments. Simulations of a two compartments system are also done to give insight into the possible effects of the scale and the imperfect mixing on the feeding strategy. Satisfactory results in terms of recombinant protein amounts have been obtained and no major adverse large scale effects were observed...|$|R
