50|$|The flash {{evaporation}} of a single-component liquid is an <b>isenthalpic</b> process {{and is often}} referred to as an adiabatic flash.

50|$|Between points 4 and 5, the {{saturated}} liquid refrigerant {{passes through the}} expansion valve and undergoes an abrupt decrease of pressure.

50|$|Air {{can also}} be {{liquefied}} by Claude's {{process in which the}} gas is allowed to expand isentropically twice in two chambers. While expanding, the gas has to do work as it is led through an expansion turbine. The gas is not yet liquid, since that would destroy the turbine. Commercial air liquefication plants bypass this problem by expanding the air at supercritical pressures.. Final liquefaction takes place by <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion in a Joule-Thomson-Valve.|$|E
50|$|In practice, simple {{idealized}} thermodynamic cycles {{are usually}} {{made out of}} four thermodynamic processes. Any thermodynamic processes may be used. However, when idealized cycles are modeled, often processes where one state variable is kept constant are used, such as an isothermal process (constant temperature), isobaric process (constant pressure), isochoric process (constant volume), isentropic process (constant entropy), or an <b>isenthalpic</b> process (constant enthalpy). Often adiabatic processes are also used, where no heat is exchanged.|$|E

5000|$|... b. In an <b>isenthalpic</b> process, system {{enthalpy}} (H) is constant. In {{the case}} of free expansion for an ideal gas, there are no molecular interactions, and the temperature remains constant. For real gasses, the molecules do interact via attraction or repulsion depending on temperature and pressure, and heating or cooling does occur. This {{is known as the}} Joule-Thomson effect. For reference, the Joule-Thomson coefficient μJT for air at room temperature and sea level is 0.22 °C/bar.|$|E

These do not require separate pumps {{before and after the}} heater to boost the feedwater to the pressure of the extracted steam as with an open heater. However, the extracted steam (which is most likely almost fully condensed after heating the feedwater) must then be throttled to the condenser pressure, an <b>isenthalpic</b> process that results in some entropy gain with a slight penalty on overall cycle efficiency.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Joule-Thomson {{inversion}} curve (JTIC) separates {{regions in}} which {{heating and cooling}} occur upon an <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion. Mixture JTIC calculation is a clear matter for single-phase conditions; if the mixture splits in two or more equilibrium phases, derivatives properties are not defined. However, in practice a system may change its state during an <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion (i. e., a phase boundary is crossed between initial and final conditions); such situations are not uncommon in petroleum engineering applications. Recently, several JTIC construction procedures were proposed for two-phase vapor-liquid systems (D. V. Nichita, C. F. Leibovici, Calculation of Joule-Thomson Inversion Curves for Two-Phase Mixtures, Fluid Phase Equilibria 2006, 246, 167 - 176). For multiphase systems, an apparent JT coefficient can be defined, which incorporates both JT effects and phase distribution changes effects. In this work we present a method for JTIC calculation in multiphase systems, based on <b>isenthalpic</b> flash calculations, with emphasis on mixtures with solid-phase precipitation. Effects {{of the presence of}} a solid phase on the JTIC can be very important, since wax precipitation may occur in natural hydrocarbon systems (crude oils and gas condensates) at temperatures as high as 350 K. For multiphase systems, the locus separating heating/cooling regions in the temperature-pressure plane may have several distinct branches, corresponding to extrema of <b>isenthalpic</b> curves and to angular points of enthalpy variations (given by discontinuities in the JT apparent coefficient at phase boundaries). The proposed method is applied to JTIC calculations for several ternary mixtures and a synthetic hyperbaric fluid...|$|E
40|$|For the {{analysis}} of thermodynamic cycles, processes, or high speed flow problems involving steam, the isentropic and <b>isenthalpic</b> changes in properties are often used for computing or simulating purposes. The use of the detailed but long and computer time-intensive procedures is in many cases not acceptable {{and there is a}} need for some approximate but fast procedures. The present paper presents such an algorithm for computing the state variables of steam during isentropic or <b>isenthalpic</b> changes in a fraction of a second, even with personal computers. Extensive runs of the exact steam equations yielded results that afterwards were correlated using suitable algebraic relations. The corresponding coefficients of these expressions have been cross-correlated and two relations giving the compressibility factor during state changes at constant entropy and constant enthalpy have been obtained...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Joule-Thomson {{inversion}} curve (JTIC), {{defined as}} the locus in the p-T plane where the adiabatic Joule-Thomson (JT) coefficient is zero, separates regions for which heating and cooling occur upon an <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion. JTIC calculation for mixtures is a clear matter for single-phase conditions. For two-phase mixtures, an apparent JT coefficient can be defined, which incorporates: (i) JT effects and (ii) phase distribution changes effects. Three different ways for calculating the apparent JTIC are presented: a volumetric approach, an approach based on enthalpy departure variation, and an approach based on <b>isenthalpic</b> flashes. Cubic equations of state are used in this work, but any thermodynamic model can be used. Several examples show that for mixtures, the locus separating heating/cooling regions may {{have two or three}} distinct branches, and that at phase boundaries there are discontinuities in the JT coefficient corresponding to angular points of enthalpy variations...|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} {{mass flow}} rate, pressure drop, and temperature drop {{data were obtained}} {{for a number of}} multiple orifice Joule-Thomas devices known as visco jets. The present investigation continues a study to develop an equation for predicting two phase flow of cryogens through these devices. The test apparatus design allowed <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion of the cryogen through the visco jets. The data covered a range of inlet and outlet operating conditions. The mass flow rate range single phase or two phase was 0. 015 to 0. 98 lbm/hr. The manufacturer's equation was found to overpredict the single phase hydrogen data by 10 percent and the two phase data by as much as 27 percent. Two modifications of the equation resulted in a data correlation that predicts both the single and two phase flow across the visco jet. The first modification was of a theoretical nature, and the second strictly empirical. The former reduced the spread in the two phase data. It was a multiplication factor of 1 - X applied to the manufacturer's equation. The parameter X is the flow quality downstream of the visco jet based on <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion across the device. The latter modification was a 10 percent correction term that correlated 90 percent of the single and two phase data to within +/- 10 percent scatter band...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} {{mass flow}} rate, pressure drop, and temperature drop {{data were obtained}} {{for a series of}} multiple orifice Joule-Thomson devices, known as Visco Jets, over a wide range of flow resistance. The test rig used to acquire the data was designed to minimize heat transfer so that fluid expansion through the Visco Jets would be <b>isenthalpic.</b> The data include a range of fluid inlet pressures from 30 to 60 psia, fluid inlet temperatures from 118 to 164 R, outlet pressures from 2. 8 to 55. 8 psia, outlet temperatures from 117 to 162 R and flow rate from 0. 04 to 4. 0 lbm/hr of nitrogen. A flow rate equation supplied by the manufacturer was found to accurately predict single-phase (noncavitating) liquid nitrogen flow through the Visco Jets. For cavitating flow, the manufacturer's equation was found to be inaccurate. Greatly improved results were achieved with {{a modified version of the}} single-phase equation. The modification consists of a multiplication factor to the manufacturer's equation equal to one minus the downstream quality on an <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion of the fluid across the Visco Jet. For a range of flow resistances represented by Visco Jet Lohm ratings between 17, 600 and 80, 000, 100 percent of the single-phase data and 85 percent of the two-phase data fall within + or - 10 percent of predicted values...|$|E

Within a robust 2 D Navier-Stokes, capable to handle the complex aspects of cavitating flows, different cavitation models are implemented. In particular two different classes of barotropic cavitation models have been used: a sinusoidal model and a quasi-homogeneous <b>isenthalpic</b> cavitation model suitably modified to account for thermal effects. The paper deals with the differences between these models and hence with the differences with the resulting flow fields. The analysis has been made for the flow over an ogival headform...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a quasi-homogeneous <b>isenthalpic</b> cavitation flow model, suitably modified to account for the effects of thermal cavitation and the concentration of active nuclei. The proposed modified bubbly <b>isenthalpic</b> cavitation model has been implemented in a 2 D numerical code in order to readily assess, by comparison with experimental results from the literature, its potential for the simulation of cavitating flows. Two types (hemispherical and 2 -caliber ogival) of axisymmetric headforms and a 2 D modified NACA 66 - 109 hydrofoil have been chosen for validation of the model against available data (Rouse & McNown, 1948; Shen & Dimotakis, 1989). The flow temperature has been varied from to in order to highlight the influence of thermal cavitation effects. Good agreement of the model predictions with the available experimental data has been found in terms of pressure distribution, extension of the cavitation region and loads (forces and moments) on the hydrofoil. As expected, the results indicate that the stability of the numerical method is sensitive to the temperature of the flow and to the presence of recirculating regions in the flow. Convergence problems have been detected at high angles of attack and when approaching room temperature, {{as a consequence of the}} inherent unsteadiness of reverse flow regions and the extremely rapid changes of the flow density in the absence of significant thermal cavitation effects. Examples are presented to display the influence of the relevant flow parameters on the solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-phase}} {{impulse turbine}} used {{to replace the}} classic expansion valve in a refrigeration system needs a nozzle/expander to transform the flow stored enthalpy into kinetic energy, and a runner that comes afterwards to transform the flow kinetic energy into torque. That process transforms the <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion of the refrigerant into, ideally, an isentropic one. Replacing a classic <b>isenthalpic</b> expansion with a nearly isentropic one increases the cycle cooling capacity by 8 % up to 20 % for the same compressor input power and generates an additional electric power by the two-phase turbine. During the expansion in the nozzle, the static pressure of the flow decreases and a phase change occurs, for the flow is slightly subcooled, by 2 to 3 K, at the nozzle entrance. A Turgo turbine runner design is presented. The runner makes use of the kinetic energy of a two-phase flow and transforms it into torque. The geometry and material of the runner components are chosen to provide mechanical integrity and high efficiency. The design takes into consideration the number of buckets, the flow behavior inside a bucket, the power loss due to drag force, the flow impingement angle with the bucket and many other factors. The variation of {{the efficiency of the}} runner with the refrigerant quality and the gas physical properties is also studied. FEM (finite element method) is used to calculate the mechanical stress on the structure of the runner that is supposed to withstand static and fatigue stress, and erosion due to the two-phase nature of the flow. FEM is also used to visualize the flow inside the bucket and to estimate the power loss due to drag force. The calculated efficiency of the runner is then compared to the efficiency of a similar tested runner...|$|E
