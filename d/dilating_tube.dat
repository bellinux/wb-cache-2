30|$|A {{variety of}} {{pathologic}} non-neoplastic conditions {{may affect the}} fallopian tubes. Knowledge of their imaging appearance is important for correct diagnosis. With recent advances in MRI, along with conventional MR sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences are available and may improve lesion characterization by discriminating {{the nature of the}} content of the <b>dilated</b> <b>tube.</b> Tubal fluid with low signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images, high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images and no restricted diffusion on DWI is indicative of hydrosalpinx. Content with high signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images and restricted diffusion on DWI is suggestive of hematosalpinx associated with endometriosis or tubal pregnancy. A <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> with variable or heterogeneous signal intensity content on conventional MR sequences and restricted diffusion on DWI may suggest a pyosalpinx or tubo-ovarian abscess. We describe morphological characteristics, MR signal intensity features, enhancement behaviour and possible differential diagnosis of each lesion.|$|R
30|$|MRI is {{the method}} of choice for {{characterization}} and localization of utero-adnexal pelvic masses of uncertain nature. On MR images, the hydrosalpinx appears as a fluid-filled tubular structure that arises from the upper lateral margin of the uterine fundus and is separate from the ipsilateral ovary. A <b>dilated</b> fallopian <b>tube</b> folds upon itself to form a sausage-like C- or S-shaped cystic mass [1, 2]. The most helpful and specific findings of hydrosalpinx are a tubular shape with small round projections and the waist sign [46]. The <b>dilated</b> <b>tubes</b> contain incomplete plicae or folds, producing its convoluted appearance, either seen as the waist sign causing focal constriction of the tubular structure [47, 48].|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} and model the viscoelastic properties of binary blends composed of linear chains. These systems are indeed very suitable {{to test the}} validity and the limit of the constraint release (CR) process and dynamic tube dilution and to determine {{the value of the}} dynamic dilution exponent a. We first focus on binary blends containing barely entangled short chains. In such a case, we show that the tension re-equilibration process previously observed [van Ruymbeke Macromolecules 2012, 45, 2085] can be correctly described as a CR-activated contour length fluctuation (CLF) process, which takes place along the fully <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> and is governed by the intrinsic Rouse time of a long–long entanglement segment. In addition, reptation is considered to take place along the fully <b>dilated</b> <b>tube.</b> We also show that this CR-activated CLF process speeds up the relaxation of the long chains, which naturally leads to an effective dilution exponent a equal to 4 / 3, {{despite the fact that the}} modeling is based on a = 1. This result is in agreement with the experimental data. Then, we analyze the rheological behavior of binary blends containing entangled short chains. In such a case, we show that the CR-activated CLF also takes place, but with a delay time being necessary for the long chain to explore the <b>dilated</b> <b>tube.</b> This approach is tested for several binary blends, showing an improved quality of the predictions compared to previous tube modeling on the same blends. Indeed, by considering the chain motions on two different length scales, a larger fraction of the long chains relax at intermediate frequencies (through the tension re-equilibration) before their reptation, leading to an effective dilution exponent larger than 1 as determined from the low-frequency plateau modulus...|$|R
5000|$|Symptomatic Schatzki rings may {{be treated}} with esophageal {{dilatation}}, using bougie or balloon dilators. These {{have been found to}} be equally effective. [...] Bougie dilatation involves passage of long <b>dilating</b> <b>tubes</b> of increasing size down the esophagus to stretch the area of narrowing, either over a guidewire passed into the stomach by endoscopy (the Savary-Gillard system) or using mercury-weighted dilators (the Maloney system). This is usually done with intravenous sedation to reduce discomfort. Dilatation can produce some temporary irritation. A short course of proton pump inhibitor therapy may decrease aggravation by stomach acid reflux into the esophagus. The duration of the benefit of dilation varies, but may be from months to years.

30|$|A parietal {{enhancement}} of a <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> {{surrounded by a}} cystic mass may eventually indicate a tubal pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is {{the main cause of}} pregnancy-related death during the first trimester in the USA, with an occurrence of 1 : 150 births [75]. Approximately 95  % of ectopic pregnancies occur in the tubes, with the majority of cases located in the distal parts, particularly the ampulla. When ectopic pregnancy involves the intramural portion of the tube, the highest rate of morbidity and mortality is seen [76]. The other 5  % of cases occur in the ovaries, in a rudimentary horn of the bicornuate uterus, in broad ligaments, in peritoneum, and in the cervix [77]. This event can result from anatomical abnormalities of the tubes, such as constriction and false passage formation (diverticulum), or from tubal dysfunction such as altered contractility or abnormal ciliary activity. Tubal anatomy and function can both be altered by either tubal surgery or prior PID. The surgical procedures that predispose women to ectopic pregnancy include salpingolysis and ovariolysis, fimbrioplasty, neosalpingostomy, and tubal anastomosis.|$|R
40|$|Relaxation of {{branched}} polymers under tube-based models involves a parameter p 2 characterizing the hop size of relaxed side arms. Depending on assumptions made in rheological models (e. g., about the relevant tube diameter for branch-point hops), p 2 {{had been set}} to values varying from 1 to 1 / 60 in the literature. From large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of melts of entangled {{branched polymers}} of different architectures, and from experimental rheological data {{on a set of}} well-characterized comb polymers with many (∼ 30) side arms, we estimate the values of p 2 under different assumptions in the hierarchical relaxation scheme.

40|$|We {{optically}} drive a microsphere at {{constant speed}} through entangled actin networks of 0. 2 - 1. 4 mg/ml at rates {{faster than the}} critical rate controlling the onset of a nonlinear response. By measuring the resistive force exerted on the microsphere during and following strain we reveal a critical concentration c^*≃ 0. 4 mg/ml for nonlinear features to emerge. For c>c^*, entangled actin stiffens at short times with the degree of stiffening S and corresponding timescale t_stiff scaling with the entanglement tube density, i. e. S∼ t_stiff∼ d_t^- 1 ∼ c^ 3 / 5. The network subsequently yields to a viscous regime with the yield distance d_y scaling linearly with yield force f_y and inversely with the entanglement length (f_y∼ d_y∼ l_e^- 1 ∼ c^ 2 / 5). Stiffening and yielding dynamics are consistent with recent theoretical predictions for nonlinear cohesive breakdown of entanglements. We further show that above c^* force relaxation proceeds via slow filament disengagement from <b>dilated</b> <b>tubes</b> coupled with ∼ 10 x faster lateral hopping, with the corresponding concentration dependences in agreement with recent theoretical predictions for entangled rigid rods...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{dielectric}} analysis {{suggested that}} entangled linear cis-polyisoprene (PI) chains in monodisperse bulk exhibit, {{in the terminal}} relaxation regime, reptation/contour length fluctuation (CLF) along a partially <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> with its diameter being determined by the constraint release (CR) activated tension equilibration along the chain backbone (Matsumiya et al. Macromolecules 2013, 46, 6067). In relation to this finding, we re-examined the dielectric and viscoelastic terminal relaxation times of components in linear PI blends having various component molecular weights and volume fractions, Mi and υi (i = 1 and 2 for the short and long components). In entangling blends with M 2 ≫ M 1 and large υ 2 (>critical volume fraction υ 2 e for the onset of long−long entanglement), the relaxation time τ 2,b of the long chain decreases with decreasing υ 2 but stayed considerably larger than τ 2,soln of the same long chain in a solution having the same υ 2. This result suggested that the CR-activated tension equilibration retards the reptation/CLF motion of the long chain in such blends. A simple “solution model” considering this retardation due to the CR relaxation of short−long entanglements was formulated. Utilizing data for the CR relaxation time τdil‑ 2,CR of dilute long chains (with υ 2 υ 2 e very well. Nevertheless, this model could {{not apply to the}} cases where M 2 and M 1 are rather narrowly separated and the short−long entanglements considerably survive in the time scale of the long chain relaxation. For this case, a “blend model” was formulated to consider self-consistently, though in an approximate way, the CR relaxation of all species of entanglements (short−short, short−long, long−short, and long−long entanglements) thereby mimicking coupled relaxation of the long and short chains. The component relaxation times deduced from this model (again {{on the basis of the}} τdil‑ 2,CR data) were surprisingly close to the data, not only for the PI/PI blend having narrowly separated M 2 and M 1 but also for those with M 2 ≫ M 1 (the latter being described satisfactorily also with the solution model), suggesting that reptation/CLF of the components in the terminal relaxation regime occurs along partially <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> with the diameter being determined by the CR-activated tension equilibration. Furthermore, the “blend model” worked satisfactory also for literature data for polystyrene blends having various M 2 /M 1 ratios. These results demonstrate the importance of CR-activated tension equilibration in the blends, which is consistent with the finding for monodisperse bulk...|$|R

40|$|We revisit {{previously}} published dielectric and viscoelastic data of binary blends of linear cis-polyisoprene [Watanabe, H.; Ishida, S.; Matsumiya, Y.; Inoue, T. Macromolecules 2004, 37, 6619] {{in order to}} test the validity of the dynamic tube dilution (DTD) picture and to determine the most appropriate value of the dilution exponent α. We conclude that the DTD picture with α = 1 is more appropriate at short times, while at longer time, a larger exponent of α = 4 / 3 gives a better description of the experiments. Furthermore, between these two time regions, a broad crossover zone is found, going from an effective α = 1 to an effective α = 4 / 3. On the basis of this result, we propose to consider a new relaxation process, which is combined with the classical DTD picture with α = 1 to give the experimentally observed effective α = 4 / 3 at long times. This extra relaxation process results from the tension equilibration along the long chains, which takes place thanks to the blinking feature of release/reformation of the long-short entanglements and leads to a partial disorientation of the primitive path itself within the <b>dilated</b> <b>tube.</b> We have formulated the relaxation function considering this tension equilibration and demonstrated its validity for description of the experiments in the entire range of time. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease (PID) is polymicrobial infection in women characterized by {{inflammation of the}} upper genital tract, including endometritis, salpingitis, pelvic peritonitis, occasionally leading {{to the formation of}} tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). PID primarily affects young, sexually active women, and it is highly correlated with having several sexual partners, intrauterine contraceptive device and sexually transmited diseases. The spectrum of disease is caused most commonly by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 30 - 50 % of cases. PID is responsible for severe acute morbidity and significant long-term sequelae, including tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The following clinical features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID: bilateral lower abdominal tenderness, abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, fever (higher than 38 °C), abnormal vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness, with or without a palpable mass. In laboratory findings, there is presence of excess leucocytes, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Transvaginal ultrasound scanning may be helpful, and its sensitivity is up to 85 %. It can identify inflamed and <b>dilated</b> <b>tubes</b> and tubo-ovarian masses. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in a final diagnosis in 95 % of cases. In 15 - 30 % of suspected cases, there is no laparoscopic evidence of disease. Treatment regimens for PID include broadspectrum antibiotics, including coverage for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The usage of parenteral or oral therapy, inpatient or outpatient regimens, depends on the patient’s clinical condition.

40|$|Abstract. A 62 ‑year‑old female with {{neurofibromatosis}} type 1 (NF 1; also von Recklinghausen's disease) {{was diagnosed}} with a giant, thick‑walled tubular mass, mainly located in the right abdominal area on computed tomography, following an examination for intermittent abdominal pain and increasing abdominal distension. According to the clinical manifestations and imaging features, the giant tubular mass was considered most likely to be a <b>dilated</b> fallopian <b>tube</b> associated with infection, while the possibility of obstructed bowel loops was excluded. However, the subsequent laparotomy revealed a giant appendix, caused by a large neurofibroma in the root region of the appendix, which occluded the lumen. Neurofibroma of the appendix is extremely rare, even in patients with NF 1. To the best of our knowledge, only three such cases have previously been reported in the English literature to date...|$|R

40|$|Networks of {{epithelial}} tubes, {{such as the}} vertebrate lung, {{kidney and}} vascular system, enable transport of gases and nutrients to all tissues in the body. These tubes are built up by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells, with the apical membrane facing the lumen. For optimal organ function {{it is critical that}} each tube in the network attains correct size and shape, as constricted or <b>dilated</b> <b>tubes</b> will affect the flow rate and impede organ function. When tubes form during organ development, they often have a narrow lumen that must expand to attain the typical mature length and diameter. Both apical (luminal) membrane growth and rearrangements of the subapical cytoskeleton are central to tube growth, but the mechanisms that coordinate these events across the tubular epithelium to ensure uniform tubes with functional dimensions have remained unknown. We have used the respiratory organ (trachea) of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that control tube size and shape. This thesis includes the analyses of five new tracheal tube size genes, which mutational analyses have revealed a new biological principle to ensure uniform functional tubes: newly formed tracheal tubes deposit a broad luminal chitin filament around which the tubular epithelium can rearrange. After tube expansion and before the tubes become functional in transport, the luminal filament is cleared. Four of the genes (krotzkopf verkehrt, knickkopf, retroactive and mummy) are required to build the luminal chitin filament, and their loss of function result in severe diameter constrictions and dilations in the expanding tubes. A fifth gene, which we have called humongous, encodes a novel protein required for formation of the septate junctions (SJs), which are analogous to vertebrate tight junctions. Many previously identified tracheal tube size genes encode SJ components, but their role in tube expansion has been unclear. We find that intact SJs are essential for correct assembly of the chitin filament, thus reinforcing the central role of the luminal chitin filament in tube size regulation...|$|R
40|$|For an {{entangled}} Cayley-tree-type cis-polyisoprene (CT-PI) {{composed of}} two classes of arms, trifunctionally branched inner arms each carrying two outer arms (Mi = 24. 7 × 103 and Mo = 12. 3 × 103 for each inner and outer arm, respectively), the molecular picture of dynamic tube dilation (DTD) was examined through viscoelastic and dielectric data. The global motion of the arms was dielectrically active because they had the so-called type A dipole parallel along their backbone. The dielectric relaxation function Φ(t) thus measured for CT-PI enabled us to experimentally evaluate the survival fraction of the <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> φ′(t), a key quantity in the DTD picture. In the conventional picture of full-DTD, relaxed portions of the arms are regarded as a simple solvent, thereby allowing the number of mutually equilibrated entanglement segments per dilated segment, β(t), to fully increase {{to that in a}} corresponding solution, βf-DTD(t) = {φ′(t) }−d with d = 1. 3 for PI. The corresponding full-DTD relationship between φ′(t) and the normalized viscoelastic relaxation function μ(t), μf-DTD(t) = {φ′(t) } 1 +d, did not hold for the φ′(t) and μ(t) data of CT-PI. In contrast, in the molecular picture of partial-DTD, β(t) is determined through competition of the constraint release (CR) motion of the focused chain and the motion of surrounding chains, the former determining the maximum possible βCR(t) value in a given time scale, t. In this picture, the length and time scales are consistently coarse-grained {{on the basis of the}} CR mechanism. The partial-DTD relationship, μp-DTD(t) = φ′(t) /β*(t) with β*(t) = min[βf-DTD(t), βCR(t) ], was found to hold for the φ′(t) and μ(t) data satisfactorily. In addition, analysis of the φ′(t) data unequivocally indicated that the inner arm hardly relaxed until the outer arm relaxation completed; i. e., the hierarchical relaxation occurred through partial-DTD. These results suggested the importance of the consistent coarse graining in molecular description of the dynamics of branched chains in general...|$|R

In these patients, 236 patients(298 eyes) with canalicular(or lacrimal duct) obstruction undergone KTP laser combined with RS model disposable lacrimal recanalization catheter; 312 patients(359 eyes) with nasolacrimal duct obstruction undergone KTP laser therapy combined with <b>dilating</b> lacrimal drainage <b>tube.</b> The irrigation of lacrimal passage was sustained.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is therefore important to prevent or treat any procedure-related infections. After careful review of the published literature, it is evident that routine antibiotic prophylaxis is generally not recommended for the majority of ART-related procedures.

40|$|The {{formation}} of an epithelial organ requires a set of organ-specific gene programs that instruct parallel and successive developmental events. Still, {{it is unclear what}} are the core regulatory programs and how such programs are timely coordinated within the organ. We use mainly the Drosophila trachea (respiratory system) as a model to understand epithelial organ development. The trachea is a network of epithelial tubes, and its morphology is sensitive to mutations in genes whose products participate in consecutive steps of branching morphogenesis and tube size maturation. In paper I, we identified two gene functions required for tracheal tube elongation. We show that tracheal cells, at a specific time in development, acquire an ability to elongate that is mediated by a protein involved in actin organization. A luminal matrix holds back this elongation, and temporal expression of an anion channel appears required to modify the luminal matrix and thereby permit a controlled extent of elongation. In paper II, we show that a mucin-like protein is temporally expressed in the trachea and is required for tube elongation. The protein also drives diameter expansion of the hindgut, where it fills the growing lumen and appears to physically <b>dilate</b> the <b>tube.</b> The work demonstrates that regulated expression of a single protein can model epithelial tube diameter. In papers III and IV, we focused on the temporal regulation of tracheal gene expression, and uncovered an important function for the mid-embryonic ecdysone hormone pulse in progression of organ development. In paper III, we analysed the mechanism of embryonic ecdysone signalling and found that the hormone causes pan-embryonic activation of Ecdysone Receptor (EcR). EcR acts tissue-autonomously together with Ultraspiracle to promote concurrent progression of organ development. In paper IV, we show that ecdysone, via EcR and a downstream cascade of gene regulators is needed to advance parallel tracheal-specific gene programs. Together, the results reveal novel gene functions during epithelial tube formation, and show that correct temporal unfolding of the tracheal gene network relies on gene-regulatory input from an external cue in form of a hormone pulse...|$|R

40|$|Depending on the architecture, {{polymers}} {{are observed}} to show different dynamical and rheological properties. The results obtained from this work {{will not only}} contribute to a fundamental understanding {{of the character of}} star polymeric systems, but also possibly help to design industrial architecturally complex polymer materials with specific macroscopic properties. Simulations are carried out with coarse-grained method at multiple levels. The Twentanglement algorithm for mesoscopic simulations of polymers is extended to study three armed polymers with various arm lengths. Firstly, a star with three moderately entangled linear arms is studied to test the method. The segmental diffusions are calculated, where it is found that the branch point diffuses the slowest and the free ends move the fastest. By increasing the arm length, the star polymers gradually show a slower diffusion than both matching linear chains, as well as a delayed relaxation. Furthermore, in this work the zero shear viscosities of star melts are calculated from their stress moduli. The observed exponential scaling law in the arm molecular mass of star polymer shows a reasonable agreement with experimental and theoretical investigations for very large star polymers presented in the literature. Besides, the asymmetric three-armed polymer melts have also been studied. The presence of the agile side chain allows for relatively fast local stress relaxations and <b>dilates</b> the <b>tube</b> constraining the backbone. The investigation of polymer systems at different time and length scales requires different coarse graining levels. We present a highly coarse grained model, Responsive Particle Dynamics (RaPiD). In this model, the coarse grained forces can be split into conservative interactions described by the extended Flory-Huggins potential, 'transient' forces depending on the contacts between polymers to represent entanglement effects, and random thermal forces. In this work, the parameterization is obtained in a bottom-up approach as well as considerations of polymer concepts in physics. The radial distribution function generated by RaPiD reproduces the small scale simulation data very well. The shear stress modulus as calculated in RaPiD is in reasonable agreement with the small scale simulations. This work proves that a many-body model is capable of describing the system dynamics very well...|$|R
30|$|We first {{separated}} CM, EC/MC {{and other}} cell types based on lineage markers used in published studies (Li et al., 2016). 28 {{cells from the}} control group and 68 cells from the cKO group were characterized to be CMs (Fig.  3 B and 3 C and Table S 3 B). Heatmap and PCA graph showed that most single cKO CMs could be clearly separated from control CMs (Fig.  3 D). Volcano plot revealed that 3, 020 and 2, 351 genes were significantly up and downregulated in single cKO CM cells compared with single control CMs (Fig.  3 E), based on the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Table S 3 C). Among them, genes that were also differentially expressed in bulk RNA sequencing (FC[*]<[*] 1.5, P[*]<[*] 0.05) were listed in Table S 3 F. Upregulated genes in single cKO CMs were enriched in GO class of focal adhesion, glycolysis process, angiogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation (Fig.  3 F, Table S 3 D and S 3 G). Notably, 15 angiogenesis genes were in this class, including Anxa 2, Ctgf, Pecam 1, Vegfa, Adm 2, Flna, Hspg 2, Rhob, etc. (Fig. S 3 D and Table S 3 I). Downregulated genes were predominantly classified in GO class of polyA RNA binding, mitochondrion, ribosome and RNA splicing (Figs.  3 G, S 3 D, Table S 3 E, S 3 H and S 3 J). The GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in single CMs was similar {{with those in the}} bulk RNA-seq data (Fig.  2 B and 2 C). We selected representative genes from each GO class to shown as violin plots (Fig.  3 H and 3 I). For example, Vegfa and Ctgf were important angiogenesis genes normally lowly expressed in CMs but enriched in ECs and mesenchymal cells, their expression level increased significantly (Fig.  3 H). RNA in situ hybridization also confirmed their upregulation in the cKO heart (Fig.  3 L). Adm 2 was not detectable in ventricular control CMs, but highly expressed in cKO CMs (Fig.  3 H). Sum above, our single cell RNA-seq analysis clearly demonstrated that the profound dysregulation of gene expression in Dgcr 8 cKO CMs could well be the principle cause of the dramatically <b>dilated</b> heart <b>tube,</b> and the abnormal increase of angiogenesis genes reflected a dramatic shift in gene expression program in microRNA-free CMs.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{intimate}} relationship between the molecular structure of industrial polymers, their rheological properties and their final processing and mechanical properties. The tube model of Doi, Edwards and de Gennes (Doi and Edwards, 1986; de Gennes, 1971) enables a molecular understanding of this relationship. The linear rheology data of linear and star polymers can be quantitatively predicted by adaptations of the original tube model. All parameters can be determined self-consistently from the chemistry except for the dilution exponent α and friction parameter p 2 whose exact values are still being debated (van Ruymbeke et al., 2012). However, the inherent problems of the tube model theory arise with predictions of complex branched structures and with predictions of these polymers in complex non-linear shear and extensional flows. One {{of the reasons for}} {{this is due to the}} uncertainty related to relaxation mechanisms such as constraint release. Moreover, it is also a problem of obtaining well-defined mondisperse branched polymers, accurate characterization of the branching structure and developing reliable non-linear flow experiments where experimental artificats are avoided. This is the exact goal of this work, to combine well-defined anionic synthesized polymers, state-of-the-art characterization tools such as TGIC and systematic rheological studies in both the linear and non-linear regime in order to validate and improve existing current tube model theories. More specifically, our study focuses on the determination of the physical origin of chain stretch in complex branched polymers. We use the Sentmanat Extensional Rheometer fixed to a strain controlled rheometer to perform uniaxial extensional rheology. Uniaxial extensional rheology is difficult to measure in experimental set-ups but is a crucial experiment for introducing chain stretch. We investigate three types of architecture from order of branching complexity: linear, H, comb polymers. The uniaxial extensional rheology of linear polymers is highly rate dependent and the onset rate of experimental strain hardening (the macroscopic consequence of chain stretch) is equivalent to the theoretical prediction of the inverse Rouse time. Moreover, even linear polymers will stretch considerably under high deformations until they reach finite extensibility. The molecular dynamic picture becomes more complicated when introducing two or more branch points and two or more relaxation 7 times. We study H polymers, which have been anionically synthesized by (Roovers, 1984) and characterized recently by state-of-the-art TGIC. We discover that due to the hierarchical relaxation scheme of the H polymer, there is a greater degree of chain stretch and an earlier onset rate. We determine that as the experimental extensional rate is increased, the chain stretch is increased until it is no longer entropically favourable to do so, and branch point withdrawal occurs. Contrary to linear polymers, the maximum stretch is independent of stretch rate and only depends on architecture such that λ=q where q is the number of arms on each branch point. This can be explained by the simple rationale that the backbone segment is not free to relax until the branches have full retracted (McLeish and Larson, 1998). When increasing the number of entanglements of the arms and backbone of the H polymer, the effect of chain stretch is magnified. Moreover, we study well-defined comb polymers (Roovers, 1979) with long molar mass of backbone Mb and rather short arm ends. When doubling the number of entanglements of the arms systematically while keeping the Mb constant, the onset of chain stretch occurs at earlier rates. This can be rationalized by accounting for the effect of dynamic tube dilution and extra drag from the arms that results in an effectively slower stretch relaxation time. We modify the original differential pom-pom model of (McLeish and Larson, 1998) with the recently added modification to include drag strain coupling (Blackwell et al., 2000) by specifying the coupling of stretch between adjacent backbone segments. The model is validated successfully by comparison with a wide variety of combs (with different molecular features) and a wide range of extensional rates. At high rates, the maximum stretch condition is reached and branch point withdrawal occurs, when arms are first oriented and then withdrawn into the stretched backbone tube segments, first from the free ends and then gradually progressing towards the center. By studying the internal dynamics of the backbone segments, we discover that at this maximum stretch condition, the central backbone segment has a stretch factor equal to λ=ns/ 2 and that the stretch factor decreases by a value of 1 at each adjacent backbone segment. At these high rates, the addition of drag strain coupling smoothens the transition to maximum stretch and allows for better predictions. Moreover, our study focuses on the effects of the environment on the reptation and fluctuations of model H and comb polymers. By systematically varying the length of the linear chains, we study the acceleration factor related to the arm and backbone relaxation times. The acceleration factor has a strong dependence on the length of the linear chains. The shorter the chains, or the larger the difference between the relaxation times of the linear 8 matrix and the branched polymer, the more enhanced is the acceleration factor. For the study of bidisperse linear blends, there is the Struglinksy-Graessley parameter which is often invoked to explain the transition from static dilution of the short linear chains in a <b>dilated</b> <b>tube</b> to reptation in a skinny tube. There is no similar interpretation for blends of branched polymers and linear chains. We model the SAOS data using the Time Marching Algorithm by estimating a priori whether the linear polymer would be taken as a theta solvent or whether the reptation occurs in a skinny tube. The criterion for this estimation is based on the relaxation timescale separation between the linear matrix and the H or comb. In addition, the BOB model is used to model the SAOS data of the mixtures and is shown to match the data moderately well. The second diluted plateau modulus is overpredicted, indicating that the full dilution is not taken into account...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{findings}} on the relationship between tubal muscles and the Eustachian tube as described in the previous report, the actions of various tubal muscles on the Eustachian tube are discussed, and the observations carried out by the methods described below on the movements in vivo of the naso-haryngeal orifice at the time of phonation and of swallowing reveaied the following results. 1. Observations were carried out {{with the use of a}} nasopharyngoscope. 2. Observations were done on the patients who underwent the radical operation for the cancer of maxillar sinus. As the inferior nasal concha was already removed at the time of the operation, it was possible to insert a small nasal mirror into the posterior nasal cavity of the operated side to catch the whole view around the tubal orifice of healty side. 3. For the children over 5 - 6 years old with cleft palate, observations were carried out directly on the pharyngeal orifice through the mouth cavity (motion pictures were taken in this instance). At a result it has been found that the nasopharyngeal orifice of the tube is widened because the posterior lip and the mucous membrane of the base of the Eustachian tube move slightly outward at the time of swallowing. In anatomically summarizing these observations the author arrived at the following conclusions. At the time of swallowing the tensor muscle of the palate <b>dilates</b> the Eustachian <b>tube</b> at the points near the middle part and the anterior part of the tube. The levator palatini muscle assists the opening action of the tensor muscle by fixing or by drawing the base of the tube slightly toward the inferior-interior side. The salpingopharyngeus muscle or the salpingopharyngeal fold, being drawn inward by the cephalopharyngeal muscle and pahryngopalatine muscle and widening the nasopharygeal orified, assists the dilatating action of the tensor muscles. When the muscles are relaxed, the Eustachian tube is closed probably by the elasticity of the lateral cartilaginous lamina and by the pressure of the tissues surrounding the tube...|$|R

On the classifications of seminal vesiculograms, there have been many reports, but could not be found that of seminal vesiculograms about male sterility.
