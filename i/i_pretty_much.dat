There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic."

2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
