But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E

[...] The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: [...] "I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too."

Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across.

500|$|Jasmine's song [...] "A Whole New World", {{which she}} {{performs}} as {{a duet with}} Aladdin, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 65th Academy Awards in 1993. Six years after Aladdin, Salonga {{would go on to}} be cast as the singing voice of second Disney Princess, Mulan, in 1998. Salonga joked about being required to audition for the role despite having already voiced a Disney Princess: [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to audition?... I was already a princess before. Wasn't that enough?" [...] Meanwhile, Larkin would return to voice Jasmine several times in subsequent media appearances, including films, video games and television series. As the two actresses responsible for giving voice to the character, both Larkin and Salonga were honored with Disney Legends awards for their contributions in 2011 at a ceremony recognized for awarding several other actresses who famously voiced Disney Princesses. In addition to songwriters Menken and Tim Rice, Salonga jokingly thanked Larkin {{for not being able to}} sing and thus providing her with a job. Salonga became the award's first Filipina recipient; her hand print is also imprinted at the Walt Disney headquarters in Burbank, California.|$|E
500|$|Upon being cast as Mulan's {{speaking}} voice, Wen {{was immediately}} informed by Disney {{that she would}} not be providing the character's singing voice. The actress took no offense to this decision, commenting jokingly [...] "I don't blame them." [...] The directors hired Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga to dub the character's respective singing voice, heard in the film's songs [...] "Reflection", [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] and [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For", on Wen's behalf. According to Thomas S. Hischak, author of the book Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary, Salonga was originally cast to provide both Mulan's speaking and singing voices. However, the directors eventually felt that her attempt at impersonating a man in the form of Mulan's male alter-ego [...] "Ping" [...] was rather unconvincing, and ultimately replacing Salonga with Wen. Six years prior to Mulan, Salonga provided the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin (1992) on behalf of American actress Linda Larkin. While auditioning for Mulan, Salonga asked jokingly, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to audition?... I was already a princess before. Wasn't that enough?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing.

500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E
