40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure, {{based on}} the use of sector-field ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS), was developed for the determination of Be, B, Al, P, S, Ti, Ge, As, Se, Zr, Nb, Rh, Pd, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Ir and Pt in a <b>high-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> matrix, consisting mainly of Cr, Fe and Ni, in addition to lower amounts of Si, V, Mn, Co, Cu and Mo. To reduce the impact of spectral and non-spectral interferences, an analyte/matrix separation procedure based on cation-exchange chromatography was developed and applied. In the chromatographic protocol used, most of the first row transition metals are retained on AG 50 Wx 8 resin, whereby ca. 97. 5 % of the initial matrix can be separated from the rapidly eluting target elements. The main matrix constituents accompanying the rapidly eluting target elements are Si, Mo and ca. 5 % of the total Cr, the latter of which unavoidably elutes prematurely. The finalised procedure was applied to CRMs and real <b>high-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> samples (T 91, 316 L and 15 - 15 Ti).

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{methods for}} estimation of cyclic yield stress and cyclic Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain parameters of steels from their monotonic properties were developed on relatively modest number of material datasets and without considerations of the particularities of different steel subgroups formed {{according to their}} chemical composition (unalloyed, low-alloy, and <b>high-alloy</b> <b>steels)</b> or delivery, i. e., testing condition. Furthermore, some methods were evaluated using the same datasets that were used for their development. In this paper, a comprehensive statistical analysis and evaluation of existing estimation methods were performed using an independent set of experimental material data compriseding 116 steels. Results of performed statistical analyses reveal that statistically significant differences exist among unalloyed, low-alloy, and <b>high-alloy</b> <b>steels</b> regarding their cyclic yield stress and cyclic Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain parameters. Therefore, estimation methods were evaluated separately for mentioned steel subgroups in order to more precisely determine their applicability for the estimation of cyclic behavior of steels belonging to individual subgroups.

40|$|Purpose: This work {{is focused}} on {{determination}} of effects of grinding conditions on effectiveness of abrasive electrodischarge grinding (AEDG) process applied for removal of machining allowance and forming of surface geometrical texture (SGT). These results were compared with one obtained for conventional grinding.
