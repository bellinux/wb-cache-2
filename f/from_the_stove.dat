500|$|There were accidents: {{a candle}} left burning caused {{extensive}} fire damage, and {{on another occasion}} {{several members of the}} party were almost asphyxiated by fumes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> Borchgrevink did attempt to establish a routine, and scientific work was carried on throughout, but as he wrote himself, referring to the general lack of fellowship: [...] "The silence roars in one's ears". [...] Further lowering the group's spirits, [...] their zoologist, Nicolai Hanson, fell ill, failed to respond to treatment [...] and died on 14 October 1899.|$|E
2500|$|These stoves {{are used}} most often to heat {{buildings}} in winter. [...] Wood or other fuel {{is put into}} the stove, lit, and then air flow is regulated to control the burn. [...] The intake airflow is either at the level where fuel is added, or below it. [...] The exhaust (smoke) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> is usually several metres above the combustion chamber.|$|E

2500|$|In 1942, a Pennsylvania Railroad bridge {{watchman}} {{was struck}} by a train and thrown from the bridge. [...] The bridge suffered a fire early in the morning on January 24, 1944. At first, the Federal Bureau of Investigation feared that the bridge had been set on fire deliberately as an act of sabotage. But the Metropolitan Police Department said that the fire started when a night watchman dumped hot coals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> in his watchhouse down the embankment of the river, igniting dry brush and oil (which had dripped from passing rail cars) {{at the base of the}} bridge. A fireboat and 20 fire trucks and engines were needed to put out the blaze, which sent flames [...] into the air. Some of the bridge's spans buckled because of the fire's heat.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy looked up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> and said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'" ...|$|E

50|$|Southern Stove's {{cavernous}} main stove works {{building is}} a single story with a 60-foot-tall ceiling and steel trusses. The foundry was built in 1902. Its roof system was made with 8-inch poured concrete as a fire barrier for sparks and soot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stoves.</b> <b>The</b> premises were purchased by J.P. Taylor Leaf Tobacco Co. in 1921. A three-story middle building is reinforced with heavy timbers. Bricks {{on the south side}} of the middle building are pitted from battering by barrels, or hogsheads, loaded with tobacco. It last housed beers from Austria, Germany and Eastern Europe.|$|R

60|$|The heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> {{had made}} Armand drowsy; his head fell forward on his chest. Chauvelin, {{with his hands}} held behind his back, paced ceaselessly {{up and down the}} narrow room.|$|E
60|$|But {{even as he}} passed, four shadows {{detached}} themselves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tall <b>stove,</b> resolved {{themselves into}} armed men, and sprang after him.|$|R
60|$|Carrie {{saw that}} he was resolute, and discreetly changed the subject. She had not yet quite shaken off the effects of the cold, and in another hour rose drowsily <b>from</b> beside <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{was almost}} dark now, and Nellie Townshead {{could not see}} her companion's face, but {{she was no longer}} careful to keep her own in the shadow, even when the {{radiance}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> flickered about the room.|$|E

5000|$|Independent Chinese {{families}} are classified accordingly to <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> they possess. Because circumstances of a divided household, kitchens are shared but never <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> In <b>the</b> {{case of a}} fathers death, the sons divide their fathers household. The eldest son inherits <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> and <b>the</b> younger brothers transfer <b>the</b> coals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> old <b>stove</b> to their own new <b>stoves.</b> This invites <b>the</b> <b>Stove</b> god to join their newly formed households (Ahern, Martin, Wolf 1978). This process is called [...] "pun chu" [...] or dividing <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> This indicates <b>the</b> [...] "soul" [...] {{of the family and}} it signifies fate of the family.|$|R
60|$|He stopped {{abruptly}} as his neighbour drove an elbow into his ribs, {{and his mouth}} gaped open as he dropped his feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> Then the others moved uneasily in their chairs, for a man {{stood in the doorway}} regarding them with a singularly unpleasant smile.|$|E
60|$|Next morning, after breakfast, Thomas Mugridge {{began his}} whet, whet, whet. I glanced warily at him, for I {{was on my}} knees taking the ashes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> When I {{returned}} from throwing them overside, {{he was talking to}} Harrison, whose honest yokel’s face was filled with fascination and wonder.|$|E

60|$|By way of answer, Deborah opened {{another door}} which threw more light on <b>the</b> scene <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cooking <b>stove</b> in <b>the</b> kitchen, {{and at the}} same moment Cora with a candle came down the stairs.|$|R
60|$|Harding was testifying, when Smoke saw {{the door}} shoved open slightly, {{and in the}} crack appear {{the face of the}} man who had sold the flour.

60|$|Some {{minutes later}} he lifted Millicent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> saddle, and she leaned against him almost {{powerless}} as he pounded on the door. The loud knocking was answered by voices within, the door swung open, and Millicent reeled into a long hall. Two women rose <b>from</b> beside <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> and, for it was broad daylight now, stared in bewilderment at the strangers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any bark knocked off?" [...] inquired the accountant, {{as he took}} a {{piece of}} glowing {{charcoal}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> wherewith to light his pipe.

Bruises, sores, contusions, sprains, rheumatic affections of the back and loins, carbuncles, and earache--there's nothing that smoking won't cure; eh, doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{contradictory}} couple {{agree in}} nothing but contradiction. They return home from Mrs. Bluebottle’s dinner-party, each in an opposite {{corner of the}} coach, and do not exchange a syllable until they have been seated for at least twenty minutes by the fireside at home, when the gentleman, raising his eyes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> all at once breaks silence: ...|$|E
60|$|Early {{next morning}} Breckenridge and the {{messenger}} drove away, and rather {{more than a}} week later Fräulein Muller, whom the former had taken to attend on the homesteader's wife, arrived one night at Fremont ranch. She came in, red-cheeked, unconcerned, and shapeless, in Muller's fur coat, and quietly brushed the dusty snow from her dress before she sat down as far as possible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b>|$|E
60|$|What a {{life that}} poor man led with his wife, to be sure! Not a day passed without her scolding him and calling him names, and indeed {{sometimes}} she would take <b>the</b> broom <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> and beat him with it. He had no peace or comfort at all, and really hardly knew how to bear it.|$|R
60|$|The cat {{came to her}} <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> languidly {{stretching}} himself, and yawning {{until all}} the red cavern {{of his mouth and}} throat was revealed. At the moment he had an uncanny resemblance to Elder Joseph Blewett of White Sands--Roaring Joe, the irreverent boys called him--when he grew excited and shouted. Mrs. Bell saw it--and then reproached herself for the sacrilege.|$|R
