40|$|This paper {{describes}} a morphopedological approach {{applied to the}} Sapo River sub-basin to support territorial management for soil and water conservation. The approach follows the conception of the morphopedological compartment presented by Salom√£o (1994), which considers terrain homogenous units based on soil, relief and geological substrate. Three thematic maps of 1 : 50, 000 scale were made to characterize the morphopedology. Afterwards, spatial analyses techniques were developed in GIS to outline the morphopedological compartments considering the hydraulic functions of the relief inclination. As a result, 11 compartments of the physical environment with specific characteristics have been identified. Relatively smooth terrains predominated, formed by sandy soils in 76. 41 % of the studied area, represented by the MP- 06 and MP- 08 morphopedological compartments. These two units, together with the Quartzarenic Neosol, the MP- 10 compartment with erosive amphitheaters of <b>drainage</b> <b>head</b> waters, the colluvial slopes and slope talus from the MP- 07, and the median and low mountain sides of median hills of the MP- 05 compartment, constitute the regions most vulnerable to erosion. Erosion occurs predominantly {{at the bottom of}} fluvial valleys from MP- 05 and MP- 06 and at <b>drainage</b> <b>head</b> waters, resulting in direct impacts on soil and waters of the basin due to silt build-up, hydromorphism losses and decrease of the water level. It was concluded that preventive actions are necessary to control erosion, especially in the most fragile areas...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{measured}} {{a comprehensive}} set of outcome measures after different surgical procedures for painful chronic pancreatitis (CP) at long-term follow-up. Background: Pain caused by CP can be alleviated through operative intervention with {{type of procedure}} depending on anatomical abnormalities. Outcome measures include functional (pain relief, quality of life [QoL]), medical (endo- and exocrine function), and clinical (reoperation) results reported by patient. Methods: A cross-sectional cohort of 223 consecutive patients who underwent surgical <b>drainage,</b> <b>head</b> resection, or left-sided pancreas resection, depending on anatomical abnormalities, was analyzed. Participating patients were reassessed during a prospectively scheduled outpatient clinic visit. Results: At follow-up, 44 patients had died; 146 of 179 living patients consented {{to participate in the}} study. After 63 months (range: 14 - 268), 68 % reported no or little pain, 19 % reported intermediate pain, and 12 % reported severe pain. Preoperative daily opioid use (OR: 3. 04; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 09 - 8. 49) and high numbers of preceding endoscopic procedures (OR [odds ratio]: 3. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 14. 9) were associated with persistent severe pain. Compared with the general population, physical more than mental QoL remained impaired (P < 0. 05). At follow-up, endocrine insufficiency was present in 57 % of patients and exocrine insufficiency was present in 77 %. Independently, a head resection and a reoperation for any cause were moderately associated with new-onset diabetes (P < 0. 1). Compared with patients who underwent left-sided resection, the risk of developing exocrine insufficiency after surgery was higher after drainage or head resection. After 20 months (interquartile range: 10 - 51) after surgery, 26 (12 %) of 223 patients underwent 1 or more elective reoperations. Conclusions: Operative intervention for painful CP, tailored to anatomical abnormalities, results in excellent to fair long-term pain relief, but approximately 10 % of patients do not respond. QoL scores remained slightly compromised. High preoperative pain levels, suggested through daily opioid use and high numbers of endoscopic procedures, are associated with less favorable outcom...|$|E

40|$|The manual lymphatic {{drainage}} therapy of {{the head}} is a proven treatment in the preventive therapy of the migraine. Until today {{there have been no}} studies performed, which substantiates the effectiveness of this treatment for that disease. Since many years an imbalance of the autonomic nervous regulation and an increased excitability of central neurons are known with migraine patients. Successful are sympatholytic methods like beta-blockers. Because of the known sympatholytic effect of lymphatic drainage, we tried to find a central nervous effect of this treatment. For this, we calculated the heart rate and sinus arrhythmia, based on ECG recordings. This way it was possible to distinguish between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. 23 patients with migraine and 22 healthy subjects were investigated by ECG before and after lymphatic drainage therapy {{of the head}}. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups. Following the treatment, a significant decrease of the heart rate and an increase of the sinus arrhythmia has been noticed. To detect the local effect of the lymphatic drainage on the skin microcirculation, the laser Doppler flux of the skin of the right and left forehead before and after the lymphatic drainage has been measured. To detect possible effects far away of the local lymphatic drainage the same measurements were also carried out on the left and right forefingers before and after the lymphatic <b>drainage</b> of the <b>head.</b> Before the therapy no significant differences in the skin microcirculation between the patients with migraine and healthy subjects were found. In all subjects the blood flow was higher in the forefingers than in the forehead, because of the different structure of the vessels in the underlying skin area. During the lymphatic drainage in both groups the flow decreased in the forefingers most likely due to thermoregulatory mechanisms in combination with a temperature drop. The more pronounced perfusion drop at patients suffering migraine seems to be based on a different sensibility to the temperature drop. No group showed changes in the perfusion of the forehead. Additionally 16 healthy subjects in horizontal position were investigated before and after relaxing without treatment. They showed a significant decrease of the heart rate only, without any change in the sinus arrhythmia. This corresponds with the symptoms of a pure sympatholytic cardiac reaction. So the most important difference between the effect of a lymphatic <b>drainage</b> of the <b>head</b> and the effect of relaxing in horizontal position is the additional parasympathetic cardiac effect of the lymphatic <b>drainage</b> of the <b>head.</b> In conclusion the lymphatic <b>drainage</b> of the <b>head</b> shows the criteria of a relaxation therapy, because of its simultaneous sympatholytic and parasympathetic effect on the nervous system.

40|$|The Cenozoic {{strata of}} western Nebraska are an {{extensive}} sequence of continental deposits that extend eastward from the Hartville, Laramie, and Front Range uplifts and southeast from the Black Hills. The oldest Cenozoic sediments (Chadron Formation, White River Group) are Early Oligocene alluvial valley fills. Subsequent to filling of these drainages and continuing {{for about the}} next 7 m. y., landscape development in western Nebraska was dominated by eolian deposition of tremendous volumes of rhyolitic volcanic ash derived from western eruptions. A plain of low relief, with only an occasional narrow <b>drainage</b> <b>heading</b> in the western highlands, was maintained during most of this period. Uplift in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains (pre-Gering Formation, Arikaree Group) caused erosion and brought epiclastic detritus into the area about 28 m. y. ago. Eolian sediment consisting mostly of pyroclastic detritus continued building the plains during and after Gering alluvial deposition until about 19 m. y. ago when Arikaree deposition ceased. About this time, western volcanic activity declined for several million years and {{was followed by a}} marked decrease in the volume of rhyolitic volcanism {{for the remainder of the}} Cenozoic. At the end of Arikaree deposition in western Nebraska, a major pulse of erosion (pre-Runningwater Formation, Ogallala Group) was followed by a fundamental change in depositional style and landscape evolution, characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of epiclastic valley fills. Sands and gravels from Rocky Mountain sources were first deposited in a major valley in the northern half of the area and later in valleys to the south.

Central venous catheters (CVCs) are required for the safe administration of many vasopressors and inotropes, 3, 4 but carry potentially serious morbidity and mortality risks, 5, 6 particularly as the femoral insertion site is frequently chosen to avoid the theoretical risk of impaired venous <b>drainage</b> from the <b>head</b> in association with internal jugular vein CVC placement. 7 The authors observed {{that there was a}} difference in practice between consultants within the Department of Anaesthesia regarding the routine placement of CVCs in patients with s-SAH, prompting the study.|$|R

40|$|During development, {{topography}} is cut, filled, and graded, altering natural {{surface drainage}} patterns. The spatiotemporal characteristics of drainage network and hillslope changes throughout {{the development process}} are to date unknown. For this study we used multiple temporal LiDAR-derived DEMs spanning the development of two small agricultural watersheds to examine geomorphic changes caused by urban development. A third forested watershed was also examined to track geomorphic changes not attributable to development. We first present a technique to extract <b>drainage</b> channel <b>heads</b> and <b>drainage</b> networks through time utilizing surface tangential curvature and compare its ability to predict field verified channel heads against two other delineation techniques. Second, subwatersheds of the delineated networks were used to summarize topographic changes in the forested and developing watersheds through time. Finally, simplified hydrologic response functions are generated for each time step utilizing width functions augmented by the curvature delineated networks. Landscape dissection and hydrologicconnectivity increased throughout development, indicating an increased efficiency of water removal from the landscape. Substantial topographic changes manifest as variations in curvature standard deviations through time in first order catchments, highlighting redistribution {{of high and low}} gradient regions. Idealized hydrologic responses reflect increased landscape connectivity with a distinct shift toward more rapid storm response shapes throughout the development process. Unexpectedly high temporal variance observed in the forested watershed across analyses indicates inherent differences in temporal digital topographic datasets.

The model uses fluid volumes as primary state variables and explicitly models fluid flows as well as the resistance, compliance, and pressure associated with each of the compartments (arteries and arterioles, capillary bed, veins, venous sinus, ventricles, and brain parenchyma). The model has been tested to assure that it reproduces a correct physiologic response to intra- and extra-parenchymal hemorrhage and edema, and to therapies directed at reducing ICP such as cerebral spinal fluid <b>drainage,</b> mannitol administration, <b>head</b> elevation, and mild hyperventilation. The model is able to replicate observed clinical behavior in many cases, including elevated ICP associated with severe cerebral edema, subdural hematoma, and cerebrospinal fluid blockage.

We conclude that incorporating fluid volumes and flows into a model of ICP dynamics significantly improved its clinical utility. Additional improvements are anticipated (or will accrue or will result) as the specific mechanisms that modify cerebral compliance and autoregulation during TBI and elevated ICP are further delineated.

The continental shelf and slope are indented and dissected by major canyon systems. The shelf is characterised by major northeast‚Äìsouthwest trending sand banks that are orthogonal to the shelf edge. Along the shelf edge, several fields of asymmetric sandwaves oriented orthogonal to the canyon axes indicate sediment transport into the canyon heads. Less commonly, sandwaves with weak asymmetry suggest sediment transport onto the shelf. These may be reworked and are partly overprinted by more recent sandwaves. Down-slope sediment transport by turbidity currents is the dominant process through the major canyons. Recent faulting has {{also played a role}} in canyon development. Turbidity currents are most likely initiated by faulting, and/or slope failure of the walls that bound the canyon <b>head</b> <b>drainage</b> basins and sediment migration from the shelf. This leads to deep incision of sinuous thalwegs in the upper reaches of canyon floors and downcutting and sediment transport on the mid to lower continental slope.

Under the Local Management Act, as our readers may remember, an underground room may not be occupied separately as a dwelling unless certain conditions are complied with, one of which is that there shall be a window of specified size, with an area before it open down to 6 inches below the floor of the room... One of the worst examples that we saw of these underground rooms we must endeavour to illustrate. It is in Nichol-street, No.59, and may be described as entirely below the surface. the window of the apartment is a little over 3 feet in width, and about the same in height; the area is even with the breadth and depth of the window. It extends from the wall about 2 feet, and was closed with an iron grating; but this having become broken, the entire top of the area has been covered with wood, so that the only means of light and ventilation is a chink 3 feet wide by 4 and a half inches in height. Passing through the passage to the back, the dilapidated condition of the premises, as may be seen in the sketch, is startling. The plaster has fallen from the walls and the ceilings, the narrow staircase is rotten and shaky, the general colour is of a dingy smoky black, with peeps of indifferent brickwork and broken laths. At the back there is a large open space, in a most filthy condition; damp refuse of all kinds is piled up against the wall; there is no supply of water;" ...|$|R

Ao longo de um testemunho de 130 cm, foram identificados 37 t√Éxons diferentes, os quais foram separados em cinco categorias ecol√Égicas (√Érvores, arbustos, ervas terrestres, algas e esporos de pterid√Éfitas). A data√É√Éo estimada sugere que a base da turfeira formou-se √É aproximadamente 13. 700 anos A. P, per√Éodo relacionado ao √Éltimo M√Éximo Glacial (UMG). Nessa √Época a cabeceira de drenagem n√Éo teria uma liga√É√Éo canalizada com a rede de drenagem do rio Independ√Éncia, n√Ével de base local. De acordo com os dados obtidos, pode-se afirmar que na regi√Éo da √Érea de estudo, durante a passagem do Pleistoceno/Holoceno at√É o presente, n√Éo h√É registros de cerrado, apenas de √Éreas campestres no Pleistoceno, inferido pela presen√Éa de ervas terrestres, principalmente Asteraceae e Borreria encontrados em 12. 700 anos A. P. (est.) e total aus√Éncia de algas e gr√Éos de p√Élen de esp√Écies arb√Éreas, sugerindo regime hidrol√Égico mais seco. Eventualmente, fen√Émenos de alta precipita√É√Éo ocorreram nas encostas e promoveram a degrada√É√Éo dos horizontes de solo na alta encosta (nose), promovendo a deposi√É√Éo de camadas coluviais at√É o novo regime h√Édrico, mais √Émido, propiciando a instala√É√Éo de uma vegeta√É√Éo herb√Écea acompanhada de pterid√Éfitas, principalmente nas √Éreas mais baixas. H√É cerca de 10. 600 anos A. P. 14 C (est.), a manuten√É√Éo da eleva√É√Éo de umidade se estabelece e altos √Éndices de precipita√É√Éo fizeram com que o len√Éol fre√Ético aflorasse no hollow constantemente, acelerando a hidromorfiza√É√Éo do paleohorizonte A h√Émico e desenvolvendo, nas esta√É√Ées chuvosas, uma pequena lagoa no eixo central da cabeceira. Fato evidenciado pela presen√Éa de algas e por uma expans√Éo significativa de Araucaria angustifolia, a qual necessita de um regime pluviom√Étrico {{superior}} a 1. 400 mm. ano- 1, sem esta√É√Éo seca definida. A vegeta√É√Éo predominante passa a ser de Floresta Ombr√Éfila Mista e Floresta Pluvial Atl√Éntica composta por g√Éneros arb√Éreos, ervas terrestres e pterid√Éfitas. A m√Éxima expans√Éo da Floresta Ombr√Éfila Mista √É registrada a cerca de 6. 880 anos A. P. (est.), face o aumento de todos os t√Éxons registrados, principalmente Araucaria. A presen√Éa de algas ficou mais acentuada, sugerindo novamente a ocorr√Éncia de uma l√Émina de √Égua, conservada por um regime pluviom√Étrico abundante e regular. Nos anos que se seguiram, provavelmente √É 1. 060 anos A. P.

Em algum momento desse per√Éodo o hollow da cabeceira de drenagem passou a desenvolver canais de drenagem perenes, que permitiram a drenagem eficiente na cabeceira, diminuindo os n√Éveis de umidade da turfeiraThis study identifies paleoenvironmental {{records in}} the remaining at planed surface VIII, in Pato Branco (SW PR), more precisely in conservation area (A. R. I. E. do Buriti) by analysis of palynomorphs in a bog, characterization of the surface formations and the 14 C dating method. Throughout the testimony of 130 cm, 37 different taxa were identified, which were separated into five ecological categories (trees, shrubs, ground herbs, algae and fern spores). The dating estimated suggests that {{the base of the}} bog was formed approximately 13, 700 years BP, a period related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At that time the <b>head</b> of <b>drainage</b> would not have a connection to the piped drainage waterway of Independence river, local base level. According to the data obtained, we can affirm that in the region of the study area during the transition from the Pleistocene / Holocene to the present, there are no records of savannah, only grassland areas in the Pleistocene, inferred by the presence of ground herbs, especially Borreria and Asteraceae found in 12, 700 years BP 14 C (estimated) and total absence of algae and pollen grains of tree species, suggesting drier hydrological regime. Occasionally, high precipitation phenomeno occurred on the slopes and promoted the degradation of soil horizons in the upper slope (nose), promoting the deposition of colluvial layers until the new water regime, wetter, allowing the establishment of a herbaceous vegetation accompanied by ferns, mainly in the lower areas. In about 10, 600 years BP 14 C (est.), maintenance of high humidity is established and high precipitation caused the water table surface in the hollow constantly accelerating the hidromorfization paleohorizonte A humic, and developing in the rainy seasons, a small pond in the central axis of the headboard. Fact evidenced by the presence of algae and a significant expansion of Araucaria angustifolia, which requires an annual rainfall exceeding 1, 400 mm. yr- 1, without a dry season. The predominant vegetation is replaced by the Araucaria Forest and Atlantic Rain Forest composed of genres trees, ground herbs and ferns. The maximum expansion of the Araucaria Forest is logged about 6, 880 years BP 14 C (est.), face the increase of all taxa recorded, mainly from Araucaria. The presence of algae was more pronounced, again suggesting the occurrence of a blade of water conserved by an abundant and regular rainfall. In the years that followed, probably to 1, 060 years BP 14 C (est.), a reduction of vegetation as a general rule, changing only in the present with the planting of araucaria after the creation of A.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between drainage from the variably saturated zone {{above the water}} table, and the response of an unconfined aquifer to pumping has {{been the source of}} debate for many decades. While various field tests (Nwankwor et al., 1992 and Moench et al., 2001) have supported the concept that variably saturated flow processes delay drainage above a falling water table, Neuman (1972, 1974, 1975), has asserted that the impact is minimal, delay in response of the water table is due to elastic storage effects, and instantaneous yield above the water table is a reasonable assumption in unconfined aquifer analysis. This assumption results in exceedingly low estimates of specific yield in comparison to other analysis techniques (Neuman, 1987). A 7 -day pumping test by Bevan et al. (2005) in the unconfined aquifer at Canadian Forces Base Borden has highlighted the complexity in drainage from above the water table during pumping, as the tension saturated zone was found to increase in thickness as a function of both proximity to the pumping well, and elapsed pumping time. This extended thickness persisted for the 7 -day pumping duration. Analytical analysis of the test by Endres et al. (2007) resulted in significant underestimates of specific yield in comparison to laboratory values for most solutions. Narasimham (2007) suggested that the use of numerical simulators which include variably saturated flow may provide the most accurate representation of the test results. An attempt to replicate test results using a numerical simulation of variably saturated flow by Moench (2008) could not provide a complete physical mechanism for the extension observed by Bevan et al. (2005). This study provides a detailed investigation on the effect of heterogeneity, hysteresis, and entrapped air on drainage during unconfined pumping tests using numerical simulations, field experiments, and laboratory observations. The results of the Bevan et al. (2005) pumping test are used as a standard for comparison. Three variably-saturated groundwater flow numerical codes were evaluated for their ability to replicate the variations in soil moisture content observed during pumping by Bevan et al. (2005). Results of the numerical simulations were also analyzed for their similarity to the peak and subsequent decrease in vertical gradients observed during pumping in the Borden aquifer. While the models generated vertical gradients through the capillary fringe during pumping, these gradients dissipated significantly before 1000 min. of pumping. No gradients in the saturated zone generated by the numerical model would be capable of shifting the pressure head sufficiently to cause an apparent capillary fringe extension following the first few hours of pumping. Significant gradients were persistent throughout the test at locations where saturation was less than 85 %. Accounting for the formation of vertical gradients, no simulation was able to replicate the soil moisture distributions observed by Bevan et al. (2005). Based on these results, heterogeneity, hysteresis, and entrapped air were proposed as processes with the potential to significantly affect drainage from above the water table during pumping, as their investigation may provide the physical mechanism for the observed capillary fringe extension. Compaction of the aquifer material was dismissed as a potential mechanism {{based on the results of}} a proctor test. The effect of heterogeneity on drainage from the Borden aquifer during pumping was investigated numerically using geostatistical methods. A log-normal saturated hydraulic conductivity distribution was used to represent the Borden aquifer. Brooks and Corey parameters were used to describe the pressure-saturation-relative conductivity relationships. The air-entry pressure parameter was scaled to the saturated conductivity using the scaling relationship for Borden sand proposed by Keuper and Frind (1991). The Brooks and Corey lambda parameter was kept constant. A Monte Carlo analysis was performed on the results. While several realizations of the hydraulic conductivity distribution resulted in the formation of perched water during drainage, the ensemble capillary fringe thickness was unchanged from the thickness generated using a homogeneous conceptual aquifer model. No single realization produced a capillary fringe extension in which the magnitude was a function of elapsed pumping time, or distance from the pumping well. Approximation of the effect of air-entry barriers on drainage did not increase the estimated capillary fringe thickness. The presence and location of finer grained layers appeared to have a much greater impact on the thickness of the capillary fringe than the drawdown induced by pumping. Ensemble results for the hydraulic head drawdown provided improved matches to the field observations in comparison to the homogeneous numerical model during intermediate and late times in the pumping test. A mild degree of heterogeneity appears to have sufficient effect on drainage from above the water table during pumping to impact hydraulic drawdown. The effect would be magnified with the greater degree of heterogeneity that is more typical of natural aquifer systems. A 24 -hour pumping test was conducted at CFB Borden to gain a better understanding of the nature of drainage during a pumping test. Due to the wet site conditions prior to the test, the moisture profile during pumping was significantly influenced by hysteresis. The hydraulic head drawdown generated during the test was insufficient to generate any drainage due to the lowering of the top of the saturated zone, and the formation of perched lenses could not occur. Hysteresis in the moisture profile was a controlling factor in this result. Although there was no significant drainage initiated due to the lowering of the top of the saturated zone, an inflection point was still apparent in the time-drawdown curve for the four monitoring wells observed. Vertical gradients measured throughout the saturated zone, including the capillary fringe, remained low throughout the duration of pumping, and no significant increase was apparent in the transition from saturated to tension-saturated conditions. Hysteresis has the potential to increase the delay in drainage as the water table falls during pumping. A laboratory tank apparatus was used to determine the effect of entrapped air, grain size distribution, and horizontal gradient on drainage in a primarily horizontal flow regime. The tank was packed on three separate occasions, once with a coarse well sorted silica sand, and twice with sand from the Borden aquifer. For each packing, the tank was drained twice, using two different horizontal gradient magnitudes. Results show that horizontal gradient magnitude has no impact on soil moisture distributions during drainage. Air-entry pressure was elevated in comparison to gravity <b>drainage</b> derived pressure <b>head</b> ‚Äì saturation curves. This elevation was not transient, nor dependant on gradient or grain size distribution. The increase in air-entry pressure does not appear to be due to insufficient equilibration time between water level drops or flow redistribution around the TDR Rods. Results of this study support a conceptual model of unconfined aquifer response in which drainage from above the water table is a complex and time dependant process. Individually, heterogeneity and hysteresis have been shown to cause a time delay between the lowering of the water table and the subsequent drainage of the tension saturated zone during intermediate to late pumping times. The magnitude and duration of this delay varies by process and is a function of the degree of heterogeneity, moisture conditions in the aquifer prior to pumping, and the drawdown rate of the water table. While no individual process tested could produce the capillary fringe extension observed by Bevan et al. (2005), the investigation of each has led to an improved conceptual understanding of the response to pumping in unconfined aquifers. Due to the complex interaction of these processes it is unlikely that pumping test results, even those which include moisture content observations, could be used to accurately predict unsaturated flow parameters. Storage parameter (i. e. specific yield) estimates made using analytical solutions may not be appropriate unless delayed drainage from above the water table is properly accounted for...|$|R
