5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E

25|$|This was {{followed}} by victory in Zimbabwe's first Test match in six years, against Bangladesh, which was a historic achievement, further backed up by another ODI Series win. The team then had a nine-match losing streak before they broke it with a record win against top opponent New Zealand, chasing 328 to win. They then nearly defeated the same opponents in the one-off Test, chasing 366 at Bulawayo, but a spectacular collapse, in which they lost six wixckets for 44 runs made them <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 34-run loss.|$|E
25|$|These standings do not {{necessarily}} reflect a skater/couple's capabilities. Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> much lower world standing.|$|E

Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck was also hounded by a back injury, which forced him off the field {{for a total of}} nine games, contributing to a six-game losing streak {{during the second half of}} the season. Although the Seahawks won two of their last three games, including a 13-3 victory over the New York Jets in Holmgren's last home game at Qwest Field, the team would finish third in the NFC West and <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record of 4-12, the worst the franchise had seen since 1992.|$|E
25|$|During the turnaround, the {{traveling}} twin {{is in an}} accelerated reference frame. According to the equivalence principle, {{the traveling}} twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea. From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock will <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done {{in the frame of}} the stay-at-home twin.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, we <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An example of that is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E

They proceeded {{on to the}} finals against their old time rival Japan. Japan won the match and took the title with a narrow score of 6–5, putting Chinese Taipei in second place. In {{the final round of}} the tournament, Chinese Taipei defeated 2008 Olympic baseball champions South Korea with a 5–4 victory. Their next match was played against China, whom they lost to {{for the first time in}} history at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Chinese Taipei would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 13–1 victory in 7 innings (game ended due to mercy rule) over China. The team would then play a final decisive game against their long-time rival Japan. The Japanese team won 6-5 and took the championship title, having gone 3–0 in the final round. Chinese Taipei would finish as the runner-up, with 2 wins and 1 loss in the last round of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} game, against Italy, the USA team started off strong, {{opening up a}} 31–13 lead early. Coach Rizzotti was happy with the team's intensity, {{that led to a}} 90–64 win over Italy. Cierra Burdick shot 5–7 from the field and hit 8 of 9 free throws to lead the team in scoring with 17 points. Her nine rebounds were a team high. The USA team shot well overall, hitting 55% of their shots. The USA team outrebounded their opponents 44–22. This win set up a match-up between the USA team and Canada, each coming into the game with spotless (5–0) records. Canada jumped out to an early 6–0 lead. Although the USA team closed the gap to 8–6, Canada {{extended}} the lead to double digits. The USA team was plagued by poor shooting, hitting only a third of their shots in the game, and ending up only marginally better, at 36%. Canada started out shooting well, over 60% in the first quarter, but would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower shooting percentage than the USA at 35%. However, turnovers would be a key measure, as the USA team turned the ball over 24 times, the most of any game they played so far, leading to more shooting opportunities for the team from Canada. Ariel Massengale was the only USA player to score in double-digits with 17 points. In contrast, Canada had three double-digit scorers, led by 24 points for Michelle Plouffe. Canada won the game 64–52. Both teams were still in medal contention.|$|E
