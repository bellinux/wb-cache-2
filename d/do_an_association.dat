So, there is necessary monitoring and evaluation {{in a process of}} performance. The one of institute to make social justice is Muhammadiyah Panti Asuhan and Pondok Pesantren Madiun. The purpose of this research is to build social values in an organization to know internal and external performances in realize vision and mission of Muhammadiyah Panti Asuhan and Pondok Pesantren Madiun by skill program and education to know the reaching of success indicator from those panti asuhan programs. This research used human capital theory of Coleman, James, S that explain a human capital like a physical financial capital made by making a revolution in a material. So, it composes the tools that give facilitation of the product, the human sources that create by modifying the people. So, it gives them skill and ability that makes them able to act likes procedural report. Coleman, James. S said, besides knowledge and skill the other portion of human modal (human capital) is the society ability to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>association</b> (connection) with the others. The result of this research is to know the character of Muhammadiyah Panti Asuhan and Pondok Pesantren Madiun deeply in increase human capital of the foster children by nurture system in that institute. The institute program is education and skills, because this program has a big contribution in increasing human capital of the foster children. The result of the analysis said that the skill program in the panti asuhan do not realized yet with creation of curriculum, because the minimum of the labor force and it is just a formality job program in the panti asuhan. The education program was work fit with the panti asuhan’s prospect that the foster children can thread the education until senior high school, but the process of the new generation after they leave from the panti asuhan do not work yet. It is because there is a hard responsibility of the foster children to serve in Madiun...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use novel {{historical}} data on economics and social rights from the constitutions of 201 countries and an instrument variable strategy to answer two important questions. First, do {{economic and social}} rights provisions in constitutions reduce poverty? Second, does the strength of constitutional language {{of the economic and}} social rights matter? Constitutional provisions can be framed either more weakly as directive principles or more strongly as enforceable law. We find three important results. First, we <b>do</b> not find <b>an</b> <b>association</b> between constitutional rights generally framed and poverty. Second, we <b>do</b> not find <b>an</b> <b>association</b> between economic and social rights framed as directive principles and poverty. Third, we <b>do</b> find <b>a</b> strong negative <b>association</b> between economic and social rights framed as enforceable law and poverty. When we use legal origins as our IV, we find evidence that this result is causal. Our results survive a variety of robustness checks. The policy implication is that constitutional provisions framed as enforceable law provide effective meta-rules with incentives for policymakers to initiate, fund, monitor and enforce poverty reduction policies...|$|R
