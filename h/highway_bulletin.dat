5000|$|The Wilson's {{decided to}} donate the statue when the present {{courthouse}} {{was completed in}} 1917. Because they had no children they reasoned they should give something substantial to the community. [...] The Greene County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay {{half the cost of}} the base. The Bureau Brothers Foundry of Philadelphia was contracted to create the statue, and they included the plaque at no expense. It was originally planned that the statue would stand atop a base of pink granite from Pipestone, Minnesota. However, because of World War I the War Industries Board refused to permit the quarrying and carving the stone until the war was over. The Capitol Hill Monument Company of Des Moines erected a temporary concrete base for the statue's dedication on September 22, 1918. The [...] "temporary" [...] base was replaced in 1964. The Iowa State <b>Highway</b> Commission Service <b>Bulletin</b> and the Lincoln Highway Forum used a photograph of the new statue on the cover of their publications in 1918. The Lincoln Highway Association placed an image of the statue on its mission statement in 1920.|$|R
