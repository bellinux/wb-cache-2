2500|$|The <b>filtering</b> <b>operation</b> {{in large}} eddy {{simulation}} can be implicit or explicit. [...] Implicit filtering {{recognizes that the}} subfilter scale model will dissipate {{in the same manner}} as many numerical schemes. [...] In this way, the grid, or the numerical discretization scheme, can be assumed to be the LES low-pass filter. [...] While this takes full advantage of the grid resolution, and eliminates the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term, it is difficult to determine the shape of the LES filter that is associated with some numerical issues. [...] Additionally, truncation error can also become an issue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coherent}} vortex simulation approach decomposes {{the turbulent}} flow field {{into a coherent}} part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow. [...] This decomposition is done using wavelet filtering. [...] The approach has {{much in common with}} LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter. [...] Instead, the <b>filtering</b> <b>operation</b> is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves. [...] Farge and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the [...] energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures (vortex tubes), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures. [...] Goldstein and Vasilyev applied the FDV model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter completely eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales. [...] By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion.|$|E

Depending on whether the operations take place in the DPM of the client or the server, our implementation provides two options: the Heavyweight Client mode (HWC) and the Lightweight Client mode (LWC). In the HWC mode, the operations are conducted in the client's DPM while the server's DPM just receives processed data from the client, and simply forwards them to the SIM. In the LWC mode, the client's DPM just sends the raw spiking activity to the server's DPM, where the binning and <b>filtering</b> <b>operations</b> are conducted.|$|R

Despite the protection of the represented set, Bloom <b>filter</b> <b>operations,</b> such as the verification of set inclusion, need to be still feasible.
