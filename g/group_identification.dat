5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and <b>group</b> <b>identification</b> with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In <b>group</b> <b>identification,</b> allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of <b>group</b> <b>identification.</b> Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|E

The classification is specific to Australian needs and was developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The classification is based on the self-perceived <b>group</b> <b>identification</b> approach, using a self assessed response to a direct question. This approach measures the extent to which individuals associate with particular cultural or ethnic groups.|$|E
2500|$|The Morley-Minto Reforms were a milestone. Step by step, the {{elective}} principle {{was introduced}} {{for membership in}} Indian legislative councils.

The Communal electorates were later extended to other communities and made a political factor of the Indian tendency toward <b>group</b> <b>identification</b> through religion.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{categorization}} {{theory has}} been discussed as a three-stage process of identification, where [...] "individuals define themselves {{as members of a}} social group, learn the stereotypes and norms of the group, and group categories influence the perception and understanding of all situations in a particular context" [...] This definition {{can be applied to the}} U.S.-led war on terror, in which conflict features such as the phenomenon of Anti-Americanism and the phenomenon of non-Arab countries like Iran and Afghanistan lending support to Islamist-based terrorism by funding or harboring terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and al-Qaeda against Western nations, particularly Israel and the United States are, according to social categorization theory, influenced by a three-stage process of identification. In this three-stage process of identification, the Arab and Muslim world(s) are the social group(s), in which their members learn stereotypes and norms which categorize their social group vis-à-vis the West. This social categorization process creates feelings of high-level in-group support and allegiance among Arabs and Muslims and the particular context within which members of the Arab and Muslim world(s) social group(s) understand all situations that involve the West. Social categorization theory as a framework for analysis indicates causal relationships between <b>group</b> <b>identification</b> processes and features of conflict situations.|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{analyzed}} {{the concept of}} social identity complexity - a theoretical construct that refers to an individual's subjective representation of the interrelationships among his or her multiple <b>group</b> <b>identifications</b> – in presence and virtual experiences. We thought social identity complexity reflects the degree of overlap perceived to exist between groups of which a person is simultaneously a member. Today, computer mediated communication (CMC) has a main point and meaningful influence {{in the construction of}} the social identity but the interaction with entity cognitive and the different levels of mediation has been a little considered...|$|R
50|$|Together with Cărtărescu {{and other}} {{figures in the}} Postmodernist group, Nedelciu was a target for criticism, both {{individual}} and collective. A synthesis of these objections was provided by literary historian Eugen Negrici. In Negrici's view, the self-referential and ironic works produced by such writers hindered the development of local literature on a more solid basis, and their embrace by the established critics diverted attention from older, classically Modernist authors. He also argued that the <b>group's</b> <b>identification</b> with Postmodernist theses prevented others from doing the same, and that the approximation implied by this process rendered the Postmodern label meaningless.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{comparative}} analysis of two German-speaking Mennonite colonies. One group of 1, 800 migrants voluntarily left Russia for Canada in the 1870 s and departed Canada for Paraguay’s Gran Chaco in 1927 {{to preserve their}} communal autonomy. Another group of 2, 000 Mennonites remained in Russia until 1929, when Stalinist persecution forced them to flee as individual refugees through Germany to the Gran Chaco. Here, the colonies negotiated their relationships {{with each other and}} crafted different responses to German Nazis and American Mennonites who desired global German or Mennonite unity. Comparing the groups’ collective narratives—as voluntary migrants and refugees—reveals problems faced by individuals who do not fit into prescribed national or religious molds. This work engages global forces—such as nationalism and displacement—and universal conditions affecting mobile groups—including how they negotiate <b>group</b> <b>identifications</b> and perpetuate local cultures. It begins from the premise that <b>group</b> <b>identifications</b> are not immutable and objective but are tied to fluid, subjective narratives. This framework shapes three arguments: 1) Faith-based diasporas {{are some of the most}} tenacious carriers of national cultural features—such as languages and folkways—but they often maintain these features for their own ethnoreligious purposes. 2) Governments and aid agencies benefit from the existence of migrants and refugees by advancing mythologies that are inclusive or exclusive of these populations. 3) Mobile faith-based communities use national and religious concepts to interpret new environments but they formulate their collective narratives differently—on a spectrum from faithful disciples to exiled victims...|$|R
