The laser-cut skin of the diamond form is adorned with intricate patterns of baseball bats and balls other sports equipment. Around the sculpture are various 'instruments' people can play, a giant horn, a rattle roller, drum sets and chimes that together form a symphony of sounds. When no one is at the park there is no colored light, when there is noise it lights up — the louder the noise, the brighter the light. The art is a veritable Barometer of excitement for the ballpark." ...|$|R
