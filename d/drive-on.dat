25|$|Elyria has a {{large number}} of parks and {{recreational}} centers that include a variety of activities such as baseball, playground equipment. The four recreational centers are named after their location on the map - North, East, South, and West. They each include one or more baseball fields and at least two tennis courts. There are two main parks, Cascade and Elywood, which are connected by a <b>drive-on</b> ford in the center. The Lorain County Metro Parks took over control of Cascade Park in late 2014, and has unveiled a master plan project throughout 2018 to restore the park for better and safer use, as well as maintain the park.|$|E

She was so successful that they ordered a larger vessel with superior passenger accommodation. Built in Norway, Sound of Jura took up the service on 1 August 1969.|$|E
50|$|Three {{ships with}} steam turbo {{generators}} and turbo-electric transmission — , Virginia and Pennsylvania — came into service in 1928-29, replacing {{all the other}} ships on the intercoastal service. These three newest ships included a <b>drive-on</b> service for passengers' automobiles, which allowed passengers to disembark with their cars at ports of call, such as Havana, a stop added in the early 1930s.|$|E
50|$|A trip aboard Chi-Cheemaun {{is a long}} {{standing}} Great Lakes tradition {{dating back to the}} 1930s when a small, wooden vessel, Kagawong, first ferried automobiles across the Georgian Bay between Tobermory and South Baymouth. It features a <b>drive-on,</b> drive-off bow and stern loading and unloading through a visored bow system and a square door stern section. The ship is 111 m with a 19 m beam and has capacity for 648 passengers and 143 vehicles, including room for large highway vehicles such as buses and transport trucks.|$|E
50|$|The vessel used by Hawaii Superferry was an aluminum-hulled {{catamaran}} with <b>drive-on</b> / drive-off vehicle capability or fast ferry service. It {{is designed}} and built in the United States by Austal USA, {{a division of the}} world's largest fast-ferry builder, Australia-based shipbuilder Austal. The vessel is powered by environmentally clean MTU Friedrichshafen engines running on ultra-low sulfur diesel using waterjet propulsion which the company claimed will minimize impact to marine mammals. It was capable of transporting up to 866 passengers and 282 subcompact cars.|$|E

50|$|Several {{years ago}} Bedworth Kwik Save (a 1960s steel re-enforced {{concrete}} building with <b>drive-on</b> roof parking, {{known locally as}} the Hypermarket - the original name), was redeveloped into a new Aldi store. Located next to it is a Home Bargains store. Bedworth's Tesco which was a similar type of building to Kwik Save, but in a brick faced and arched windowed 1970s style, closed in January 2011 and was redeveloped into a steel framed Tesco Xtra store. Parking is at ground level, the store is on the first floor, with delivery access up a ramp to the first floor. It opened on 5 December 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The last {{conventional}} passenger ferry was [...] (...) , {{delivered in}} 1953 by Swan Hunter and powered by steam turbines giving {{a speed of}} 22 knots, making her the only ship which could complete three round voyages weekly, and she did so during the 1950s and 1960s. From 1953 the service continued regularly for 15 years with Leda and Venus operating the summer service with up to five sailings per week, and Leda operating a twice-weekly winter service. Both ships were limited by their lack of <b>drive-on</b> car transport facilities, and Venus was withdrawn and broken up in 1968. Leda continued until its withdrawal in 1974 after steep rises in fuel prices.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947 the {{institution}} was officially closed {{as a result}} of overcrowding, deteriorating health conditions and maintenance concerns with the [...] "Otter". The institution was then transferred to the newly established Eventide Home {{on the site of the}} former RAAF Station Sandgate. Dunwich was then opened up to government land sales and mining of mineral sand resources. From 1947 to 1957 a number of passenger ferries serviced both Dunwich and Amity Point from Brisbane, Redland Bay and Cleveland. The first <b>drive-on</b> drive-off ferry commenced operation in 1964 and ran from Cleveland to Dunwich using the beach as a ramp for loading and unloading. However, with further development and an increase in sand mining a deep water car ferry ramp was needed. Consequently, plans were made to reclaim land to the south east of the causeway providing a place for barge landing. Today this reclaimed land is the site of barge and water taxi landings servicing an ever increasing number of residents and visitors.|$|E
5000|$|The Oddfellows {{arrived on}} station 11 July 2007 to replace [...] This {{latest version of}} the Atlantic 85-class had been in {{development}} by the RNLI since 2004. This lifeboat {{at the time of}} its arrival in Sheringham was the most modern state-of-the-art inshore lifeboats in the RNLI fleet. the new lifeboat was funded by the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows, from which the lifeboat once again took her name. The organization also provided £68,000 for a new <b>drive-on,</b> drive-off launch and recovery carriage required for this larger boat. This new apparatus had a number of improved features such as illumination, and an enhanced hydraulic lifting device which, during rough seas, can be raised to an appropriate height enabling the boat to launch from the slipway at hightide without the bow being angled into the water. A wing-tank on either side of the trailer supplies each outboard engine with enough water to allow the engines to be started and warmed up on the slipway before launching.|$|E
50|$|The MB-4H {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover inshore lifeboats via a A85 DoDo (<b>drive-on,</b> drive-off) launch cradle/carriage. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2 m of calm water. The tractor is divided into two sections with the front section housing the power unit, hydraulic oil tank for the front axle, hydraulic pumps, cooling systems and the fuel tank. The rear section houses the rear axle, hydraulic winch with 100 meters of cable, the operator and his/her controls, batteries, electronic control panel, and the drive gear. The driver's seat within the cockpit can face forward or rear, with duplicated controls front and back, allowing the operator flexibility during deployment or retrieval of the DoDo trailer and payload. This allows the combination to drive to the launch site and then reverse round to launch the lifeboat into the sea. The rear-facing controls have the addition of a third foot pedal which is the dead-man control for the winch. The MB-4H has an automatic hydrostatic transmission which gives the tractor an ever-variable ground speed which corresponds to engine speed and ground/sea-bed conditions. To give the tractor excellent handling ability, the vehicle has a pivot steer type with all electrical, mechanical and hydraulic links passing through central wire-reinforced hose. The design allows the tractor to have a steering articulation of 40 degrees to the left or right and results in a turning circle of only ten metres.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the need for an inshore lifeboat to operate in the Wash would need to be considered. With the population's increased income and greater leisure time the use of this part of the coastline was on the increase. The RNLI proposed at a local meeting that an inshore lifeboat be placed at Hunstanton and that the station should begin operations once again. The local population and council agreed and the previous boathouse was acquired for use as the station once more.The RNLI provided a D class inflatable ILB for a one-year trial at the station, which if all went well, would be replaced with a new boat for the 1980 season. On 24 May a standard relief ILB D 181 was sent to the station. The Hunstanton lifeboat station was officially opened in June 1979 with D 181 performing its first service in July 1979, saving two people from a rubber dinghy. In April 1980 another D-class ILB D 126 was sent to the station. With the re-opening of the station being a resounding success the RNLI agreed that the station would be sent a new Atlantic-class 21 ILB together with a new <b>drive-on</b> drive-of trailer and a new Talus MB-4H amphibious tractor to launch the ILB. In December 1982 the stations new lifeboat arrived to replace the relief Atlantic 21. She was named Spirit of America (B 556) on 11 May 1983 by Vice Admiral Donald D. Engen, a retired US Navy Officer and {{the former president of the}} Association for Rescue at Sea (AFRAS).|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of an enhanced performance of vertical MOSFET is revealed by adopting the oblique rotating ion implantation (ORI) method combined with fillet oxidation (FILOX) technology. These CMOS compatible processes have formed the symmetrical self-aligned source/drain regions over the silicon pillar with sharp vertical channel profiles. Accordingly, an increased numbers of electrons in the channel with decreased channel length (L(g)) have shown to improved the threshold voltage, sub-threshold swing, <b>drive-on</b> current, leakage current, DIBL and drain saturation current significantly. The drain overlap capacitance is a factor of 0. 2 lower and the source overlap capacitance is a factor of 1. 5 lower than standard vertical MOSFETs...|$|E
40|$|A {{process of}} making a {{symmetrical}} self-aligned n-type vertical double-gate MOSFET (n-VDGM) over a silicon pillar is revealed. This process utilizes the technique of oblique rotating ion implantation (ORI). The self-aligned region forms a sharp vertical channel profile and decreases the channel length Lg. A tremendous improvement in the <b>drive-on</b> current is noted. The electron concentration profile obtained demonstrates an increased number of electrons in the channel injected from the source end as the drain voltage increases. The enhanced carrier concentration results in significant reduction in the off-state leakage current and improves the drain-induced barrier-lowering (DIBL) effect. These simulated characteristics when compared to those in a fabricated device without the ORI method show the distinct advantage of the technique reported for suppression of short-channel effects (SCE) in nanoscale vertical MOSFET...|$|E
