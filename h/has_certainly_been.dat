At Number 2123 is Mitchells Café and Take Away, which claims to be the oldest café in Leith; while this claim is unverified, the premises <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> operating in café format since at least 1924, when it opened its doors as an Italian ice cream parlour. Many long-time Leithers still refer to Mitchells as Lannys; so ingrained is the old ice cream cafe in their memories.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E

More than 569 people were involved in the post-production work, including 200 inkers and hand-painters, 85 of them from Taiwan's Cuckoo's Nest Studio.

"I cannot {{deny that}} I {{was in his}} hands, sire," [...] said Ormond, [...] "and <b>had</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> murdered by him, had he chosen to take my life on the spot, instead of destining me--I thank him for the honour--to be hanged at Tyburn. I <b>had</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> sped, if he had thought me worth knife or pistol, or {{anything}} short of the cord.--Look at him sire!

2500|$|Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) {{praised the}} novel in the 8 December 1961 issue of The Guardian: [...] "Mrs Agatha Christie is our nearest {{approach}} to perpetual motion. And {{not only does}} she never stop, but she drops {{the ball into the}} cup nearly every time; and if one is sometimes reminded of those automatic machines where one pulls a handle and out pops the finished product, that is a compliment to the automatic machine and not by any means a reflection on Mrs Christie. For the latest tug on the Christie handle produces a product which is not only up to the standard but even above it. The Pale Horse is in fact the best sample from this particular factory for some time, and that is saying plenty. The black magic theme is handled in a masterly and sinister fashion, and to give away what lay behind it would be unforgivable. This is a book which nobody (repeat, nobody) should miss." [...] Iles further named the novel as his favourite in the paper's Critic's choice {{for the end of the}} year, published one week later, writing that [...] "It has not been an outstanding year for crime fiction, but as usual there have been one or two first-class items. The best puzzle <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> Agatha Christie's The Pale Horse." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seems to}} me the time demands the forming of a new school of art based upon Protestant principles. For {{whatever}} vigor and originality there might once be in art, based on Romanism, it <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> worn threadbare by repetition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very intimately. She is {{our only}} neighbour; and her being here <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> a great comfort to me. It is sad not having some woman near one {{that one can}} speak to;--and then, I really do like her very much." ...|$|E
