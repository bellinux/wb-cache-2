25|$|Both {{wild and}} feral pigs are {{commonly}} hunted. Some breeds of pig, {{such as the}} Asian pot-bellied pig, are kept as pets. There are two instances in the 2000s where farm hogs ate human beings. The first was in 2004 in Romania, where a woman died after her ears, half of her face and <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> consumed; the other in 2012 in Oregon—whether the farmer was killed by his hogs or died of another cause before being consumed is unknown.|$|E
60|$|She leaned towards him. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> {{cold and}} her voice trembled.|$|E
60|$|She bent her fresh young {{face down}} to mine, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> in my hair.|$|E
60|$|His clasp upon <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> tightened. She turned towards him. Her {{expression}} was serious but delightful.|$|R

50|$|Gumnaam - The Mystery {{starts with}} an unknown lady (Mahima Chaudhary) driving in a rainy night, who is {{eventually}} murdered as she drives, and <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>is</b> cut off.|$|R
60|$|A frightful coldness {{appeared}} to seize her, and {{the tips of}} <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> strangely numbed.|$|E
60|$|The waiter {{bowed and}} hurried off. The woman played with her fan but <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> shaking.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> idle. An idea {{seemed to}} have {{occurred}} to her. She asked him a question.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} hand upon his. The touch of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> wonderful, cool and soft and somehow reassuring. He {{felt a sense}} of relaxation, felt the strain of living {{suddenly}} grow less.|$|R
60|$|Millicent {{staggered}} {{a little}} under the blow, which had been a heavy one, but her wits were clear, and, moving swiftly to a bell button, the pressure of <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> answered by a tinkle below.|$|R
50|$|In The Wiz, {{the shoes}} are silver high heels. This movie gives further {{insight into the}} shoe's magical protection. When Evillene (the witch of the west) tries to obtain them magically, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> bent painfully backwards.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth sat up presently, {{a little}} dazed. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> still {{gripping}} Philip's almost fiercely. The automobile had stopped.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} in her chair again. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> twisted together, her slim form was tense with stifled emotions.|$|E
60|$|But <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> {{deep into}} the honest pain-wrack of his calf, and in her he could observe no {{reluctance}} of fear.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> {{on the man}} {{who stood}} poised ready to jump. With an awful recoil, I drew back and {{suppressed}} a scream. It was {{on the tip of}} my tongue to cry out, [...] "Why, that's my father's murderer!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{glanced at}} him, {{and it was}} {{suddenly}} apparent for one instant of illumination that this ring upon <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> the crowning blunder of her life. It was apparent, and then it faded into the quality of an inevitable necessity.|$|R
60|$|He {{took a step}} forward. A sort {{of panic}} seized her. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> on the door-handle. She turned it, and the next moment was outside.|$|E
60|$|She stood {{upon the}} {{threshold}} and drank from the wineglass {{which he had}} filled. When she gave it back to him, he noticed that <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> steady.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas about candlelight when I awoke, and Dorothy {{was sitting}} alone beside me. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> resting upon my arm, and she greeted {{me with a}} smile all tenderness.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. Berenice {{seemed on}} the point of {{breaking}} down. She was nervously lacing and interlacing <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> <b>Her</b> breath <b>was</b> coming spasmodically.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} suddenly. The {{struggle}} {{in her face}} was ended, her expression transformed. <b>Her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> held up as though to bid him listen. With her other hand she clutched {{the back of the}} couch. Her eyes were fixed upon the door. The little patch of wonderful colour faded from her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|LUCREZIA. Poor darling! (She strokes his hair, twines its {{thick black}} tendrils round <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> ALBERTO <b>is</b> abjectly pathetic.) ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry was {{suddenly}} taken by storm. Philippa had thrown herself into his arms. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> locked around his neck. Her lips, her eyes, were pleading with him.|$|E
60|$|She had no knife, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> numb and weak, but {{she worked}} {{away with her}} teeth, while great welcome tears poured from her eyes, onto those poor, pinioned hands.|$|E
60|$|Then {{in silence}} Lenore dressed his wound, and if her heart did beat unwontedly, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> steady and deft. He thanked her, with moody eyes seeing far beyond her.|$|E
60|$|In her {{uncertainty}} as {{to which}} of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> she <b>was</b> not to budge, Flo nervously moved them all.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} 1970 issue's artwork {{featured the}} woman facing downward, and the [...] "Free Your Mind..." [...] title in brown. Reissues beginning in 1990 reversed the woman's direction (substituting an alternate photograph where {{her head is}} more inclined and <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> more widely fanned), and have varied the placement and color of text elements.|$|R
60|$|He was {{watching}} her very closely, for inwardly he had been wondering how she had taken his news. She was strangely agitated, so Maurice's troubled, jealous heart told him; her face was flushed, her eyes were wet and a tiny lace handkerchief which she twisted between <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> nothing but a damp rag.|$|R
6000|$|He {{threw himself}} on his knees, and <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> clasped among his thick curls, while his frame heaved with {{suppressed}} sobs, [...] "Oh, if he could only have come back to you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was losing}} my head a little, I think, for <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> {{gripping}} mine convulsively, warm and tender little fingers {{which seemed to}} be drawing me all the while closer to her.|$|E
60|$|She had her way in this, {{and drove}} {{nearly the entire}} afternoon. When he took the reins at last, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> cramped and swollen, but her face was deeply flushed with pleasure.|$|E
50|$|The play premiered at the 2006 Noosa Festival as Strings Under <b>Her</b> <b>Fingers.</b> It <b>was</b> {{subsequently}} reworked as Lotte's Gift.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer, {{but after}} a horrible moment or two had passed a half-seen arm and {{shoulder}} rose out of the flood, and the sudden drag on the bridle that slipped from <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> very reassuring. The horse plunged and floundered, and once more Hetty felt her dragging skirt was clear of the water.|$|R
