25|$|The curious {{personal}} {{character of}} La Fontaine, {{like that of}} some other men of letters, has been enshrined {{in a kind of}} legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it, including the anecdotes of his meeting his son, being told who he was, and remarking, Ah, yes, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him somewhere!, of his insisting on fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring him to visit at his house just as before; of his going into company with his stockings wrong side out, , with, for a contrast, those of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness in company.|$|E

500|$|Stoddart went, aged seventeen, {{to train}} in fine {{art at the}} Glasgow School of Art where he studied from 1976 to 1980. There he settled on {{sculpture}} and initially worked within the modernist idiom. Stoddart has recalled an epiphany moment several times: when, after finishing a riveted metal pop-art sculpture (praised by his tutors) he found a bust of the Apollo Belvedere, [...] "I thought my pop-riveted thing was rubbish by comparison. It's extraordinarily easy to pop-rivet two bits of metal together and extraordinarily difficult to make a figure like the Apollo, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to try." ...|$|E

500|$|Groza took 1960 off and {{did some}} {{scouting}} for the team. He also focused on an insurance business he started. [...] "I was 36 and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> retired", he said. The following year, however, {{he came back to}} the team at the urging of Art Modell, who bought the Browns that year. Not wanting to use a roster spot on a kicking specialist (Groza's back injury prevented him from playing on the line), Brown had signed Sam Baker to kick and play halfback. But Groza was eager to return and Modell insisted. Groza stayed with the team as a placekicker until 1967, and was on a Browns team that won the 1964 championship. Groza scored the first points in that game on a third-quarter field goal. He also kicked four kickoffs more than [...] and out of the Baltimore Colts end zone, preventing a return. Cleveland won 27–0.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on October 2, 1995, at CTS Studios in London. It took almost {{four months to}} record all the songs, which involved creating the music first and then the lyrics. Parker declared {{the first day of}} recording as [...] "Black Monday", and recalled it as a worrisome and nervous day. He said, [...] "All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were all very apprehensive." [...] The cast was also nervous; Banderas found the experience [...] "scary", while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done a terrible job", the singer recalled.|$|E
500|$|According to the singer, she {{was very}} nervous during {{the first day of}} recording. She {{allegedly}} found herself [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to doing the song; [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber [...] I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done a terrible job", she recalled. The final version recorded had much similarities to the original version by Covington, although had a much faster pace and was created as an orchestral pop to cater to the contemporary music scene. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, Madonna's version of the song is set in common time, with a slow groove tempo of 90 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals on the song span from G3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–F–C when Madonna sings [...] "It won't be easy, you'll think it strange", and changes to G7–C on the second verse.|$|E

500|$|Edwards {{signed for}} League One side Stevenage on 27 June 2011. He joined the club on a free transfer, rejecting a {{contract}} extension at Accrington. He signed a one-year deal with Stevenage, with the option of a second year. On joining the club he said [...] "I wasn't particularly looking for another club and I didn't {{have any interest in}} any other clubs at the time, so I thought I'd still be at Accrington next season. However, the manager got in touch with my agent and discussed the offer and when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the chance of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage". Edwards was assigned the number six shirt ahead of the 2011–12 season. He made his Stevenage debut {{on the first day of}} the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match in a 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. Edwards made 13 starting appearances for the club, as well as a further 14 appearances from the substitute's bench, during the first half of the club's first ever League One campaign.|$|E
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who {{has shot}} {{all of the}} director's films since 1993's Schindler's List, {{reviewed}} the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe's style. [...] "I didn’t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century", Spielberg explained. [...] "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, and I had to approximate this younger director's look that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> moved away from after almost two decades." [...] Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for Superman Returns. Spielberg {{did not want to}} fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted. Lucas felt [...] "it looks like it was shot three years after Last Crusade. The people, the look of it, everything. You’d never know there was 20 years between shooting." [...] Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.|$|E

500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of [...] the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience [...] "scary" [...] while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done a terrible job", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; [...] "On film, it's different than being on stage because the person on the screen in front of you is never farther than someone on the pillow in bed next to you". Parker declared the first day of recording as [...] "Black Monday", since it was [...] "filled with trepidation and nerves... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were very apprehensive".|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a unique take on it." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be quickest.
