40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{relation}} between dividend policies and financial performances of the companies operating in Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST). The study uses data of 172 companies outside of financial sector for the period of 2008 - 2011. In the study firms are divided into two groups: the ones regularly paying dividends and the ones that don’t make regular dividend payments. The tests were conducted in order to understand whether there is a difference between accounting and market based financial performances of these two groups or not. Empirical analyses used multiple regression, T test methods as well as descriptive statistics. The results of analysis showed that dividend payments had influence on companies ’ performances. Furthermore, there was a positive and statistically meaningful relation between the dividend per share rate (DPS) within groups and market based performance indicator Tobin’s q while there was a statistically meaningless relation between accounting based performance indicators ROA and ROE and dividend per share rate. These results are of supporting quality for the <b>dividend</b> <b>relation</b> developed by Myron Gordon and John Lintner (GL) ...|$|E
40|$|Relational division, {{also known}} as small divide, is a derived {{operator}} of the relational algebra that realizes a many-to-one set containment test, where a set is represented {{as a group of}} tuples: Small divide discovers which sets in a <b>dividend</b> <b>relation</b> contain all elements of the set stored in a divisor relation. The great divide operator extends small divide by realizing many-to-many set containment tests. It is also similar to the set containment join operator for schemas that are not in first normal form. Neither small nor great divide has been implemented in commercial relational database systems although the operators solve important problems and many efficient algorithms for them exist. We present algebraic laws that allow rewriting expressions containing small or great divide, illustrate their importance for query optimization, and discuss the use of great divide for frequent itemset discovery, an important data mining primitive. A recent theoretic result shows that small divide must be implemented by special purpose algorithms and not be simulated by pure relational algebra expressions to achieve efficiency. Consequently, an efficient implementation requires that the optimizer treats small divide as a first-class operator and possesses powerful algebraic laws for query rewriting. ...|$|E

40|$|Dividend pricing/present value models relate current {{stock prices}} to {{expectations}} of future dividends. In {{this study we}} apply the West and Campbell-Shiller tests of the <b>dividend</b> pricing <b>relation</b> to an index of {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs). REITs provide a unique test of these models since, during our study period, REITs were mandated to pay out at least 95 % of taxable income as dividends. While our results complement previous research which finds that the dividend pricing model cannot be rejected if share repurchase is included as part of dividends, our data contain a much less significant amount of share repurchase, so that our approach to the issue of the viability of dividend pricing models offers an alternative insight. Our research suggests that, for our REIT population, dividend pricing models cannot be rejected. Copyright 2003 by the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} conceded that dividend pricing models are poor predictors of asset prices. This finding is sometimes attributed to excess volatility or to a dividend process manipulated by firm managers. In this paper, we present rather powerful panel {{tests of the}} <b>dividend</b> pricing <b>relation</b> using a unique data set in which dividends are set by market forces independent of managers' preferences. We rely on observations {{on the market for}} condominium dwellings in Korea-perhaps the only market in which information on dividends and prices is publicly and continuously available to consumers and investors. We extend the "dividend-price ratio model" to panels of housing returns and rents differentiated by type and location. We find broad support for the dividend pricing model during periods {{both before and after the}} Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 - 1998, suggesting that the market for housing assets in Korea has been remarkably efficient...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the double taxation system prevailing in the U. S., Australian firms operate under an imputation environment with respect to dividend payments. We argue that the dividend imputation tax system increases the signalling potential of dividend reductions and our findings support this view. We find that abnormal changes in profitability are negative in the year following dividend reductions and are negatively related to the <b>dividend</b> reduction. The <b>relation</b> is statistically significantly stronger for franked dividends. Overall, our study shows conclusively that dividend reductions in Australia constitute a strong signal regarding the future prospects of the firm and, as such, our results are at variance with the results obtained in the U.

40|$|The {{majority}} of managers set themselves some long-term coefficient-objective for {{the distribution of}} <b>dividends</b> in <b>relation</b> to the profits of the period (target payout ratio). But they do not mechanically apply this ratio to each year?s profits {{as they try to}} avoid brusque fluctuations which could provoke movements in investors? positions in imperfect markets. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to verify whether the dividend distribution policy of a company depends not only on profit but also on other factors, amongst which the both the theoretical and empirical literature point to the following: the profitability of the company, the stability of its earnings, its rate of growth and opportunities for investment and its financial and governing structure, highlighting the institutional aspects of the financial systems of the countries in which banks operate. The results obtained in the empirical test allow us to affirm that the policy of payouts does not depend solely on business profits. We observe that the economic and financial factors proposed by the theories mentioned, along with institutional factors, in practice determine the dividends of companies according to the structure of government which exists within organisations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{dividend}} performance of eight UAE based banks between the years 2001 and 2005. The analysis was undertaken by examining three sets of financial ratios that are routinely used to measure bank dividend performance. The main ratios that were employed put a particular focus on the banks’ ability to pay <b>dividends</b> in <b>relation</b> to market value of its share, earnings and ability to cover the payments. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to rank the performance, measuring the dispersion and the stability-variability of the indicators. Conclusions were then drawn from the computation of the descriptive analysis of ratios that allowed the author to make an effective comparison of said banks. This type of analysis was used to summarize the performance of each bank based on three criteria, mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of each banks performance. The findings showed that eight banks performed reasonably well during the period studied, but have different strategies in paying their dividends across the years under study. The analysis reveals that these banks have been affected by both internal and external factors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} cash {{dividend}} policy of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong {{and on the}} Mainland. It shows that, in both groups, firms that have higher managerial membership on the board tend to pay lower cash <b>dividends.</b> The <b>relation</b> is stronger in Mainland-listed firms, indicating that managers' influence on the board creates more serious agency problems. This study further shows that ownership concentration of Mainland-listed firms tends to weaken the association between managerial membership {{on the board and}} lower cash dividends, suggesting that concentrated ownership in the Mainland reduces the agency cost. Finally, this study shows that there is a price premium attaching to dividend payout of HK-listed Chinese firms, but there is no such premium in the Mainland market. Further, the same dividend premium is also observed in local firms listed in Hong Kong. Taken together, this study indicates that the pricing mechanism of Hong Kong's equity market appears to encourage managers of HK-listed firms to pay dividends. The same mechanism is not found to exist in the Mainland market. This difference helps to explain the finding that the controlling shareholders of HK-listed firms take a less active role in dividend policy than those of their peers on the Mainland. Thus, Hong Kong's equity market seems to provide a mechanism that can be used by Chinese firms listed there. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper employs {{heterogeneity}} in {{institutional shareholder}} tax characteristics {{to identify the}} relation between firm payout policy and tax incentives. Analysis of a panel of firms matched with the tax characteristics of the clients of their institutional shareholders indicates that "dividend-averse" institutions are {{significantly less likely to}} hold shares in firms with larger <b>dividend</b> payouts. This <b>relation</b> between the tax preferences of institutional shareholders and firm payout policy may reflect dividend-averse institutions gravitating towards low dividend paying firms or managers adapting their payout policies to the interests of their institutional shareholders. Evidence is provided that both effects are operative. Plausibly exogenous changes in payout policy result in shifting institutional ownership patterns. Similarly, exogenous changes in the tax cost of institutional investors receiving dividends results in changes in firm dividend policy.

40|$|M. Com. (Financial Management) Abstract: Share {{prices and}} {{dividends}} were considered as {{important factors in}} creating and increasing shareholders’ wealth. In some theories it was indicated {{that the existence of}} a relationship between share prices and dividends could be questioned. More important for companies and investors was the determination of a relationship between share price volatility and dividends. If such a relationship existed, companies could structure their dividend policy decisions to attain minimum share price volatility in order to attract maximum investor interest. This was especially important to small and medium-sized companies finding themselves in the early growth phase. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether a relationship existed between share price volatility and dividend policy for companies listed on the Alternative Exchange (AltX) on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited (JSE Ltd). Dividend policy was measured through dividend yield and the dividend pay-out ratio. Share price volatility was regressed against dividend yield and the dividend pay-out ratio using panel data regression analysis to achieve this aim. Share price volatility was found to have a statistically significant and negative relationship with dividend yield, and a statistically insignificant relationship with the dividend pay-out ratio. The results indicated that a company could possibly reduce the share price volatility by using the dividend policy by declaring dividends, although the amount of <b>dividends</b> in <b>relation</b> to earnings were of little importance to investors of small to medium-sized companies. The results of this study therefore provided information that such companies could use to structure their dividend policy in such a way that share price volatility risk would be minimised, which in turn would promote optimum growth for investors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} aggregate dividend payments and maiket capitalization as related to the firm's dividend decision. Most previous work concentrates on the US; we extend these studies to the different institutional framework represented by West Germany, France, the UK, and Switzerland. The observation that managers smooth <b>dividend</b> changes in <b>relation</b> to changes in permanent earnings (MARSH/MERTON [1987]) seems also to be true for European countries. The hypothesis of a long-run target payout ratio is tested by estimating cointegrated processes. Integration of the same order for both series is {{a necessary condition for}} this hypothesis to hold. We use a recent test strategy proposed by PERRON [1988] to test for a unit root in the time series. There is evidence for non-stationary nominal and real logarithmic capitalization as well as real log dividend series, whereas the logarithm of nominal dividends is stationary. Cointegration is therefore tested only for real magnitudes. On the 5 % percent significance level non-cointegration can be rejected only for the UK. This finding casts doubt on the validity of earlier tests derived from specific error correction formulations, such as the MARSH/MERTON [1987] dividend model. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} capital structure in the MENA coun- tries. The main interest is to investigate both financial firms specially banks and non-financial firms. This study test the main theories of capital structure, namely: trade off theory and pecking order theory. The countries included in this thesis are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (Include both Abo-Dhabi and Dubai stock indexes), Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine and Jor- dan. The characteristics it covers as suggested by previous literature are tangibility, profitability, risk, debt tax shield, growth, dividends,size, cash flow and liquidity. It will also investigate {{the effect of the}} industry, credit rating and ownership structure on the capital structure This study also investigates the determinants of capital structure in Islamic and conventional banks. This {{is one of the first}} attempts to empirically examine the determinants of capital structure in Islamic and conventional banks in general and in MENA countries in particular. This study fills the gap in this important area of research and can provide a base for future research on capital structure in Islamic banks. This thesis use different models to test the capital structure and these are Panel data models (OLS, Fixed, and Random); Tobit and Dynamical model (Arellano-Bover Blundell-Bond), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Generalised Regression Neural Networks (GRNN). The results suggest that the three methods used in this study lead to similar re- sults with a few exceptions in some countries. This thesis finds that the relation between leverage and the determinants of capital structure is different when using the market or the book leverage. It also finds that the determinants of capital struc- ture between the MENA countries are different. For example, profitability attribute relation with leverage follow the trade-off theory in some countries and follow the picking order theory in other countries. Also, liquidity is significant in all the countries in the sample and have a negative relation to leverage. In addition, tangibility is found to have a mixed results with some countries following the trade-off theory and other countries which follow the trade-off theory but overall it is a key determinant of capital structure. Additionally, the findings show that although that the majority of firms in the MENA countries don’t pay <b>dividends</b> the <b>relation</b> between the long term debt and leverage is negative in all the countries in the sample. The growth opportunities have a negative relation in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Palestine, Qatar and Tunisia but positive in rest of the countries. The cash flow attribute have a negative relation with leverage in all the countries in the sample except Saudi Arabia and Qatar when using the short and long term debt. Furthermore, the ownership variable is expected to have a negative relation when the ultimate owner is an institution. The results show that overall when there is an ultimate owner the leverage will have a negative relation. Suggesting that ultimate owners will force managers to keep a low debt in firms capital structure. This PhD also attempt to investigate the capital structure in banks within the MENA countries. A special focus is on the differences between the Islamic banks and conventional banks capital structure. First, the findings show that the banks follow the same determinants of capital structure as non-financial firms and that regulations are not the main determinant of capital structure in banks. Then, This study show that there is a difference in capital structure of Islamic banks in com- parison with conventional banks. The findings for the dividends variable show that Islamic banks do not follow the pecking order theory but conventional banks don’t. The results of the size variable show that when Islamic banks are large they use less debt in their capital structure. Growth variable show mixed results depending on the use of book or market leverage. Ownership structure show that when there is an ultimate owner leverage increase which is the reverse of the relation in the non-financial firms. The age variable is negative in relation to the book leverage and positive with the market leverage. Also, credit rating relation is different between the two banks, as it is positive with the conventional banks and negative with Islamic banks. Therefore, this study conclude that the main capital structure theories are applicable to MENA countries. Also indicate that Islamic banks have a different capital structure to conventional banks.
