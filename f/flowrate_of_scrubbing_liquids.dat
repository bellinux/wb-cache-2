40|$|Toluene, an {{important}} {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC), is used in many kinds of industries, such as painting, printing, coating, and petrochemical industries. The emission of toluene causes serious air pollution, odor problem, flammability problem and affects human health. This paper proposes the removal of toluene from waste air using a spray wet scrubber combining the absorption and oxidation reaction. Aqueous sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution {{was used as the}} <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> in the system. NaOCl, the strongest oxidative agent, presents an effective toluene removal. As the scrubbed toluene is reacted, recirculation <b>of</b> the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> could be operated with a constant removal efficiency throughout the operting time. The investigated variables affecting the removal efficiency were air flow rate, inlet toluene concentration, NaOCl concentration, <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> flow rate and size of spray nozzle. Influence <b>of</b> the <b>scrubbing</b> parameters was experimentally studied to develop a mathematical model of the toluene removal efficiency. The removal model reveals that the increase <b>of</b> <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> flow rate, toluene concentration, and NaOCl concentration together with the decrease of air flow rate and size of spray nozzle can increase the toluene removal efficiency. Optimization problem with an objective function and constraints was set to provide the maximum toluene removal efficiency and solved by Matlab optimization toolbox. The optimization constraints were formed from the mathematical model and process limitation. The solution of the optimization was an air flow rate of 100 m 3 /h, toluene concentration of 1500 ppm, NaOCl concentration of 0. 02 mol/l, NaOCl solution feed rate of 0. 8 m 3 /h, and spray nozzle size of 0. 5 mm.

40|$|A wet {{scrubber}} is a device used in underground coal mines for the exhaust treatment system of various internal combustion engines (generally diesel) {{primarily as a}} spark arrestor with a secondary function to remove pollutants from the exhaust gas. A pool <b>of</b> <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> (generally water based) is {{used in conjunction with}} a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Scrubbers are widely used in underground applications of diesel engines as their exhaust contains high concentration of harmful diesel particulate matter (DPM) and other pollutant gases. Currently the DPFs have to be replaced frequently because moisture output from the {{wet scrubber}} blocks the filter media and causes reduced capacity. This paper presents experimental and theoretical studies on the heat and mass transfer mechanisms of the exhaust flow both under and above the water surface, aiming at finding the cause and effects of the moisture reaching the filters and employing a solution to reduce the humidity and DPM output, and to prolong the change-out period of the DPF. By assuming a steady flow condition, heat transfer from the inlet exhaust gas balances energy required for the water evaporation. Hence the exit humidity will decrease with the increase of exit temperature. Experiments on a real scrubber are underway...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecently, the {{development}} of a high voidage contactor, named Aquilair Plus™, has demonstrated high efficiency for chemical <b>scrubbing</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen sulphide. <b>Liquid</b> and gas phases flow at co-current and high velocity, leading to a great dispersion of the liquid and then to an enhancement of the mass transfer rate by comparison with classical packed towers. This study focused on the results which obtained at semi-industrial scale with the Aquilair PlusTM process on a waste water treatment plant located in France. The <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> consisted <b>of</b> a sodium hypochlorite alkaline solution. At once, pressure drop, H 2 S removal and reagents consumption were followed.

40|$|Thiopaq {{biotechnology}} for partial sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur is {{an efficient}} way to remove H 2 S from biogases. However, its application for high-pressure natural gas desulfurization needs upgrading. Particularly, an increase in alkalinity <b>of</b> the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquid</b> is required. Therefore, the feasibility of sulfide oxidation into elemental sulfur under oxygen limitation was tested at extremely haloalkaline conditions in lab-scale bioreactors using mix sediments from hypersaline soda lakes as inoculum. The microbiological analysis, both culture dependent and independent, of the successfully operating bioreactors revealed a domination of obligately chemolithoautotrophic and extremely haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Two subgroups were recognized among the isolates. The subgroup enriched from the reactors operating at pH 10 clustered with Thioalkalivibrio jannaschii¿Thioalkalivibrio versutus core group of the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Another subgroup, obtained mostly with sulfide as substrate and at lower pH, belonged to the cluster of facultatively alkaliphilic Thioalkalivibrio halophilus. Overall, the results clearly indicate a large potential of the genus Thiolalkalivibrio to efficiently oxidize sulfide at extremely haloalkaline conditions, which makes it suitable for application in the natural gas desulfurization...|$|R

40|$|Investigations on the {{thermodynamics}} and kinetics of {{the absorption}} of volatile compounds in high boiling scrubbing agents {{have been carried out}} in a previous PEF-project. Within this project it was shown that besides glycol ethers other compounds may be used as scrubbing agents. These novel agents could open new fields of application for absorption/desorption processes in waste gas purification. Based on this work, the new <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquids</b> are evaluated in the present study by means of simulation programs for absorption/desorption processes which enable the selection <b>of</b> suitable <b>scrubbing</b> <b>liquids</b> for economic operation. The following high boiling liquids have been studied: Tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEG), polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether 250 (P 250) and 500 (P 500), polyethylene glycol dibutyl ether (PDBE), adipic acid bis- 2 -ethylhexylester (ASE), phtalic acid bis- 2 -ethylhexylester (PSE), maleic acid dibutylester (MDB), phtalic acid dibutylester (PDB), dimethylpolysiloxane (DMPS), 2 -ethyl hexanoic acid (EHS), propylene carbonate (PC) and N-methylpyrrolidon (NMP). The simulation results for {{the absorption of}} dichloromethane show that the process works with the best profitability with ASE, PC and all the glycol ethers except P 500. For all other compounds, the operating costs for steam and cooling water are much higher. If the washing agent is hygroscopic, water (air humidity) can be absorbed too. Therefore, the influence of water on the absorption capacity of the washing agent has been investigated. The activity coefficients of several organic compounds in TEG in the presence of water have been measured and the results show that the influence of water can be neglected. (orig.)

40|$|The {{gravity flow}} of bulk solids from mass flow bins and hoppers {{is a subject}} of {{considerable}} practical and theoretical interest Many published papers have brought greater understanding <b>of</b> the <b>flowrate</b> <b>of</b> coarse particles. Research on finer materials was insufficient due to imprecise predictions of the air pressure gradient at the hopper outlet, {{which is a very}} important factor in predicting the <b>flowrate</b> <b>of</b> the fine particles. The work in this thesis develops theoretical models for predicting the interstitial air pressure gradient and for predicting the <b>flowrate</b> <b>of</b> bulk solids from conical mass flow bins. The theoretical models are based on the continuum mechanics theory. The boundary conditions follow air pressure and bulk density continuity in a vertical direction. A close agreement between theoretical results and experimental results was obtained for predicting both flowrate and air pressure distribution. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the <b>flowrate</b> <b>of</b> free flowing bulk solids increases rapidly at first and then more gradually as the particle permeability constant increases. The use of 2 ̆ 7 permeability 2 ̆ 7 enables the theories developed to be applied in describing the flow behaviour of both coarse and fine particle mixtures as well as composite particle size-distributed bulk solids. The use of consolidation-related bulk density and permeability enables the theoretical models to be applied to both compressible and incompressible materials. Results of both theoretical and experimental work on the effect of material surcharge level on the flowrate indicate that for fine materials this effect is significant. Based on the original theoretical model, simplified expressions for predicting the dynamic deaeration coefficient Kdea and a simplified flowrate model are presented.
