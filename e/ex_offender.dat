40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{recognition}} of the intersectional relationship between homelessness and incarceration, we have a limited knowledge about housing policy and practice for people leaving custody and (<b>ex)</b> <b>offender</b> groups in the community. Addressing these gaps, this paper {{provides an overview of}} the main local housing authority statutory duties in the provision of housing support for prison leavers and (ex) offenders in England and Wales, and situates the issues with accessing accommodation within the wider context of austerity. The paper presents a case study that explores criminal justice practitioners’ experiences of working with local authority housing agencies. Stemming from 25 interviews with housing practitioners and criminal justice practitioners, the paper outlines the main challenges facing criminal justice agencies as they try to secure accommodation for homeless (ex) offenders and resettle them in the community. Finally, the paper concludes by raising critical questions about the housing options for this population, now and in the future...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} {{contribution}} made by housing-related third sector organisations (TSOs) in assisting ex-prisoners to find housing, and the barriers they face in doing so. Design/methodology/approach – An offender survey was used to measure awareness of and engagement with TSOs in eight prisons, alongside qualitative interviews with prisoners, criminal justice staff and TSO representatives. Findings – Despite the involvement of TSOs, securing accommodation for ex-prisoners remains complex and difficult, largely due to high service demand, housing shortages, budget cuts, and needs assessment and allocations systems which reduce the responsiveness of housing providers to the reducing re-offending agenda. Research limitations/implications – The research benefited from a mixed-method approach which captured the perceptions of service users and professionals. The response rate for the offender survey was low (12 per cent), and the survey findings should be treated with caution. Practical implications – Local authorities and other housing providers need to be more willing to accept ex-prisoners as potential service users, and better links need to be made between local homelessness strategies, choice based lettings systems and prisoner resettlement programmes. Providing support services to ex-offenders may encourage such acceptance and help to maintain the motivation to desist from crime. Originality/value – Previous research has paid little specific attention to the role of TSOs in (<b>ex)</b> <b>offender</b> housing. This paper addresses this omission by drawing on original empirical research to examine the value of their work in securing accommodation for ex-prisoners and helping to reduce re-offending...|$|E

The research explores interviewees' lives, their offending and the changes in their circumstances over the years of the project. In doing so it provides a comprehensive picture of a group of offenders, contributing to the desistance literature in several important ways, touching upon several themes including the links between victimisation and desistance from crime, citizenship among <b>offenders</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>offenders</b> and the long term impacts of probation supervision...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{study is}} aimed at exploring, {{describing}} and understanding the experiences and perceptions of male ex-offenders with regards to their participation in skills development and/or training programmes. Methods: The research methodology utilised was positioned in the qualitative research paradigm, specifically using the tradition of phenomenology. To gather data from the participants, focus groups and face to face interviews were conducted, consisting of broad questions followed by probes to gain an in-depth description of participants’ experiences and perceptions. Participants: Five males who were classified as being <b>ex</b> <b>offenders</b> and one female (key informant) participated in the study. Results: Four themes emerged that reflected the vocational experience of ex offenders: 1) A sense of distrust, 2) A sense of support: Giving {{back to the community}} through learning and doing, 3) Working towards change through capacity building. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that occupational therapy practitioners as well as correctional service personnel should identify and eliminate the barriers that impacts on return to work intervention programmes. Professionals working with offenders and ex-offenders should incorporate the enablers identified in this study when designing return to work programmes. Web of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|The nonprofit {{sector is}} {{increasingly}} engaged in social enterprise, which involves a combination and balancing of social mission and business goals {{which can cause}} mission drift or mission tension. A work integrated social enterprise (WISE) is {{a specific type of}} social enterprise that focuses on integrating hard-to-employ individuals, such as <b>ex</b> <b>offenders,</b> back into the workforce, usually through producing goods or offering services. Little is known about how WISE organizations manage mission drift, particularly given the unique characteristics of this type of organization. Using institutional values theory and resource dependence theory as the foundation, the purpose of this case study was to explore how a WISE in Indiana experience and manage mission drift and mission tension. Data were collected from semistructured interviews with 4 board members and 4 staff persons, and from organizational documents. All data were inductively coded and subjected to a constant, comparative analysis between empirical and predictive themes. The study revealed the organization has not experienced mission drift or mission tension because, (a) there was a strong mission and a commitment by the board and staff to the mission, (b) there was a constant balancing act between mission and income, (c) business goals aligned with mission, and (d) operating systems were in place for mission sustainability. The positive social change implications stemming from this study include providing beneficial information about best practices and strategies to other organizations seeking to develop WISE programs that provide opportunities and training for difficult to employ populations...|$|R
40|$|Desistance {{research}} {{emphasizes that}} offenders identify a future self that aids desistance efforts. However, {{it is unclear}} how future selves operate when offending opportunities arise. To explore this we employ qualitative accounts of instances when offende rs and <b>ex</b> - <b>offenders</b> abstained from offending, and the emotions this evoked. Offending was avoided to preserve aspects of offenders’ lives or avoid negative consequences but, for some, avoiding offending brought frustration. Finally, those who had made the most progress towards desistance were less likely to identify opportunities for offending. These findings suggest future selves inform the desistance process, highlighting particular ways to be. However, time is needed to build up valued aspects of the lif e that may be feared lost if engaging in crime. Before the benefits of abstaining are recognized, there may be a tension between the future and current self...|$|R
40|$|In the United States between 1991 and 2001, {{there was}} an {{increase}} of over 848 % in new AIDS cases in African American women fifty and older. This increase {{is due in part to}} changes in reporting. Because of the startling statistics and scarcity of studies in this population, this study examines the HIV prevention needs of two groups of African American women over fifty, injection drug users and non injection drug users. Focus groups were used to collect data on general HIV knowledge, experience with HIV prevention, psychosocial factors, drug involvement, and risks and barriers to HIV infection and prevention. Data was also collected through a survey that gathered information on demographics, sources of HIV information, HIV testing and risks including knowledge of risk, belief of risk and risk behaviors. This study found that lack of education and misconceptions regarding disease transmission act as a barrier for prevention efforts; a need for inclusive HIV prevention efforts such as multi-generational in-home programs, multi-family programs and the incorporation of prevention messages with existing health services; a need for skills building, condom negotiation skills and self-empowerment. Effective methods suggested were techniques that align with African American culture and heritage such as storytelling, inclusion of family and community. In order to generalize findings from this study, future research must include a representative sample of African American women 50 years and older such as churchgoers, sorority women, health conscious women, <b>ex</b> <b>offenders,</b> past injection drug users, infected or affected women and newly single women. The findings of this study are significant to public health research because they add to a growing body of knowledge regarding the HIV prevention needs of this group, can be used to design prevention messages for the population from which they were gathered, and most importantly provide insight to what a subpopulation of this group views as effective prevention methods. Recommendations for future research are also provided for federal government agencies, state public health agencies, community organizations, the family structure, HIV service groups, physicians, universities and researchers...|$|R

The full field work report and other project outputs are available at: [URL] increase in travel opportunities coupled with open borders {{across much of the}} European Union has resulted in increased capacity for serious violent or sexual offenders to travel or migrate to other Member States within the EU. In some instances this results in (<b>ex)</b> <b>offenders</b> living and working in Member States with less monitoring, regulation or supervision than they would experience in their home Member State; and in some cases without any tracking or information exchange about their known criminality. In 2013 an EU funded project reviewed current information exchange systems within the EU, and the challenges and issues faced by law enforcement and probation service personnel when seeking to work collaboratively with other EU Member States to manage the risk posed by this small number of high risk offenders. This article reviews the key issues from that research, and most notably the differences in perceptions of privacy, data protection restrictions on information exchange, rights to free movement post sentence, and a range of legal and ethical constraints upon the choices and actions of law enforcement and probation personnel. Underlying ideological and philosophical differences, particularly across Probation practice, can be discerned focused on the relative weight that risk, desistance or rehabilitation should play in response to these offenders. This article examines the implications of these differences for the effective management of serious violent or sexual offenders who are mobile across the EU community...|$|R
40|$|This {{assignment}} {{focuses on}} the foot tagging, which {{is a relatively new}} phenomenon in the use of punishment. Foot tagging was introduced in Denmark in 2005, which makes it possible to reverse some prison sentences into doing the time at home, with an electronic foot tagging. Foot tagging is in general seen as a mild punishment, relative to prison, and there are many indications that foot tagging works rehabilitating. But what kind of suffering, does this sentence implie? Our analysis aims to uncover the offenders experience with foot tagging as punishment in practice. Based on interviews and other empirical data regarding. The offenders experiences, we analyze where and how, respectively, the gentle, suffering and rehabilitating elements in the foot tagging is located. For the analysis, we have made use of the theories of Michel Foucault, and Nils Christie's theory of the punitive values constant. The conclusions are in a very condensed version; that the punitive value is subjective and depends on <b>ex.</b> the <b>offender's</b> age, housing and social conditions. It consists of rehabilitating a schematization and disciplining the offender and his/hers everyday life, as some get used to the way...|$|R
40|$|The Women In Progress Program at New Directions For Women Inc. is an {{information}} and skills building {{program that is}} focused on life management issues and skills {{for women who are}} <b>ex</b> - <b>offenders</b> and recovering from drug addiction. Before these women can sustain themselves economically there must be a bridge to lead them to a point where they can realize that they have talents and the ability to become self sustainable. The program consist of twelve hours of workshops presented each week for one hour. This format is offered to all of the residents at New Directions For Women Inc. which is a transitional housing shelter for women, upon their release from prison. It was created and designed by the women, based on their own needs. The workshops are facilitated by a qualified training instructor. They stress an open interactive learning model that encourages questions, concerns and skills of the participants to shape and enrich the learning process. The facilitator encourages the group to claim ownership of the decision making process and the short and long term goals they want to pursue. A blend of lecture, role plays and personal exchanges to keep the group motivated and focused on the topic is also incorporated in the workshops. The goal is to empower the participants with confidence and the ability to become self sustainable. As the women progressed in their recovery they discovered that they have talents, can accomplish goals and be productive individuals, capable of sustaining themselves emotionally and economically. This conclusion was made evident when the women created nutritional recipes which were designed into a calendar for sale. The proceeds from the calendar are used to start an emergency fund for the women. Some of the women have found employment as mentors for the new women coming into the shelter. Others have completed their high school degrees and enrolled in job skill programs or college. One participant was hired as the head chef of New Directions For Women Inc. The most rewarding aspect of this project is that it {{will continue to be a}} part of New Directions For Women Inc., and the women developed the entire program themselves.
