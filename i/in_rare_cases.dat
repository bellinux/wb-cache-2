5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> {{where none}} of the oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> very <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> {{malignant}} (cancerous) growths, leiomyosarcoma, of the myometrium can develop. <b>In</b> extremely <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> uterine fibroids {{may present}} as part or early {{symptom of the}} hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome.|$|R
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases.</b> Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with a silky luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} ways in which Morning Glory clouds form, {{especially}} <b>in</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> {{other parts of the}} world, but these are far less understood.|$|R
25|$|In humans : gastroenteritis, {{urinary tract}} infections, and {{neonatal}} meningitis. <b>In</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases,</b> virulent strains are {{also responsible for}} hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicaemia and gram-negative pneumonia.|$|R
5000|$|In art history, speech scroll (also {{called a}} {{banderole}} or phylactery) [...] is an illustrative device denoting speech, song, or, <b>in</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases,</b> {{other types of}} sound.|$|R
5|$|Proposed {{mechanisms}} for {{the recognition of}} worker-laid eggs or active reproductive workers include marker hydrocarbons {{on the surface of}} queen-laid eggs, cuticle hydrocarbons on reproductive workers, and recognition of nest-mates. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> worker-laid eggs carry mimicked queen hydrocarbons and escape policing, a condition known as the anarchic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases,</b> Schluckbildchen {{were used}} as letters of {{protection}} or as religious amulets common at that time (e.g. Wettersegen or Breverl). Furthermore, they {{were used as}} decorations for gingerbread and other pastries.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases,</b> {{the word}} is {{replaced}} entirely (Deuteronomy 28:27, 30; Samuel I 5:6) for reasons of tohorat halashon, [...] "purity of language." [...] This type of qere is noted in a printed Hebrew Bible.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> very <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> {{ibuprofen}} {{can cause}} aseptic meningitis.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E

5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to rule out delirium).|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
50|$|In Italy, France, Spain and Portugal it's normal {{entering}} in a {{home with}} shoes, and they're removed only <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> like a wooden floor. The Italian autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia is an exception, and this tradition is quite respected.|$|R
50|$|Patients mostly {{present with}} a hard lump in one breast without any sign of a {{systemic}} disease. Other possible symptoms include nipple retraction, pain, inflammation of the overlying skin, nipple discharge, fistula, enlarged lymph nodes, <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> peau d'orange-like changes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{audio format}} used in {{conjunction}} with Windows Media Video is typically some version of Windows Media Audio, or <b>in</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases,</b> the deprecated Sipro ACELP.net audio format. Microsoft recommends that ASF files containing non-Windows Media formats use the generic [...]ASF file extension.|$|R
5|$|When present, {{the thyroid}} ima's chief supply is the thyroid gland, though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. The artery may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed artery, {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). The artery ends by supplying the thyroid gland, or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. The artery is also found to be the only supply of the parathyroid gland <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{was home}} to 2,117,361 Palestinians in 2015, most of them Jordanian citizens. The first wave of Palestinian {{refugees}} arrived during the 1948 Arab Israeli war and peaked in the 1967 Six Day War and the 1990 Gulf War. In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently Jordanian citizenship is given only <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> <b>cases.</b> 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps. Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan. West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested.|$|E
5000|$|Clostridium sordellii {{can cause}} a fatal {{infection}} <b>in</b> exceptionally <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> after medical abortions.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> very <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> cerebritis {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>cases</b> such as situs ambiguus or heterotaxy, situs {{cannot be}} determined. In these patients, the liver may be midline, the spleen absent or multiple, and the bowel malrotated. Often, {{structures}} are duplicated or absent altogether. This {{is more likely}} to cause medical problems than situs inversus totalis.|$|R
