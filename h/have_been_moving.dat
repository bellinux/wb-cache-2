25|$|The {{most recent}} {{statistics}} show {{a decrease in}} the population of the city, to 205,934 in the middle of 2009. This is mainly because quite a large number of citizens <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> to nearby communities, adjacent to the formal administrative area of Toruń, but still outside it. As a result, Toruń is surrounded by a belt of densely populated settlements, whose inhabitants work, shop and entertain in the city proper, but do not officially live there.|$|E

The south and west of the region have historically had industrial based economies, although they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> away from this in recent decades. Huddersfield, for example, has been developing in the creative industries sector.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent years}} many {{migrants}} {{from other parts}} of the People's Republic of China <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> into Lhasa and now own many of the city's small businesses. According to the Tibetan Independence Movement and some Western media, Tibetans in Lhasa are angered by inflation that has caused the prices of food and consumer goods to increase. Residents were worried that a railway built to link Lhasa to China would increase the number of migrants in the city, but they accepted it because the government assured them that cheaper transportation would keep prices lower. However, as in other parts of the country, prices have continued to rise, creating resentment amongst the residents of Lhasa. Tibetan youth complain about not having equal access to jobs and education.|$|E
25|$|Artists {{and musicians}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> to Staten Island's North Shore {{so they can}} be in close {{proximity}} to Manhattan but also have enough affordable space to live and work. Filmmakers, most of whom work independently, also play an important part in Staten Island's art scene, which has been recognized by the local government. Staten Island Arts (formerly The Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island) is Staten Island's local arts council and helps support local artists and cultural organizations with regrants, workshops, folklife and arts-in-education programs, and advocacy. Conceived by the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation to introduce independent and international films to a broad and diverse audience, the Staten Island Film Festival (SIFF) held its first four-day festival in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Erik Wolpaw, National Lampoon veteran Jay Pinkerton and Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek {{wrote the}} game's script. Wolpaw and Pinkerton wrote the single-player {{campaign}} story, while Faliszek wrote GLaDOS's lines for the cooperative campaign. The game has 13,000 lines of dialogue. The writers felt {{they needed to}} create a larger story for a stand-alone title, and wanted the game to [...] "feel relatively intimate", and avoided adding too many new characters. They considered expanding the [...] "sterility and dryness" [...] of Portal and adding more comedy to the script. Wolpaw said that while some developers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> towards art games, no one had made a comedic video game. The game's story development was tightly coordinated with the gameplay development and testing.|$|E

500|$|According to the San Juan National Weather Service office, {{the storm}} was [...] "up to this time the {{greatest}} and more [...] intense and destructive hurricane of record in Puerto Rico." [...] Along the storm path, the eye passed over Guayama, Cayey, and Aibonito, resulting {{in a period of}} calm lasting 20minutes. The island of Puerto Rico received the worst of the storm's winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at Category 5 strength. The hurricane was extremely large as it crossed Puerto Rico. Hurricane-force winds were measured in Guayama for 18hours; since the storm is estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> at 13mph (21km/h), the diameter of the storm's hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234miles (376km).|$|E
500|$|Larger-scale {{agriculture}} {{occurs on}} rubber and cashew plantations. Other economic {{activities in the}} province include gem mining and commercial logging. The most abundant gem in Ratanakiri is blue zircon. Small quantities of amethyst, peridot, and black opal are also produced. Gems are generally mined using traditional methods, with individuals digging holes and tunnels and manually removing the gems; recently, however, commercial mining operations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> into the province. Logging, particularly illegal logging, {{has been a problem}} both for environmental reasons and because of land alienation. This illegal logging has been undertaken by the Cambodian military and by Vietnamese loggers. In 1997, an estimated 300,000 cubic meters of logs were exported illegally from Ratanakiri to Vietnam, compared to a legal limit of 36,000 cubic meters. John Dennis, a researcher for the Asian Development Bank, described the logging in Ratanakiri as a [...] "human rights emergency".|$|E
500|$|The famous Glen Rose {{trackway}} {{on display}} in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved {{in the same direction}} as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs. The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints, indicating that they were formed later. This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of Acrocanthosaurus was stalking a herd of sauropods. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. The same can be said for the purported [...] "herd" [...] of sauropods, who also may or may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> as a group. At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack. However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side.|$|E

2500|$|The forests (and wooded suburbs) {{are home}} {{to a variety of}} {{invertebrate}} and vertebrate animal species.

However, coyotes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> into Massachusetts to fill the ecological niche formerly occupied by wolves. [...] Bears, wild turkey, and even moose have returned from northern refuges.
