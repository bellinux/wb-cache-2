5|$|As {{champions of}} the Football League, Burnley {{qualified}} for the Charity Shield, then known as the Dewar Shield. Burnley's opponents were Tottenham Hotspur, who had finished sixth in the First Division and beaten Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. In what was the last match of the 1920–21 campaign, Burnley fell to a 0–2 loss at White Hart Lane on 16May 1921. The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, maintaining that the whistle had already been blown by the referee.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not made contact (and thus the <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith made contact.|$|E

25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E

5000|$|As {{discussed}} by Slocombe (1998a), <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported {{in order to}} be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. <b>Goals</b> <b>should</b> also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes, such as habitat loss or introduced invasive species, occurring within an ecosystem. Overall the <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> be integrative, to include the structure, organization and processes of the management of an area.

Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee. In the replay, Sheffield United won 2–1, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match.

[...] In the first qualifying round against Montenegrin side Budućnost, Maribor won on penalties and qualified for the decisive round against Proleter.

There were 20,000spectators, 15,000 of whom were already present in the stands almost three hours before kick off, eventually helping Maribor win the game 3–1. However, the two-goal advantage proved to be insufficient as Proleter won the second leg in Zrenjanin 3–0 and earned promotion with the score 4–3 on aggregate. In the second leg match when the score was 1–0 for the home team, Maribor had scored an equaliser in the 23rd minute, but the goal was disallowed. The later TV replay showed that the ball had actually crossed the goal line and that the <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> have stood.|$|E
