40|$|Chicken conalbumin {{double-stranded}} cDNA (con-dscDNA) was synthesized from {{a laying}} hen oviduct mRNA preparation enriched for conalbumin mRNA (con-mRNA). The <b>dscDNA</b> was inserted by blunt-end ligation into the Sal I site of plasmid pBR 322 {{which had been}} repaired with DNA polymerase I to create Taq I sites {{on each side of}} the inserted fragment. After bacterial transformation, one hybrid recombinant, pBR 322 -con 1, which contains the largest inserted <b>dscDNA</b> (about 2350 bp) was shown to hybridize specifically to the RNA which is translated into conalbumin. Electron microscopic examination of hybrid molecules between con-mRNA and pBR 322 -con 1 DNA indicate that the inserted con-dscDNA is an almost full-length double-stranded transcript of conalbumin mRNA...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the sequence of}} ovalbumin RNA (ov-mRNA) using a double-stranded cDNA (<b>dscDNA)</b> plasmid. We have also determined the sequence of the previously characterized exonic regions of the chicken ovalbumin gene. The comparison of these various sequences has shown {{that there are no}} additional interruptions in the mRNA-coding sequences above those 7 already characterized. There is only one single base discrepancy between the two mRNA sequences determined using the <b>dscDNA</b> or the genomic clones. This demonstrates the accuracy and reproducibility of the cloning and sequencing techniques. The ovalbumin mRNA sequence was found to be 1872 nucleotides in length, 13 nucleotides larger than the previous value reported by McReynolds et al. [Nature 273, 723 - 728 (1978) ]...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{microbial}} community analysis typically involves amplification by PCR, despite well-docu-mented biases. We have developed two methods of PCR-independent {{microbial community}} analysis using the high-density microarray PhyloChip: direct hybridization of 16 S rRNA (dirRNA) or rRNA converted to double-stranded cDNA (<b>dscDNA).</b> We compared dirRNA and <b>dscDNA</b> communities to PCR-amplified DNA commu-nities using a mock community of eight taxa, {{as well as}} experiments derived from three environmental sample types: chromium-contaminated aquifer groundwater, tropical forest soil, and secondary sewage in seawater. Community profiles by both direct hybridization methods showed differences that were expected based on accompanying data but that were missing in PCR-amplified communities. Taxon richness decreased in RNA compared to that in DNA communities, suggesting a subset of 20 % in soil and 60 % in groundwater that is active; secondary sewage showed no difference between active and inactive populations. Direct hybridization of <b>dscDNA</b> and RNA is thus {{a viable alternative to}} PCR-amplified microbial community analysis, providing identification of the active populations within microbial communities that attenuate pollutants, drive global biogeochemical cycles, or proliferate disease states. Microbial populations are the primary drivers of many eco-system-level processes (2, 13, 45) and can be exceedingly com...|$|E
40|$|Okayama and Berg (1) have {{recently}} described a technique {{for the high}} efficiency cloning of full-length dscDNAs. We have constructed eukaryotic expression vectors compatible both with this technique (and with classical techniques) for <b>dscDNA</b> cloning. The vectors are such that recombinants obtained contain dscDNAs in the correct orientation downstream from a block of sequence comprising either the SV 40 early or late gene promoter linked {{to a pair of}} splice sites from a rabbit beta-globin gene. A sequence encoding an SV 40 polyadenylation site follows the <b>dscDNA.</b> We have used our vectors to make a library from chicken oviduct polyA(+) RNA using the Okayama and Berg technique. Ovalbumin recombinants occur in the library at the expected frequency and a high proportion contain full length copies of the ovalbumin mRNA. However, a similar result was not obtained for conalbumin recombinants. When recombinants are introduced into eukaryotic cells by either calcium phosphate coprecipitation or protoplast fusion, expression of chicken ovalbumin or conalbumin may be detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Under optimal conditions (use of SV 40 late promoter and cos 7 cells) ovalbumin protein could be detected when the ovalbumin recombinant was present in only 2 % of the protoplasts used for fusion. This suggests that colony banks obtained using our vectors could be screened in batches of 50 by protoplast fusion followed by a search for expression of a given protein using indirect immunofluorescence...|$|E
40|$|ApoA-I is {{the major}} human HDL apoprotein. By {{oligonucleotide}} hybridization, we have isolated 5 <b>dscDNA</b> clones to human hepatic apo A-I mRNA. One of these clones (pA 1 - 3) was completely sequenced. It has 878 bp plus a poly A tail of 48 and includes all the coding and 3 '-untranslated regions of the mRNA {{and part of the}} 5 '-untranslated region. It predicts a peptide sequence of 267 amino acids (including the 24 amino acid prepropeptides) which is very similar to the sequence reported by Brewer et al., (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 : 623 - 630. The predicted signal peptide sequence is highly homologous to the rat apoA-I signal peptide. There is no evidence for any internally repeated segments in apoA-I either at the amino acid or at the DNA level. Using pA 1 - 3 as a probe, we have detected on Northern gels apo A-I mRNA sequences of approximately 1100 nucleotides in human hepatic and baboon hepatic and intestinal RNAs, but not in RNAs from baboon skeletal muscle, kidney or spleen. The demonstration of apo A-I mRNA sequences in specific organs is important to our concept of "reverse cholesterol transport"...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{for the development of}} novel methods for isothermal amplification of nucleic acids using phi 29 and Bst DNA polymerases in the detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis was used in this study for screening similar sequences to avoid unnecessary sequencing from genomic libraries and detection of common pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. Four different structures of DNA linear double stranded DNA (dsDNA, 48 kb), linear single stranded DNA (ssDNA, 3. 6 kb), small circular dsDNA (2. 6 kb) and a large circular dsDNA (8. 6 kb) were used as representatives of different types of viral nucleic acids for the evaluation of phi 29 -amplification at limiting concentrations. Phi 29 -amplification of linear ds, large and small circular dsDNA could be amplified 10 - 100 -fold but ssDNA could not be amplified at all. Alternative protocols were adapted for ligating ssDNA and dsDNA to construct large concatemers for efficient phi 29 -amplification. Phi 29 -amplification of ssDNA was found to increase > 10 -fold when it was ligated using T 4 RNA ligase {{in the presence of a}} large excess of background ssDNA compared to that in the absence of background ssDNA. T 4 DNA ligase-mediated phi 29 -amplification of double stranded cDNA (<b>dscDNA)</b> was found to increase > 105 -fold compared to non-ligated <b>dscDNA.</b> CircLigaseä II ssDNA ligase was used for circularization of ssDNA and aid phi 29 -amplification. CircLigaseä II ssDNA ligase-mediated phi 29 -amplification of ssDNA was found to increase > 107 -fold compared to non-ligated sscDNA. A method named RT-Bst was developed for simultaneous reverse transcription and Bst DNA polymerase amplification of cDNA in the same reaction. In a qualitative PCR assay, RT-Bst was found to be more efficient than the QuantiTectä reverse transcription kit (QIAGEN, Crawley, UK). The RT-Bst method was used for amplification of cDNA in 70 nasopharyngeal samples for detection of a panel of 12 pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. The performance of multiplex RT-Bst PCR detection of pathogenic viruses was comparable to that of multiplex one-step RT-PCR (performed in this study) and more efficient than immunofluorescence (performed by a hospital diagnostic laboratory). The RT-Bst protocol was further modified using tailed random primers to develop another protocol for whole genome amplification designated RT-Bst Single Primer Amplification (RT-Bst SPA) as a cheaper alternative to sequence independent single primer amplification. HRM analysis was used in this study to demonstrate its application for low cost screening of similar sequences to avoid unnecessary sequencing task from whole genome libraries prepared from MS 2 RNA and tissue culture media positive for influenza B and hRSV. HRM analysis was also used for rapid and low cost detection of common pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. It is proposed that RT-Bst and RT-Bst SPA have the potential for sequence independent amplification of RNA sequences for subsequent multiplex PCR detection, and other downstream applications. HRM analysis can be used for rapid and cost effective detection of pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. However, a more detailed study will be required for further optimization and validation of the developed protocols for appropriate commercialization as kits...|$|E
40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} Mobile Genetic Elements (MGE) {{suggests}} that their continued presence in all domains of life {{results from a}} successful evolutionary strategy. The influences of these elements on the genome structure and population dynamics of their host organisms have been an increasing topic {{of interest in this}} new age of genome sequencing. I present several bioinformatic and molecular approaches that may serve as guidelines for investigating the influence of a simple type of MGE, the Insertion Sequence (IS), on bacterial genome projects currently in the pipeline. These techniques identify putative and fragmentary IS elements and identify potential genome insertion hotspots. In the case of the root nodule actinobacterium, Frankia sp., ORFs related to IS elements comprise nearly 3 % of the genome coding sequences in two of three sequenced strains. Remnant transposase ORFs, detected using a PSI-TBLASTN approach, increased the numbers of predicted IS elements in the HFPCcI 3 (CcI 3) and EAN 1 pec (EAN) genomes by 36 % and 39 % respectively. IS element comparisons using a sliding window analysis revealed clear instances of clustering near regions of predicted gene deletions in strain CcI 3 and near regions of gene duplication in strain EAN. Use of these techniques on the Thermotogales genome sequences revealed IS element bias and a clear instance of genome rearrangement mediated by IS elements. ^ While IS element activity is often determined by transposition into specialized plasmids, we provide evidence that suggests transcriptome sequencing may eventually be useful in quantifying transposition frequency. Three different conditions of Frankia sp. CcI 3 cells were harvested and prepared into <b>dscDNA</b> libraries using an Illumina™ mRNA −seq kit. Comparison of the resultant sequencing data from those libraries suggests that nutrient deprivation is likely to increase the transcription of transposases in culture. While transcription does not necessarily correlate with transposition, the increased activity of these transposase ORFs suggests a likelihood of activity that will be confirmed with future studies. ...|$|E
