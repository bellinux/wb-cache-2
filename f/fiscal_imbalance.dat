5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalance</b> between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E

25|$|Taxation in Australia is levied at the federal, state, {{and local}} {{government}} levels. The federal government raises revenue from personal income taxes and business taxes. Other taxes include {{the goods and services}} tax (General Service Tax), excise and customs duties. The federal government is the main source of income for state governments. As a result of state dependence on federal taxation revenue to meet decentralised expenditure responsibilities, Australia is said to have a vertical <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalance.</b>|$|E
40|$|Preliminary version. Comments welcome. Our {{goal is to}} {{understand}} the response of bond returns to the government’s <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances.</b> We offer a framework that defines <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> and links them to returns on government bonds. We show that our measure of <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> con-tains significant information about future returns on the government’s debt portfolio up to two years. We also show that <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> have significant predictive power not only for short-term bond returns, but also for long-term bond returns, even af-ter controlling for the Cochrane-Piazzesi factor and the Ludvigson-Ng (2009) macro factors...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the role}} of fiscal {{variables}} for the assessment of sovereign credit risk? Has this role changed over time? In the face of the financial crisis many OECD countries have experienced large increases of government debt relative to GDP. This has triggered a distinct response of financial markets reflected by a sharp rise of longterm interest on government bonds. We show that, in particular, within some member countries of the European Monetary Union the explanation of investors' recent reactions to these <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> is twofold: first, it is the worsening of fiscal positions due to the financial crisis that has been taken into account. Second, and more striking, it is financial markets' reconsideration of the role of these fiscal fundamentals for the pricing of sovereign credit risk. We argue that, from a historical perspective, this recent re-evaluation of fiscal positions seems little surprising. It is rather the re-establishment of the temporarily interrupted pricing of <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> as a central factor of sovereign credit risk than the aggravation of <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances.</b> In our study we provide cross-country evidence for the impact of <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> upon long-term interest rates. We use macroeconomic data from 1980 to 2012 and contrast a panel of 22 OECD countries with 11 EMU member countries and the so called GIIPS countries. This comparably long time span allows us to evaluate the changes in sovereign risk pricing that set in with the start of the EMU. In particular, we find that the relationship between the perceived default risk reflected by long-term interest rates and the public debt to GDP ratio as an indicator of fiscal sustainability is time regime as well as regional cluster specific. Our findings suggest that there is a strong connection of institutional aspects of EMU and the relationship between <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances</b> and changes in the pricing of sovereign credit risk...|$|R
25|$|Binns' {{popularity}} {{was tested}} {{as the government}} weathered challenges on many fronts. Unpredictability in federal equalization, coupled with rising health care and energy costs and weakness in the primary and tourism sectors, put pressure on provincial finances. Clashes {{with the federal government}} over the <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalance</b> and fisheries management continued for several years. Binns launched a Program Renewal process to streamline duplication and improve delivery of public services. The provincial public service was reduced by several hundred people as services were reorganized and administrative overlap was reduced in the health sector, evidenced by the disappearance of doctors in West Prince. These measures, along with a steadily growing economy, have led to continued improvement of public finances.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{structural}} adjustment policies on poor countries {{has been one of}} the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with structural adjustment loans, which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal {{of structural adjustment}} loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the wider}} economy, Canada was {{surprisingly}} unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This {{was the first time}} that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalance.</b> 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.|$|E

40|$|The {{implications}} of delegating fiscal decision making power to sub-national governments {{has become an}} area of significant interest {{over the past two}} decades, in the expectation that these reforms will lead to better and more efficient provision of public goods and services. The move towards decentralization has, however, not been homogeneously implemented on the revenue and expenditure side: decentralization has materialized more substantially on the latter than on the former, creating vertical <b>fiscal</b> <b>imbalances.</b> These imbalances measure the extent to which sub-national governments' expenditures are financed through their own revenues. This mismatch between own revenues and expenditures may have negative consequences for public finances performance, for example by softening the budget constraint of sub-national governments.
