500|$|From medieval times, beagle {{was used}} as a <b>generic</b> <b>description</b> for the smaller hounds, though these dogs {{differed}} considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood [...] at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a [...] "pocket" [...] or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and {{it is possible that the}} two names refer to the same small variety.

2500|$|Despite being {{common in}} German and English-language journalism during World War II, the word [...] was never {{used by the}} Wehrmacht as an {{official}} military term, except for propaganda. Some senior officers, including Kurt Student, Franz Halder and Johann Adolf von Kielmansegg, even disputed {{the idea that it}} was a military concept. Kielmansegg asserted that what many regarded as blitzkrieg was nothing more than [...] "ad hoc solutions that simply popped out of the prevailing situation". Student described it as ideas that [...] "naturally emerged from the existing circumstances" [...] as a response to operational challenges. The Wehrmacht never officially adopted it as a concept or doctrine. In 2005, the historian Karl-Heinz Frieser summarized blitzkrieg as the result of German commanders using the latest technology in the most beneficial way according to traditional military principles and employing [...] "the right units {{in the right place at}} the right time". Modern historians now understand blitzkrieg as the combination of the traditional German military principles, methods and doctrines of the 19th century, with the military technology of the interwar period. Modern historians use the term casually as a <b>generic</b> <b>description</b> for the style of manoeuvre warfare practised by Germany during the early part of World War II, rather than as an explanation. According to Frieser, in the context of the thinking of Heinz Guderian on mobile combined arms formations, blitzkrieg can be used as a synonym for modern manoeuvre warfare on the operational level.|$|E

This specimen was nearly ready to moult, and perhaps in consequence of this, even the upper scales were most obscurely serrated on their lower margins, and all the others quite smooth: there were some much worn horny spines close {{to the bottom of the}} peduncle. Basal calcareous cup slightly concave, of moderate size; its diameter, in the one specimen examined, was 9/10ths of an inch; it was composed of several layers.

60|$|General Remarks and Affinities.--The {{first five}} species form a most natural genus; {{they are often}} {{sufficiently}} difficult to be distinguished, owing to their great variability. The sixth species (L. fascicularis) differs to a slight extent in many respects from the other species, and has considerable claims to be generically separated, as has been proposed by Mr. Gray, {{under the name of}} Dosima; but as it is identical in structure in all the more essential parts, I have not thought fit to separate it. As far as external characters go, some of the species of Pæcilasma have not stronger claims, than has L. fascicularis, to be generically separated; and I at first retained them altogether, but in drawing up this <b>generic</b> <b>description,</b> I found scarcely a single observation applicable to both halves of the genus; hence I was led to separate Lepas and Pæcilasma. If I had retained these two genera together, I should have had, also, to include the species of Dichelaspis and Oxynaspis; and even Scalpellum would have been separable only by the number of its valves; this would obviously have been highly inconvenient. Although some of the species of Pæcilasma so closely resemble externally the species of Lepas, yet if we consider their entire structure, we shall find that they are sufficiently distinct; as indirect evidence of this, I may remark that Conchoderma (as defined in this volume), includes two genera of most authors, and yet certainly comes, if judged by its whole organisation, nearer to Lepas than does Pæcilasma.|$|E

40|$|Finite Element Modeling {{is widely}} used by the {{research}} community and industry in order to grasp {{a better understanding of}} real-world applications through computer simulations. This engineering tool is becoming more important as industry drives towards concurrent engineering. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is typically made up of three steps, namely the creation of a mesh, the computer simulation, and the post-processing of the results. A fundamental hindrance to fully exploiting the power of FEM is the human effort required to acquire complex part geometries. This preprocessing can represent up to 80 % of an engineer’s time. Therefore, the need to minimize the amount of interactivity cannot be over stressed. Besides the need for a speed-up, the meshing should be based upon actual “as-built” geometries, which should be preferred to as-designed geometries from CAD models or <b>generic</b> <b>descriptions.</b> A CAD model may not accurately account for all the changes to the initial design that take place during the manufacturing process.

60|$|The Peduncle {{varies in}} length, {{generally}} {{about twice as}} long as the capitulum, in one specimen above thrice as long. The upper part as wide as the capitulum, the lower part sometimes much attenuated. The calcified scales in the uppermost whorl (Pl. VIII, fig. 1 b´) are only slightly larger than those in the second whorl; the scales in the succeeding three or four whorls, are considerably larger than those below, which latter very gradually decrease in size, till, low down on the peduncle, they are barely visible to the naked eye. In this lower part, they may be called calcareous beads; they stand some way apart from each other; they are nearly hemispherical, smooth, translucent, and furnished with a conical fang; some of the smallest were 1/325th and 1/400th of an inch in diameter. The upper scales vary somewhat in the outline, the most usual shape being sub-triangular, with the lower margin arched and protuberant; and this margin, in the two or three upper whorls, is crenated with teeth, which are conical and sharp, after exuviation, but soon become reduced to mere notches. The scales in the uppermost whorl are usually nearly quadrilateral; the imbedded portion, or fang of each scale, is, in all, produced into a blunt rounded point. The basal calcareous cup (fig. 1 a´ and 1 c´) is well developed, and is sometimes even half an inch in diameter. Before the cup is formed, there is a row of small, flat discs (fig. 1, and like those in fig. 2 a´) attached to the sides of the burrow: but a full account of these parts of the peduncle, and of the burrowing habits of this species, has been given under the <b>generic</b> <b>description.</b>|$|E
60|$|General Remarks.--As {{there are}} only two species as yet known, and as these {{resemble}} each other in every respect most closely, a <b>generic</b> <b>description</b> would be a useless repetition of the full details given under Ibla Cumingii. I have taken this latter species as the type, from having, owing to the kindness of Mr. Cuming, better and more numerous specimens. Ibla and Lithotrya are the only two recent genera in which the body of the animal is lodged within the peduncle; but there is no distinction of any importance, though useful for classification, between the capitulum and peduncle; and these two parts, as we have seen, tend to blend together in some species of Conchoderma and Alepas. The entire absence of calcareous matter in the valves and spines of the peduncle, at first appears very remarkable; but we have seen a similar fact in Alepas, and there is an approach to it in some varieties of Conchoderma aurita and C. virgata. In all four valves of Ibla, the umbones, or centres of growth, are at their upper points. The horny spines on the peduncle, are the analogues of the calcareous scales in Scalpellum and Pollicipes; and in this latter genus, two of the species have their scales, almost cylindrical, placed irregularly, with new ones forming over all parts of the surface, and not exclusively at the summit,--in which several respects there is an agreement with Ibla. The shape of the body (i. e. thorax and prosoma, Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´) is peculiar; but it is only a slight exaggeration of what we have seen in several genera, and shall meet again in some species of Scalpellum. The presence of hairs on the outer membrane of the prosoma is a peculiarity confined to this genus amongst the Lepadidæ, though observed in the sessile genus, Chthamalus. The caudal appendages in the I. quadrivalvis attain a greater length than in any other species of the family, being four times the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus. A far more important peculiarity is the fact of the oesophagus, in both species, running over or exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle, instead of, as in every other species, close under this muscle. I took great pains in ascertaining the truth of this singular anomaly: the course of the oesophagus is approximately represented in Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´ by faint dotted lines. The stomach has no cæca; the biliary folds are longitudinal; there is a marked constriction at the line corresponding with the junction of the thorax and prosoma. There are no filamentary appendages.|$|E
