Bylo zjištěno, že tlakový koeficient klesá s rostoucím podílem nanoplniva. Nanocomposites of extrusion-type Surlyn ionomer and {{intercalated}} sodium-type montmorillonite were compounded on a <b>KO-kneader</b> {{and measured}} on a modified capillary rheometer for strain rate versus pressure dependencies of shear and elongational viscosities for various clay concentrations. The modified White-Metzner model was employed to simultaneously fit the viscosity data and determine pressure coefficientsthese {{have been found to}} decrease with the loading level of the nanocomposites.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{influence}} of chain length on the intercalation processes and on the properties of polymer/clay nanocomposites. Many polymer/clay nanocomposites have been studied so far. Less attention has been given to PVC/clay nanocomposites, although polyvinylchloride (PVC) is the best known and most widely used vinyl plastic. Natural montmorillonite, Na-MMT, was intercalated with octadecylamine (ODA), dodecylamine (DDA) and octylamine (OA) molecules by ion–dipole intercalation to determine the applicability of these intercalates for nanocomposite materials. The structure was determined by X-ray diffraction and molecular simulation. All polymer samples were prepared in a <b>KO-Kneader</b> in melt conditions. The prepared materials were tested for abrasion resistance, and mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNTs or SWCNTs) {{were used}} as nanofillers in polyethylene. Only MWCNTs reduced the heat release rates caused by polymer degradation. MWCNTs can {{be more effective in}} heat release reduction than organoclays. The char generated by the nanofiller blend “MWCNTs and organoclays ” as a synergistic flame retardant system in EVA was improved compared to the char generated by organoclay based nanocomposites. Initial results indicated that there was a strengthening effect of the char by MWNTs. The synergistic improvement for heat release reduction by a blend of the two nanofillers “MWCNTs and organoclays " was used {{for the development of a}} flame retardant cable compound. 1. 5 kg of MWCNTs were compounded on a BUSS <b>ko-kneader</b> to generate 60 kg of a nanocomposite based on the nanofiller blend. The flame retardant properties of insulated wires made either by the nanofiller blend or by “classical ” organoclays were measured...|$|E
40|$|Polymer organic-{{inorganic}} hybrids, {{where the}} high-aspect ratio inorganic filler can be delaminated at the nanometer scale, {{are able to}} increase their enhancement very significantly at very low-filler volume. Necessary requirement {{for the use of}} materials in packaging and storage applications are presented by gas barrier properties. Modified type of montmorillonite (MMT) 30 B, 25 A, 93 A and natural type of MMT Na+ were used as the inorganic phase. Fillers were incorporated to the linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) matrix. The nanofiller particles were generated via melt compounding in <b>KO-kneader.</b> In case of PVC, the plasticizers act as the intercalation agents. The ion-dipole method was used for intercalation process. Prepared samples were tested for water vapor transmission (WVT), O 2, and CO 2 permeability. Next, the PVC samples were tested for the migration behavior of plasticizers. The structure was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the high level of exfoliation could positively affect tested properties. © 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers...|$|E
40|$|Reported nanocomposites of poly(vinyl chloride) {{have been}} {{prepared}} using bentonite-based clay, Na-montmorillonite (nature clay) and organophilic clay 30 B. Na-montmorillonite is {{the most widely used}} type of silicate clay in polymer nanocomposites. It is a reinforcing material, naturally abundant, nontoxic, inexpensive, chemically and thermally stable. Polymer nanocomposites of differing compositions were produced using Buss <b>KO-kneader</b> via melt intercalation method. The effect of different type of plasticizer (both low molecular and high molecular) and compounding conditions on the structure of PVC/clay nanocomposites was investigated. Different compounding conditions were tested to study their influence on nanoparticles dispersion, orientation and exfoliation in PVC/clay nanocomposites. The structure of PVC/MMT nanocomposites was observed using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning elektron microscopy (SEM) and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy). It was found that the Na-montmorillonite offer low exfoliation level, while 30 B modified by plasticizer exhibits fine dispersion of partial to nearly full exfoliated MMT. Moreover the processing conditions play also important role in nanocomposite production.

40|$|The polymer/clay nanocomposites {{have been}} studied for several years yet Weak {{attention}} has been given to poly(VinylChloride) /clay nanocomposites, although PVC is the best known and the most widely used vinyl plastics This paper focuses to the clay volume optimalization at compositions based on soft PVC Different clay content was used to find out the optimum between properties, filling grade and level of exfoliation. Modified type of clay, Cloisite 3013, and unmodified type of clay, Cloisite Na(+), were employed as the inorganic phase In the first case the clay gives good exfoliation degree and in the second case the degree of exfoliation is very low. These two systems were select due to better understanding the role of clay content and exfoliation degree in relation to the final properties of polymer/clay nancomposites Clay volume differs from 0 to 40 % In case of Cloisite 30 B composition with clay content 0 - 20 % was prepared due to thermal stability of mixing systems As the intercalation and co-intercalation agent was used low molecular plasticizer dioctyphthalate (DOP) The melt intercalation method was used for PVC/clay nanocomposite preparation All intercalates and co-intercalates were reached at 80 degrees C in laboratory mixer Thermomix For mixture compounding, the <b>KO-kneader</b> was chosen The morphology of investigated materials was studied by XRD and TEM The final composition properties were characterized by tensile stress and strain, dynamical thermo-mechanical analysis and by barrier properties It was observed, that relative value of complex modulus /E*/ is growing rapidly with increasing temperature The enhancement is more intensive for materials based on Cloisite 30...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} work was to improve the mechanical properties of glass fibre reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites by the mechanochemical modification of the PP. The modification of the PP {{was carried out by}} reactive processing of the PP with a modifier in a Buss <b>Ko-Kneader.</b> Two main types of modifier were evaluated one type based on N-substituted maleimides the others based on 2 -allylamino- 4, 6 -dichloro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (ACCT). The modification of the PP was carried out in two stages. Firstly the PP was reactively processed with the modifier and a free radical initiator. The objective of this stage was to bind the modifier to the PP. In the second stage the modified PP was reactively processed with the glass fibre. The objective in this stage was to form a chemical bond between the bound modifier and the silane coupling agent {{on the surface of the}} glass. Two silane coupling agents were evaluated these had a aliphatic chloro group and an aliphatic amino group respectively available for reaction with the modifier. The modifiers synthesised for this work had two main functional groups. The first was a double bond for free radical addition to the PP. The second was an organic group chosen for its potential reactivity to the silane coupling agent. A preliminary investigation was carried out using maleic anhydride (MA) as the modifier, this is reactive to the amino silane coupled glass. Studies of a commercially available system were also carried out for comparison purposes. During the work it was found that the amino silane coupled glass fibres produced, without any modification being made to the PP, mechanical properties comparable to the commercial system. Further any modification added to the amino silane system failed to improve the mechanical performance and in some cases acted in the opposite fashion. This failure was evident even when a chemical bond between glass fibre and PP could be shown. In the case of the chloro silane coupled glass fibres the mechanical properties of the composite without modification were poorer than those of the commercial system. It was found that the mechanical properties of these systems could be enhanced by the modifiers, however, no system tested significantly out performed the commercial system. Of the two modifier systems tested those based on the n-substituted maleimides were more successful at enhancing mechanical properties than those based on ACCT. This was attributed to the Poor chemical binding of the ACCT based modifiers to the PP. During the work it was found that several of the modifiers improved the properties of the PP when no glass fibres were present, particularly the % elongation and impact strength. It is possible that these modifiers could be used to improve the impact performance of PP, this may be of particular interest in recycling. These modifiers have only been tested for improving the properties of glass fibre composites. The N-substituted maleimide based modifiers could be used as compatibleisers for alloys of PP and other polymers. These could function by the formation of the bond with PP via the double bond whilst the group attached to the nitrogen atom could react with the alloying polymer...|$|E
