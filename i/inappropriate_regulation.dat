Douglas's case for a radical approach was strengthened by the belief among many of his parliamentary colleagues that the economy's deep-seated problems could only be solved by extensive restructuring. It was understood that some restructuring must follow the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia, which took effect in 1981 and reduced barriers to trade between Australia and New Zealand.

Countries and industries where direct and indirect regulatory burdens are lighter have generally experienced the highest GDP per capita and productivity growth rates. Moreover, where regulatory burdens are lighter, the reallocation of resources towards the highest-productivity firms is stronger.

50|$|ID {{proteins}} are key regulators {{of development}} where they function to prevent premature differentiation of stem cells. By inhibiting {{the formation of}} E-protein dimers that promote differentiation, ID proteins can regulate the timing of differentiation of stem cells during development. An increase in ID expression is seen in embryonic and adult stem cells. ID proteins also promote cell cycle progression, delaying senescence, and help facilitate cell migration. In contrast, <b>inappropriate</b> <b>regulation</b> of ID proteins in differentiated cells can contribute to tumorigenesis. Generally, IDs function as oncogenes. When ID proteins are overexpressed, cell proliferation is enhanced and cells become insensitive to growth factor depletion. Expression of ID proteins in neurons halts neuron axon growth and allows elongation of neurons.There is some controversy surrounding the ID proteins and their role in cancer, but overexpression is seen in most tumor types. There are a few exceptions, for example, an increase in ID1 expression in brain cancer is correlated with a better prognosis, while a decrease in ID4 expression in colon and rectal cancers is linked to a poorer prognosis. ID proteins can bind E-proteins, preventing them from binding bHLH proteins and halting transcription, a case often seen in cancerous phenotypes.|$|E

40|$|SummarySurvival during {{prolonged}} food deprivation {{depends on}} the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. <b>Inappropriate</b> <b>regulation</b> {{of this process is}} a hallmark of diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Activation of the genes encoding gluconeogenic enzymes is mediated by hormone-responsive transcription factors such as the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Here we show using cell-type-specific gene ablation that the winged helix transcription factor Foxa 2 is required for activation of the hepatic gluconeogenic program during fasting. Specifically, Foxa 2 promotes gene activation both by cyclic AMP, the second messenger for glucagon, and glucocorticoids. Foxa 2 mediates these effects by enabling recruitment of CREB and GR to their respective target sites in chromatin. We conclude that Foxa 2 is required for execution of the hepatic gluconeogenic program by integrating the transcriptional response of the hepatocyte to hormonal stimulation...|$|E

While Congress encumbers WIPP with unanticipated oversight and <b>inappropriate</b> <b>regulations,</b> Congress streamlines the commercial repository program and promises improved regulations for Yucca Mountain. While DOE encouraged science {{at the expense of}} the WIPP infrastructure, DOE postponed its scientific investigations at Yucca Mountain and constructed an infrastructure, large enough to support an ambitious program that was never realized. Somewhere between WIPP and Yucca Mountain lies an ideal repository program. A program where consistent national policy promotes progress; where lucid regulations inspire confidence; where science and infrastructure are balanced; and where oversight groups do not become the tail that wags the dog. Neither WIPP nor Yucca Mountain are ideal programs, but each has its advantages that approach the ideal. Consistent national policy would steer the ideal repository program in a predictable direction. Here Yucca Mountain has the advantage. Successive legislation has streamlined the siting process and promises better regulations. From the beginning, the ideal program would know its regulators and regulations. Again, Yucca Mountain has the advantage. More familiar with regulators and regulations, the Yucca Mountain program had the foresight not to declare HLW to be hazardous and subject to dual regulations. The ideal program would equitably balance its science and infrastructure. Here neither program has the advantage and could possibly represent extremes. The WIPP`s emphasis on scientific investigations left it with little or no infrastructure to deal with regulations and oversight. A regulatory infrastructure, for example, could have forewarned WIPP that its in situ tests were not relevant to the regulations.

In particular, there will be too many taxis operating at too high a price. This holds whatever the elasticities of demand with respect to price and waiting time. However, this crucial evidence on price and service elasticities has not previously been available. To that end, we present the results from a number of case studies which demonstrate the size of potential market failure under different conditions. Optimal price-setting, together with free-entry subject to quality controls, is the efficient strategy for regulating the taxi trade and could increase welfare considerably. taxi, demand elasticity, regulation, deregulation...|$|E

In Drosophila, studies have recently revealed that different subcellular pools of activated, phosphorylated Akt can modulate different IIS-dependent processes. For example, a specific pool of activated Akt within the cytoplasm alters aspects of lipid metabolism, {{a process that is}} misregulated in both obesity and diabetes. However, it remains unclear how this pool is regulated. Here we show that the protein phosphatase PP 2 A-B' regulatory subunit Widerborst (Wdb), which coimmunoprecipitates with Akt in vivo, selectively modulates levels of activated Akt in the cytoplasm. It alters lipid droplet size and expression of the lipid storage perilipin-like protein LSD 2 in the Drosophila ovary, but not in epithelial cells of the eye imaginal discs. We conclude that isoforms of PP 2 A-B' can act as subcellular-compartment-specific regulators of PI 3 -kinase/PTEN/Akt kinase signalling and IIS, potentially providing new targets for modulating individual subcellular pools of activated Akt in insulin-linked disease...|$|E

The Act, however, focused mainly on enhancing regulatory systems rather than considering how the Act affected small-scale financial institutions, including thrifts, which {{play a major role}} in the U. S. local housing development industry. In addition, the Act did not accord with the principles of the Government Accountability Office, and left certain regulatory measures intact, including the Qualified Thrift Lending test. Under this new regime, thrifts may face difficulty maintaining their businesses because of the heavy burden of complying with stringent and <b>inappropriate</b> <b>regulations</b> that were passed following the Act. In addition to the problematic issues facing the U. S., Korean savings banks have also been meeting difficulties since the Korean Savings Bank Crisis of 2010, which resulted in the failure of twenty-five percent of total savings banks and cost more than 26 billion with more than 100, 000 victims. Even though the Korean government tried to solve the problems facing the savings bank industry after the crisis, savings banks have still been struggling to operate successfully. This lack of improvement is in part due to deficiencies in the financial regulatory system, such as lenient and insufficient regulations. This dissertation analyzes how the Dodd-Frank Act adversely affects the thrift industry with intensified regulations, and then offers suggestions on how to create more efficient regulations for the thrift industry. This dissertation also studies how the Korean savings bank industry can overcome its current trouble by analyzing the similarities between the savings bank crisis and two U.

40|$|The coordinated {{contraction}} {{of the heart}} relies on proper functioning of ion channels that generate the cardiac electrical impulse. <b>Inappropriate</b> <b>regulation</b> of these ion channels {{can result in a}} wide variety of cardiac arrhythmias. Mutations in the genetic code of genes encoding cardiac ion channels are an important cause of cardiac arrhythmias. Increasing evidence shows that genetic variation in noncoding regulatory regions can disturb important biological processes, thereby adding to the complexity of heritable diseases. This thesis explores the role of noncoding regulatory elements and the effects of genetic variants therein on cardiac ion channel gene expression and function. Using current state-of-the-art techniques we identified several regulatory elements in the vicinity of ion channel genes. We show that loss of these regulatory elements results in reduced expression of ion channel genes, which consequently affects cardiac conduction. Furthermore, we provide evidence that genetic variants herein affect ion channel gene expression in humans. These insights will help to stratify the risk of arrhythmia and will provide clues towards developing novel therapeutic strategies that can bring personalized medicine closer to clinical application...|$|E
40|$|The iron {{requirements}} of the erythroid compartment modulate the expression of hepcidin in the liver, which in turn alters intestinal iron absorption and iron release from the reticuloendothelial system. We {{have taken advantage of}} an inherited anemia of the mouse (hemoglobin deficit, or hbd) to gain insights into the factors regulating hepcidin expression. hbd mice showed a significant anemia but, surprisingly, their iron absorption was not increased as it was in wild-type animals made anemic to a similar degree by dietary iron depletion. In wild-type mice hepatic hepcidin levels were decreased but in hbd animals a significant and unexpected increase was observed. The level of absorption was appropriate for the expression of hepcidin in each case, but in hbd mice did not reflect the degree of anemia. However, this apparent <b>inappropriate</b> <b>regulation</b> of hepcidin correlated with increased transferrin saturation and levels of diferric transferrin in the plasma, which in turn resulted from the reduced capacity of hbd animals to effectively use transferrin-bound iron.

We show that in the absence of extrinsic stimulation, strong luminescence is evident in lymph nodes in the neck region, thymus, and Peyer’s patches. Treating mice with TNF-�, IL- 1 �, or LPS increased the luminescence in a tissue-specific manner, with the strongest activity observed in skin, lungs, spleen, Peyer’s patches, and the wall of the small intestine. Liver, kidney, heart, muscle, and adipose tissue displayed less intense activities. Also, exposure of skin to a low dose of UV radiation increased luminescence in the exposed areas. Furthermore, induction of chronic inflammation resembling rheumatoid arthritis produced strong NF-�B activity in the affected joints, as revealed by in vivo imaging.
