2500|$|Staughton Lynd, {{chairman}} of the 1965 [...] "March on Washington", was asked by Russell {{to participate in the}} tribunal and rejected the invitation. Lynd's objections and criticism of the Tribunal were {{based on the fact that}} Russell planned to investigate only non-North Vietnamese and National Liberation Front conduct, sheltering Hanoi from any criticism for their behaviour. Lynd wrote that [...] "in conversation with the emissary who proffered the invitation, I urged that the alleged war crimes of any party to the conflict should come before the Tribunal. After all, I argued, a [...] "crime" [...] is an action that is wrong no matter who does it. Pressing my case, I asked, [...] "What if it were shown that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam tortures unarmed prisoners?" [...] The answer, as <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it,</b> was, [...] "Anything is justified that drives the imperialist aggressor into the sea." [...] I declined the invitation to be a member of the Tribunal." ...|$|E
60|$|RANKIN. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> {{was your}} {{business}} to provide escorts, Captain Brassbound.|$|E
60|$|In this emergency, as <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it,</b> {{there was}} but one course to follow. I refused {{to receive the}} challenge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it won't {{make much}} difference, because, as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> it's {{only a short}} walk from one set of {{buildings}} to the other." ...|$|R
60|$|HODSON. No sir. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it's</b> a very wet climate, sir. I'd better {{pack your}} india-rubber overalls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alan," [...] said I, [...] "I'll not say it's {{the good}} Christianity as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> but it's good enough. And here I offer ye my {{hand for the}} second time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps I am touchy; I don't think I am ungrateful. They {{have always}} made you {{like one of}} themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> {{was not the}} war, but Mr. Marmaduke himself, {{which had}} carried his family to this pass. And some of my old resentment rekindled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never let}} my daughters {{see her in}} those dreadful characters--they are too bold; but they are both here to-night. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> was {{to be quite a}} departure." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir John. O ho, then {{it seems}} the cudgelling and turning away were pure invention; I am glad <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{that is very}} {{interesting}} history," [...] said Jack, well pleased; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> perfectly all but the explanation." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. LINCOLN: Well! <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> to be a {{principle}} of Democracy to whip foreign nations whenever, they interfere with us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course; I knew it. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> all," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I've {{nothing to}} do with the girl. I don't care whether she be good or bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{raised his}} brows. [...] "Ah," [...] said he, [...] "I appear, then, to have misapprehended the situation. From what Gervase told me, <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> was your brother forced you to return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I heerd it,' said Toodle, 'but I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> rightly Sir, 'account {{of being}} no scholar, {{and the words}} being--ask your pardon--rayther high. But Polly heerd it. It's all right.' ...|$|E
30|$|Although in the novel, Ghosh {{uses the}} word “Brahma,” <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> as “Brahman” due to the {{characteristics}} used to describe it.|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} is (as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it)</b> Mr. Garrett's estimate of Jameson's total loss in killed and wounded {{for the two}} days: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> could <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> it wouldn't be so bad," [...] he {{kept saying}} over and over again to himself, [...] "but <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> why Mrs. Whitefoot doesn't love me any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I haven't done wrong--have I? As <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it,</b> {{there was}} no alternative. Geoffrey told me you had settled with him to present {{yourself}} here as a married lady, whose husband was coming to join her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That shows a very Christian {{disposition}} on your part. And {{then there}} was Sir Harry. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> all, but I could not hinder it. But {{it had to be}} done, hadn't it?--And now there will be an end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I have {{no doubt}} that he embellished that too, with some of his fine {{masculine}} witticisms. I understood myself that he was offended at my asking him. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> quite well; he told me so!' Then with feminine intuition she went on: ...|$|E
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. [Drily] We {{will put}} it that way. [A pause] At the present moment you owe, as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> eleven hundred pounds.|$|R
2500|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{guarantee}} us only {{the right to be}} correct, {{we have a right to}} be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> and under the Constitution, as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> every citizen in this country has the right to express himself ... on public questions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} ye mean, Redskin," [...] replied Paul; [...] "but speak your own tongue, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> {{well enough to}} talk with ye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{can tell}} what notions {{he has in}} his head? Mr. d'Alcacer, I believe his only object is to call Captain Lingard away from us. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> {{only a few minutes}} ago. It has dawned upon me. All he wants is to call him off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{might have}} been a reason twelve months ago, but there was to be no more delay now; that is as <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it.</b> No, it has not been that, Sir Lionel. It makes me very unhappy, I know;" [...] and Miss Baker again used her handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{letter was}} rather enigmatical, and I {{do not know}} whether <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> exactly. I suppose you told me what you did for good reasons of your own, and I did not think much about it. I believe the {{question}} of taste did not come up in my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>It</b> was worse. As {{to killing}} a man, {{which would be}} a {{comparatively}} decent thing to do, well--I have never done that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you want}} 'em arrested, Abe?" [...] put in Tom Dillon. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> this here Merwell feller is wanted {{by the police}} as it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean just}} what I say!" [...] {{declared}} the money-lender's son. [...] "This is a frame-up, nothing more! <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> all now, although I didn't at first." ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of answering, {{he burst}} into a fit of laughter--loud, coarse, hard laughter, so utterly unlike any sound I had ever yet heard issue from his lips, so strangely and shockingly foreign to his {{character}} as <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it,</b> that I stood still on the sands and openly remonstrated with him.|$|E
60|$|While {{hearing the}} story it was {{impossible}} for me to realize how agonizing must have been the position of the besieged man. Now <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> keenly, and resolved not to look out from that side of the house again, lest the painted fiends should begin their horrible work before night came.|$|E
6000|$|... "None of them," [...] she replied. [...] "He {{went away}} two hours since on foot. As <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>it,</b> his object {{was to make}} fresh {{inquiries}} about the woman named Anne Catherick. He appears to be unreasonably anxious about tracing her. Do you happen {{to know if she}} is dangerously mad, Miss Halcombe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{noticed an}} {{extraordinary}} change in Williams's reports, {{both in the}} handwriting and expression. Now <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> You work the same stall as Haden, do you not?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. G. A. Sutton is an {{applicant}} for {{superintendent of the}} addition of the Insane Asylum, and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> partly depends on you whether he gets it.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} aired on Democracy Now, academic and author Ward Churchill said: [...] "HR 1955, as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> provides {{a basis for}} subjective interpretation of dissident speech...." ...|$|R
