25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I {{should live}} to hear Arnold Schoenberg sound tame, yet tame he sounds—almost timid and halting—after Ornstein who is, most emphatically, the only true-blue, genuine, Futurist {{composer}} alive." ...|$|E

But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [...] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> {{of them as}} {{personal}} songs {{in terms of my}} own life but they were personality songs. They were all about my obsessions and images. None of them takes place in a normal world. They all take place in an extreme world. Very operatic ... they were all heightened. They don't take place in normal reality.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{ability to}} connect with Americans earned him the laudatory moniker [...] "The Great Communicator." [...] Of it, Reagan said, [...] "I won the {{nickname}} the great communicator. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> it was my style that made a difference—it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things." [...] His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.|$|E

500|$|Francesca died in 1992, aged two. Gunn {{played a}} match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his {{daughter}} died; he said of it, [...] "When I ran out, I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium was with me. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about packing it in." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Gunn won Norwich's Player of the Year award, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{problem of}} {{interpretation}} has also plagued Narihira's last poem (quoted above). The fourth line, , is most normally read as [...] "(I never thought) {{that it might}} be yesterday or today", but has been occasionally interpreted by scholars to mean [...] "until yesterday <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> it might be today"; others take it as simply meaning [...] "right about now". But the emotion behind the poem is nonetheless clear: Narihira, who died in his fifties, always knew he must die someday, but is nonetheless shocked that his time has come so soon.|$|E
500|$|Rabi died at {{his home}} on Riverside Drive in Manhattan from cancer on 11 January 1988. His wife, Helen, survived him and {{died at the age}} of 102 on 18 June 2005. In his last days, he was {{reminded}} of his greatest achievement when his physicians examined him using magnetic resonance imaging, a technology that had been developed from his ground-breaking research on magnetic resonance. The machine happened to have a reflective inner surface, and he remarked: [...] "I saw myself in that machine... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> my work would come to this." ...|$|E

500|$|St. Laurent {{resigned}} {{as leader of}} the Liberal Party on September 5, 1957, but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected. With a lame-duck leader, the Liberals were ineffective in opposition. Paul Martin stated that [...] "I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> the day would come when [...] would ever be a member of a government, let alone head of it. When that happened, the world had come to an end as far as I was concerned." [...] In January 1958, St. Laurent was succeeded by Lester Pearson.|$|E
500|$|Tessa {{occasionally}} meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In [...] "", {{she immediately}} dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that [...] "...sparks fly {{between the two}} women". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I would meet one of them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "'Shake It Off' {{was just}} like ... That comes from that style of I guess [...] Confessions and just that bounce. It's {{got a lot of}} {{ingredients}} to it because <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that Mariah could make a bouncy type of record. When you hear that song — the whole bounce of the record and the way she's flipping it and the stuff she talking about ... I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.|$|E

500|$|Steinman {{had secured}} a {{contract}} with Meat Loaf's recording label MCA for Lorraine Crosby, a club singer from North East England whom he was managing. While visiting the company's recording studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love". Crosby recalls, [...] "I went and sang it twice and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> anything more of it until six months later when I {{got a phone call}} saying, 'Would you mind if we used your vocals?'" [...] Cher, Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Tyler had been considered for the role. However, as Crosby had recorded her part as guide vocals, she did not receive any royalties from the song.|$|E
500|$|Victoria's son {{remembered her}} fondly: [...] "My mother was very quick on the uptake, very talkative, very {{aggressive}} and argumentative. With her marvellous brain she sharpened people's wits." [...] Her granddaughter thought her [...] "formidable, but never intimidating... a supremely honest woman, full of commonsense and modesty." [...] Victoria wrote her own typically forthright epitaph {{at the end}} of her life in letters to and conversation with her son: [...] "What will live in history is the good work done by the individual & that has nothing to do with rank or title... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I would be known only as your mother. You're so well known now and no one knows about me, and I don't want them to." ...|$|E
500|$|He recalled, [...] "I {{read the}} script for Mad Men and I loved it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> they'd cast me—- I mean, I thought they'd go {{with one of the}} five guys who look like me but are movie stars". He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|E

500|$|Shatner {{referred}} to The Original Series as [...] "cartoonish" [...] in Mind Meld, but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, [...] "I {{never thought it}} was a cartoon ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> it was beneath me." [...] In a February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, Shatner said Mind Meld was similar to My Dinner with Andre, and indicated that he and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature. Nimoy said of the film, [...] "This is the most personal insight the fans will get into our relationship and into aspects of Bill and myself they've never heard before." [...] In April 2002, Mind Meld was screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Two years later, Mind Meld was included in the bonus material when the first six Star Trek films were re-released as a special edition box set.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Say Never" [...] is a pop-R which {{includes}} hip hop. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Never Say Never" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a metronome of 96 beats per minute, which is described as [...] "steady, not too fast."

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Misery" [...] {{details the}} {{feelings}} one receives following a new relationship. Stefani sings: [...] "Hurry up, {{come see me}} / Put {{me out of my}} misery", which shows the singer debating whether she wants to relive the pain or experience the pleasure. Elsewhere, she compares her boyfriend to medications: [...] "You're like drugs to me / You're like drugs to me", and warns him that their newfound relationship is becoming a bit much: [...] "You're in so much trouble / Yeah, you're in so much trouble". Additionally, she requests that the lover should come visit her: [...] "You're at the door / I'm thinking things <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> before / Like what your love would taste like / Give me more". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that Stefani's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale was not the track's subject, despite the misleading use of the word [...] "Misery".|$|E
