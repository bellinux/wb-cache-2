5|$|<b>Germanium</b> is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic <b>germanium</b> compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural <b>germanium</b> compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble <b>germanium</b> salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive <b>germanium</b> compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E
5|$|Germanium's {{abundance}} in the Earth's crust is approximately 1.6ppm. Only a few minerals like argyrodite, briartite, germanite, and renierite contain appreciable amounts of <b>germanium,</b> and none in mineable deposits. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough <b>germanium</b> to justify extraction {{from the final}} ore concentrate. An unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of <b>germanium</b> in some coal seams, discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for <b>germanium</b> deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in Hartley coal ash with as much as 1.6% <b>germanium.</b> The coal deposits near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia, contain an estimated 1600tonnes of <b>germanium.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 118tonnes of <b>germanium</b> was {{produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). <b>Germanium</b> is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A {{recent study found that}} at least 10,000 t of extractable <b>germanium</b> is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled <b>germanium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because <b>germanium</b> and gallium {{arsenide}} have very similar lattice constants, <b>germanium</b> substrates {{can be used}} to make {{gallium arsenide}} solar cells. The Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on <b>germanium</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolGe and atomic number32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure <b>germanium</b> is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, <b>germanium</b> naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> is a semiconductor. Zone {{refining}} {{techniques have}} led to the production of crystalline <b>germanium</b> for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 1010, {{making it one of the}} purest materials ever obtained. The first metallic material discovered (in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of <b>germanium,</b> uranium, and rhodium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> is a shiny grey-white solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle. It is mostly unreactive at room {{temperature}} but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. <b>Germanium</b> also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. <b>Germanium</b> is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67eV. Liquid <b>germanium</b> is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity {{similar to that of}} liquid mercury.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the demand}} for <b>germanium</b> for fiber optic {{communication}} networks, infrared night vision systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide <b>germanium</b> consumption in 2000. The US government even designated <b>germanium</b> as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146ton (132t) supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Salts of <b>germanium</b> are {{potentially}} harmful to {{humans and animals}} if ingested on a prolonged basis. There is interest in the pharmacological actions of <b>germanium</b> compounds but no licensed medicine as yet.|$|E
5|$|Semiconductor {{detectors}} made {{of single}} crystal high-purity <b>germanium</b> can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security. <b>Germanium</b> {{is useful for}} monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy X-ray applications. Crystals of high purity <b>germanium</b> are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy {{and the search for}} dark matter. <b>Germanium</b> crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, <b>germanium</b> {{was thought to}} be a poorly {{conducting}} metal. <b>Germanium</b> did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of <b>germanium</b> were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact Schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of <b>germanium</b> were produced in smelters each year, {{but by the end of}} the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, <b>germanium</b> was {{discovered}} comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. <b>Germanium</b> ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, <b>germanium</b> is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though <b>germanium</b> is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{compounds}} of <b>germanium</b> {{have low}} toxicity to mammals, but have toxic effects against certain bacteria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> {{differs from}} silicon {{in that the}} supply {{is limited by the}} {{availability}} of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and quartz. While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of <b>germanium</b> was almost $800 per kg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> dioxide is {{also used}} in {{catalysts}} for polymerization {{in the production of}} polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The high brilliance of this polyester is especially favored for PET bottles marketed in Japan. In the United States, <b>germanium</b> is not used for polymerization catalysts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> is {{normally}} absent in diamond, {{but it can}} be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. <b>Germanium</b> in diamond can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which has similar properties to those of the Si-vacancy center.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germanium</b> supplements, {{made from}} both organic and {{inorganic}} <b>germanium,</b> have been marketed {{as an alternative}} medicine capable of treating leukemia and lung cancer. There is, however, no medical evidence of benefit; some evidence suggests that such supplements are actively harmful.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} <b>germanium</b> has seen {{increasing}} use in precious metal alloys. In sterling silver alloys, for instance, it reduces firescale, increases tarnish resistance, and improves precipitation hardening. A tarnish-proof silver alloy trademarked Argentium contains 1.2% <b>germanium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Solar {{panels are}} a major use of <b>germanium.</b> <b>Germanium</b> is the {{substrate}} of the wafers for high-efficiency multijunction photovoltaic cells for space applications. High-brightness LEDs, used for automobile headlights and to backlight LCD screens, are an important application.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>germanium</b> {{compounds}} {{have been}} administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of <b>germanium</b> used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted {{in some cases}} of renal dysfunction, hepatic steatosis, and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine <b>germanium</b> concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the <b>germanium</b> transistor in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for <b>germanium,</b> but then high-purity silicon began replacing <b>germanium</b> in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} semiconductor electronics.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{produced}} mainly from sphalerite, {{it is also}} found in silver, lead, and copper ores. Another source of <b>germanium</b> is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain <b>germanium.</b> Russia and China used this as a source for <b>germanium.</b> Russia's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island, and northeast of Vladivostok. The deposits in China are located mainly in the lignite mines near Lincang, Yunnan; coal is also mined near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} between silica (SiO2) and <b>germanium</b> dioxide (GeO2), the silica stationary phase in some gas chromatography columns can be replaced by GeO2.|$|E
5|$|Germane (GeH4) is a {{compound}} similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds {{that are similar}} to alkanes—with formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five <b>germanium</b> atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion. The <b>germanium</b> hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} properties of silicon and <b>germanium</b> enabled {{the establishment of}} the semiconductor industry in the 1950s and the development of solid-state electronics from the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, <b>germanium</b> is a brittle, silvery-white, semi-metallic element. This form {{constitutes an}} allotrope known as α-germanium, {{which has a}} metallic luster and a diamond cubic crystal structure, the same as diamond. At pressures above 120 kbar, it becomes the allotrope β-germanium with the same structure as β-tin. Like silicon, gallium, bismuth, antimony, and water, <b>germanium</b> {{is one of the}} few substances that expands as it solidifies (i.e. freezes) from the molten state.|$|E
5|$|Using a ligand called Eind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl) <b>germanium</b> {{is able to}} form {{a double}} bond with oxygen (germanone).|$|E
5|$|A few non-essential {{heavy metals}} have been {{observed}} to have biological effects. Gallium, <b>germanium</b> (a metalloid), indium, and most lanthanides can stimulate metabolism, and titanium promotes growth in plants (though {{it is not always}} considered a heavy metal).|$|E
5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with <b>germanium,</b> silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and <b>germanium</b> crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|Pure <b>germanium</b> spontaneously extrudes {{very long}} screw dislocations, {{and this is}} one of the primary reasons for the failure of older diodes and {{transistors}} made from germanium; depending on what they eventually touch, they may lead to an electrical short.|$|E
5|$|Some of germanium's artificially-produced {{compounds}} {{are quite}} reactive and present an immediate hazard {{to human health}} on exposure. For example, <b>germanium</b> chloride and germane (GeH4) are a liquid and gas, respectively, {{that can be very}} irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.|$|E
5|$|The major {{end uses}} for <b>germanium</b> in 2007, worldwide, were {{estimated}} to be: 35% for fiber-optics, 30% infrared optics, 15% polymerization catalysts, and 15% electronics and solar electric applications. The remaining 5% went into such uses as phosphors, metallurgy, and chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. <b>Germanium</b> forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of <b>germanium</b> was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and <b>germanium</b> tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
