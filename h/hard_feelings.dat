By sometime in 1984, however, Sweet began distancing himself from the Athens music scene, and in 1985 he got a record deal and moved to New York. While some people accused him of using his Athens music connections to get ahead and then desert the scene, R.E.M. did not hold any <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> towards him.|$|E
5|$|Harbaugh made {{headlines}} {{prior to the}} season by claiming 2007 would be Carroll's last year with USC before departing to the NFL, drawing a terse rebuke from Carroll; Harbaugh later called the 2007Trojans {{one of the best}} teams in history at the Pac-10 Media Day, reiterating the position in the week before their game. However, there were no <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> between the coaches. The two kept in cordial phone contact and Carroll made light of Harbaugh's comments several times during the season.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or <b>hard</b> <b>feelings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Remarkably, {{despite the}} two 20th century wars, {{there is no}} <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> against Germany in modern Russia. Moreover, in many places in Russia German war cemeteries were {{established}} in places of fierce World War II battles.|$|R

He {{has a new}} girl, has no <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> about his summer stay at Asquith and Mohair, has {{traveled}} around the World and met Charles Wexell Allen in his travels. He reveals that Mr. Allen thanked him for inadvertently helping him in the embezzlement.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, {{who lived in the}} dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the Mississippi River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1969, Governor John McKeithen {{replaced}} Fulco on the House Budget Committee with freshman Representative Lonnie O. Aulds, also of Shreveport. The matter sparked divisiveness in the Caddo Parish delegation, but McKeithen {{tried to}} smooth over the <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> with self-deprecating humor in an engagement in Shreveport in mid-February 1969.|$|E
25|$|More {{problems}} and <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> arose from a Richmond-Chesterfield case {{which began in}} 1965; they were later used as prime examples of obstacles to regional cooperation as the state legislators have considered changes. The resulting 1970 annexation was exceptionally controversial and took {{more than seven years}} to be resolved in court.|$|E

60|$|It {{appeared}} to me, from the conversation, {{that there was}} much <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> {{on the part of}} the Indians because they were not allowed to indulge in an amusement which had been countenanced by more than one officer of the British army, and I fancied that Thayendanega, great sachem though he now was of the Six Nations, would have no little trouble in holding his precious followers in check.|$|R
60|$|Sophy hesitated. There was a <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> in her throat, {{a burning}} {{at the back}} of her eyes. She was passionately anxious to be alone, yet she could not bring herself to refuse. She could not deny herself, or tear herself at once away from the close {{companionship}} which seemed, somehow or other, to have crept up between herself and John, and to have become the one thing that counted in life.|$|R
25|$|That same day, Ronaldinho, {{joined by}} Adriano, {{returned}} {{to the city of}} Barcelona and held a party at his home, which was continued into the early morning hours at a nightclub.

25|$|Finally, on February 1, 1854, the {{railroad}} ran a train through Erie without change. But civil disturbances continued for years. Townspeople were assaulted, {{the local newspaper}} was torn down and the ruins burnt, and the Presbyterian church split in two. The matter caused such <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> that people avoided discussing it for years afterwards {{in order to avoid}} starting arguments.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 {{round of}} realignment, UT had secured a better conference TV deal and a bigger share of that deal and gained what Dodds {{considered}} an easier {{path to the}} national title game. It also was permitted its own network (the Longhorn Network) and had gotten Nebraska out of the conference. However, the $20 million payouts did not soothe <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> at Texas A and Oklahoma.|$|E

5000|$|AASHTO defines and {{specifies}} that temporary routes {{should have}} the following behavior:In the erection of signs for numbering routes, it is necessary {{in some cases to}} carry a number temporarily over a road that ultimately will not be the permanent location of that number. Great care should be taken by the State Highway Departments in seeing that when numbers of this character are permitted, that a standard strip carrying the words [...] "Temporary" [...] shall be placed on the staff above the number. This will obviate much <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> when it is necessary to change a number to the permanently established route.|$|R
25|$|Krause {{publicly}} portrayed Jackson as a two-faced {{character who}} {{had very little}} regard for his assistant coaches, a perception that certain Krause associates in the Bulls organization had sought to spread about Jackson.

25|$|Kung Lao {{returns in}} Mortal Kombat X.

His younger cousin, Kung Jin, makes his debut as a playable character {{and is one of}} the story's main heroes. It is mentioned that Kung Jin became a thief because his family fell on hard times after Kung Lao's death, and held <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> toward Raiden as a result.|$|E
25|$|The Royalist {{victory was}} capped when they hauled off {{considerable}} military stores {{abandoned by the}} fleeing communists, including half a dozen armored cars and eight artillery pieces. However, the route to the Plain of Jars was still blocked by communist forces. As a result, there were <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> on part of the RLA regulars, who felt cheated of their triumph. Nor was that the only factor dampening Royalist morale; the Tonkin Gulf Incident of 2 August that officially began the Vietnam War immediately overshadowed Operation Triangle.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{observe the}} Adjective.

When we wish to speak of our [...] "good friend or friends," [...] in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one form and have no trouble or <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> about it; but with the German tongue it is different.

Every now and then, the sympathies of their race lead these inveterate wanderers to attach themselves, for the time, to some human companion, whom their mysterious insight chooses from the crowd. Teresa, with the <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> towards animals {{which is one of the}} serious defects of the Italian character, cried, [...] "Ah, the mangy beast!" [...] and lifted her umbrella.

25|$|The boom {{operated}} {{for eight}} months. The 150 employees were paid $1.50 {{per day for}} their work. The owners of the boom paid an average of $50,000 per year to their employees {{for an average of}} $333.33 per man. This low pay compared to the millions that the owners of the boom and some of the mills brought about some <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> among the workers of the Susquehanna Boom. The workers of the boom, the lumber jacks, and the sawmill workers banded together in 1872 went on strike that summer.|$|E
25|$|Lewis {{eventually}} relinquished {{his commission}} as a {{lieutenant in the}} 4th Battalion, Northumberland Regiment, on 30 September 1921. He traveled to the United States in 1923, surveying business conditions there. Upon his return, he recommended that Lloyd's form an American Non-Marine Department; the recommendation caused some <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> towards him from coworkers. Lewis was listed in public records as a business liquidator as early as 1925. This was also the year he married Christian Robertson, on 9 July; the union would last 68 years and produce two daughters and two sons. Lewis avoided becoming impoverished by the Great Depression of 1929. He also built the American Non-Marine Department into the largest department in Sedgwick and Collins by 1939.|$|E
25|$|His third solo album, No <b>Hard</b> <b>Feelings,</b> {{appeared}} in June 1993 and was recorded with De Soto, Bremond, De Marco and Leach. It was co-produced by Wells and De Soto for ATI Records and Mushroom Records. In August that {{year it was}} followed by a four-track EP, Hard Done by You, co-credited to Peter Wells, Dave Steel (ex-Weddings Parties Anything), Bob Armstrong. In late 1994 Wells and De Soto reactivated Pete Wells Band with Turner and were joined by Mark Evans on bass guitar (ex-AC/DC, Finch, Heaven) and Mick O'Shea on drums (ex-Swanee, Judge Mercy). In the next year the line-up with Wells and De Soto were Cocks, De Marco and Andy Cichon on bass guitar (ex-Rose Tattoo, James Reyne Band, Judge Mercy). Wells issued his fourth solo album, Orphans, in June that year, which was co-produced by Wells and De Soto.|$|E
60|$|The dose was given; and <b>Harding,</b> <b>feeling</b> {{the urgent}} need of action {{if he were to}} {{continue}} calm, got up and wandered about the muskeg. Coming back after a while, he looked at Clarke. The doctor merely shook his head, though his face now showed signs of uneasiness. Harding sat down again and refilled his pipe, noticing that the stem was nearly bitten through. He gathered from Clarke's expression that they would soon know what to expect, and he feared the worst. Now, however, he was growing cool; his eyes were very stern, and his lips had set in an ominously determined fashion. Benson, glancing at him once or twice, thought it boded trouble for the doctor if things went badly. The American had a ruthless air.|$|R
2500|$|Maj. Gen. Harry Schmidt, {{commander}} of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy shelling of the island immediately preceding the mid-February amphibious assault. However, Rear Adm. William H. P. Blandy, {{commander of}} the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), did not believe such a bombardment would allow him time to replenish his ships' ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt's request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and agreed to a three-day bombardment. This decision left much <b>hard</b> <b>feeling</b> among the Marines. After the war, Lieut. Gen. Holland M. [...] "Howlin' Mad" [...] Smith, commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt's Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained {{that the lack of}} naval gunfire had cost Marine lives during the entire Allied island campaign.|$|R

25|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} and Henry was {{rejected}} {{as a volunteer}} {{on account of his}} slightly cripped right hand, he turned his attention to making a button hole machine. He and his brother James entered into partnership with Mr. Seaman and in 1862 they perfected an automatic buttonhole sewing machine. It was then tested in a clothing shop in New York on army overcoats and capes, where its average was from 1,000 to 1,200 buttonholes per day. This caused <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> among the hand buttonhole workers, and one day during the noon hour they smashed the machine. However, the next morning another machine was working in its place. All together there were over one hundred thousand button holes made there. The patents were taken over by the Wheeler and Wilson Manufacturing Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. While House was in Washington D.C. looking after the patent application, he met Abraham Lincoln, for whom he cast his first vote.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, shortly {{after the release of}} the first demo, Seppälä and Kuri began searching for a female vocalist with high {{technical}} skills to replace Goodman, feeling he wasn't right for the music. Around the time they placed an ad, they found another for soprano vocalist Heidi Parviainen, who had grown tired of her keyboard duties of Iconofear. After listening to her samples, they decided to set up a demo with her and the band. It turned out that she was exactly what they were looking for, due to her ability to both sing and contribute lyrics, after writing the lyrics to Passing Bells. This completed the band's lineup, now under the name of Amberian Dawn, the result of a day of brainstorming. In spite of having Goodman leave his position as singer, there were no <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> between him and the band, and he has made minor appearances on all three Amberian Dawn albums since.|$|E

Some Team Bondi former employees went on to work for different Rockstar studios, while some went to Kennedy Miller Mitchell.
