40|$|Abstract. In {{accordance}} with the increased awareness of resource depletion and environmental pollution, the importance of eco-friendly disposal and recycling of vehicles as a potentially valuable resource is emphasized; in particular, {{this is important as}} automobile production and demand continues steadily. In this paper, a systematic <b>dismantling</b> system is proposed to minimize the quantity of ASR by <b>dismantling</b> End-of-Life Vehicles(ELVs) rationally and efficiently. An adaptive layout design system is also provided to aid for the effective implementation of the proposed <b>dismantling</b> system to industrial applications. The proposed <b>dismantling</b> system is based on eco-friendly <b>dismantling</b> and improves not only the recyclability of ELVs, but also the efficiency of the <b>dismantling</b> operations. The adaptive layout design system is a software tool, which allows a layout of a <b>dismantling</b> plant according to the specific requirements of the customers, and estimates the overall figures and capacity of an intended plant by simulation of the <b>dismantling</b> process. This interactive design system can be useful for testing alternative layouts of a <b>dismantling</b> plant customized to meet particular recycling needs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract After {{decades of}} pushing for {{deregulation}} and regulatory reform in its Member States, has the European Union itself become a locus for policy <b>dismantling</b> – i. e. {{leading to a}} weakening of its policies? This thesis offers a first systematic study of policy <b>dismantling</b> at EU level. It focuses on environmental policies, {{an area in which}} EU action has repeatedly been criticised by politicians for harming competitiveness and not respecting national sovereignty. It combines for the first time insights from comparative politics studies of <b>dismantling</b> with EU governance literature, to offer a theoretical framework specially configured to explaining <b>dismantling</b> at EU level. It investigates which EU environmental policies have been targeted for policy <b>dismantling,</b> by whom, why and how, from the early 1990 s {{to the end of the}} second Barroso Commission in 2014. It reveals how the EU has changed, from a driver of policy <b>dismantling</b> in its Member States to a locus of <b>dismantling</b> in its own right. <b>Dismantling</b> attempts (from the reduction of administrative burdens to the repatriation of competences) have been made by key EU actors – which for some, such as the European Commission, goes against the conventional wisdom in EU studies. These attempts have been justified in terms of criticisms of the EU’s legislative outputs – subsidiarity and proportionality – and of European integration itself. But they have not resulted in significant policy <b>dismantling.</b> <b>Dismantling</b> has been the least frequent outcome of legislative reform amongst the many pieces of legislation earmarked for <b>dismantling.</b> This pattern indicates the resilience – until now – of the EU’s “green state” (Klyza and Sousa, 2013), but <b>dismantling</b> attempts have markedly changed the way the EU legislates on environmental issues and further hindered policy expansion. This thesis contributes to the renaissance of <b>dismantling</b> studies in comparative politics by revealing how <b>dismantling</b> strategies and effects at EU level differ from the existing literature which focuses almost exclusively on nation states. Looking at the EU from a policy <b>dismantling</b> perspective, this thesis also questions foundational assumptions in EU studies – on what drives EU actors, on where the EU is headed. Finally it offers a different reading of the history of EU environmental policy, stressing the role that contestation in general, and <b>dismantling</b> in particular, have played in shaping the environmental acquis...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 9 June 2016 Examining Board: Professor Youssef Cassis, EUI (Supervisor); Professor Anne Deighton, Oxford University (External Supervisor); Professor Federico Romero, EUI; Professor Gabriele Clemens, Hamburg University. The {{programme}} of <b>dismantling</b> German factories for reparations {{caused the}} biggest {{crisis in the}} relationship between British and the Germans during the apost-Second World War occupation years. By 1949, the peak year for <b>dismantling</b> in the British Zone, the Germans were convinced that the British, alone among the Allies, were pushing for continued <b>dismantling,</b> and that they were doing so for purely commercial reasons. The <b>dismantling</b> campaign has been almost exclusively by economic historian, with the consensus being that its effect was limited. This raises the question of why it turned into such a bitter political conflict. My thesis explores the <b>dismantling</b> programme from this angle. I show that the renewed <b>dismantling</b> programme from 1947 onwards caused rifts inwards in the British occupation apparatus, as the punitive aspects of the <b>dismantling</b> campaign and the strong German reaction against it started threatening what the British saw as their positive mission in Germany, re-educating the Germans. It caused a rift between the Allies, as the US Congress started a massive campaign to end <b>dismantling</b> in connection with the Marshall Aid, and with the French vacillating between ending and continuing <b>dismantling.</b> In Germany itself, the <b>dismantling</b> programme became an issue where the political parties, industry groups and labour unions sought to exploit the groundswell of popular discontent against <b>dismantling</b> for their own, wider political goals, often with a troublesome nationalistic rhetoric. <b>Dismantling</b> as a major political issue ended with the Petersberg agreement in November 1949. By this time the conflict over <b>dismantling</b> had festered for so long that it was relatively easy for the Adenauer government to sideline the British and focus their attentions on rapprochement with France and European economic integration. The most original part of the research focuses on how British debates on whether to proceed or end <b>dismantling,</b> and how British <b>dismantling</b> policies were shaped by other occupation goals focused on a particular British conception of power. The British increasingly saw <b>dismantling</b> as influencing British prestige, meant to compensate for lagging relative power. I define what the British meant by their prestige in this question, its imperial origins and how it failed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing waste streams in {{contemporary}} societies. Proper treatment and recovery of WEEE is an important challenge not only because of its content on hazardous substances but also because it contains significant quantities of valuable materials. The pre-processing stage of WEEE recycling plays a major role in the recovery network, in particular when carried out through manual <b>dismantling</b> processes. <b>Dismantling</b> allows components to be separated prior to further treatment. However, recycling organisations usually find this particular stage considerably time-consuming, and hence expensive, since products are not designed to be easily <b>dismantled.</b> One particular waste stream that could reduce <b>dismantling</b> costs through an improved design is the stream of Flat Panel Displays (FPD). However, little detailed data is nowadays available on the <b>dismantling</b> processes, which prevent designing FPD according to the requirements of treatment operators. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method for in-depth analysis of <b>dismantling</b> practices of electronic displays in order to obtain useful data for product design. The method is composed of three stages: (1) study definition, (2) data construction and (3) data analysis. The first stage allows setting out why, how and where the analysis will be performed. The second stage consists in describing <b>dismantling</b> operations in detail to construct a detailed and meaningful dataset. Finally, product indicators are developed and the best and worst design practices from a <b>dismantling</b> point of view are identified. The approach is illustrated through a case study on the manual <b>dismantling</b> of 12 FPD. The sample was <b>dismantled</b> at one of the European recycling facility representatives. Data on the <b>dismantling</b> time spent on each component, operation and tool was obtained. Collected data can be used as empirical evidence to support the development of quantitative ecodesign strategies. Some examples of ecodesign strategies that can significantly reduce the <b>dismantling</b> time of the sample are given.
