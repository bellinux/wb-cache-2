The geochemical model used {{was based on the}} stoichiometry dissolution and hydrolysis of different minerals associated with the comsumption of atmospheric/soil CO 2 by the rock weathering. This study confirms the important role of the Andes in the solute riverine transports of dissolved and particulate material by the Amazon, and it shows that the silicate weathering rate and the atmospheric/soil CO 2 consumed are higher in the Andes than {{in the rest of the}} Amazon Basin. The average silicate weathering rate estimated for the whole Amazon basin (14, 8 m/My) and the average specific fluxes of atmospheric/soil CO 2 consumed in the process (331 x 10 3) moles/km 2. y) is comparable to other estimations made for other tropical-equatorial environments...|$|E

It were used images from sensor CCD/CBERS- 2 (China and Brazil Earth Resort Satellites). "C" Factor {{is a combination of}} all relations from cover and management variables, and depends on the rainfall that occurs during the differents periods evaluated. Considering this definition, it was established a correlation among "C" Factor, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Rain Erosivity Index (EI), determined for differents phenological crop stages of the analysed cultures, intending to establish a regression equation to the "C" Factor prediction in areas where this information was not studied. The results showed a good correlation between NDVI and "C" factor of the Universal Soil Loss Equation and that is a powerfull tool to monitoring soil loss a long differents crops cicles.

40|$|A {{parallel}} computing plasma simulation environment has been implemented at Fraunhofer IST {{based on the}} Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo hybrid approach. Using massiv parallelization 3 d 3 v simulations of low temperature magnetron discharges could be performed within reasonable time. Comparisons with depth profile measurements of eroded magnetron targets and high speed photography of dual magnetron discharges have shown {{the reliability of the}} simulation results. Spatial discharge simulations with varying magnetron layouts have been analyzed for the cause of anomalous targets <b>erosin</b> in magnetron sputtering. The simluation showed that the plasma is confind where the magnetic field component perpendicular to the target surface is weakest. This region is referred to as confinement in our work. We found out that two kinds of confinement variations could cause plasma density aggregations in electron drift direction. The subsequent inhomogeneous ion bombardment yields the anomalous target erosion which limits the target material utilization. We state that most of the magnetron related erosion anomalies could be referred to these confinement variations in electron drift direction. According to our thesis we derived two mechanisms for anomalous target erosion in our magnetron sputtering simulation. Both mechanisms have been validated on a simulation basis as well as by experimental measurements...|$|E

El oro es de origen aluvial y se encuentra disperso en la matriz del conglomerado Alhambra, de edad Plioceno (de hace ~ 5 Ma), y procede de la <b>erosi??n</b> de los {{relieves}} metam??rficos de Sierra Nevada. La ley en oro es baja (0 ?? 5 gr/m 3). Dicha mina fue explotada en ??poca romana por el m??todo ???ruina montiun???, consistente en desmoronar los cerros aur??feros inyectando agua a trav??s de pozos y galer??as, y volvi?? a ser re-explotada a finales del siglo XIX por una compa????a minera francesa. En el itinerario que se propone se visitan los restos de las antiguas explotaciones y conducciones de agua y se discute el oro del oro y su viabilidad econ??mica. La gu??a incluye varios anexos con abundantes ilustraciones que facilitan la labor docente y/o de divulgaci??n. In Granada {{in southern}} Spain, at {{the outskirts of}} the Lancha del Genil suburb, there exists an abandoned gold mine. The gold, alluvial in origin, is found in the matrix of the Pliocene (~ 5 Ma years old) Alhambra conglomerate, which resulted from the erosion of the nearby metamorphic Sierra Nevada highland. The average gold content is low (0 ?? 5 gr/m 3). The mine is Roman and was exploited using the ???Ruina montiun??? method (by generating giant, artificial water-induced landslides). The mine was worked again in the late XIX century by a French company. A visit to the remains of the Roman and French works and water channels is the main target of the field trip. The origin of the gold is also discussed as well as the present-day, economic viability of the deposit. The field guide includes some additional information with plenty of illustrations to facilitate teaching and divulgation...|$|E
40|$|Esta dissertação tem como objeto de estudo a análise da política {{ambiental}} e o desenvolvimento urbano na Serra do Periperi. Tal análise partiu de preocupações concernentes a ocupação desordenada na Serra e aos problemas ambientais advindos dessa ocupação. Ao construir loteamentos e estradas, e realizar atividades mineradoras o homem alterou consideravelmente o equilíbrio natural da paisagem na Serra e ocasionou entre outras coisas, graves problemas ambientais, como a erosão das encostas da serra, desmatamentos, assoreamento e poluição do Rio Verruga. Assim em 1998 a Serra do Periperi foi decretada por parte do Poder Público Municipal como Área de Preservação Ambiental com uma Unidade de Conservação denominada Parque Municipal da Serra do Periperi essa política ambiental implementada na Serra visa coibir essa ocupação e proteger áreas que são de extrema importância ambiental para a cidade. Diante do exposto, visando refletir sobre a política ambiental na Serra do Periperi e as relações do processo de ocupação que o presente trabalho tem o objetivo de compreender como a expansão da malha urbana da cidade de Vitória da Conquista BA e as atividades mineradoras influenciaram nos processos de degradação ambiental na Serra do Periperi&# 65279;This present dissertation {{has as its}} aim {{of study}} {{an analysis of the}} environmental policy and the urban development at the Periperi Hill. Such analysis arose due to concerns related to the disordered occupation in that Hill and also due to the environmental problems caused by this occupation. By opening roads and developing areas for housing and mineral extraction activities, man has altered considerably the landscape natural balance in that hill and caused among other difficulties, grave environmental problems, such as the <b>erosin</b> at the hill coast, deforestation, obstruction and pollution of the Verruga River. Therefore, in 1998 it was decreed by the Municipal Public Power that Periperi Hill became an Environmental Preservation Area with a Unit of Conservation known as Periperi Hill Municipal Park, an environmental policy implemented at the Hill that aims to hinder this occupation and to protect areas that are of great environmental importance to the city. It looking at what is now exposed and aiming to consider the Periperi Hill s environmental policy and the relationship of the occupation process, that this present work has the objective of understanding how the expansion of the city s urban network in Vitória da Conquista BA and the mineral activities cause an influence in the process of environmental degradation at the Periperi Hil...|$|E
