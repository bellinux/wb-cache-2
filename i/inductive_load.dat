25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an <b>inductive</b> <b>load,</b> which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E

2500|$|Reactive {{power is}} {{measured}} in [...] "thousands of volt-ampere reactive-hours", (kvarh). By convention, a [...] "lagging" [...] or <b>inductive</b> <b>load,</b> such as a motor, will have positive reactive power. [...] A [...] "leading", or capacitive load, will have negative reactive power.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{difference}} between a lagging and leading power factor. The terms refer to whether the phase of the current is leading or lagging the phase of the voltage. A lagging power factor signifies that the load is inductive, as the load will “consume” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component [...] is positive as reactive power travels through the circuit and is “consumed” by the <b>inductive</b> <b>load.</b> A leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive, as the load “supplies” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component [...] is negative as reactive power is being supplied to the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Distortion of the {{electric}} current by loads is measured in several ways. [...] Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. [...] A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. [...] For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. [...] This {{can lead to a}} significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.|$|E

50|$|Real {{transmission}} lines typically serve <b>inductive</b> <b>loads,</b> {{which are the}} motors that exist everywhere in modern electronics and machines. Transferring {{a large amount of}} reactive power Q to <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> makes the line current lag voltage, and the voltage regulation is characterized by decrease in voltage magnitude. In transferring a large amount of real power P to real loads, current is mostly in phase with voltage. The voltage regulation in this scenario is characterized by a decrease in phase angle rather than magnitude.|$|R

50|$|An <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> {{consists}} of an iron-core reactive element which, when {{used in conjunction with}} a resistive load bank, creates a lagging power factor load. Typically, the <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc. With a resistive-inductive load bank, full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{new methods}} for further {{reducing}} the size and/or increasing the bandwidth (BW) {{of a class}} of miniaturized slot antennas are presented. This paper examines techniques such as parasitic coupling and <b>inductive</b> <b>loading</b> to achieve higher BW and further size reduction for this class of miniaturized slot antennas. The overall BW of a proposed double resonant antenna is shown to be {{increased by more than}} 94 % compared with a single resonant antenna occupying the same area. The behavior of miniaturized slot antennas, <b>loaded</b> with series <b>inductive</b> elements along the radiating section is also examined. The <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> are constructed by two balanced short circuited slot lines placed {{on opposite sides of the}} radiating slot. These <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> can considerably reduce the antenna size at its resonance. Prototypes of a double resonant antenna at 850 MHz and inductively loaded miniaturized antennas at around 1 GHz are designed and tested. Finally the application of both methods in a dual band miniaturized antenna is presented. In all cases measured and simulated results show excellent agreement.

50|$|When relay {{contacts}} open to interrupt a high current with an <b>inductive</b> <b>load,</b> a voltage spike will result, striking an arc across the contacts. If the voltage is high enough, an arc may be struck even without an <b>inductive</b> <b>load.</b> Regardless {{of how the}} arc forms, it will persist until the current through the arc falls to the point too low to sustain it. Arcing damages the electrical contacts, and a sustained arc may prevent the open contacts from removing power from the system being controlled.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental studies of voltage phenomena in the switching operations of vacuum switching devices made by various manufacturers in several different configurations of 6 kV, 10 kV, 20 kV and 35 kV networks. During switching-on operations of the <b>inductive</b> <b>loads,</b> re-ignition of the electric arc between the contacts of the vacuum switching devices appears. Each arc ignition appearance leads to overvoltages with gradients close to those of lightning overvoltages. Switching-off operations of the <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> with vacuum switching devices leads to the cutting of the current before it passed through a natural zero and the appearance of multiple re-ignition of the arc between their contacts. All this leads to significant overvoltages on the equipment insulation.
