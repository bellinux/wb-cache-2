40|$|The Internet {{network has}} {{received}} huge attentions {{by the research}} community. At a first glance, the network optimization and scalability issues dominate the efforts of researchers and vendors. Many results have been obtained in the last decades: the Internet’s architecture is optimized to be cheap, robust and ubiquitous. In contrast, such a network has never been perfectly secure. During all its evolution, the security threats of the Internet persist as a transversal and endless topic. Nowadays, the Internet network hosts a multitude of mission critical activities. The electronic voting systems and financial services are carried out through it. Governmental institutions, financial and business organizations depend on the performance and {{the security of the}} Internet. This role confers to the Internet network a critical characterization. At the same time, the Internet network is a vector of malicious activities, like Denial of Service attacks; many reports of attacks can be found in both academic outcomes and daily news. In order to mitigate this wide range of issues, many research efforts have been carried out in the past decades; unfortunately, the complex architecture and the scale of the Internet make hard the evaluation and the adoption of such proposals. In order to improve the security of the Internet, the research community can benefit from sharing real network data. Unfortunately, privacy and security concerns inhibit the release of these data: its suffices to imagine the big amount of private information (e. g., political preferences or religious belief) it is possible to get while reading the <b>Internet</b> <b>packets</b> <b>exchanged</b> between users and web services. This scenario motivates my research, and represents the context of this dissertation which contributes to the analysis of the security issues of the Internet infrastructures and describes relevant security proposals. In particular, the main outcomes described in this dissertation are: • the definition of a secure routing protocol for the Internet network able to provide cryptographic guarantees against false route announcement and invalid path attack; • the definition of a new obfuscation technique that allow the research community to publicly release their real network flows with formal guarantees of security and privacy; • the evidence of a new kind of leakage of sensitive informations obtained hacking the models used by sundry Machine Learning Algorithms...|$|R
50|$|PPP is {{commonly}} used as a data link layer protocol for connection over synchronous and asynchronous circuits, where it has largely superseded the older Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and telephone company mandated standards (such as Link Access Protocol, Balanced (LAPB) in the X.25 protocol suite). The only requirement for PPP is that the circuit provided be duplex. PPP was designed to work with numerous network layer protocols, including Internet Protocol (IP), TRILL, Novell's Internetwork <b>Packet</b> <b>Exchange</b> (IPX), NBF, DECnet and AppleTalk. Like SLIP, this is a full Internet connection over telephone lines via modem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{stochastic}} stability properties of certain networked control system. Specifically we study {{the stability of}} the Model-Based Network Control System introduced in [9] under time-varying communication. The Model-Based Network Control System uses knowledge of the plant {{to reduce the number of}} <b>packet</b> <b>exchanges</b> and thus the network traffic. Stability conditions for constant data <b>packet</b> <b>exchange</b> rates are analysed in [9, 10, 11]. Here we concentrate on the stochastic stability of the networked system when the <b>packet</b> <b>exchange</b> times are time varying and have some known statistical properties.

30|$|We have {{proposed}} two important mechanisms in G-ER, {{both in the}} form of cooperation inside the group. The first mechanism is the group-based <b>packet</b> <b>exchange.</b> Similar to [20 – 22], by treating each cluster/group as a single node, G-ER is a two-layer routing, including the inter-group routing and intra-group routing. The strategy of ER is adopted for the inter-group routing to <b>exchange</b> <b>packets</b> between groups, and a table-driven routing is employed for the intra-group routing to handle the packet delivery inside the group. Importantly, we employ the group-based <b>packet</b> <b>exchange</b> to expedite the packet delivery in this two-layer routing: when two nodes from two groups meet each other, other members in these two groups will also take this chance to deliver packets to the neighboring group. In contrast, the <b>packet</b> <b>exchange</b> in all DTN schemes mentioned above takes place only between two contacting nodes, which we refer to as the node-based <b>packet</b> <b>exchange.</b> The second mechanism is the buffer sharing inside a group, which is used to reduce the buffer requirement at one node in G-ER. This buffer sharing could be well supported by the nature of a group, i.e., the cooperation among group members. In addition, we study the performance of G-ER under group dynamics and find that the impact of group dynamics can be reduced by some proper buffer resource allocation in one group. Extensive simulations are conducted to show the advantages of G-ER in different scenarios, even with group dynamics.|$|R

30|$|Utilizing the {{dedicated}} CCC for control <b>packet</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{is a widely}} accepted assumption for distributed DSA protocols. In {{the dedicated}} CCC based protocols, because all control <b>packets</b> are <b>exchanged</b> on one channel, the SUs can conveniently obtain the information of their neighbor nodes through listening to the dedicated CCC, which can efficiently simplify the protocol architectures. However, some drawbacks are existed {{in this kind of}} protocols. First, a licensed channel may not exist in realistic CWNs. Second, it is easy to be affected by the PUs' traffic if an unlicensed channel acts as the dedicated CCC. Third, utilizing dedicated CCC may cause the CCC saturation problem. Although non-dedicated CCC based protocols can efficiently solve above problems, the control <b>packet</b> <b>exchanging</b> mechanism should be well designed, which causes that this kind of protocols usually have more complex architecture.|$|R
30|$|Compared {{with the}} single radio based {{protocols}}, the multi-radios based protocols usually allow the SUs to listening to the control <b>packets</b> <b>exchanges</b> all the time, thus reducing the packet collisions. Moreover, multiple channels can be used simultaneously if multiple data radios are equipped. However, generally speaking, the multi-radios based protocols have higher cost than the single radio based protocols. Although the single radio based protocols have lower cost and power consumption, how to schedule the radio to listen to control <b>packets</b> <b>exchanges</b> and to transmit data packets is a challenging task. In addition, the single radio based protocols are often suffered from the multi-channel hidden terminal problem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{deals with}} the problem of {{synchronizing}} multiple distributed databases over a broadcast network, such as satellite networks. The proposed method is based on introducing network coding techniques besides extending the well-known database reconciliation algorithm, the characteristic polynomial interpolation-based synchronization (CPISync). One key element is to elect a master node that manages the operations in a central manner. Performance is shown in terms of completion time for full synchronization, and average number of <b>packets</b> <b>exchange.</b> Compared to point-to-point and traditional broadcasting synchronization methods, the algorithm implementing network coding allows reaching the lower-bound for the number of <b>packets</b> <b>exchange.</b> Key words: multiple databases synchronization, network coding, broadcast channels, satellite communications...|$|R
