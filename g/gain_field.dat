25|$|The initial {{requirement}} was {{to raise}} an artillery regiment, an engineer squadron, an infantry battalion, a medical unit, and a service corps company. For {{much of the}} 1950s the army was preoccupied {{with the task of}} building itself and training existing and new personal. To this aim the British Army Training Team (BATT) advisory group carried out training for ex-members of the CDF within the Ceylon Army, senior officers were sent to the British Army Staff College, Camberley and some attached to units of the British Army of the Rhine to <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> experience. New officers were sent for training at Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst which continued until the 1960s and both officers and other ranks were sent to specialist training courses in Britain, India, Pakistan and Malaya. There were no formations and all units were structured to directly function under the Army Headquarters. However temporary field headquarters were to be formed at the time requirement arose.|$|E
500|$|In American football, {{intentionally}} conceded safeties are {{an uncommon}} strategy. Teams have utilized elective safeties to <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> {{position for a}} punt when pinned deep in their own territory and, when ahead {{near the end of}} a game, to run down the clock so as to deny the other team a chance to force a turnover or return a punt. Teams have also taken intentional safeties by kicking a loose ball out the back of their end zone, with the intent of preventing the defense from scoring a touchdown.|$|E

N3/PL then deployed their super-carrier and carrier fleet in the [...] "Wrecking Ball" [...] formation just off the system's space station, a formation which had previously defeated the CFC and Russian alliance.

Meanwhile, they deployed their sub-capital fleets to N3 staging systems, including I-NGI8 and GXK-7F, to delay any reinforcements.|$|E
40|$|SummaryGain fields, the eye-position {{modulation}} {{of visual}} responses, {{are thought to}} provide a mechanism by which the motor system can accurately calculate target position in space despite a constantly moving eye. Current gain-field models assume that the modulation of visual responses by eye position is accurate at all times, even around the time of a saccade. Here, we show that for at least 150  ms after a saccade, <b>gain</b> <b>fields</b> in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are unreliable. The majority of LIP cells with steady-state <b>gain</b> <b>fields</b> reflect the presaccadic eye position. The remainder of the cells have responses that cannot be predicted by their steady-state <b>gain</b> <b>fields.</b> Nonetheless, a monkey’s oculomotor performance is accurate during this time. These results suggest that current models built upon a simple gain-field algorithm cannot be {{used to calculate the}} position of a target in space that flashes briefly after a saccade...|$|R

2500|$|Following a {{defensive}} penalty, {{a team with}} possession may <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> position by kicking for touch; that is, by kicking {{the ball on the}} full over either of the touch lines. [...] Unlike Rugby Union, which brings the ball back into play with a line-out, the team with possession retains the ball by putting the ball back in play with a tap, in line from where the ball crossed the touch line. [...] This also gives that team a new set of six tackles.|$|E
5000|$|Neurons {{involved}} in <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> encoding work multiplicatively, taking the input from several {{together to form}} the <b>gain</b> <b>field.</b> [...] It is this process that allows the complexity of motor control. Instead of simply encoding {{the motion of the}} limb in which a specific motion is desired, the multiplicative nature of the <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> ensures that the positioning {{of the rest of the}} body is taken in to consideration. This process allows for motor coordination of flexible bimanual actions as opposed to restricting the individual to unimanual motion. [...] For example, when considering the movement of both arms, the body calls upon <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> models for each arm in order to compensate for the mechanical interactions created by both.|$|E

50|$|Early {{hypotheses}} of <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> encoding {{suggested that}} the <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> works {{as a model for}} motion additively. This would mean that if two limbs needed to move, models for each would be called separately but at the same time. However, more recent studies in which more complex motor movements are observed have found that the <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> is created multiplicatively in order to allow the body to adapt to the constantly changing frames of reference experienced in everyday life.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gain</b> <b>field</b> {{encoding}} is {{a hypothesis}} about the internal {{storage and processing}} of limb motion in the brain. In the motor areas of the brain, there are neurons which collectively {{have the ability to}} store information regarding both limb positioning and velocity in relation to both the body (intrinsic) and the individual's external environment (extrinsic). [...] The input from these neurons is taken multiplicatively, forming what is referred to as a <b>gain</b> <b>field.</b> [...] The <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> works as a collection of internal models off of which the body can base its movements. The process of encoding and recalling these models is the basis of muscle memory.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> {{activity}} {{is based in}} the premotor cortex found in the frontal lobe anterior to the primary motor cortex, however it receives input {{from a variety of}} locations in the brain. [...] These incoming signals provide frame of reference information through the individual's senses. Further evidence suggests that the cerebellum and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) also play major functional roles in <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> encoding. [...] The intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the <b>gain</b> <b>field</b> can be shown as products of the PPC. In Brodmann area 7 of the PPC, the positioning of objects with respect to the eyes is represented completely extrinsically with no input from the positioning of the body involved. [...] This opposes the case of other parts of the PPC such as Brodmann area 5 which represents objects in relation to body defined coordinates. Due to the extrinsic and intrinsic properties of motor functioning, it is speculated that these types of signals are both taken multiplicatively to form the <b>gain</b> <b>field.</b> With input from each area, a three-dimensional representation of the objects in space can be arranged for use {{by the rest of the}} motor system.|$|E
