5|$|Camouflage {{was first}} practiced <b>in</b> <b>simple</b> {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks {{required}} them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of camouflage have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels.|$|E
5|$|Case Closed was {{conceived}} in 1994, during {{the rise of}} mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the Kindaichi Case Files series; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday on January 19. Aoyama cites the stories of Arsène Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work. When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Each case spans several chapters (except {{for a handful of}} shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain the details of their solutions <b>in</b> <b>simple</b> terms; a database consisting of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In Shaanxi in {{the north}} of China, drum {{ensembles}} accompany yangge dance, and in the Tianjin area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the Fagu hui Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens of musicians. In Korea, a style of folk music called Nongak (farmers' music) or pungmul has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It is loud music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as the drums called janggu and puk, and the gongs ching and kkwaenggwari. It originated <b>in</b> <b>simple</b> work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.|$|E
5|$|Purandara Dasa (1484–1564), a {{wandering}} bard {{who visited}} Vijayanagara {{during the reign}} of King Achyuta Raya, is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages, although only about 1,000 songs are known today. Composed in various ragas, and often ending with a salutation to the Hindu deity Vittala, his compositions presented the essence of the Upanishads and the Puranas <b>in</b> <b>simple</b> yet expressive language. He also devised a system by which the common man could learn Carnatic music, and codified the musical composition forms svaravalis, alankaras and geethams. Owing to his contributions in music, Purandara Dasa earned the honorific Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ("Father of Carnatic Music").|$|E
