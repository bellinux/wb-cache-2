Both findings are in strong contrast to the previously studied substitution reaction of Cl - + CH 3 I [Science 2008, 319, 183 - 186] at all but the lowest collision energies, a discrepancy that was not captured in a subsequent study at only a low collision energy [J.

Current subtractive solutions fail {{in areas where}} the input image is dark (by either retaining some residual ghost or eliminating important surface detail). Our solution automatically solves for a perceptually optimal compensation that diminishes the appearance of ghosts and reveals more detail in these problem regions. Note: All deghosting results in this paper have been captured with a camera through a polarizing filter; All descattering results are simulations. This paper addresses the problem of unintended light contributions due to physical properties of display systems. An example of such unintended contribution is crosstalk in stereoscopic 3 D display systems, often referred to as ghosting. Ghosting results in a reduction of visual quality, and may lead to an uncomfortable viewing experience. The latter is due to conflicting (depth) edge cues, which can hinder the human visual system (HVS) proper fusion of stereo images (stereopsis). We propose an automatic, perceptually-based computational compensation framework, which formulates pollution elimination as a minimization problem. Our method aims to distribute the error introduced by the pollution in a perceptually optimal manner. As a consequence ghost edges are smoothed locally, resulting in a more comfortable stereo viewing experience. We show how to make the computation tractable by exploiting the structure of the resulting problem, and also propose a perceptually-based pollution prediction.

Most notably, significant nuclear variability (a decrease of ~ 45 % in approximately 6 hours) at energies above 2 keV indicates that Chandra has probed within light hours of the central black hole.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the radiation dose reduction to the gonads and its effect on image quality when a wrap-around male pediatric gonad shield was used during CT scanning. This information is obtained to assist the attending radiologist in the decision to utilize such male gonadal shields in pediatric imaging practice. Methods The dose reduction to the gonads was measured for both direct radiation and for <b>indirect</b> <b>scattered</b> radiation from the abdomen. A 6 cm 3 ion chamber (Model 10 X 5 - 6, Radcal Corporation, Monrovia, CA) was placed on a Humanoid real bone pelvic phantom at a position of the male gonads. When exposure measurements with shielding were made, a 1 mm lead wrap-around gonadal shield was placed around the ion chamber sensitive volume. Results The use of the shields reduced scatter dose to the gonads by a factor of about 2 with no appreciable loss of image quality. The shields reduced the direct beam dose by a factor of about 35 at the expense of extremely poor CT image quality due to severe streak artifacts. Conclusion Images in the direct exposure case are not useful due to these severe artifacts and the difficulties in positioning these shields on patients in the scatter exposure case may not be warranted by the small absolute reduction in scatter dose unless it is expected that the patient will be subjected to numerous future CT scans. </p...|$|R

The Sun may therefore be said to illuminate, which {{is a measure of the}} light within a specific sensitivity range. Many animals (including humans) have a sensitivity range of approximately 400-700 nm, and given optimal conditions the absorption and scattering by Earth's atmosphere produces illumination that approximates an equal-energy illuminant for most of this range. The useful range for color vision in humans, for example, is approximately 450-650 nm. Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise, the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate.

40|$|The main {{motivation}} for this thesis is {{the physics of}} the very early universe and of heavy ion collisions. These two fields are described using quantum field theory. In order to do calculations in (quantum) field theory one often makes use of perturbation theory and/or the imaginary time formalism. However, if one wants to describe nonequilibrium processes such as phase transitions or thermalization, in which nonperturbative effects play a role, new approximation methods are needed. Commonly used nonperturbative real-time approximation schemes include the large-n, the Hartree and the classical approximations. They all have their limitations: the related large-n and Hartree include quantum corrections, but fail to properly describe thermalization, {{due to the lack}} of direct scattering. The classical approximation does include scattering and leads to (classical) thermalization, but has problems with the Rayleigh Jeans divergencies and cannot describe quantum thermalization. More recently, approximations based on an expansion of the 2 PI effective action or on a truncation of the Schwinger-Dyson equations, both including direct scattering, have been shown to lead to thermalization. These methods give good results, but the treatment of inhomogeneous systems seems numerically too demanding. In this thesis an approximation is introduced and studied, which tries to improve on both the classical and the Hartree approximation. In the Hartree approximation the initial density matrix is taken to be Gaussian, leading to the absence of direct scattering terms. In the classical approximation one usually writes the initial density matrix as an ensemble average over initial conditions. By expanding a general density matrix on a (over complete) basis of Gaussian density matrices, one can use the Hartree or Gaussian approximation to calculate the dynamics in each of the `realizations' and take an ensemble average to allow for more general initial density matrices. At the same time these `realizations' can be inhomogeneous (i. e. space dependent), leading to <b>indirect</b> <b>scattering</b> and thus removing the principal obstruction for thermalization. The thesis examines this approximation in a simple scalar ϕ^ 4 theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. In the first chapters it studies if the model thermalizes starting from some out of equilibrium initial condition. Starting at low momenta the system indeed thermalizes. However this process only slowly proceeds to higher momenta, and a full quantum thermal distribution is never found. Deviations start to emerge and the system evolves towards a classical distribution, caused by the fact that the Hartree equations of motion can be derived from a Hamiltonian. Timescales for both processes, thermalization and the flow to classical behaviour are derived and studied in both phases of the theory. Because of the numerical task involved, further approximations are also investigated, especially to allow for the extension to 3 + 1 dimensions. The final chapter studies the topological defects present in the theory, kinks and antikinks. It makes a comparison between the classical theory and the Hartree approximation. As initial conditions both semi-stationary and colliding configurations are studied. Some important differences between the classical and quantum theory are found...|$|R

The possibility to use split solitons for <b>indirect</b> measurements of <b>scattering</b> lengths is also suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{intermediate}} valence compound YbAl 3 {{exhibits a}} broad magnetic excitation in the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum with characteristic energy E 150 meV, {{equal to the}} Kondo energy (TK~ 600 – 700 K). In the low temperature (T<Tcoh~ 40 K) Fermi liquid state, however, a new peak in the scattering occurs at E 233 meV, which lies in the hybridization gap that exists in this compound. We report inelastic neutron scattering results for a single-crystal sample. The scattering at energies near E 1 qualitatively has the momentum (Q) dependence expected for interband <b>scattering</b> across the <b>indirect</b> gap. The <b>scattering</b> near E 2 has a very different Q dependence: it is a weak function of Q over a large fraction of the Brillouin zone and is smallest near (1 / 2, 1 / 2, 1 / 2). A possibility is that the peak at E 2 arises from a spatially localized excitation in the hybridization gap...|$|R
40|$|Charge-charge, current-current and Raman {{correlation}} {{functions are}} derived in a consistent way using the unified response theory. The theory {{is based on}} the improved description of the conduction electron coupling to the external electromagnetic fields, distinguishing further the direct and <b>indirect</b> (assisted) <b>scattering</b> on the quasi-static disorder. The two scattering channels are distinguished in terms of the energy and momentum conservation laws. The theory is illustrated on the Emery three-band model for the normal state of the underdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates which includes the incoherent electron scattering on the disorder associated with the quasi-static fluctuations around the static antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering. It is shown, for the first time consistently, that the incoherent indirect processes dominate the low-frequency part of the Raman spectra, while the long-range screening which is dynamic removes the long-range forces in the $A_{ 1 g}$ channel. In the mid-infrared frequency range the coherent AF processes are dominant. In contrast to the nonresonant $B_{ 1 g}$ response, which is large by itself, the resonant interband transitions enhance both the $A_{ 1 g}$ and $B_{ 1 g}$ Raman spectra to comparable values, in good agreement with experimental observation. It is further argued that the AF correlations give rise to the mid-infrared peak in the $B_{ 1 g}$ Raman spectrum, accompanied by a similar peak in the optical conductivity. The doping behavior of these peaks is shown to be correlated with the linear doping dependence of the Hall number, as observed in all underdoped high-$T_c$ compounds.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{electromagnetic}} interaction between a point charge travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and the waveguide itself. By using a convenient expansion of the Mathieu functions, useful in particular for treating a variety of problems in applied mathematics and physics with elliptic geometry, we first obtain the longitudinal electromagnetic field of a point charge (Green function) in free space in terms of elliptical coordinates. This expression allows, then, to calculate the scattered field due to the boundary conditions in our geometry. By summing {{the contribution of the}} direct or primary field and the <b>indirect</b> field <b>scattered</b> by the boundary, after a careful choice of some expansion expressions, we derive a novel formula of the longitudinal electric field, in any transverse position of the elliptical cross section, generated by the charge moving along the longitudinal axis of the waveguide. The obtained expression is represented in a closed form, it can be differentiated and integrated, {{it can be used to}} fully describe the radiation process of a particle beam travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and it is valid for any elliptic geometry. The equations are used to evaluate the coupling impedance due to indirect space charge in case of elliptical geometry. In addition, they are useful as preliminary studies for the determination of the coupling impedance in different cases involving elliptic vacuum chambers, as, for example, the effect of the finite conductivity of the beam pipe wall or the geometrical variation of the vacuum chamber due to elliptic step transitions existing in some accelerators...|$|R
