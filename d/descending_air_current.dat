The effects categorized in this study contain (1) the rain cloud back-built by the gust front originated from the <b>descending</b> <b>air</b> <b>current</b> inside of the convective cloud, (2) the stationary and long-lasting rainfall line generated from the ascending air motion along the mountain slope, (3) the newly evolutive convective cloud, which caused by the strong gust front from thundercloud in the downward slope of the mountain valley, and (4) the enhancement of rainfall generated by the merge of two kinds of rain systems of different type...|$|E
5000|$|Thunderstorm — A {{thunderstorm}} {{is a type}} {{of storm}} that generates lightning and the attendant thunder. It is normally accompanied by heavy precipitation. Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, with the highest frequency in tropical rainforest regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability. These storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates deep, rapid, upward motion in the atmosphere. The heat energy creates powerful rising <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> that swirl upwards to the tropopause. Cool <b>descending</b> <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> produce strong downdraughts below the storm. After the storm has spent its energy, the rising currents die away and downdraughts break up the cloud. Individual storm clouds can measure 2-10 km across.|$|R

Attractive aspects of ballooning include the exceptional quiet (except when the propane burners are firing), {{the lack of a}} feeling of movement, and the bird's-eye view. Since the balloon moves with the direction of the winds, the passengers feel absolutely no wind, except for brief periods during the flight when the balloon climbs or <b>descends</b> into <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> of different direction or speed.|$|R
40|$|Taylor Glacier, {{an outlet}} of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, {{flows through the}} Transantarctic Mountains and terminates in the Dry Valleys. Understanding how this glacier fluctuates is {{important}} for studies of glacial geology, paleoclimate, ice dynamics, and ecology. Sublimation is the primary mass-loss process {{for most of the}} glacier. Four years of specific balance measurements from the ablation zone show sublimation rates up to 40 cm per year. We used data from an array of weather stations as inputs to a model for latent heat flux and hence sublimation rate. Calculated and measured ablation rates agree to within uncertainties, indicating that wind speed and vapor pressure gradient (a function of temperature and humidity) are the governing variables, as expected from theory. Measurements and model results together allowed us to examine the spatial and temporal variations of sublimation on the glacier. On average, sublimation is about two times faster in summer than winter. Rapid sublimation occurs during storms and katabatic wind events, but such periods contribute less to the annual total than do slow, persistent losses. Spatially, sublimation reaches a maximum midway along the glacier, where <b>descending</b> surface <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> are focused by the topography of the aptly-named tributary, Windy Gully...|$|R
