5|$|Design of the FR-1 {{began in}} 1943 to a {{proposal}} instigated by Admiral <b>John</b> <b>S.</b> McCain, Sr. for a mixed-powered fighter because early jet engines had sluggish acceleration {{that was considered}} unsafe and unsuitable for carrier operations. Ryan received a contract for three XFR-1 prototypes and one static test airframe on 11 February 1943 with the first two prototypes delivered in 14 months. Another contract was placed for 100 aircraft on 2 December 1943 and a later contract on 31 January 1945 increased the total of FR-1s on order to 700.|$|E

5|$|In August 1835, at {{the strong}} urging of Ohio's Congressmen, President Jackson removed Mason as Michigan's Territorial Governor and {{appointed}} <b>John</b> <b>S.</b> ("Little Jack") Horner in his stead. Before his replacement arrived, Mason ordered 1,000 Michigan militiamen to enter Toledo {{and prevent the}} symbolically important first session of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas. While the idea was popular with Michigan residents, the effort failed: the judges held a midnight court before quickly retreating south of the Maumee River, where Ohio forces were positioned.|$|E

A voter and prospective candidate, <b>John</b> <b>S.</b> Trinsey,Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E

5|$|Mikawa's {{run down}} the Slot was not {{detected}} by Allied forces.

5|$|After {{service in}} World War I and {{a law degree}} from Yale, Dilworth practiced law in Philadelphia. He and Clark were allies in the anti-corruption reform effort that had swept the city four years earlier. Dilworth had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as his {{campaign}} manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. He resigned that post to run for governor in 1950, but was defeated by Republican <b>John</b> <b>S.</b> Fine. Democratic party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. He won, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. In the primary election in May, Dilworth easily defeated his underfunded opponent, William A. Paschall, a local meat dealer.|$|E
