50|$|Born in Frederiksberg, Hansen {{started his}} career with Copenhagen club BK Frem in the amateur-only Danish league. He played as a left <b>inside</b> <b>wing,</b> was a {{world-class}} header of the ball, and could kick the ball equally hard with both legs. With BK Frem, Hansen won the 1944 Danish championship, and was the top goal-scorer of the 1948 Danish championship tournament.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, {{a ground}} loop is a rapid {{rotation}} of a fixed-wing {{aircraft in the}} horizontal plane (yawing) while on the ground. Aerodynamic forces may cause the advancing wing to rise, which may then cause the other wingtip to touch the ground. In severe cases (particularly if the ground surface is soft), the <b>inside</b> <b>wing</b> can dig in, causing the aircraft to swing violently or even cartwheel.|$|E
5000|$|Fairings {{of various}} kinds, such as blisters, pylons and wingtip pods, {{containing}} equipment which cannot fit <b>inside</b> the <b>wing,</b> and whose only aerodynamic {{purpose is to}} reduce the drag created by the equipment.|$|R
50|$|The HP-17 is {{all-metal}} in construction, {{except for}} its foam wing ribs. The wing features water ballast carried <b>inside</b> the <b>wing</b> spar. The wing also has full-span flaps and spoilerons {{in place of}} ailerons.|$|R
5000|$|Coates is [...] {{in height}} and played at <b>inside</b> forward or <b>wing</b> half.|$|R
50|$|The {{geometry}} of most aileron linkages can be configured {{so as to}} bias the travel further upward than downward. By excessively deflecting the upward aileron, profile drag is increased rather than reduced and separation drag further aids in producing drag on the <b>inside</b> <b>wing,</b> producing a yaw force {{in the direction of}} the turn. Though not as efficient as rudder mixing, aileron differential is very easy to implement on almost any airplane and offers the significant advantage of reducing the tendency for the wing to stall at the tip first by limiting the downward aileron deflection and its associated effective increase in angle of attack.|$|E
5000|$|Control {{reversal}} {{also affected}} the Gossamer Condor, the Kremer Prize-winning human-powered airplane. When a wing warping mechanism was tried {{as a solution}} to a long-running turning problem, the effect was to turn the airplane in the opposite direction to that expected by conventional airplane knowledge. When the Condor was rigged [...] "conventionally", the <b>inside</b> <b>wing</b> slowed down so much that it settled to the ground. By employing [...] "backwards" [...] wired wing-warping, the inside wingtip angle of attack was increased so that the added drag slowed that wing while the added lift allowed the airfoil to stay aloft at a slower speed. The tilted canard could then complete the turn.|$|E
50|$|For the {{conventional}} control-line system, {{tension in the}} lines is required to provide control. Line tension is maintained largely by centrifugal force. To increase line tension, models may be built or adjusted in various ways. Rudder offset and thrust vectoring (tilting the engine toward the outside) yaw the model outward. The position where the lines exit the wing can compensate for the tendency of the aerodynamic drag of the lines to yaw the model inboard. Weight on the outside wing, an <b>inside</b> <b>wing</b> that is longer or has more lift than the outside wing (or even no outside wing at all) and the torque of a left rotating propeller (or flying clockwise) tend to roll the model toward the outside. Wing tip weights, propeller torque, and thrust vectoring are more effective when the model is going slowly, while rudder offset and other aerodynamic effects have more influence on a fast moving model.|$|E

50|$|Water ballast bags <b>inside</b> the <b>wings</b> enable {{loadings}} up to 50 kg/m². Two {{ballast tanks}} {{integrated into the}} rudder fin will keep the centre of gravity within its optimum range, compensating for ballast changes and heavier pilots.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 October 1994, Hultgreen {{died when}} her F-14A-95-GR, BuNo 160390, coded [...] "NH 103", crashed on {{approach}} to [...] The incident occurred {{off the coast}} of San Diego after a routine training mission. Finding herself overshooting the landing area centerline, Hultgreen attempted to correct her approach by applying left rudder pedal, which caused the nose to disrupt the airflow over the left (<b>inside)</b> <b>wing,</b> as well as the airflow to the left engine intake. (The approach turn stall, aerodynamic effect and the appropriate recovery technique were taught throughout the period that Hultgreen completed primary (undergraduate) flight training.) The left-hand engine suffered a compressor stall and lost power—a well-known deficiency characteristic of the F-14A's TF30-P-414A engine when inlet air was no longer flowing straight into it. The F-14 NATOPS flight manual warned against excess yaw for this reason. Loss of an F-14 engine results in asymmetric thrust, which can exceed rudder authority, especially at low speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Coordinated flight {{indication}} {{is obtained}} {{by using an}} inclinometer, which is recognized as the [...] "ball in a tube". An inclinometer contains a ball sealed inside a curved glass tube, which also contains a liquid {{to act as a}} damping medium. The original form of the indicator is in effect a spirit level with the tube curved in the opposite direction and a bubble replacing the ball. In some early aircraft the indicator was merely a pendulum with a dashpot for damping.The ball gives an indication of whether the aircraft is slipping, skidding or in coordinated flight. The ball's movement is caused by the force of gravity and the aircraft's centripetal acceleration. When the ball is centered {{in the middle of the}} tube, the aircraft is said to be in coordinated flight. If the ball is on the <b>inside</b> (<b>wing</b> down side) of a turn, the aircraft is slipping. And finally, when the ball is on the outside (wing up side) of the turn, the aircraft is skidding.|$|E
40|$|Structural {{vibrations}} {{can have}} severe consequences on airplane design like fatigue, aeroelastic instability and reduced manoeuvrability. Fuel sloshing <b>inside</b> <b>wing</b> tanks can increase these problems. This work {{is intended to}} model a system that consists of a cantilever aluminum plate with a fluid tank near the free tip. Piezoelectric patches are used to excite the system. Three different methodologies were used to obtain a state-space model of the system: analytical (exact) solutions of simplified problems, numerical approximated methods and system identification techniques. Results show good agreement between theory and experiments...|$|E

40|$|Control surface {{effectiveness}} {{is an important}} parameter for any aeroplane. For a hypersonic aircraft, though the power required to operate the flaps is determined by low speed flying conditions, {{it is imperative to}} know the effect of flaps at hypersonic speeds. Hence, studies have been done on this topic by aerodynamicists for over 40 years. In spite of this, only a limited data is available in the literature on this subject. This paper discusses the experimental study of the effect of sweep on the aerodynamic characteristics of thin slab delta wings with flaps at hypersonic speeds. For the purpose of this investigation, a novel special thin six-component balance, which has a thickness of 4 mm and can be housed <b>inside</b> <b>wings</b> with 8 mm thickness, has been designed.
