500|$|Acne inversa (L. [...] invertō, [...] "upside down") and {{acne rosacea}} (rosa, [...] "rose-colored" [...] + -āceus, [...] "forming") {{are not true}} forms of acne and {{respectively}} refer to the skin conditions <b>hidradenitis</b> <b>suppurativa</b> (HS) and rosacea. Although HS shares certain common features with acne vulgaris, such as a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris, the condition otherwise lacks the defining features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disorder.|$|E
500|$|Shuster {{went on to}} {{consider}} the potential psychosocial effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that <b>hidradenitis</b> <b>suppurativa</b> produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found [...] "much evidence" [...] in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop his theory of alienation.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, a retrodiagnosis of Marx's {{skin disease}} {{was made by}} {{dermatologist}} Sam Shuster of Newcastle University and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from <b>hidradenitis</b> <b>suppurativa,</b> a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of apocrine ducts opening into hair follicles. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence {{would not have been}} known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the Marx/Engels Collected Works. There, [...] "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, perianal, genital (penis and scrotum) and suprapubic regions and inner thighs, [...] "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis [...] "can now be made definitively".|$|E
2500|$|Predisposing {{conditions}} for cellulitis include insect or spider bite, blistering, animal bite, tattoos, pruritic (itchy) skin rash, recent surgery, athlete's foot, dry skin, eczema, injecting drugs (especially subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or where an attempted intravenous injection [...] "misses" [...] or blows the vein), pregnancy, diabetes, and obesity, which can affect circulation, {{as well as}} burns and boils, though debate exists as to whether minor foot lesions contribute. [...] Occurrences of cellulitis may also {{be associated with the}} rare condition <b>hidradenitis</b> <b>suppurativa</b> or dissecting cellulitis.|$|E
2500|$|TNF {{promotes}} the inflammatory response, which, in turn, causes {{many of the}} clinical problems associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, <b>hidradenitis</b> <b>suppurativa</b> and refractory asthma. [...] These disorders are sometimes treated by using a TNF inhibitor. This inhibition can be achieved with a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab (Remicade) binding directly to TNFα, adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) or with a decoy circulating receptor fusion protein such as etanercept (Enbrel) which binds to TNFα with greater affinity than the TNFR.|$|E
2500|$|Used externally, {{it is an}} {{antiseptic}} and disinfectant, and is used 5 to 10% in ointments in {{the treatment}} of chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis, <b>hidradenitis</b> <b>suppurativa,</b> and eczema of a sub-acute character. It is present in over-the-counter topical acne treatments at 2% or less concentration, and in prescription treatments at higher concentrations. Weak, watery solutions of resorcinol (25 to 35 g/kg) are useful in allaying the itching in erythematous eczema. A 2% solution used as a spray has been used with marked effect in hay fever and in whooping cough. In the latter disease 0.6 mL of the 2% solution has been given internally. It can be included as an anti-dandruff agent in shampoo or in sunscreen cosmetics. It has also been employed {{in the treatment of}} gastric ulcers in doses of 125 to 250mg in pills, and is said to be analgesic and haemostatic in its ...|$|E
