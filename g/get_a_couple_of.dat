For guys to have success where it maybe goes against the grain, against the culture.... I know I {{probably}} didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I {{was going to do}} it.... For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E
500|$|Hancock {{began to}} feel the {{pressure}} of directing his first epic adventure film [...] "with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas". The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after {{a meeting with the}} producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for Rome and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months. Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still couldn't swim or bite after a year and a half; [...] "You <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> shots and [...] breaks." [...] Echoing the first film's production, Carl Gottlieb was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence. Gottlieb wrote on location at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, Feldman threw {{seven innings}} of shutout ball against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win. [...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> runs early, and you feel you have a 'W' in hand. [...] He has been unbelievable this year when he steps on the mound.... He just keeps getting better." ...|$|E

50|$|Amell's first {{role was}} Daniel Murtaugh in Cheaper by the Dozen 2, which filmed in the Muskoka Region of Ontario.

500|$|The {{division}} of royalties {{was a source}} of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for [...] "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part [...] "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: [...] "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> things on there." [...] Mason recalled: [...] "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." [...] Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: [...] "Animals...wasn't a fun record to make... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band... that it was only because of him that [...] were still going... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire batted on {{for another}} 49 overs, scoring 195 for 6 declared, and setting Somerset a target of 247 runs in 31 overs. Paul Horton and Loye put on 94 for the first wicket. But all in all, taking 61 overs to score 195 was hardly {{declaration}} batting. Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, [...] "To <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> fifties against a pretty good attack is a good start. It was a pretty difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and I was disappointed to miss out. Getting a century is a psychological thing for a batsman. I don't set myself goals or anything like that, but it's always nice to get a hundred." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E

5000|$|In later {{commentary}} the Washington Post (the original source) described McCain's {{attempts to}} connect Obama with Franklin Raines {{based on their}} reporting as [...] "a stretch" [...] and said all reporting they did about the matter actually stems from a single conversation a reporter had with Raines in which she recalls Raines said he [...] "had <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> calls from the Obama campaign".

5000|$|Just as the Dukes’ {{management}} {{were coming}} to terms with dropping the home point against one set of ‘Tigers’, the trip north to face the Glasgow Tigers in the return match a few days later brought the smiles back on their faces. With Jay <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> wins in his last match for the Dukes, a rare away win from Kentwell and a solid 5 paid 6 from Les Sharpe, there was finally some support for the heat leaders and the Dukes came away with a solid 44-34 victory.

60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Juno came confidingly on, shaping her course rather more to {{windward}} than usual even, {{on account of}} the lightness of the breeze. This effectually prevented her seeing or being seen from the canoes; the parties diagonally drawing nearer, in utter ignorance of each other's existence. As for Unus, he manoeuvred quite skilfully. After <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles off the land, he swam directly to windward; and it was well he did, the course of the boat barely permitting his getting well on her weather-bow, {{when it was time to}} think of boarding.|$|R

60|$|At dinner Jacques {{told his}} comrades {{that he was}} going to remain behind and act as {{signalman}} for them. A good deal of regret was expressed by his shipmates, many of whom came like himself from Dunkirk, and had known him from a boy.

5000|$|In {{a review}} of Harley's 1979 concert at the Hammersmith Odeon, Kelly Pike of Record Mirror said: [...] "Steve Harley has been away too long.
