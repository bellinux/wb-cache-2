40|$|In this review, we {{summarize}} the current {{knowledge about the}} membranous replication factories of members of plus-strand (+) RNA viruses. We discuss primarily the architecture of these complex membrane rearrangements, because this topic emerged {{in the last few}} years as electron tomography has become more widely available. A <b>general</b> <b>denominator</b> is that two “morphotypes” of membrane alterations can be found that are exemplified by flaviviruses and hepaciviruses: membrane invaginations towards the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and double membrane vesicles, representing extrusions also originating from the ER, respectively. We hypothesize that either morphotype might reflect common pathways and principles that are used by these viruses to form their membranous replication compartments...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{relevance}} of mitochondrial dysfunction as to pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction and failure in sepsis is controversial. This focused review evaluates {{the evidence for}} impaired mitochondrial function in sepsis. Design Review of original studies in experimental sepsis animal models and clinical studies on mitochondrial function in sepsis. In vitro studies solely on cells and tissues were excluded. PubMed was searched for articles published between 1964 and July 2012. Results Data from animal experiments (rodents and pigs) and from clinical studies of septic critically ill patients and human volunteers were included. A clear pattern of sepsis-related changes in mitochondrial function is missing in all species. The wide range of sepsis models, length of experiments, {{presence or absence of}} fluid resuscitation and methods to measure mitochondrial function may contribute to the contradictory findings. A consistent finding was the high variability of mitochondrial function also in control conditions and between organs. Conclusion Mitochondrial function in sepsis is highly variable, organ specific and changes over the course of sepsis. Patients who will die from sepsis may be more affected than survivors. Nevertheless, the current data from mostly young and otherwise healthy animals does not support the view that mitochondrial dysfunction is the <b>general</b> <b>denominator</b> for multiple organ failure in severe sepsis and septic shock. Whether this is true if underlying comorbidities are present, especially in older patients, should be addressed in further studies...|$|E
40|$|A major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between fraction-identification rule abstraction and training exemplars. Fractions can be identified with at least two different rules. One of these, the denominator rule, is general in that it yields correct responses across a wide variety of fraction identification problems. The second, the one-element rule, is appropriate only when the number of elements in the set and the denominator-specified number of subsets are equivalent. Because these rules are not equally serviceable, a question of major importance is what factors determine which of the two fraction identification rules a child will learn during training. The main hypothesis within this study specified that the nature of the fraction identification rule abstracted by a learner would be influenced by the nature of the examples used in training. It was further hypothesized that mastery of the denominator rule would positively affect performance on one-element problems, and that denominator-rule problem errors consistent with the one-element rule would occur significantly more frequently than would be expected by chance. The study addressed two additional questions. These related to recent work in the area of information processing and concerned both changes in learner behavior across training/posttesting sessions and consistency between verbal reports of thinking processes and the fraction rules hypothesized to control fraction identification. A pretest was used to determine eligibility to participate in the study. Eighty-two children incapable of set/subset fraction identification participated in the study. Two additional children were involved in an exploratory phase. The children ranged in age from six to ten and in grade level from one to four. The participants were mainly from middle and lower-class Anglo and Mexican-American homes. Children were randomly assigned to one of two training groups. In both training groups learners were provided, through symbolic (verbal) modeling, the <b>general</b> <b>denominator</b> rule for fraction identification. Children in one training group were also provided examples of fraction identification requiring the denominator rule. In the second training group children were provided simple examples in keeping with the denominator rule stated as part of instruction and yet also in keeping with the unstated one-element rule. A modified path analysis procedure was used to assess the effects of training group assignment on fraction identification performance. Results of this analysis suggest a training group main effect. That is, children's performance on fraction identification posttest problems was in keeping with rules associated with the training examples they had been provided. The results suggest that the strongest effects of training were related to performance on denominator rule problems in that the odds of passing the denominator rule posttest were 11. 52 times greater for children taught with denominator-rule exemplars than for children taught with the one-element exemplars. The findings also suggest that performance on either of the fraction identification tasks influenced performance on the other. A further finding was that training with the one-element exemplars was associated with performance congruent with inappropriate use of the one-element rule. Recall that the one-element rule was never stated and that the exemplars, while compatible with the one-element rule were equally compatible with the stated denominator rule. Protocols from the children in the exploratory portion of the study suggest that the child taught with the ambiguous exemplars did abstract the one-element rule while the child taught with the denominator rule exemplars abstracted the denominator rule. The protocols also suggest that the child taught with the denominator rule made changes in his thinking as training and posttesting progress progressed...|$|E

The results confirm the fact that countries tend to cluster into larger groups the more <b>general</b> their <b>denominator</b> is, say, political legacy, historical circumstances or shared ideology. At the same time, a set of group behavioral patterns suggests that a better understanding of regional effects of integration strongly relates to a similarly better representation of regional groupings based on comparable competitive evolutions.

40|$|Clinical {{findings}} have linked multiple {{risk factors and}} associated pathologies to Alzheimerś disease (AD). Amongst them are vascular risk factors such as hypertension and pathologies such as stroke. Coexistence of AD and these associated pathologies worsenes dementia, the clinical hallmark of the disease, as compared to pure AD. One <b>general</b> common <b>denominator</b> of these associated pathologies {{is the presence of}} hypoxic tissue conditions. It was asked the question, whether there exists a mutual, causal interaction between hypoxia and AD pathology, that could explain the clinical observations. Alternatively, the worsened clinical state of multiple brain pathologies could s̈implyb̈e the consequence of multimorbidity, i. e. accumulated disease load, without any causal interaction between the constituents. To approach this question whether hypoxia influences AD progression, use was made of a murine animal model of AD (transgenic mice: APPswe, PSEN 1 dE). Animals of two ages (8 and 14 months, ÿoungänd öldr̈espectively) and two genotypes (transgenic and wild- type) were either treated under hypoxia or normoxia, corresponding to 8...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} countries, {{a number}} of factors put indigenous peoples at increased risk of HIV infection. National surveillance data between 1999 and 2008 provided diagnoses for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Australia), First Nations, Inuit and Métis (Canada excluding Ontario and Quebec) and Māori (New Zealand). Each country provided similar data for a non-indigenous comparison population. Direct standardisation used the 2001 Canadian Aboriginal male population for comparison of five-year diagnosis rates in 1999 – 2003 and 2004 – 2008. Using the <b>general</b> population as <b>denominators,</b> we report diagnosis ratios for presumed heterosexual transmission, {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IDU). Age standardised HIV diagnosis rates in indigenous peoples in Canada in 2004 – 2008 (178. 1 and 178. 4 / 100 000 for men and women respectively) were higher than in Australia (48. 5 and 12. 9 / 100 000) and New Zealand (41. 9 and 4. 3 / 100 000). Higher HIV diagnosis rates related to heterosexual contact among Aboriginal peoples, especially women, in Canada confirm a widening epidemic beyond the conventional risk groups. This potential of a generalised epidemic requires urgent attention in Aboriginal communities; available evidence can inform policy and action by all stakeholders. Although less striking in Australia and New Zealand, these findings may be relevant to indigenous peoples in other countries...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this work}} has been to {{investigate}} methodological issues connected to long-term follow-up of infections diseases. The work extended to prevalent cohorts in <b>general.</b> The common <b>denominator</b> for the main methodological efforts in these four papers is issues connected to selection bias. In the first three papers methods for visualizing selection bias in prevalent cohorts were explored and different approaches to adjust for this bias discussed. In the fourth paper, capture-recapture modeling {{was used to examine}} ascertainment level for liver cancer in the Swedish Cancer Register. Study 1 : In this study we investigated a novel approach to visualize and adjust for selection bias in prevalent cohorts. The method is an extension of the standard interval-based approach, where a risk estimate is calculated for disjointed time periods after inclusion in the cohort of interest. In the proposed method, observation time and events are cumulated, giving more power and more precise estimates which may be useful for studies with few events where {{it may be difficult to}} judge what is a true effect and what is random noise. The proposed method, cumulative SIR, is exemplified using data on hepatitis-C virus infection and the outcome liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The results using this novel approach were comparable to a standard approach with disjoint intervals. The results indicate that the method may be useful in situations with few events in the cohort. The method is only useful for cohorts where the risk of the studied outcome is fairly stable over time. Study 2 : Spurious observations have indicated that there may be a relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and kidney cancer. In this study the relationship between HCV-infection and kidney cancer was investigated by use of disease registers. In addition the known association of HCV-infection and other forms of kidney disease was explored further. Methods for investigating selection bias explored in Paper I were used, in addition new ideas were investigated which were further developed in paper III. The relationship between HCV-infection and kidney cancer was not confirmed in this study, but the association of HCV-infection with other kidney-related diseases was investigated further. Study 3 : For cohorts that may have high hazard immediately after inclusion in the cohort, which then first decreases to later increase with follow-up time, the method of cumulative SIR must not be used. The cumulative properties will obscure the initial decrease and the method cannot give clear answers. In paper III we used restricted cubic splines to model to instantaneous failure rate (hazard). The shape of the hazard function may give an indication of the possible presence of selection bias in the cohort. The proposed method was exemplified using 1) data on HCV-infection where the outcome of interest was ‘kidney disease’ and 2) a cohort a patients with Monoclonal Gammapathy of Uncertain Significance (MGUS) and the outcome of interest ‘death’. The model was useful to study the shape of the hazard in the cohorts and the number of knots was adjusted to give a suitably flexible model, clearly showing the shape of the hazard without being too flexible. Study 4 : In this study we explored capture-recapture modeling, using a log-linear model to estimate ascertainment level of the Swedish Cancer Register (CR). We used a three-source model: CR, the National Patient Register (PR) and the Cause of Death Register (DR). Due to the limited degrees of freedom in available data, a full model can not be used. We chose to estimate a single two-way interaction between the most dependent registers (DR and PR) and a three-way interaction. This model will estimate the number of unreported cases of liver cancer to about 25 % of the total number of cases in all three registers together, accounting for overlap. The analysis is likely to be biased by false positive cases identified in the PR and/or DR...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} time of {{information}} overload, assistance of professional information specialists upon searching quality information on the Internet is needed more than ever before. Human labour cannot yet be replaced by any technology because technology {{is not able to}} understand the content, assess its quality or find links between different data sources. To that end, qualified people are needed who can manage the process of satisfying the need for information by using their information literacy. This master thesis includes a scientific article written in cooperation with Pille Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt, head of the Institute of Journalism and Communication of the University of Tartu (UT), Georg Singer, a doctoral student and Ulrich Norbisrath, a senior researcher of the Institute of Computer Science of the University of Tartu, and Krista Lepik, a librarian of the Library of the University of Tartu and a doctoral student of the Institute of Journalism and Communication of the University of Tartu. The article were presented at the Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in Libraries International Conference, QQML held in Athens in May 2011. A revised article based on the material used in the thesis will be published in the nearest future. Empirical material of the article was collected in the finals of the Estonian information search competition “Information search on the Internet” {{that took place in the}} Library of the University of Tartu in October 2010, involving ten information specialists from Estonian libraries, museums and archives. The article gives an overview of how professional information specialists search information on the Internet and what kind of search strategies they use. The author analysed in depth the used search strategies and looked into the relationship between the strategies and the types of internet users. The author also analysed the participants´ assessments of the tasks before and after completing them and the time spent on completing the tasks. Collecting and analysing the material was based on a unique method in which the qualitative material obtained by means of log files was linked to the quantitative results. The Internet search strategies were divided into two main groups – the known address strategies and the search engine strategies. According to the article included in this work, in most of the cases (94 %) search engine strategies were used, known-address strategies were used only in a few cases (6 %). Consequently, in case of complex exploratory search tasks like those included in our experiment, there is a higher need for search engines, whereas known internet addresses can be used less frequently. At the same time, the searcher´s previous personal knowledge and experience become more important. 50 It appeared that in case of complex exploratory search tasks, one needs to approach the task by making a generalisation and trying to find a common denominator or category and, thereafter, become more specific and find the answer. Usually, one has to use different strategies and try out many search words. Use of only one strategy and search of information by using only the words or data given in the task and a lack of a general structure is often the case with less successful information searches. Based on the information collected in our experiment, it can be assumed that younger people enter more search words, use more strategies and the number of their searches is higher than that of the older people. At the same time, using a higher number of strategies and searches does not necessarily ensure better results. The number of strategies and searches used by the best competitor was one of the lowest among the participants. This proves, once more, that the most important thing about a successful information search on the Internet is information literacy as well as previous experience and wide horizon. With regard the time spent on answering different questions, it appeared that the more complicated is the question and the more alternative answers it has, the more time it takes to search the information. While trying to analyse the reasons for the adequate evaluations of the time spent by competitors on completing the tasks, the author is of an opinion that experience in the Internet use has an important role here while compiled with a more active and versatile type of the Internet user. The more previous experience in the Internet use a person has, the more adequate he or she can assess the abilities of searching and finding information in the Internet. The analysis of internet user types showed that the participants with the best two results are active and versatile internet users in their everyday life, i. e. they are very frequent internet users and use all available service groups (information, communication, entertainment, involvement). The two participants with the lowest scores are infrequent users and more focused on searching practical information. It is therefore to conclude that information literacy is very important in order to be successful in searching information on the Internet. The more active and wider is the use of various options available on the Internet, the more experienced a person is in the information search and the more successful (faster, more effective) is the information search and problem solving on the Internet. The analysis of the participants´ assessments showed that easier questions did not necessarily mean that the questions were indeed easy for the participants. Even with the questions for which all 51 participants earned points, before a search, one-third of the respondents regarded finding an answer not easy, one-third easy and one-third could not tell whether it would be easy or difficult to find the answer. After the search, almost everyone thought that finding an answer was not more difficult than what they had thought before. With the complicated questions, the respondents who gave correct answers were not themselves certain that they had been correct. While with easier questions, the participants changed their opinion about the difficulty level of the question after the answer had been found, i. e. at first the question was thought to be difficult and then easy, with more complicated questions, the difficulty level was considered the same in most cases, i. e. not easy before and after the search. In summing up the participants´ assessments, it can be said that the assessments were generally quite adequate. There were only few cases (18 to 22 cases of the total of 150) where finding an answer was considered easy and the amount of time spent on it low and many cases (41 to 48 cases, i. e. nearly one-third of the total of 150) where after the search a task was considered more complicated than expected and the amount of time spent on completing the task higher than expected. A relationship between assessments of the tasks and internet user types became evident. It appeared that the more active and versatile was the internet user, the more inadequate assessments were given to the tasks, i. e. there were more situations where after a search a question was regarded to be more complicated and time-consuming than before it. The participants who use the Internet less or are entertainment-oriented users were not so confident about their assessment or rather regarded a question more complicated or time-consuming from the beginning. This could be explained by the fact that more active, versatile and experienced internet users usually manage to find information easily and quickly but this experiment included complicated complex tasks that often cannot be solved so quickly. Last but not least, the author compiled a list of suggestions for improving information search on the Internet based on the results obtained from the work. Some explanatory questions are of assistance. 1. Define the problem and information need o Which <b>general</b> or common <b>denominator</b> characterises your problem/information need the best? o Formulate your information need as precisely and briefly as possible! 2. Determine the resources o What are the potential sources of the information? o What are the potential strategies for fining information (for example, search engine catalogue, search term function of a search engine, a known address etc.) ? 3. Information search or eliminating unsuitable options o Try previously determined search strategies and information sources! o Reformulate your search terms and/or question, try to specify or generalise them, use accurate synonyms! 4. Assess the relevance and quality of the found information o Did you find a solution to your problem? o Was the solution satisfactory or a new search is needed...|$|R
