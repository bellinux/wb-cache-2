5|$|A {{number of}} plants are {{poisonous}} to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade,</b> foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip or onion) is normally considered poisonous, as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He {{notes that}} some have a hollow stem, such as <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, {{roughness}} of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E

50|$|Petunia is a genus in {{the family}} Solanaceae, {{subfamily}} Petunioideae. Well known members of Solanaceae in other subfamilies include tobacco (Nicotianoideae), and the cape gooseberry, tomato, potato, <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshades</b> and chili pepper (Solanoideae). Some botanists place the plants of the genus Calibrachoa in the genus Petunia, {{but this is not}} accepted by others. Petchoa is a hybrid genus derived from crossing Calibrachoa and Petunia.|$|R
5000|$|Petunia is genus of 35 {{species of}} [...] {{flowering}} plants of South American origin, {{closely related to}} tobacco, cape gooseberries, tomatoes, <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshades,</b> potatoes and chili peppers in the same family, Solanaceae. The popular flower {{of the same name}} derived its epithet from the French, which took the word petun, meaning [...] "tobacco," [...] from a Tupi-Guarani language. An annual, most of the varieties seen in gardens are hybrids (P. × atkinsiana, also known as P. × hybrida).|$|R
25|$|Many berries are edible, but others, such as {{the fruits}} of the potato and the <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade,</b> are {{poisonous}} to humans. Some berries, {{such as the}} white and red mulberry, are poisonous when unripe, but are edible in their ripe form.|$|E
25|$|Atropine occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of plants of the nightshade family including <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade,</b> Jimson weed, and mandrake. It was first isolated in 1833. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. A one-milligram vial costs between US$0.06 and US$0.44, wholesale, in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} glycoalkaloids, {{of which the}} most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|E

25|$|The {{landscape}} is rocky moorland with a covering of coarse grass and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls {{and are not}} accessible to the public. There {{are a number of}} magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse – the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as yellowhammer, reed bunting, skylark and meadow pipit are a common sight in the open areas of the park. <b>Deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic's School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species name}} [...] "belladonna" [...] ("beautiful woman" [...] in Italian) {{comes from the}} {{original}} use of <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> to dilate the pupils of the eyes for cosmetic effect. Both atropine and the genus name for <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> derive from Atropos, {{one of the three}} Fates who, according to Greek mythology, chose how a person was to die.|$|E

He was involved in The Turning Point (1977), starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne, and his score for Evil Under the Sun (1982) was based on songs by Cole Porter, a memorable rendition of [...] "You're The Top" [...] by Diana Rigg.

6000|$|In other cases, the {{circumstances}} under which a particular plant appears in England are often very suspicious. Take the instance of the belladonna, or <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade,</b> an extremely rare British species, found only in the immediate neighbourhood of old castles and monastic buildings. Belladonna, of course, is a deadly poison, and was much used in the half-magical, half-criminal sorceries of the Middle Ages. Did you wish to remove a troublesome rival or an elder brother, you treated him to a dose of <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade.</b> Yet why should it, in company with many other poisonous exotics, be found so frequently around the ruins of monasteries? Did the holy fathers--but no, the thought is too irreverent. Let us keep our illusions, and forget the friar and the apothecary in 'Romeo and Juliet.' ...|$|E

60|$|The potato, nutritive and {{harmless}} as it appears, {{belongs to}} a family suspected of very dangerous traits. It is a family connection of the <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> and other ill-reputed gentry, and sometimes shows strange proclivities to evil,--now breaking out uproariously, as in the noted potato rot, and now more covertly in various evil affections. For this reason, scientific directors bid us beware {{of the water in}} which potatoes are boiled,--into which, it appears, the evil principle is drawn off; and they caution us not to shred them into stews without previously suffering the slices to lie {{for an hour or so}} in salt and water. These cautions are worth attention.|$|E
60|$|I {{can only}} grope my way now through vague and {{baffling}} memories. Maybe {{it was the}} frenzied excitement of these madly happy birds that shed itself into my defenceless mind, after rousing me into the night I knew too well. With full, vigilant eyes I am standing again a few paces {{from the brink of}} the pool, looking up into a moonlit bush of <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade,</b> its noxious flowering over, and hung with its black, gleaming, cherry-like fruit. I cannot recall having ever given a thought to this poisonous plant in Wanderslore during my waking hours, though in my old happy reconnoitrings of the garden I had sometimes chanced on the coral-red clusters of the woody nightshade--the bittersweet, and had afterwards seen it in blossom.|$|E
6000|$|... 76. Next, in the potato, we {{have the}} {{scarcely}} innocent underground stem of one of a tribe set aside for evil; having the <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> for its queen, and including the henbane, the witch's mandrake, and the worst natural curse of modern civilization--tobacco.* And the strange thing about this tribe is, that though thus set aside for evil, {{they are not a}} group distinctly separate from those that are happier in function. There is nothing in other tribes of plants like the form of the bean blossom; but there is another family of forms and structure closely connected with this venomous one. Examine the purple and yellow bloom of the common hedge nightshade; you will find it constructed exactly like some of the forms of the cyclamen; and, getting this clue, you will find at last the whole poisonous and terrible group to be--sisters of the primulas! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sense of}} taste, {{which in the}} lowest animals is {{diffused}} equally over the whole frame, is in ourselves and other higher creatures concentrated in a special part of the body, namely the mouth, where the food about to be swallowed is chewed and otherwise prepared beforehand {{for the work of}} digestion. Now it is, of course, quite clear that some sort of supervision must be exercised by the body over the kind of food {{that is going to be}} put into it. Common experience teaches us that prussic acid and pure opium are undesirable food-stuffs in large quantities; that raw spirits, petroleum, and red lead should be sparingly partaken of by the judicious feeder; and that even green fruit, the bitter end of cucumber, and the berries of <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade</b> are unsatisfactory articles of diet when continuously persisted in. If, at the very outset of our digestive apparatus, we hadn't a sort of automatic premonitory adviser upon the kinds of food we ought or ought not to indulge in, we should naturally commit considerable imprudences in the way of eating and drinking--even more than we do at present. Natural selection has therefore provided us with a fairly efficient guide in this respect in the sense of taste, which is placed at the very threshold, as it were, of our digestive mechanism. It is the duty of taste to warn us against uneatable things, and to recommend to our favourable attention eatable and wholesome ones; and, on the whole, in spite of small occasional remissness, it performs this duty with creditable success.|$|E
6000|$|So Roger Chillingworth--a {{deformed}} old {{figure with}} a face that haunted men's memories longer than they liked--took leave of Hester Prynne, and went stooping away along the earth. He gathered {{here and there a}} herb, or grubbed up a root and put it into the basket on his arm. His gray beard almost touched the ground as he crept onward. Hester gazed after him a little while, looking with a half fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath him and show the wavering track of his footsteps, sere and brown, across its cheerful verdure. She wondered what sort of herbs they were which the old man was so sedulous to gather. Would not the earth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye, greet him with poisonous shrubs of species hitherto unknown, that would start up under his fingers? Or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch? Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him? Or was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself? And whither was he now going? Would he not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blasted spot, where, in due course of time, would be seen <b>deadly</b> <b>nightshade,</b> dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce, all flourishing with hideous luxuriance? Or would he spread bat's wings and flee away, looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have made}} a miserable botch of this description; it is no description, but merely an attempt to {{preserve}} something of the impression it made on me, and in this I {{do not seem to}} have succeeded at all. I liked the contrast between the sombreness of the old walls, and the sunshine falling through them, and gladdening the grass that floored the aisles; also, I liked the effect of so many idle and cheerful people, strolling into the haunts of the dead monks, and going babbling about, and peering into the dark nooks; and listening to catch some idea of what the building was from a clerical-looking personage, who was explaining it to a party of his friends. I don't know how well acquainted this gentleman might be with the subject; but he seemed anxious not to impart his knowledge too extensively, and gave a pretty direct rebuff to an honest man who ventured an inquiry of him. I think that the railway, and the hotel within the abbey grounds, add to the charm of the place. A moonlight solitary visit might be very good, too, in its way; but I believe that one great charm and beauty of antiquity is, that we view it out of the midst of quite another mode of life; and the more perfectly this can be done, the better. It can never be done more perfectly than at Furness Abbey, which is in itself a very sombre scene, and stands, moreover, {{in the midst of a}} melancholy valley, the Saxon name of which means the Vale of the <b>Deadly</b> <b>Nightshade.</b>|$|E
