25|$|On curves {{the outer}} rail {{may be at}} a higher level than the inner rail. This is called {{superelevation}} or cant. This reduces the forces tending to displace the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or seated passengers. A given amount <b>of</b> <b>superelevation</b> is most effective over a limited range of speeds.|$|R
50|$|Some {{high speed}} rail {{equipment}} employs tilting technology to improve stability in curves. Examples of such equipment are the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), the Pendolino, the N700 Series Shinkansen, Amtrak's Acela Express and the Talgo. Tilting is a dynamic form <b>of</b> <b>superelevation,</b> allowing both low- and high-speed traffic {{to use the same}} trackage (though not simultaneously), as well as producing a more comfortable ride for passengers.|$|R
50|$|The change <b>of</b> <b>superelevation</b> {{from zero}} in a tangent segment {{to the value}} {{selected}} for {{the body of a}} following curve occurs over the length of a transition curve that connects the tangent and the curve proper. Over the length of the transition the curvature of the track will also vary from zero at the end abutting the tangent segment to the value of curvature of the curve body, which is numerically equal to one over the radius of the curve body.|$|R
30|$|The best-fit results using Dan 3 D-Flex {{are shown}} in Fig.  11 a. These {{simulations}} use a friction angle of 10 ° in the source zone and 26 ° along the runout path (Table  1). As noted by Moore et al. (2017), this parameter combination reproduces velocity estimates based on field measurements <b>of</b> <b>superelevation</b> and runup. These simulations reproduce the two key field observations noted above: (1) little volume is simulated {{to remain on the}} planar rupture surface, and (2) no runup is simulated at the toe.|$|R
5000|$|The Russian {{experiments}} cited below {{show that}} all these formulas are inaccurate. At balancing speed, they give a curve resistance a few times too high (or worse). However, these approximation formulas are still contained in practically all standard railway engineering textbooks. For the US, AREMA American Railway Engineering ..., PDF, p.57 claims that curve resistance is 0.04% per degree of curvature (or 8 lbf/ton or 4 kgf/tonne). Hay's textbook also claims it is independent <b>of</b> <b>superelevation.</b> [...] For Russia in 2011, internet articles use 700/R.|$|R
40|$|A probabilistic- and {{uncertainty}} {{analysis for the}} failure modes of a hydraulic structure is presented in this paper. First, a general approach for such kind of analysis is presented, followed by a case study. The study deals with the Ziaran diversion dam in Iran. Data has been collected during previous studies of this dam. In particular one failure mechanism is investigated in this paper in detail: overtopping by <b>superelevation</b> <b>of</b> the bend flume in the Ziaran Dam. This study focuses on the downstream water surface elevation during the flow considering the flume’s actual discharge and roughness. Superelevation in the Ziaran Flume has led to severe erosion of the bank and to undermining of the structure. Therefore, this study aims to cast lights on the cause <b>of</b> overtopping by <b>superelevation.</b> By means <b>of</b> direct observation on the flume’s hydraulic performance, during full discharge, and from generalization of the field data, a more reliable prediction method of the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>superelevation</b> has become possible. The probabilistic analysis will show to have several advantages in comparison with deterministic analysis methods...|$|R

40|$|Characteristics of {{supercritical}} flows around curved {{sections of}} open channels are discussedin this paper. Laboratory experiments on 45 ° bend of clear water flow and high concentra-tion flow are accomplished and {{the applicability of}} the theories so far is checked. Lenau'sanalysis which is based on the energy, continuity, and irrotational equations better fits thanKnapp's wave concept which is based on the momentum, continuity, and the wave angleequations. There are no evident differences in the characteristics of the flow between clearwater and highly concentrated water. Amplification of the roll waves along the outer wallis rather well estimated by applying Lenau's formula.
