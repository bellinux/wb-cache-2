By the time of launch, Kodak faced competition from the popular Nikon D1 and Nikon D1x, which were physically smaller and cheaper. The DCS 760's initial list price was $8,000.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the sensor}} was {{much larger than}} that in the EOS DCS 3, the DCS 1 had a lower fixed {{sensitivity}} of ISO 80. The large image size resulted in a burst rate of just over one image per second for two images, followed by an eight-second delay to clear the buffer. A typical contemporary 340MB PCMCIA card or IBM Microdrive could store 53 images. In common {{with the rest of}} the Kodak <b>DCS</b> <b>range,</b> the EOS DCS 1 could not produce JPEG files in camera.|$|E
50|$|The Kodak DCS 300 series {{comprised}} two cameras, the DCS 315 and DCS 330. They were professional-level digital SLR cameras {{built by}} Eastman Kodak's Kodak Professional Imaging Solutions division. They {{were based on}} the Nikon Pronea 6i APS SLR camera and were aimed at a lower price point than other models in the Kodak <b>DCS</b> <b>range.</b> The 1.5 megapixel DCS 315 was launched in 1998, while the 3 megapixel DCS 330 was launched in 1999.The DCS 315 was the first digital SLR camera to incorporate an image preview LCD and inbuilt JPEG processing.|$|E
5000|$|The Avometer design {{incorporates}} {{an electrical}} interlock which prevents AC & <b>DC</b> <b>ranges</b> being selected simultaneously. For example, {{none of the}} <b>DC</b> <b>ranges,</b> current or voltage, can be connected unless the AC switch is set to its [...] "DC" [...] position. On a Model 8, this is the position with the AC switch arrow vertical. Similarly, to use the AC <b>ranges,</b> the <b>DC</b> switch must be set to its [...] "AC" [...] position.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} other inventions were made to {{increase}} usability, including improvements in sensor technology, the first Raw image format DCR, and usable host software. The original Kodak DCS was launched in 1991, and {{was based on a}} stock Nikon F3 SLR with digital components. It used a 1.3-megapixel Kodak KAF-1300 sensor, and a separate shoulder-mounted processing and storage unit. The DCS 200 series of 1992 condensed the storage unit into a module which mounted onto the base and back of a stock Nikon F-801s SLR. The module contained a built-in 80 megabyte hard drive and was powered with AA batteries. It was followed by the upgraded DCS 400 series of 1994, which replaced the hard drive with a PCMCIA card slot. The DCS 400 series included the 1.5-megapixel DCS 420, and the 6-megapixel Kodak DCS 460, which retailed for $28,000 on launch. In common with Kodak's later 6-megapixel models, the DCS 460 used the award-winning APS-H Kodak M6 sensor. A modified version of the DCS 420 was also sold by the Associated Press as the Associated Press NC2000. In parallel with the DCS 400 series Kodak also sold the analogous Kodak EOS <b>DCS</b> <b>range,</b> which was based on the Canon EOS-1N SLR. With the exception of the original DCS 100, these early models did not include LCD preview screens.|$|E

Each segment was heterodyned to <b>DC</b> <b>range</b> and Fourier transformed to yield spectral components of low-passed sub-band residuals. Commensurate number of spectral components in each sub-band was selected (using psychoacoustic model) and their parameters were vector quantized. In the decoder, the sub-band residuals were reconstructed and modulated with corresponding FDLP envelope. Individual DCT contributions from each critical sub-band were summed and inverse DCT {{was applied to}} reconstruct output signal [25].|$|R
50|$|As an {{ohmmeter}} the Model 8 Mark II measures from 1 Ω up to 20 MΩ {{in three}} ranges. The instrument has an accuracy of ±1% of FSD on <b>DC</b> current <b>ranges,</b> ±2% of FSD on <b>DC</b> voltage <b>ranges,</b> ±2.25% of FSD on all AC ranges and ±5% of reading (at centre scale only) on resistance ranges. Its maximum current draw of 50 μA at full-scale deflection (corresponding to 20,000 ohms per volt) is sufficient {{in most cases}} to reduce voltage measurement error due to circuit loading by the meter to an acceptable level.|$|R

In his introduction to the collected edition, author Roger Zelazny {{also noted that the}} structure bore some similarity to the key story points of the mythic structure identified by Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces - although he did allow that this might come from Gaiman's intimate knowledge of the same source material rather than a deliberate attempt to follow Campbell's guidelines. When the book was initially released over 1990/1991, it proved very popular and led Vertigo Executive Editor Karen Berger to make it a regular ongoing series under editor Stuart Moore.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{depth of}} cure (DOC), degree of {{conversion}} (DC), and flexural strength (FS) of several resin composites with low-stress behavior. METHODS: SonicFill (Kerr), SureFil(®) SDR™ (Dentsply), everX Posterior (GC), Kalore (GC), and Filtek Silorane (3 M ESPE) were tested. DOC {{was measured with}} the Acetone Shake test.

50|$|A {{design feature}} of Avometers was {{simplicity}} {{of use and}} towards this end, all measurements could generally be made using only two input terminals. However, the Avometer HR had additional 2500V (AC) and (<b>DC)</b> <b>ranges</b> which used the corresponding 1000V ranges, and were connected through two additional terminals at the top corners of the front panel. This feature was continued in the Model 8 and, with an increase to 3000V to match their 1 - 3 - 10 ranges sequence, in the Model 9, Marks II and IV and the Model 8 Mark V. The 3000V ranges were deleted in the Model 8 Marks 6 and 7 due to concerns for compliance with contemporary safety standards. This also led to a significant cost saving by eliminating the high voltage multiplier resistors.|$|R

40|$|INRiM’s primary AC-voltage {{standard}} is realized {{by means of}} a set of AC-DC Thermal Voltage Converters from <b>DC</b> <b>range</b> up to 1 MHz. Above this frequency, an AC-voltage standard has not been normally implemented because of low technical interest. Indeed, in that range, electromagnetic power, a quantity that is always well definable and measurable also at higher frequencies, becomes more interesting than the AC-voltage. Power {{standard is}} realized by means of microcalorimetric technique that, however, lacks in precision under 10 MHz. The result is a metrological gap from 1 MHz to 10 MHz, in which any electrical standard exists, at least at INRiM. To fill this gap a new measurement setup is now under development and characterization, which will allow performing AC-DC Transfer Difference measurement up to 100 MHz and realizing a low frequency power standard.

40|$|Direct {{observations}} on the reactions of flatfish of the Pleuronectidae to electrical stimulation were made by towing a manned sledge supporting an energised electrode array over the sea bed. The electrical stimulus was pulsed <b>DC,</b> <b>ranging</b> in frequency from 4 to 40 Hz. Involuntary muscular contractions were induced by this stimulus which caused the majority of fish to flee from the elec-trified zone. Reactions were classified into a few broad categories and the approximate fish size in each observed event was recorded. The results suggested that the most efficient frequency for inducing flatfish to leave the bottom is around 20 Hz, and that large fish are more strongly stimu-lated by an electric field than small fish; the latter being a significant demonstration under natural conditions of a theory based on aquarium experiments. Observations were made on the reactions of flatfish to a towed chain to assess its comparative efficiency in forcing fish to leave the sea bed...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of converting chemical energy into electrical energy {{has been studied}} for the case of D-size, low and medium rate lithium-thionyl chloride (Li/TC) cells, under DC and various pulsed loads. Microcalorimetric monitoring of the heat output during discharge allowed the direct measurement of the faradaic efficiency, and showed that self-discharge is far more pervasive than previously acknowledged by researchers and battery manufacturers. Evaluations of the cell dynamics prove that current load and temperature fluctuations combine to disrupt the lithium passivation and to greatly enhance self-discharge. Typical faradaic efficiencies for <b>DC</b> <b>range</b> from abut 30 % at low current density to 90 % at moderate and 75 % at high current density.
