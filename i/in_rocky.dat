5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E

5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, shrubs and bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters {{can also have}} a profound effect <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> areas that tend to be dominated by mussel beds. They remove mussels from rocks, liberating space for competitive species and thereby increasing the diversity of species in the area.|$|E

5|$|The animal {{tends to}} be found <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> habitats. It {{occupies}} talus piles (collection of broken rock pieces {{at the base of}} cliffs, volcanoes, or valley shoulders, accumulated due to periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces) with larger stones and rocky areas although it does not inhabit swampy montane tundra or talus lacking vegetation. It may also live in burrows under tree roots or in old moss-scree.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Marie {{appeared in}} the original Rocky; she was portrayed by Jodi Letizia. For the final film, Marie is portrayed by Geraldine Hughes. (Although Letizia did reprise the role for Rocky V, the sole scene in which she appeared was deleted. In it, Marie was homeless {{on the streets of}} Philadelphia.) Another recognizable character who {{appeared in the}} previous five films, sportscaster Stu Nahan, provided the commentary for the computer-generated fight between Dixon and Balboa. Nahan was part of the ringside commentary team during all the bouts in the first three films and the Apollo Creed/Ivan Drago fight <b>in</b> <b>Rocky</b> IV. He was diagnosed with lymphoma during the Rocky Balboa filming, though, and died on December 26, 2007. Finally, Pedro Lovell, who portrayed Spider Rico in the original film, returns to the role <b>in</b> <b>Rocky</b> Balboa as a guest and later employee at Rocky's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} silicate stone, rarely on decaying wood. It is usually in partial shade in openings in low to mid-elevation moist forests, {{and is also}} frequently found <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> roadcuts. Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen, and contribute nitrogen to the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious evidence of the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park <b>in</b> <b>Rocky</b> Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Lavelli ran an appliance business on Cleveland's west side. From 1961 through 1963, {{he served as}} an assistant to Graham, who was coaching college stars in the annual College All-Star Game. Lavelli was also an assistant coach with the Browns and a scout for the Chicago Bears. He later owned a furniture store <b>in</b> <b>Rocky</b> River, Ohio and had an interest in two bowling alleys. He had a hand in founding the NFL Alumni Association, a charitable organization.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the banded houndshark is {{commonly}} displayed in public aquariums in China and Japan, and has reproduced in captivity. Individuals have survived in captivity for over five years. This species is often caught incidentally off Japan in gillnets and set nets; {{the meat is}} sometimes sold, but {{is considered to be}} of poorer quality than that of other houndsharks in the region. It is caught in lesser numbers off Taiwan, and is probably also fished off Korea and northern China. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the banded houndshark under Least Concern, as it remains abundant throughout its range. Off Japan, it can be found <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure.|$|E

50|$|It {{tends to}} grow <b>in</b> <b>rockier</b> {{habitats}} than its cousin, arrow-leaf balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata). It hybridizes with arrow-leaf balsamroot, which has arrow shaped leaves. The {{result is a}} plant with leaves that are arrow shaped, but also deeply divided.|$|R
5|$|Lundgren's {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} he starred <b>in</b> <b>Rocky</b> IV in 1985 as the imposing Soviet boxer Ivan Drago. Since then, he has starred in more than 40 films, {{almost all of them}} in the action genre. He portrayed He-Man in the 1987 science fantasy film Masters of the Universe and Frank Castle in the 1989 film The Punisher. In the early 1990s, he also appeared in films such as Dark Angel (1990), Universal Soldier (1992), Joshua Tree (1993), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), and Blackjack (1998). In 2004, he directed his first film, The Defender, and subsequently directed The Mechanik (2005), Missionary Man (2007), Command Performance (2009), and Icarus (2010), also starring in the latter.|$|E
5|$|More than 16 {{kinds of}} lizards and snakes live in various {{habitats}} {{in the park}} and consume large quantities of insects, spiders, scorpions, other reptiles, and small mammals. The collared lizard, which occurs in every habitat, is the largest and most often seen. Plateau striped whiptails, a species consisting entirely of females, prefer grasslands and developed areas. Side-blotched lizards live <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> areas of the park but are seldom seen. Gopher snakes, which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed, are among the most common snakes in the park. The Western rattlesnake, the only venomous snake found in the park, prefers grasslands and shrub areas.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills {{to return to a}} den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E

Strop moved from shortstop to pitching in 2006 due to posting poor hitting numbers. His tenure <b>in</b> the <b>Rockies</b> organization ended with his release by the Rockies on September 19, 2008.|$|R
5|$|Seven {{kinds of}} amphibians, which drink no water but absorb it through their {{permeable}} skins, {{have been identified}} in Petrified Forest National Park. Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouse‚Äôs toads, which are seldom seen, are the largest toads in the park. They like grasslands, riparian corridors, and developed areas. Red-spotted toads, most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most common toad in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot toads include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch's varieties.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia occurs {{along the}} east coast of Australia from the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, Victoria, north through New South Wales and into Queensland. It is common north to Maryborough, with disjunct populations {{occurring}} as far north as the Atherton Tableland near Cairns. It occurs in a variety of habitats, from coastal heath (spinulosa and collina) and elevated rocky slopes (neoanglica and spinulosa) to inland dry sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalypts, where they form part of the understorey. Plants in exposed areas are generally considerably shorter than those in sheltered areas. It usually occurs on sand, but can be found <b>in</b> <b>rocky</b> clays or loams.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} {{as editor}} of the Press in 1966, Seltzer occasionally wrote columns for suburban newspapers and also published a collection of character sketches, Six and God (1966). He continued to associate with more than 50 organizations and was on the Pulitzer Prize Advisory Board from 1956 to 1968. When Seltzer's wife died in 1965 he moved in with his daughter, Shirley Cooper, <b>in</b> <b>Rocky</b> River, Ohio. When Cooper and her husband moved to Spencer in Medina County in 1973, Seltzer moved with them. Seltzer died in his daughter's house on April 2, 1980 at the age of 82. Seltzer's living relatives {{at the time of his}} death included his daughter, two siblings, four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His son, Chester E.
