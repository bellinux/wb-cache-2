The work reported here is based on the development of a multi-agent application, an audio video entertainment broadcasting (AVEB) system. This has resulted in determining advantages and limitations of using the FIPA standards to build complex Multi-agent Software Systems. The development and testing of the AVEB application are part of an EU project called FACTS (acts AC 317). A main result of using FIPA has been the identification of the usefulness and power of its protocols. The reason for the importance of the protocols in developing multi-agent systems (MAS) is it provides a degree of expressing cooperation within MAS architecture. As the protocols stand currently they are not sufficient to capture a complete explicit model of the cooperative requirements in multi-agent systems. However, they provide a basis from which to start. We examine this feature of FIPA further in order to evaluate its role as a bridge between the mental <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> social <b>agency</b> <b>requirements</b> in the development of cooperation in mult-agent systems...|$|R

40|$|Is it {{possible}} for service organizations formed from protest movements to maintain their radical commitments, even when they partner with state agencies? Engaging with the social movements, civic engagement, and nonprofit sector literatures, I focus on the American prostitutes’ rights movement and the emergence from it of the California Prevention and Education Project (CAL-PEP) and the St James Infirmary (SJI) in the San Francisco Bay Area. As flagship nonprofit health service organizations, the SJI and CAL-PEP illustrate how a social movement’s radical impulses and claims-making capacities are both maintained and restricted when they are institutionalized into service provision organizations that seek to work with state agencies {{in an era of}} neoliberal politics. Based on participant-observational, interview-based and archival research, I contend that CAL-PEP and the SJI express their radical impulses within their organizations by maintaining prostitution as a legitimate occupational choice and involving sex workers in service provision and management. Granting agreements encouraging local, community-based health service provision and an emphasis on professional, credentialed service provision permit this expression of their radical impulses, even as charitable nonprofit tax status <b>and</b> granting <b>agency</b> <b>requirements</b> for data collection constrain their capacities to advocate for sex workers' rights beyond their organizations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose – Definition of Management Controlling Framework (MCF) had {{undergone}} many changes during {{a short period}} of time. Definition change mostly reflected a scope transformation during this system development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate evolution of Management Controlling Framework, to compare different approaches and discuss outcomes, to propose future development directions based on historical background. It presents a historical revision of different trends of management controlling systems in organisations, according to four indicators: scope, outcome, tools and contradictions. Johnson and Kaplan (1987) suggestion was taken as the starting point of current investigation, as it significantly affected viewpoint change and further behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review of publications in public sector, management and accounting journals since 1990 was conducted with the aim to answer the research questions: 1. How Management Controlling Framework are described? 2. What are the main characteristics of MCF? 3. How scope of Management Controlling Framework changed over time. 4. What are the main contradictions? Data analysis was performed using Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS, TRIZ), and a special part of this theory — ‘Laws of (technical) systems evolution’ (LTSE). Findings – Overall, the results confirm that Management Controlling Framework (MCF) can be described and trended through Laws of (technical) systems evolution. These findings provide the following insights for future research such as solve contradictions: 1. Overview, but not overload (detalization problem). 2. Subsidiary independent, but over control (HQ involvement problem) 3. Managing Innovation versus Managing Operations (development problem). 4. Differentiation and unification (culture problem). 5. Leadership versus review (GM problem). 6. Common understanding on the control way and results quantification (Measurement identity problem).

40|$|The {{integration}} of pavement and bridge management sys-tems is addressed for the New York State Thruway Author-ity. A phased plan provides a unifying <b>framework</b> for development <b>and</b> accommodates <b>agency</b> <b>requirements.</b> Early efforts {{focus on the}} development of the data base and ana-lytical methodologies for pavement management. Suhse-quent work produces similar methodologies for bridge management, expands the data base to serve bridge manage-ment needs, and integrates the data base with pavement and bridge analysis programs. The requirement for integration is maintained throughout the entire planning, design, and im-plementation process. The integrated computer system is prototyped as Windows-based program managers using graphical user interfaces to unify C/C++ applications. Early prototypes highlight remaining issues of integration and facilitate the selection of appropriate procedures for inter-facing the data base with the application programs. Impor-tant issues related to system integration are discussed. On the basis of developments to date, it is concluded that (a) effi-cient integration is facilitated by the preexistence of a plan that defines a common methodological <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> comput-ing environment for all component systems, and (b) the most essential integration elements are a common referencing con-vention, data base, and computerized user interface. A n important goal of highway agencies is to identify the combination of pavement and bridge projects that makes optimal use of resources. However, the current lack of integrated program development tools in-hibits the achievement of this goal. It is the broad obiec-tive of a cooperative research effort between the New York State Thruway Authority and Rensselaer Polytech-nic Institute to address this need through development of an integrated pavement and bridge management system for the authority. The authority's goal is ultimately to implement a comprehensive infrastructure management system incorporating a pavement management system (PMS), a bridge management system (BMS), and similar tools for managing other types of physical facilities. The authority's system includes 1030 km (640 mi) of Interstate-type highway constructed primarily betwee...|$|R
40|$|Forest tenure {{reform has}} opened {{economic}} and livelihood opportunities for community forestry management through the devolution of management rights under broader decentralisation reforms. However, {{the transfer of}} rights and associated power to forest communities is usually partial. The view of property as composed of ′bundles of rights′ allows for the disaggregation of rights transferred from government to local people. In practice, it is common that rights held by natural resource stakeholders encompass {{only part of the}} rights bundle. This partial transfer of rights shapes community forestry institutions {{and the manner in which}} they function. When communities <b>and</b> state <b>agencies</b> share responsibilities <b>and</b> benefits of forest management, they collaborate within co-management systems. Co-management systems are attractive to governments because they open avenues for local participation in resource governance and more equitable benefit-sharing while maintaining some level of state control. However, co-management systems can place a greater burden on community level actors without providing the corresponding benefits. As a result, co-management can fail to meet expectations. In response, the promotion of community forestry may require greater emphasis on adjusting forest regulatory <b>frameworks,</b> institutions, <b>and</b> <b>agencies,</b> to allow more freedom by community-level actors in developing forest management systems...|$|R

This article argues, however, that the Report contains fundamental contradictions in its analysis of non-participation in learning and the solutions proposed. Despite appearing to re-instate a concern for the social, it locates the causes of non-participation primarily within individuals and their personal deficits. Yet it denies individuality and diversity by representing the socially excluded as stereotyped categories. In a flawed move, the Report presents non-participation not just in correlation to a raft of other social problems, but as cause to their effect. Deep-seated structural inequalities are rendered invisible, as social exclusion is addressed through a strongly individualistic strategy based on personal agency. At the same time, measures to enhance individual agency, notably the new ‘ConneXions’ service, are formulated within a prescriptive structural <b>framework.</b> Structure <b>and</b> <b>agency</b> are thus reversed in current English policy approaches.

It explores the way a range of disciplines, namely materials science, crystallography, astronomy, earth sciences, humanities and linguistics, get organized at the international level to address those challenges. The disciplinary culture with respect to data sharing, science drivers, organization, lessons learnt and the elements of the data infrastructure which are or could be shared with others are briefly described.

40|$|The thesis {{engages with}} recent debates {{surrounding}} {{the relationship between}} culture, ideology and politics in Venice under Italian Fascism. It aims to establish if the Fascist project for the 'nationalization of the masses' through culture was successfully promoted in Venice, or whether local economic interests were afforded a higher priority by the town authorities. It argues that local elites were not primarily concerned with the endorsement of Fascist ideology through cultural politics but considered exhibitions, plays, concerts and festivals to be the route to boosting economic growth {{through the development of}} the tourist industry. The thesis examines {{the ways in which the}} Venetian municipality was able to work with the Fascist regime, co-operating with national political directives provided these did not contradict the primary objective of restructuring and reviving the Venetian economy. Cultural policies in Venice were thus less a vehicle for Fascist ideology than a pragmatic means of injecting new life into the flagging post-war economy through the development of new forms of 'cultural tourism'. Festivals, exhibitions and traditional events were placed at the service not of the Fascist programme of mass cultural mobilisation, but of local business and political elites whose interests ultimately depended upon the revitalization of commercial tourism and the economic and social rejuvenation of the Veneto region. The familiar image of a 'totalitarian' state penetrating deep into all aspects of society is in need of serious qualification and a more realistic interpretation of Fascism in Venice must take account of the complex and sometimes ambiguous relationship between the national interest, as constructed by ideologically-driven Fascist organs <b>and</b> <b>agencies,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>requirements</b> of institutions and elites at the local level...|$|R

The agencies also rely on professional norms to safeguard against duplication, such as the peer review process used by scientific journals to limit the publication of unnecessarily duplicative research. Indeed, <b>agency</b> officials <b>and</b> stakeholders could not provide recent examples of duplication within or between the two <b>agencies,</b> <b>and</b> GAO's review of 20 randomly selected research projects did not identify duplicative projects. Nevertheless, GAO identified a few shortcomings that somewhat limit the utility of certain agency safeguards. First, information in CRIS about ARS projects was typically at least 6 months out-of-date when uploaded, which undermines CRIS's utility as a safeguard. ARS officials said that the agency now expects staff to provide ARS project information on a quarterly basis, but ARS has not issued guidance about this expectation. Second, NIFA directs staff to conduct a CRIS duplication check for projects that accounted for about two-thirds of the funding it awarded for competitive grants; as a result, about one-third of its competitive grants are not subject to this safeguard against duplication. NIFA recently convened a task force to study, among other issues, whether the directive to check CRIS should be extended to all competitive grants. ...|$|R
