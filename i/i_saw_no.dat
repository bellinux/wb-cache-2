25|$|Sitting {{after dinner}} at Ilam {{about a month}} ago, I said <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> hope for a better state of public policy here unless {{there was a new}} {{newspaper}} started which would tell the truth without fear or favour. In five minutes the thing was settled. If I would undertake the management of it, it was to be started and five hundred pound was put down on the spot; it was soon found there was a little press and some types to be bought. I promised I would write and would exercise a general superintendence over the matter... The first number appeared three weeks after the conversation referred to.|$|E
500|$|When the antiquary John Leland {{visited the}} site in the mid-16th century, he {{described}} how [...] "the castelle of Tanfeld, or rather as it is nowe, a meane manor Place, stondith hard on the ripe of Ure, wher <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> notable building but a fair toured Gateway and a Haule of squarid stone." [...] The tower and the manor passed into the Parr family and, {{on the death of}} William Parr, {{into the hands of the}} Crown, before being held by the Cecils and the Elgins. The Brudenell family owned it from 1747 onwards, until in 1886 it was sold to a Mr Arton. It was sketched around 1786 by William Grose.|$|E
500|$|The {{response}} {{did not put}} {{the questions}} to rest. [...] On 9 December 1941, Representative Rogers telephoned Nimitz and asked him whether the Navy was interested in {{a bill that would}} allow the Navy to use women {{similar to that of the}} WAAC legislation. [...] In her book, Lady in the Navy, Joy Bright Hancock quotes his reply: [...] "I advised Mrs. Rogers that at the present time <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> great need for such a bill..." [...] Nevertheless, within days Nimitz was in touch with all Navy Department bureaus asking them to assess their needs for an equivalent to the WAAC. With few exceptions, the responses were negative. Yet, Congressional inquiries continued to increase about the Navy's plan for women.|$|E

60|$|BERTLEY. WELLWYN! [WELLWYN {{turns and}} rises.] It's ages since <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you. <b>No</b> idea you were moving. This is very dreadful.|$|R
60|$|With those horrible words--put {{into her}} mouth, beyond all doubt {{by the woman}} who had {{interfered}} between us--she left me. The long hours of the day passed: <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>no</b> more.|$|R
500|$|In 1891, {{after many}} failed {{attempts}} at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{stepped in to}} mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded. [...] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protegée from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal. Utopia, concerning an attempt to [...] "anglicise" [...] a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, {{by means of a}} [...] "statutory duel" [...] and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good. Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, [...] "...Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti." ...|$|E
500|$|On 26 April, {{two days}} before [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] was due to air, the British {{government}} intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned Lord Thomson, chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast {{on the grounds that}} Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, [...] "paradoxically", the decision [...] "was not a difficult one. My colleagues and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction". With a slightly altered rationale—that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest—Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E
500|$|Poe's {{characterization}} as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed. His drinking companion for a time, Thomas Mayne Reid, {{admitted that}} the two engaged in wild [...] "frolics" [...] but that Poe [...] "never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, I can speak truly of its not being habitual". Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine. He only drank during difficult periods {{of his life and}} sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol. Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance {{at the time of his}} death. William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond. Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. Thomas Dunn English, an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user. He wrote: [...] "Had Poe the opium habit when I knew him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend, having {{presented}} me, mentioned {{my desire}} to inspect the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard's assurance that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>no</b> more.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Cleopatra <b>no</b> {{more that}} day, {{but on the}} day which {{followed}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her. She was in a heavy mood, and had no gentle word for me. I spake to her of the defence of Egypt, but she put the matter away.|$|R
60|$|She {{extended}} her hand, but I clasped her to my bosom. She sighed as she extricated {{herself from the}} embrace which she permitted--escaped to the door which led to her own apartment--and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>no</b> more.|$|R
2500|$|A rule {{change for}} the 2014 season allowed drivers to pick a unique car number that they will use for their entire F1 career. Räikkönen however decided to retain the No. 7 car number he used for Lotus during the 2013 season as [...] "It's the number I already had last year and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> reason to change it".|$|E
2500|$|... "Coming {{from the}} North, I knew I was totally ignorant," [...] Dolci wrote later. [...] "Looking all around me, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> streets, just mud and dust... I {{started working with}} masons and peasants, who kindly, gently, taught me their trades. That way my {{spectacles}} were no longer a barrier. Every day, all day, as the handle of hoe or shovel burned the blisters deeper, I learned more than any book could teach me about this people's struggle to exist..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Sondheim, the {{producer}} Cameron Mackintosh asked for {{changes for the}} 1987 London production. [...] "I was reluctantly happy to comply, my only serious balk being at his request that I cut [...] "The Road You Didn't Take" ... <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> reason not to try new things, knowing we could always revert to the original (which we eventually did). The net result was four new songs...For reasons which I've forgotten, I rewrote [...] "Loveland" [...] for the London production. There were only four showgirls in this version, and each one carried a shepherd's crook with a letter of the alphabet on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} he came through Braster, and he asked for me. He looked {{in through the window}} of my cottage when Colonel Ray was with me. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>no</b> more after that until I found him dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{extended}} her hand, but I clasped her to my bosom. She sighed as [...] she extricated {{herself from the}} embrace which she permitted, escaped [...] to the door which led to her own apartment, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>no</b> more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Ellen, not as {{she used}} to be,' added Emily, 'but like what she was when last <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her; <b>no,</b> hardly that either, for this was sad, sad, scared, terrified, with eyes all tears, as Ellen never, never was.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... 1824 Kronstadt, {{the main}} {{base of the}} Russian Baltic Fleet was swept by the {{disastrous}} flood of 1824. Of 28 capital ships moored in the inner harbours of Kotlin Island, only five were spared by the flood, and only {{three of them were}} deemed safe for the open seas. Twenty-two capital ships were written off and broken up. Most of them remained afloat when the flood recessed, but were too rotten to be worth salvaging. Alexander <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> need to resurrect the fleet to its past strength, and in 1825 the shipyards of Arkhangelsk laid down only two new ships: Azov and Ezekiel.|$|E
2500|$|Webber caused {{controversy}} with {{a series}} of comments about Eurovision in a Radio Times interview. He said: [...] "I don't think there's any point in beating around the bush. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> black faces on the programme Eurovision 2012. I was questioned by the press over Jade Ewen's race, and I think we would have placed second, but there is a problem when you go further east. If you're talking about Western Europe it's fine, but Ukraine, not so good." [...] The EBU corrected Webber, telling him Ukraine's singer Gaitana was black, that year's winner Loreen for Sweden was of North African background and accompanied by a black backing dancer, and France's contestant Anggun was Indonesian. The contest organisers also told Webber that black singer Dave Benton won for Estonia in 2001. The EBU thoroughly denied racism in its show, and insisted it unites Europe for three nights in a year.|$|E
60|$|Since these confidences were thrust on me, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> harm {{in asking}} a few questions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Even then I did not understand, till <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that--that <b>no</b> man {{stepped on}} my shadow; and I {{knew that they}} thought {{me to be a}} God, like the God Tyr, who gave his right hand to conquer a Great Beast.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chowder Loll!" [...] shrieked Colonel Jowler. [...] "O fate! thy hand is here!" [...] He rushed wildly {{into his}} tent--the next day applied for leave of absence. Gutch took {{the command of}} the regiment, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>no</b> more for some time.|$|R
60|$|This, I say, {{happened}} {{three years}} ago. And {{about that time}} a little luck descended upon us three, and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than Cypher's. Our paths separated, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Kraft <b>no</b> more and Judkins seldom.|$|R
60|$|As I entered, {{the talking}} ceased. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> face except his and that seemed blank.|$|E
60|$|For {{several minutes}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> {{more of her}} as she luxuriated in the cool depths.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me--just {{as he used}} to look, sometimes--but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> {{recognition}} in his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it was <b>no</b> {{use that}} I should stay, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> could not {{persuade him to}} come with me, so I packed up my things, and bidding him good-bye, started on the homeward journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is not {{all that}} water getting dangerous?" [...] she asked, with {{chattering}} teeth; and, knowing her keenness, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> there was <b>no</b> use attempting to hide the fact.|$|R

60|$|I saw the villain's {{nostrils}} {{rise and}} fall convulsively; but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> moving at his mouth.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought him}} looking as villainous as ever, and I replied that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> change in him.|$|E
60|$|We rushed on deck. I {{seized the}} boat-hook {{and looked over}} the side. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> one.|$|E
6000|$|At this I averted my {{face and}} blushed so furiously that {{the walls of the}} cave were {{illuminated}} with a wavering crimson like the light of a great conflagration!

60|$|The Guv'nor {{has gone}} a bust upon some cracked china, the ugliest that ever <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> though <b>no</b> judge. So {{if you want}} to get that old tall clock at the first price or any other of his rubbish, I think now is your chance. Anyhow, keep this dark as per agreement.|$|R

'He {{caught sight}} of my shadow on the wall as I listened, {{in the hope of}} finding out,' said the girl; 'and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.
