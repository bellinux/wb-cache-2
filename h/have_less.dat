5|$|A similar {{system for}} the Church of England was {{approved}} in 1976. The traditions of Eastern Christian heraldry <b>have</b> <b>less</b> developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often display a shield before a mantle topped with a crown. Eastern clergy often display coats of arms according to this style, replacing the crown with an appropriate hat drawn from liturgical use.|$|E

5|$|Admitting {{that plants}} {{generally}} <b>have</b> <b>less</b> obvious evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds some examples, {{as of the}} parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or spiny husk, and dispersed by wings or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds because they <b>have</b> <b>less</b> {{ability to move}} large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians having their populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes <b>have</b> <b>less</b> {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble those of the adult female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly.|$|E
5|$|Land {{management}} employees remove {{dead and}} hazardous fuels from areas as prioritized by the Hazard Fuels Reduction Plan. This {{is to ensure}} fires <b>have</b> <b>less</b> opportunity to threaten lives, historical structures, and visitor facilities. As of 2007, fuel is reduced within 400feet (120m) of structures and other high-priority locations.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is safe in {{pregnancy}} {{and women with}} gestational diabetes treated with metformin <b>have</b> <b>less</b> weight gain during pregnancy than those treated with insulin. Babies born to women treated with metformin {{have been found to}} develop less visceral fat, making them less prone to insulin resistance in later life.|$|E

All of these were incorporated as urban municipalities prior to the Municipal Act being enacted in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and <b>have</b> <b>less</b> aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E
5|$|The diamond allotrope {{of carbon}} is clearly nonmetallic, being {{translucent}} {{and having a}} low electrical conductivity of 10−14 to 10−16S·cm−1. Graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 × 104S·cm−1, a figure more characteristic of a metal. Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony and bismuth also <b>have</b> <b>less</b> stable allotropes that display different behaviours.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the large}} U.S. air {{carriers}} and commuter airlines, which on average <b>have</b> <b>less</b> than 20 fatalities annually, each year general aviation fatalities {{number in the}} hundreds. Most general aviation accidents involve single-engine, piston-powered airplanes used in recreational aviation.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations <b>have</b> <b>less</b> genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and <b>have</b> <b>less</b> incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions <b>have</b> <b>less</b> funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E
5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer <b>have</b> <b>less</b> mobility.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN <b>have</b> <b>less</b> thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
