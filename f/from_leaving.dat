40|$|AbstractProtein import into {{isolated}} tobacco mitochondria {{was investigated}} using mitochondria <b>from</b> <b>leaves</b> harvested {{at different times}} of the day and night. Efficient import was only detected with mitochondria isolated <b>from</b> <b>leaves</b> harvested during the dark period of the growth cycle, only low levels of import were detected <b>from</b> <b>leaves</b> harvested during the light period. However, this temporal difference seen in import {{did not appear to be}} circadian in nature. This implies that the protein import process in mitochondria isolated <b>from</b> <b>leaves</b> is not constitutive. This has important implications for targeting specificity studies performed in transgenic plants, as unless the plants are tested at the time when import is occurring, the true in vivo targeting abilities of chimeric constructs will not be measured...|$|R

5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them <b>from</b> <b>leaving</b> their nest during {{the early hours of}} the day. Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants <b>from</b> <b>leaving</b> their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E
