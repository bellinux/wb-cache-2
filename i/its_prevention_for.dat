This study aims to localize the altered neuromotor programming in this animal model and {{to evaluate the}} role of pravastatin in <b>its</b> <b>prevention.</b> <b>For</b> the preeclampsia model, pregnant CD- 1 mice were randomly allocated to injection of adenovirus carrying sFlt- 1 or its control virus carrying mFc into the tail vein. Thereafter they received pravastatin (sFlt- 1 -pra "experimental group") or water (sFlt- 1 "positive control") until weaning. The mFc group ("negative control") received water. Offspring at 6 months of age were sacrificed, and whole brains underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRIs were performed using an 11. 7 Tesla vertical bore MRI scanner. T 2 weighted images were acquired to evaluate the volumes of 28 regions of interest, including areas involved in adaptation and motor, spatial and sensory function. Cytochemistry and cell quantification was performed using neuron-specific Nissl stain. One-way ANOVA with multiple comparison testing was used for statistical analysis. Compared with control offspring, male sFlt- 1 offspring have decreased volumes in the fimbria, periaquaductal gray, stria medullaris, and ventricles and increased volumes in the lateral globus pallidus and neocortex; however, female sFlt- 1 offspring showed increased volumes in the ventricles, stria medullaris, and fasciculus retroflexus and decreased volumes in the inferior colliculus, thalamus, and lateral globus pallidus. Neuronal quantification via Nissl staining exhibited decreased cell counts in sFlt- 1 offspring neocortex, more pronounced in males. Prenatal pravastatin treatment prevented these changes.

Nowadays the most spelled threat comes from so called foreign fighters whose destabilized and war-torn countries of origin are located in Northern Africa and Middle East. In combination with inefficient management of illegal migration phenomenon and unsatisfactory EU policies on that matter the problem becomes even more amplified.

There might be a causal relationship between growing rates of frustration between peoples and social marginalization of noted societal groups which might be caused by unsatisfactory assimilation policies of respective EU member states. The goal of this given thesis was to analyze risks to Czech electrical grid which might be posed by an act of terrorism. The analysis was done by breaking down the electrical grid safety measures into respective sectors and parts. Risk for each particular category were analyzed and final risk assessment whilst using help of security professionals. A questionnaire method was used to complete this particular task.

O presente estudo verificou a relação entre nutrição ao nascer e sobrepeso em jovens. Avaliaram-se 287 indivíduos com média (desvio-padrão) de 15, 2 (1, 4) anos. Para diagnóstico nutricional ao nascer, utilizou-se o índice ponderal e, para o atual, índice de massa corporal (IMC), circunferência da cintura e composição corporal. Verificou-se, para os meninos, associação positiva entre índice ponderal e sobrepeso (p = 0, 05) e excesso de gordura abdominal (p = 0, 04). Para as meninas, houve associação negativa entre índice ponderal e comprimento ao nascer (p = 0, 00) e quantidade de massa muscular (p = 0, 01). Meninas de menor índice ponderal apresentaram maior quantidade de gordura corporal total e abdominal, enquanto as de maior índice ponderal apresentaram valores inferiores de estatura final (p = 0, 09). Pode-se sugerir que indivíduos pertencentes aos extremos de índice ponderal enquadram-se em categoria de risco para obesidade futura, relação que se mostrou mais evidente para o extremo superior, no sexo masculino, e inferior, no feminino.

40|$|Abstract Osteoporosis is a {{skeletal}} disease, {{a disease}} of {{the bones of the}} body, which is characterized by a lowered amount of skeletal minerals, decrease of bone density and a changed microstructure of the bones. The effect of these changes is a lowered quality of skeletal tissues and an elevated risk of bone fractures. This risk, being very high, is directly threatening to the patient. Anybody can suffer from osteoporosis, but there are certain groups, much more at risk. The group most often affected by osteoporosis, are women in post-climacteric period of life, i. e. several years past their climacterium. The main factors causing this disease are age, gender, genetics, lack of physical activity, malnourishment, use of harmful substances (smoking, coffee, alcohol), use of some medications, certain endocrinological diseases and diseases of the digestive system, etc. Fundamental significance <b>for</b> <b>prevention</b> and treatment is an adjustment of life-style with sufficient physical activity, correct nutrition, avoiding of harmful substances such as smoking, alcohol and coffee. Regular use of vitamins and minerals as well as regular check-ups may help to prevent the disease. For this study a questionnaire was chosen for data collecting. The questionnaire created for this work included 17 closed and 8 semi-open questions.

40|$|Because proliferative vitreoretinopathy {{cannot be}} {{effectively}} treated, <b>its</b> <b>prevention</b> is indispensable <b>for</b> {{the success of}} surgery for retinal detachment. The elaboration of preventive and therapeutic strategies depends upon the identification of patients who are genetically predisposed to develop the disease, as well as upon {{an understanding of the}} biological process involved and the role of local factors, such as the status of the uveovascular barrier. Detachment of the retina or vitreous activates glia to release cytokines and ATP, which not only protect the neuroretina but also promote inflammation, retinal ischemia, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling. The vitreal microenvironment favors cellular de-differentiation and proliferation of cells with nonspecific nutritional requirements. This may render a pharmacological inhibition of their growth difficult without causing damage to the pharmacologically vulnerable neuroretina. Moreover, reattachment of the retina relies upon the local induction of a controlled wound-healing response involving macrophages and proliferating glia. Hence, the functional outcome of proliferative vitreoretinopathy will be determined by the equilibrium established between protective and destructive repair mechanisms, which will be influenced by the location and the degree of damage to the photoreceptor cells that is induced by peri-retinal gliosis...|$|R

Moreover, developing effective phenotyping strategies for transgenic as well as precision breeding of resistance genes into commercial varieties is critical.
