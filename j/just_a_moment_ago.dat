50|$|Elgin (William Katt) is {{a college}} student who {{spends much of his}} time {{studying}} literature and concentrating on his physical fitness by playing solitary soccer. One day, he overhears his friend David making love next door. He then hears David's girlfriend pounding on the door, demanding to know who's in his room with him. Shelly (Beverly D'Angelo) comes into Elgin's room wearing only a towel, implying she was the woman with David <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> Shelly says she will only be there for a short time until David finishes making love with his girlfriend; but it takes a lot longer. David thanks Elgin by setting him up with Shelly.|$|E
50|$|In phenomenology, {{the lived}} body {{is your own}} body as {{experienced}} by yourself, as yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows {{for the possibility of}} changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you are being touched).|$|E

50|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of one's own body as another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the subjectivity of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of apperception built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The lived body is your own body as experienced by yourself, as yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched).|$|E
5000|$|Byrne's album {{came about}} {{after she was}} signed by Sony Music Ireland. The album was {{recorded}} in Sphere Studios, London and produced by Nigel Wright. It contains 12 songs, 7 of which are songs she performed on The X Factor.Byrne said the album was {{a dream come true}} as she had dreamt of the moment all her life. She has confirmed that her management are planning her own debut tour, following the release of the album. Byrne also admitted that it felt very ‘surreal’ to be promoting her debut album. She added: “The record company rang me <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> and told me it’s doing well on the pre-orders, which in itself feels amazing. I performed on QVC last week and that’s what got the sales rocketing - I didn’t believe that could happen.The album includes familiar tracks which Byrne performed on The X Factor such as [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World", [...] "I (Who Have Nothing)" [...] and [...] "The Way We Were". Byrne stated that every song featured on the album has a [...] "special meaning" [...] to her and each song was chosen carefully for the memory or the feeling it creates when she sings it. The title of the album reflects Byrne's wish to include her fans in her incredible journey.|$|E
40|$|IF YOU REALLY want to {{hear about}} it, the first thing you'll {{probably}} want to know is what is this thesis all about? Since you are reading the abstract, that means one of two things, either you want to see what is ahead, to gain some overall perspective before delving int 6 the meat of the report, or. more likely you want a condensed version of the material of the report so you don't have to read all the text that you saw while flipping through on your initial glance. For those of you who read no text past this abstract. you are probably like me, and have come to expect a bunch of mindless dribble that is used to fill space on a page and make the author look like they know what the hell they're talking about when they really don't. As the deadline nears for this project I'm sure that my inability to get things done will result in some of this extraneous text that I mentioned <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> appearing throughout various portions of this thesis book. But I do believe there is a certain segment of this book, and my project, which provides some genuine insight into the nature of architectural expression. It deals with the design of a stage set for a production at Muncie Civic Theatre. Approximately 2. 400 people viewed the project over the run of the show. Very few of those people will ever see this book, or realize some of the deeper issues which my project has addressed, in fact many of the issues that I address within this report deal with situations and experiences revealed well after the date the set was actually "finished" from the audiences standpoint. Such it is with architecture [...] . the true essence of your design comes to life after the time that we as a profession deem the project "past the point of substantial completion. " In actuality this point marks the birth of your creation and the subsequent use of your design is when the magic takes place. This is a story about people interacting with spaces [...] . Architecture is dependent upon people, and must ultimately be judged by its impact upon our lives. So please take a few minutes to share in the experiences that I have nicely condensed into this book for you to contemplate. This whole book is an abstract for a semester in the life of an architecture student coming to grips with the world of design. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|E
