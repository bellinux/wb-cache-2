This article focuses on measures that may foster protection of investors' interests. In an experiment capturing the essential elements of asset management, we find that managers' accountability does not prevent their opportunistic behavior if not backed by a threat of punishment. Further, investors inefficiently sanction managers if not completely aware of managers' choices. To effectively protect investors in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediations,</b> <b>financial</b> regulators should ensure both managers' accountability and a credible sanctioning system...|$|R

Four specific variables of the financial dualism deepening and the <b>financial</b> micro <b>intermediation</b> are considered: the ratio of microcredit to GDP, the microcredit growth rate, the share of microcredit in the economy financing due {{to the private sector}} and the agents preference for decentralized deposits. Our findings show that the four variables have positive effect on technical efficiency with 0. 6 of semi-elasticity estimated on average whereas bank loans have on average only 0. 3 on average. We conclude that the <b>financial</b> micro <b>intermediation</b> development which results from the financial dualism deepening makes it possible to almost double increase the productive efficiency in WAEMU area. ...|$|R

Although the world is divided into more than 200 nations with unequal power, there is less than half a dozen key currencies to go round to facilitate the international financial transactions.

40|$|Both {{economic}} {{practice and}} economic theory {{are interested in}} analyzing the role of financial sector in promoting the economic development and economic growth. Commercial banks {{are the most important}} financial institutions in bank-based economies. The lending activities of commercial banks are limited by regulatory framework, management decisions and credit capacities of borrowers. Regulatory framework has been limited lending potentials of commercial banks because of capital requirements and liquidity management costs. Information asymmetry and adverse selection in decision-making enforce commercial banks to implement credit rationing process even in case of social significance of investment projects. Social responsibility of commercial banks cannot be measured according to the risk-taking activities.

2500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} basic interest rate {{as determined by the}} Federal Reserve. The interest above the basic rate applied by the lender is a <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> service and is subject to the FairTax (on a typical home mortgage only about one-half of one percent of interest would be subject to tax). Several economic studies have estimated that switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system such as the FairTax would result in an interest rate drop of approximately 25%. These changes would result in a decreased cost for home buyers. [...] As a comparison to the FairTax for encouraging home ownership, the current tax system would have to allow all taxpayers to fully deduct the purchase of used property against income and payroll taxes, expand the mortgage interest deduction so that it permits a deduction against payroll taxes, fully untax interest income to lenders and institutions, and fully untax returns on savings. [...] However, since several areas would be tax free under the FairTax plan, it could decrease the social incentive to spend more on homes in favor of savings, education, or other investments.|$|E

40|$|The author {{reviews the}} current state of affairs and {{thinking}} on external risk management for developing countries. He tries to identify the reasons behind the limited risk management by sovereigns. Perverse incentives arising from a too generous international safety net, limited access to international financial markets by developing countries arising from low creditworthiness, a limited supply of financial risk management tools suited to developing countries, and a poor supply of skills have inhibited risk management. Another constraint has been the limited attention given to the strategic objectives for risk management. Going forward, the author identifies actions by international financial markets, countries, and international financial institutions that can help improve risk management. These actions include GDP-indexed loans and efforts to develop price and weather indexes.

40|$|In a two-period model {{where an}} {{investment}} project is funded with standard debt, the probability distribution of final cash flow is determined, at the interim date, by an unverifiable {{state of nature}} together with a choice by the controlling party (entrepreneur or creditor). With a control allocation contingent on a noisy default signal, renegotiation may improve efficiency in two ways: (i) reduce excessive risk-taking - due to the entrepreneur's moral hazard - through debt forgiveness; (ii) avoid the costs of financial distress associated with excessive liquidation or underinvestment by debt-holders, by letting them receive an equity stake in the firm. Such efficiency gain is an advantage of bank loans over publicly traded debt, given that the former are more easily renegotiated than the latter. The {{difference between the two}} types of debt is increasing in the degree of contractual incompleteness (noise present in the default signal) and in the portion of project value accounted for by future discretionary investment options. incomplete contracts, debt renegotiation, <b>financial</b> distress, <b>intermediation,...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper derives {{the optimal}} {{size of the}} {{financial}} sector using a general equilibrium framework that {{is an extension of}} Holmstrom and Tirole's 1997 paper. We show that the financial sector has a unique optimal size relative {{to the size of the}} economy as a whole. Creating and maintaining this sector requires diversion of some physical capital from production of output to monitoring that production. However, the efficiency gain in output production brought about by monitoring warrants the diversion. It is also found that the optimal size of the financial sector is independent of the state of the economy and does not vary over the business cycle.

40|$|This paper aims {{to assist}} policy makers {{interested}} in establishing or strengthening financial strategies {{to increase the}} financial response capacity of developing country governments {{in the aftermath of}} natural disasters, while protecting their long-term fiscal balance. Contingent credit is shown to increase the ability of governments to self-insure by relaxing their short-term liquidity constraints. In many situations, contingent credit is most effectively used to facilitate risk retention for middle layers, with reserves used for bottom layers and risk transfer (for example, reinsurance) for top layers. Discussions with governments on the optimal use of contingent credit instruments as part of a sovereign catastrophe risk financing strategy can be guided by the output of a dynamic financial analysis model specifically developed to allow for the provision of contingent credit, in addition to reserves and/or reinsurance. This model is illustrated with three country case studies: agricultural production risks in India; tropical cyclone risk in Fiji; and earthquake risk in Costa Rica.
