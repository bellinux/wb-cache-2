60|$|John Jarwin {{would have}} thought little of {{swimming}} over that narrow belt of smooth water in ordinary circumstances, but now he felt that his strength was not equal to such a feat. Moreover, he {{knew that there were}} sharks in these waters, so he dismissed the idea of swimming, and cast about in his mind how he should manage to <b>get</b> <b>across.</b> <b>With</b> Jarwin, action soon followed thought. He resolved to form a small raft out of portions of the large one. Fortunately his clasp-knife had been attached, as seamen frequently have it, to his waist-belt, when he forsook his ship. This was the only implement that he possessed, but it was invaluable. With it he managed to cut the thick ropes that he could not have untied, and, in the course of two hours--for he laboured with extreme difficulty--a few broken planks and spars were lashed together. Embarking on this frail vessel with his dog, he pushed off, and using a piece of plank for an oar, sculled himself over the lagoon.|$|E

There are also interactive environments, with obstacles that are passable with copy abilities (examples include freezing water to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> <b>with</b> the Ice ability, or cutting down tall tufts of grass with his Sword or Cutter ability). Kirby is also able to collect and store copy abilities and items in his stomach, which is represented on the touch screen.

The player can combine certain abilities, similar to Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards; however, these are limited to only Sword, Fire, Ice, Spark, Bomb, and Wheel. Mixing abilities is achieved by dragging one ability over another with the stylus. If the two are compatible with each other, they will combine and produce a new ability (example: Fire + Sword = Fire Sword). This can only be done if the scroll (mentioned below) for a certain ability is found. However, if they are not compatible, they will combine to create a random bubble.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the second}} time, since the {{creation}} of Chesapeake in 2011, Yamagata utilized the fan-funded music platform PledgeMusic to fund the album Tightrope Walker. The album production ideas were spontaneous, experimental. Per her interview with AXS, she stated [...] "I just completely let whatever road we felt like taking. Whoever musicians were in the room, whatever instruments were in the room, we tried everything. It {{was a lot of}} experimentation. ... All of the production ideas were just very in-the-moment, spontaneous and fun to try. That led to us having a collection of arrangements I hadn't done before. We have mandolin on some tracks, of course I love strings and electric guitar, I write a lot on piano. Because we recorded in my house, we had the leisure of time, a very relaxed feel {{in the middle of the}} woods, with some great musicians up in Woodstock. I think a lot of the sounds came because we had fun with it. I was trying to trace the lyric, see what the storyline is, and then match the soundscape to what I'm trying to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> <b>with</b> the idea. That often takes me to strange, and unusual places." [...] The album name was influenced by an interview with Philippe Petit, the tightrope walker who crossed between the twin towers in New York City in 1974. Yamagata was affected by his response to an interview question that asked why he did what he did, and he responded [...] "Why - There is no why." [...] Yamagata's concept for the album started with a vision she had at her home in Woodstock, when she envisioned several strangers sitting in a tent, along with scenes from each of their past. This communal gathering showed there was a connection between the strangers. This allowed the album to focus on several themes, from hardships in careers, family issues, perseverance, relentlessness, owning your own power, while showing an optimism about life.|$|E
50|$|The tale told by The Wife of Bath in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} examples of the loathly Lady motif.  The story begins during the rule of King Arthur over the Isle of Britain.  It was a time when the people of the Isle of Britain were terrorized by friars who raped women. Instead of getting the women pregnant like the incubus did in the past, the Friars solely brought shame upon them without impregnating them.  The plot of the story begins when a Knight of King Arthur’s court rapes a young woman when he is overpowered by his lust for her.  The King and his court then come to the conclusion that decapitation is a punishment fit for the crime at hand, however the decision is intercepted by the Queen and women of the court before it can be executed.  The women persuade the King to grant him another chance on one condition.  They propose that if the Knight can find what women desire most from their partners and report it back to them in time, then the Knight will keep his head.  King Arthur then proceeds to accept the women's punishment and grants the knight this second chance.  Being given a second, the Knight quickly seizes this opportunity and sets out on a journey that may be more difficult than he first anticipated. Early in his quest the Knight comes to realize that each woman he questions seems to give him a different answer than the last.  As the Knight’s time begins to run out towards the end of his quest for the answer, he comes across a group of young women dancing and sets out to question them as well.  As the Knight draws near however, to his dismay, the group vanishes and turns into a loathly, old woman who offers to help him with his dilemma.  The old woman then graciously joins the Knight on his quest back and aids him in giving the answer to the women of the court.  Together, the Knight and the Loathly Lady tell the woman of the court that women desire sovereignty the most in their love life.  In simpler terms, the moral is that women want control over their partners.  The Wife of Bath then continues with her tale and says that the loathly woman asks to marry the knight in return for helping him.  The knight is forced to submit to the hags request although he protests for her to take his material things instead of his own flesh and blood.  They marry and consummate the marriage that very night. When the old woman realizes how unhappy the Knight is she asks him why he is so sorrowful and he tells her that he is unhappy to have married such an unattractive wife.  The wife responds to this comment by giving the Knight a choice: Either he can have an old, unattractive, yet loyal wife or a young and beautiful wife that will be unfaithful to him.  The knight decides to let the wife choose and she gives him instead a beautiful and loyal wife, because he gave her the sovereignty to choose. The moral that the Wife of Bath is attempting to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> <b>with</b> her tale is that a woman’s greatest desire in her life is to have control over her partner.  The Canterbury Tales is the most cited and well known literary piece that utilizes the use of the loathly lady motif.  Geoffrey Chaucer shook the ideology associated with gender roles in the fourteenth century with his literary work The Canterbury Tales.  Women in the middle ages were seen as subordinates to men in all situations including marriage.  There are some rare exceptions to this rule, however the overwhelming majority of women in the middle ages were considered equals to men at best.  Mmarriage was a concrete exclusive bond between husband and wife; giving the husband all power and control in the relationship wives had to submit to their husband’s authority.  With the popularity that Chaucer gained in the Middle Ages, his concept of an authoritative woman in his literary works helped redefine (along with the help of other historical women icons such as Isabella I Castile and Joan of Arc) the way Middle Age society treated women. The theme of the loathly lady in this piece of literature opposed the idea of a patriarchal society and played a role in the beginnings of a feminist movement.  Geoffrey Chaucer’s Wife of Bath was a character created as a critique of the society that he lived in.  The idea that The Wife of Bath portrayed of women having control over their male counterpart was highly unpopular for its time.  Using the loathly lady motif, she shapes the moral of her story to be that no matter the age, women always want control and should be allowed to exercise this privilege.   This caught the attention of many scholars and in effect provided for a continuance of the controversial morals of his articles (such as the loathly lady motif) to be passed on to the new generation and change the ideology of the time.|$|E
