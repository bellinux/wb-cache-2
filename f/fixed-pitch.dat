25|$|European UL, fixed undercarriage, <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller.|$|E
25|$|The Aircraft is a high-wing, strut-braced {{monoplane}} with a large-area rectangular wing. It {{is powered}} by an air-cooled piston engine driving a <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller. Its fuselage is a welded steel frame covered in fabric, seating two people in tandem.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{primarily}} wooden, with plywood-skinned spruce frames. The cantilever oleo-pneumatic fixed main undercarriage legs were faired with spats. The undercarriage, tail unit and outer wing panels were {{adapted from the}} Parnall Heck 2C. The propeller was a de Havilland <b>fixed-pitch</b> type. Student and tutor sat in open, tandem cockpits, but the rear cockpit was later enclosed.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ship}} was launched, the QE2 was fitted out with a steam turbine {{propulsion}} system utilising three Foster Wheeler E.S.D II boilers, which provided steam for the two Brown-Pametrada turbines. The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of 110,000 shaft horsepower (normally operating at 94,000hp) and were coupled to two six-bladed <b>fixed-pitch</b> propellers.|$|E
25|$|During the era {{in which}} the Hawker Aircraft company would develop the Hurricane, RAF Fighter Command {{consisted}} of just 13 squadrons, each equipped with either the Hawker Fury, Hawker Demon, or the Bristol Bulldog, all biplanes furnished with <b>fixed-pitch</b> wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages. At the time, there was an institutional reluctance towards change within the Air Staff; according to aviation author Francis K. Mason, some senior figures were prejudiced against the adoption of monoplane fighter aircraft, while mid-level officers were typically approachable on the subject and design concepts that made use of such configurations.|$|E
25|$|Official {{addressing}} protocol is for {{the address}} to be in block letters, using a <b>fixed-pitch</b> typeface (such as Courier). The first line(s) of the address contain(s) the personal name and internal address of the recipient. The second-to-last line is the post office box, general delivery indicator, or street address, using the shortened name of the street type and no punctuation. The last line consists of the legal place name, a single space, the two-letter province abbreviation, two full spaces, and then the postal code. The country designation is unnecessary if mailed within Canada.|$|E
25|$|Sisu was a {{diesel-electric}} icebreaker with a {{power plant}} consisting of three eight-cylinder Atlas Polar single-acting two-stroke diesel engines, each rated at 1,600hp in continuous operation, directly coupled to 1,070kVA Strömberg generators. The diesel-driven direct current (DC) double-armature generators supplied electricity to three 1,335hp Strömberg DC motors, two driving <b>fixed-pitch</b> propellers in the stern and the third coupled to a single forward-facing propeller in the bow, through a Ward Leonard drive system. In addition, Sisu had three 200hp auxiliary diesel generators which provided electricity for other onboard consumers as well as excitation current for the main generators.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{considered}} {{safety features}} highly, building in structural strength {{as well as}} incorporating design elements that enhanced customer comfort and well-being, such as the thermostatically-controlled, air conditioned and soundproof cabin. The crew included a pilot and copilot {{as well as a}} flight attendant who could tend to passenger needs. The main landing gear did not fully retract; a portion of the wheels extended below the nacelles, typical of designs of the time, as a means of reducing structural damage in a wheels-up landing. The tailwheel was not retractable. While the Model 247 and 247A had speed-ring engine cowlings and <b>fixed-pitch</b> propellers, the Model 247D incorporated NACA cowlings and variable-pitch propellers.|$|E
25|$|Replacing the old Dynaflow-based {{two-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available {{with the standard}} two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine {{as well as the}} 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a <b>fixed-pitch</b> converter.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is of all-metal construction, with cantilever mid-wings with detachable tips. The {{leading edges}} are swept-back, and the stressed-skin wings have flaps inboard of the ailerons. The fuselage is a monocoque structure, with a hinged nose to allow loading of a stretcher or other awkward loads. Seating {{can be arranged}} for one pilot and five passengers, or two pilots and three passengers. There is a door {{on both sides of}} the cabin, and there is a baggage compartment behind the rear seats. The tailplane has twin fins at the ends of the dihedral stabiliser. The elevators and rudders are fabric-covered. The tricycle landing gear is hydraulically retractable. The two engines are mounted towards the rear of the wing, driving 2-bladed <b>fixed-pitch</b> pusher propellers. Originally planned to use Blackburn Cirrus Major III engines, it was fitted with Walter Minor 6-III engines.|$|E
25|$|The first Bf 109 in serial {{production}}, the Bf 109 B-1, {{was fitted}} with the 670PS (661hp, 493kW) Jumo 210D engine driving a two-bladed <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller. During the production run a variable-pitch propeller was introduced and often retrofitted to older aircraft; these were then unofficially known as B-2s. The Bf 109B saw combat with the Legion Condor during the Spanish Civil War, {{although it was}} apparent that the armament was still inadequate. Several aircraft were produced with an engine-mounted machine gun but it was very unreliable, most likely because of engine vibrations and overheating. Thus the Bf 109 V8 was constructed to test the fitting of two more machine guns in the wings; however, results showed that the wing needed strengthening. In the following V9 prototype, both wing guns were replaced by 20mm MG FF cannons.|$|E
25|$|Perfect fifths may be justly tuned or tempered. Two notes whose {{frequencies}} {{differ by}} {{a ratio of}} 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does {{not return to the}} original pitch class after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly detuned, or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be transposed, or played in any key on a piano or other <b>fixed-pitch</b> instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially keyboard and fretted) instruments today, twelve-tone equal temperament, uses an irrational multiplier, 21/12, to calculate the frequency difference of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a frequency ratio of 27/12:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.|$|E
25|$|The first version, the Gladiator Mk I, was {{delivered}} from July 1936, becoming operational in January 1937. The Mk II soon followed, the main differences being {{a slightly more}} powerful Mercury VIIIAS engine with Hobson mixture control boxes and a partly automatic boost control carburettor, driving a Fairey <b>fixed-pitch</b> three-blade metal propeller, instead of the two-blade wooden one of the Mark I. All MK II Gladiators also carried Browning 0.303-inch machine guns (licence-manufactured by the BSA company in Birmingham) {{in place of the}} Vickers-Lewis combination of the MK I. A modified Mk II, the Sea Gladiator, was developed for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), with an arrestor hook, catapult attachment points, a strengthened airframe and an underbelly fairing for a dinghy lifeboat, all for operations aboard aircraft carriers. Of the 98 aircraft built as, or converted to, Sea Gladiators, 54 were still in service by the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{production}} model was the IIID, {{which was an}} improved IIIC, with provision for a third crewmember and capable of being fitted with either a floatplane or a conventional wheeled undercarriage. It first flew in August 1920, powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle, and initial production for the Fleet Air Arm, together with aircraft produced for Australia and Portugal retained the Eagle, while later aircraft were powered by the more powerful Napier Lion. The naval variants were usually three-seaters; pilot, observer and gunner and the wings would could be folded back parallel to the fuselage for storage aboard ship. In floatplane configuration, carrier-borne Fairey IIIs would be launched from the deck using a trolley and would land on the water upon their return. The Fairey III floatplane could also be catapult-launched from a ship. The IIID had a wooden, fabric-covered fuselage and usually a wooden, two-blade, <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller. One IIID was built with metal wings and floats. A total of 207 IIIDs were produced for the Fleet Air Arm and RAF (Royal Air Force), with a further 20 being built for export.|$|E
25|$|To tune a violin, the A string {{is first}} tuned to a {{standard}} pitch (usually 440Hz). (When accompanying or playing with a <b>fixed-pitch</b> instrument such as a piano or accordion, the violin tunes to it.) The other strings are then tuned {{against each other in}} intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. A minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound; conversely, Baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violin's sound more gentle. After tuning, the instrument's bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f-holes; a crooked bridge may significantly affect the sound of an otherwise well-made violin. After extensive playing, the holes into which the tuning pegs are inserted can become worn, which can lead the peg to slip under tension. This can lead to the pitch of the string dropping, or if the peg becomes completely loose, to the string completely losing tension. A violin in which the tuning pegs are slipping needs to be repaired by a luthier or violin repairperson. Peg dope or peg compound, used regularly, can delay the onset of such wear, while allowing the pegs to turn smoothly.|$|E
25|$|The Bf 109A was {{the first}} version of the Bf 109. Armament was {{initially}} planned to be just two cowl-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns. However, possibly due to the introduction of the Hurricane and Spitfire, each with eight 7.7mm (.303in) machine guns, experiments were carried out with a third machine gun firing through the propeller shaft. V4 and some A-0 were powered by a 640PS (631hp, 471kW) Junkers Jumo 210B engine driving a two-blade <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller, but production was changed to the 670PS (661hp, 493kW) Jumo 210D as soon as it became available. The A-0 was not of a uniform type; there were several changes in their appearance. Visible changes included engine, cockpit and machine gun ventilation holes/slats, and the location of the oil cooler was changed several times to prevent overheating. Many of these Bf 109 A-0 served with the Legion Condor and were often misidentified as B-series aircraft, and probably served in Spain with the tactical markings 6-1 to 6–16. One A-0, marked as 6–15, ran out of fuel and was forced to land behind enemy lines. It was captured by Republican troops on 11 November 1937 and later transferred to the Soviet Union for a closer inspection. 6–15 incorporated several improvements from the Bf 109B production program and had been prepared to use a variable-pitch propeller although it had not been installed.|$|E
500|$|Some early {{production}} aircraft had imported Bristol Jupiter VI engines {{with a metal}} cowling, {{but the bulk of}} the {{production aircraft}} used the M-22 license-built copy, both of , with a Townend ring. Early aircraft usually had a <b>fixed-pitch</b> wooden propeller with a diameter of , but these were replaced by a [...] duralumin propeller without a spinner that could have its pitch adjusted on the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{engine room}} on a bulker is usually near the stern, under the superstructure. Larger bulkers, from Handymax up, {{usually have a}} single {{two-stroke}} low-speed crosshead diesel engine directly coupled to a <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller. Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and/or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft. On the smaller bulkers, one or two four-stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable-pitch propeller via a reduction gearbox, which may also incorporate an output for an alternator. The average design ship speed for bulkers of Handysize and above is [...] The propeller speed is relatively low, at about 90 revolutions per minute, although {{it depends on the}} size of the propeller.|$|E
500|$|The ships' {{company is}} 679 rising to 1,600 with air element added. A more recent {{parliamentary}} reply stated the average crew size will be 672. They {{will have a}} displacement of 65,000 tonnes on delivery, but the design allows for this to reach over 70,000 tonnes as the ship is upgraded through its lifetime. They have an overall length of , a width at deck level of , a height of , a draught of [...] {{and a range of}} [...] The Ministry of Defence decided not to use nuclear propulsion due to its high cost, so power is supplied by two Rolls-Royce Marine Trent MT30 [...] gas turbine generator units and four Wärtsilä diesel generator sets (two [...] and two [...] sets). The Trents and diesels are the largest ever supplied to the Royal Navy, and together they feed the low-voltage electrical systems as well as four GE Power Conversion's 20MW Advanced Induction Motor (arranged in tandem) electric propulsion motors that drive the twin <b>fixed-pitch</b> propellers.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 April 1935, the {{prototype}} {{was transferred to}} the Royal Air Force (RAF), receiving the designation K5200, and commenced operational evaluations of the type. Around the same time, Gloster proceeded to plan a further improved version, featuring an [...] Mercury IX engine, a two-blade wooden <b>fixed-pitch</b> propeller, improved wheel disks and a fully enclosed cockpit. K5200 was later used to trial modifications for production aircraft, such as the addition of a sliding hood for the pilot.|$|E
