This is primarily because of the re-absorption of free light chains in the kidneys, creating a threshold of light chain production which must be exceeded before measurable quantities overflow into the urine. As such, urinalysis is a fickle witness to changing free light chain production.|$|E

30|$|This letter has {{proposed}} {{a model for the}} main generic features of the channels with nanostructured inner walls with respect to trapping and accumulation of impurities carried by fluids. This includes, e.g., their capability to clean the fluid from impurities of a size much smaller than the channels’ nominal radius, with comparatively small resistance to flow (much smaller than in conventional channels with a radius as small as the impurities). The model attributes the enhanced <b>filtration</b> <b>capability</b> to the long-range attraction exerted by the exposed charges in the nanostructured walls and also to their binding capability once the impurities actually collide with them. Both features were quantitatively accounted for by means of a phenomenological ‘effective-charge density’ of the nanostructured wall.

40|$|Cell-to-cell {{variations}} in protein abundance, called noise, {{give rise to}} phenotypic variability between isogenic cells. Studies of noise have focused on stochasticity introduced at transcription, yet the effects of post-transcriptional regulatory processes on noise remain unknown. We {{study the effects of}} RyhB, a small-RNA of Escherichia coli produced on iron stress, on the phenotypic variability of two of its downregulated target proteins, using dual chromosomal fusions to fluorescent reporters and measurements in live individual cells. The total noise of each of the target proteins is remarkably constant over a wide range of RyhB production rates despite cells being in stress. In fact, coordin-ate downregulation of the two target proteins by RyhB reduces the correlation between their levels. Hence, an increase in phenotypic variability under stress is achieved by decoupling the expression of different target proteins in the same cell, rather than by an increase in the total noise of each. Extrinsic noise provides the dominant contribution to the total protein noise over the total range of RyhB production rates.

The deployment period (September 2012 -April 2013) was characterized by very little stratification and a median temperature of about throughout the water column. A mean horizontal velocity of 3. 6 cm/s {{with a standard deviation of}} 2 cm/s was also measured at 1 meter above the lake bed. In spite of the 60 m depth of the measurement site, surface waves were found to influence near-bottom velocities for a significant fraction of the time, with periods between 6. 5 and 12. 5 seconds. Fluctuations in velocity were used to quantify turbulence through the use of turbulent kinetic energy (tke) calculations, while simple spectral analysis was used to verify tke levels and identify possible wave contamination. At distances greater than 500 z+ from the bed, turbulent kinetic energy levels follow canonical scaling with values of approximately 5. However, very near-bottom tke levels are greatly elevated relative to the expected values, which we speculate may be due to mussel-induced currents. These conclusions coupled with further modeling will allow for the development of mussel-influence models that will prove important to understanding the impact of these invasive species...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the population structure, influence on local native communities, and filtration capability of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. C. gigas was first introduced into the UK for commercial purposes in 1964. The success of initial growth and survival trials of introduced individuals in the River Yealm, Devon then led to a number of hatcheries becoming established. This study, involving the examination of C. gigas at four sites within one location, looks at the subsequent establishment of the species in the Yealm Estuary which has possibly resulted from the settlement of larvae from these initial hatcheries. A study of distribution and population structure concluded that despite displaying a clear vertical distribution pattern on the lower mid-shore, there was no such definitive horizontal trend. Size structure at each of the four sites was found to be dependant on the location in the Estuary. Community structure was investigated with regards to oyster density. Species richness was not found to differ when these densities varied between high, medium, low and absent. In areas of high density oyster patches, however, a significantly greater number of mobile invertebrates were recorded in comparison to the remaining three densities. Furthermore, community assemblages were found to differ between areas of high and absent, as well as between low and absent densities of oysters. It is probable that the presence of C. gigas is helping to shape these communities by providing a refuge space. Estimates of <b>filtration</b> <b>capabilities</b> revealed higher filtration rates at sites with greater oyster. abundance. This finding was considered with respect to previous studies in the literature and it was postulated that consequences may result m increased sedimentation and reduced surface velocities.

Diatomaceous earth (DE) is widely used in the filtration of beer to remove suspended yeast and other particulate material that can cause cloudiness or haze in the final product. The DE used has a particle size diameter of between 60 and 100 um. However, health and safety concerns arise its human carcinogenic classification in 1997 from Category 2 (Probable Human Carcinogen) to Category 1 (Human Carcinogen) by the IARC. In a confidential study conducted at Adelaide University, zeolite-A, a hydrated aluminosilicate of alkali earth metals, showed promising <b>filtration</b> <b>capabilities</b> when used in the removal of haze in white wine. Zeolite-A is non-toxic via oral, dermal, ocular and respiratory exposure as well as safe for the environment at disposal. An experimental study to investigate zeolite-A as a possible substitute for DE in the brewing industry was therefore undertaken. The particular zeolite-A used was selected as it was judged as nearly the same as that manufactured within the Department of Chemical Engineering, Adelaide University from naturally occurring deposits of kaolin. Two size-grades of zeolite-A (large diameter particles of 125 - 250 um and small diameter particles of 63 - 125 um) were selected to cover the particle size range of widely used DE (as Celite 503). These two zeolites, together with filter sand (200 um diameter particle size) and silica were experimentally evaluated against DE in the clarification of beer simulants and commercial beer product. Flux-time experiments on each of three packed beds of each of the five filter media (3. 63, 11. 23, 18. 83 g) with three values of pressure driving force (70, 125, 180 kPa) were carried out in a specially constructed pilot plant, initially in the laboratory and later in situ in a commercial brewing plant. This special pilot plant, together with protocols for the preparation of media, simulated conditions and practices in current use in the brewing industry. The flux obtained from the small grade zeolite-A (particle 63 - 125 um) was significantly lower compared to DE, i. e. respectively, 22 mLm⁻²s⁻¹ and 390 mLm⁻²s⁻¹ (using 18. 83 g media at 180 kPa) Large grade zeolite-A (particle size 125 - 250 um) showed comparable flux properties to DE with flux rate of 290 mLm⁻²s⁻¹. Microbiological analyses were carried out initially on eight selected filter media - which also additionally included pumice, perlite and cellulose (as cotton wool) - to assess effectiveness in removing haze forming constituents from a simulated beer (yeast solution) and two home-brewed beer types. The pumice, perlite and cellulose were rejected as alternative filter media because of poor performance in haze removal. Microbiological, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out on each of the five remaining media. Results of the microbial analyses highlighted that DE and zeolite-A were the best filter media because practically all yeast cells were retained on the filter cake from both the simulated beer and the home-brewed beers. With filtration of commercial beers using small grade zeolite-A as the filter medium in situ at Cooper's Brewery an increase in pH value of the filtrate of 2. 0 pH units was observed. For large grade zeolite-A the pH increase of the filtrate was less than 0. 5 pH units. This increased pH of the filtrate with both grades of zeolite-A was demonstrated to be due to the release of sodium ions from the filter medium. Additional experiments were conducted to exhaust the sodium from the filter media of both the small and large grade zeolite-A. The pH of the filtrates was monitored for between 8 and 16 h of continuous filtration to determine if all sodium could be exhausted from the medium. A practical constraint was that the filter cake became clogged with yeast and other solid particles from the beer haze before a noticeable change in pH of the filtrate could be observed. Sensory analyses of filtrates of each of the five selected media were carried out by 16 industry noses to assess: colour, aroma, taste, clarity and drinkability (= overall impression). Overall the large grade zeolite-A filtrates compared satisfactorily with the DE filtrates in ratings of differences from the Descriptive Method employed in the brewery industry for colour, taste, aroma, clarity and drinkability. Small grade zeolite-A filtrates however compared poorly where the filtrate was regarded as inferior to DE, filter sand and silica, by {{all the members of the}} panel of noses. Small grade zeolite-A was further found to have a significant adverse effect on the filtrate taste using the Triangular Method widely employed commercially for establishing taste. Therefore small grade zeolite-A was deemed an unsuitable filter substitute for DE in the clarification and removal of haze constitutes in commercial beer. Large grade zeolite-A however appears to be a suitable substitute filter medium for DE in the removal of haze constituents in beer. Importantly it can be readily substituted for DE without the need for significant changes in brewery industry process equipment and protocols for preparation. The findings from this study are sufficient to strongly recommend a focused study on contributing chemical and mechanical factors to the (small) pH increase of the filtrate using large grade zeolite-A. It is not known whether a range of zeolites might also provide a practical substitute to DE, present understanding must therefore be said to be limited. Other zeolites proposed for the removal of haze from beer would need to be evaluated experimentally. The pilot plant and procedures developed for this study would be readily applicable for such an undertaking. An important justification for future work is that a suitable substitute for DE such as zeolite-A is seen as timely in view of the significant health risks associated with the established carcinogenic properties of DE. There is no evidence available to show that zeolites have been studied as an alternative to DE for the removal of haze (in beer or wine). Therefore the findings reported in the present study for zeolite-A, together with earlier findings from the polishing of white wine, strongly indicate the basis for development of IP patent(s).

Trees, however, can influence the microclimate through radiation control that indirectly reduces direct radiation uptake and glare by humans and buildings. This condition affects building energy budget and human thermal comfort. This study compares the effectiveness of Mesua ferrea L. and Hura crepitans L. in shade creation and radiation modification in improving human thermal comfort. The study employed two methods: (i) a field measurement procedure and (ii) a computer-based sun-shading analysis using ECOTECT. The {{results from this study}} indicate that both M. ferrea L. and H. crepitans L. contribute significantly to direct thermal radiation modification below their canopies. The average solar filtration under the tree canopy for M. ferrea L. was 93 %, with 5 % canopy transmissivity, 6. 1 % of leaf area index (LAI) and 35 % of shade area. For H. crepitans L. the average heat filtration under the canopy was 79 %, with transmissivity of 22 %, LAI of 1. 5 and 52 % of shade area. Thus, the study found that M. ferrea L. was more significant as a thermal radiation filter than H. crepitans L., due to the former's denser foliage cover and branching habit.

From these relationships, 3 indices of vascular structural properties were estimated: slope of F-P (minimal renal vascular resistance reflecting overall luminal dimensions of preglomerular and postglomerular vasculature), slope of P-GFR (glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>capability</b> against pressure), and threshold pressure for beginning filtration at P-GFR (preglomerular-to-postglomerular vascular resistance ratio).

However, due to anatomical differences between human and rodent nasal cavities, direct particle deposition comparisons between species are difficult. This paper presents a comparative nanoparticle (1 nm, 10 nm, and 100 nm) deposition study using anatomically realistic models of a human and rat nasal cavity. The particle deposition fraction was highest consistently in the main nasal passage, for all nanoparticles tested, in the human model; while this was only the case for 10 nm, and 100 nm particles for the rodent model, where greater deposition was found in the anterior nose for 1 nm particles. A deposition intensity (DI) term was introduced to represent the accumulated deposition fraction on cross-sectional slices. A common and preferential deposition site in the human model was found for all nanoparticles occurring at a distance of 3. 5 cm inside the nasal passage. For the rodent model maximum DI occurred in the vestibule region at a distance of 0. 3 cm, indicating that the rodent vestibule produces exceptionally high particle <b>filtration</b> <b>capability.</b> We also introduced a deposition flux which was a ratio of the regional deposition fraction relative to the region&# 039;s surface area fraction.

During testing it was found that this technology does reduce pathogens but will only remove a portion of them per pass, and thus is not adequate for use as a one pass pathogenic filter. The filter was found to be well suited for the reduction in the amount of suspended and dissolved solids, increasing clarity, and reduction of odor. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the electrospun fibrous pads to narrow down on an ideal parameter set that gave the desirable characteristics for the application of filtration. The composition of the polymer, and electrospinning parameters, were also manipulated to give a hydrophilic, or absorbent, membrane to facilitate a low pressure differential for filtration. It was demonstrated that this type of filtration membrane can be manufactured inexpensively while not requiring electricity or other external power source to generate large pressure differentials and flow. This is desirable because it allows this technology to be used in areas where both basic utilities and clean water are limited, for example in remote Africa and India. It was also shown that this filter has benefits over best selling commercial water filters currently on the market. This technology may be best suited for enhancement of tap water where healthier and cleaner water is desired. Pre-filtration of reverses osmosis (RO) or other ultrafine filter system, to increase the life of the primary filter while decreasing fouling and maintenance may be another application...|$|R
40|$|Renal failure {{results in}} {{poisoning}} because metabolic by-products are not promptly {{removed from the}} body. The main remedy for this condition is hemo-dialysis, where blood bypasses the kidneys and is filtered in a “dialyzer”, stationary machine. This research proposes and verifies novel techniques that allow an implantable device to replace a dialysis machine. This device would perform two important kidney functions: filtering solids and retaining desired electrolytes and small proteins. Three independent approaches are proposed and experimentally verified. The first approach is design optimization of the glomerular membrane as an implantable filter to separate blood cells from whole blood. We studied the parameters that minimized pressure drop per unit area in micro-channels (straight and diverging) with circular cross-sections. The second approach, aimed at extending the <b>filtration</b> <b>capability</b> of a porous membrane, used the concept of “back-wash”. It used a natural energy source in the body, the pulsatile character of blood flow, with pressure varying between 80 and 120 mm Hg. Under similar experimental conditions, experimental results demonstrated that the permeate volumetric flow rate was higher in the backwash system compared to the no-backwash system, and this flow rate could be maintained for many more filtration cycles. The third approach, which retained body electrolytes and small proteins, used a static electric field to divert blood ions and charged proteins back to circulation. Two geometries for this electrophoretic filtration were proposed and tested: “Y” method and “cross-flow” method. The “cross-flow” method seems more promising after a preliminary comparison. A benefit of using the electrostatic deviation of charged solids before mechanical filtration is a lower density of blood solids reaching the filtration membrane, causing a lower probability of filter clogging. Due {{to the importance of}} maintaining proper pressure drops at all renal filtration stages an implantable valveless pump was designed and fabricated for pressure drop adjustments. This pump’s novelty is that it relies entirely on blood pressure pulsations and does not require an external power supply. None of the proposed filtration techniques requires external power supplies; all rely on energy delivered by the heart...|$|R
40|$|Nocturnal blood {{pressure}} is elevated with natriuresis and proteinuria as renal function deteriorates in nephropathy. BackgroundWe reported that patients with sodium sensitive type of hypertension exhibited the lack of nocturnal fall in {{blood pressure}} with enhanced natriuresis during night. Sodium sensitivity is caused by diminished glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>capability</b> and/or augmented tubular reabsorption of sodium, and seems tightly linked with glomerular capillary hypertension. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between glomerular filtration rate and circadian rhythms of these parameters in patients with glomerulopathy. MethodsTwenty six patients (15 men and 11 women; aged 17 to 72 years; mean age 47 ± 3 years), whose diagnosis was confirmed as glomerulopathy with renal biopsy, were studied during hospitalization. Ambulatory blood pressure for 24 hours was monitored, while urinary samples were collected for both daytime (6 : 00 a. m. to 9 : 00 p. m.) and nighttime (9 : 00 p. m. to 6 : 00 a. m.) to estimate circadian rhythms of urinary sodium and protein excretion rates (UNaV, UproV). Then night/day ratios of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), UNaV, and UproV were analyzed in relation to 24 -hour creatinine clearance as a marker of glomerular filtration rate. ResultsSerum creatinine and creatinine clearance were 1. 1 ± 0. 1 mg/dL and 89 ± 7 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2. There were significant day-night differences in MAP (96 ± 2 mm Hg vs. 92 ± 2 mm Hg; P = 0. 006), UNaV (6. 7 ± 0. 9 mmol/hour vs. 3. 6 ± 0. 3 mmol/hour; P = 0. 003), and UproV (161 ± 27 mg/hour vs. 128 ± 28 mg/hour; P = 0. 02). Creatinine clearance had significantly negative relationships with night/day ratios of MAP (r=- 0. 49; P = 0. 01), UNaV (r=- 0. 43; P = 0. 03,) and UproV (r=- 0. 41; P = 0. 04). In addition, night/day ratio of MAP had significantly positive relationships with night/day ratios of UNaV (r = 0. 49; P = 0. 01) and UproV (r = 0. 45; P = 0. 02). ConclusionOur results show that as renal function deteriorates in glomerulopathy the nocturnal dip in {{blood pressure is}} lost, resulting in enhanced urinary sodium and protein excretions during night. These findings are compatible with our proposal that impaired natriuresis during daytime makes nocturnal blood pressure elevated to compensate for diminished natriuresis by pressure natriuresis. We speculate that nocturnal glomerular capillary hypertension contributes, at least in part, to enhanced urinary sodium and protein excretions during night...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{graphene}} oxide (GO) concentration dependent protein binding (BSA) and dye <b>filtration</b> (RO- 16) <b>capabilities</b> of polysulfone-GO composite membranes under different pH conditions (2, 7 and 10). The membranes were fabricated with different GO concentrations (1, 2, 4 and 8 % w/w) and were successfully characterized for their {{physical and chemical}} properties, {{as well as for}} their performance ability. The best BSA binding and dye rejection rates were observed with 2 % GO membrane at pH = 10, which were 95 % and 78. 26 % respectively, suggesting that 2 % is the optimal concentration. Further, considering the fact that RO- 16 dye is acidic friendly, contact time studies were carried out with 2 % GO membranes at pH = 2 and pH = 10. It was observed that 2 % GO-polysulfone membrane at pH = 2 shows the highest dye rejection rate of 87. 4 %, supporting the importance of contact time in filtration technology...|$|R
40|$|In 1997 the Czechoslovakian and Hungarian governments {{entered into}} a Treaty that called for a joint project to build two dams on the Danube river, one in Gabcikovo, Czechoslovakia and one in Nagymaros, Hungary. The {{original}} intent {{of the project was}} to provide a system of canals, reservoirs and locks to improve transportation on the river. The Czechoslovakia blocked and diverted he Danube River at Cunovo, Czechoslovakia causing an immediate negative environmental impact. The largest fresh water aquifer in the region lost more than two thirds of its water. The ground water level dropped by 12 feet contributing to the desertification of he region. The river flow was slowed, and in some areas stopped altogether, creating stagnate pools which were breeding grounds or disease. The natural <b>filtration</b> and cleansing <b>capability</b> of the river was harmed, increasing the level of pollution in both the river and the aquifer. Continued construction of the dams could have had lasting negative effects to the ecosystem in the region. The Hungarians ceased construction in 1989 sighting environmental degradation as their reason for discontinuing their part of the project. The Slovakian government subsequently took the Hungarians to court to resolve the issue...|$|R
