50|$|<b>Immunoelectrophoresis</b> is {{a general}} name {{for a number of}} {{biochemical}} methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized. The methods were developed and used extensively {{during the second half of}} the 20th century. In somewhat chronological order: Immunoelectrophoretic analysis (one-dimensional <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> ad modum Grabar), crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> (two-dimensional quantitative <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell), rocket-immunoelectrophoresis (one-dimensional quantitative <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> ad modum Laurell), fused rocket <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> ad modum Svendsen and Harboe, affinity <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> ad modum BÃ¸g-Hansen.|$|E
50|$|Rocket <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> is {{one-dimensional}} quantitative <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b> The {{method has}} been used for quantitation of human serum proteins before automated methods became available.|$|E
50|$|Affinity <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> {{is based}} on changes in the electrophoretic pattern of {{proteins}} through specific interaction or complex formation with other macromolecules or ligands. Affinity <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> {{has been used for}} estimation of binding constants, as for instance with lectins or for characterization of proteins with specific features like glycan content or ligand binding. Some variants of affinity <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> are similar to affinity chromatography by use of immobilized ligands.|$|E

50|$|Crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> is {{also called}} {{two-dimensional}} quantitative <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell. In this method the proteins are first separated {{during the first}} dimension electrophoresis, then instead of the diffusion towards the antibodies, the proteins are electrophoresed into an antibody-containing gel in the second dimension. Immunoprecipitation will take place during the second dimension electrophorsis andthe immunoprecipitates have a characteristic bell-shape, each precipitate representing one antigen, {{the position of the}} precipitate being dependent on the amount of protein as well as the amount of specific antibody in the gel, so relative quantification can be performed. The sensitivity and resolving power of crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> is than that of the classical immunoelectrophoretic analysis and there are multiple variations of the technique useful for various purposes. Crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> has been used for studies of proteins in biological fluids, particularly human serum, and biological extracts.|$|E
50|$|Sodium {{barbital}} and barbital {{have also}} been used as pH buffers for biological research, e.g., in <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> or in fixative solutions.|$|E
50|$|Fused rocket <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> is a {{modification}} of one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophorsis used for detailed measurement of proteins in fractions from protein separation experiments.|$|E
50|$|Western blot: couples gel {{electrophoresis}} and incubation with antibodies to detect specific proteins {{in a sample}} of tissue homogenate or extract (a type of <b>Immunoelectrophoresis</b> technique).|$|E
5000|$|Pull-down assays are {{a common}} {{variation}} of immunoprecipitation and <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and are used identically, although this approach is more amenable to an initial screen for interacting proteins.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, protein {{electrophoresis}} is {{a method}} of analysing the proteins mainly in blood serum. Before {{the widespread use of}} gel electrophoresis, protein electrophoresis was performed as free-flow electrophoresis (on paper) or as <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Solutions {{of sodium}} {{barbital}} {{have also been}} used as pH buffers for biological research, e.g., in <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> or in fixative solutions. As barbital is a controlled substance, barbital-based buffers have largely been replaced by other substances.|$|E

5000|$|Antigen-antibody {{interaction}} {{is used in}} laboratory techniques for serological test of blood compatibility and various pathogenic infections. The most basic is ABO blood group determination, which is useful for blood transfusion. Sophisticated applications include ELISA, [...] enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot), immunofluorescence, and <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) assays {{have been proven}} {{to be more sensitive}} than either LAT or culture tests, and highly specific.

50|$|Immunoprecipitates {{may be seen}} in the wet agarose gel, but are {{stained with}} protein stains like Coomassie Brilliant Blue in the dried gel. In {{contrast}} to SDS-gel electrophoresis, the electrophoresis in agarose allows native conditions, preserving the native structure and activities of the proteins under investigation, therefore <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> allows characterization of enzyme activities and ligand binding etc. in addition to electrophoretic separation.|$|E

50|$|Academy {{scientists}} have been early adapters of molecular biology techniques. Allozymes, DNA-DNA hybridization, <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and serology were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs DNA sequencing, microsatellites, and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training {{for the use of}} molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.|$|E
50|$|Two factors {{determine}} that immunoelectrophoretic methods are not widely used. First they are rather work intensive and require some manual expertise. Second they require rather {{large amounts of}} polyclonal antibodies. Today gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting is the preferred method for protein characterization because its ease of operation, its high sensitivity, and its low requirement for specific antibodies. In addition proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis {{on the basis of}} their apparent molecular weight, which is not accomplished by <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> but nevertheless immunoelectrophoretic methods are still useful when non-reducing conditions are needed.|$|E
50|$|Protein {{electrophoresis}} is {{a method}} for analysing the proteins in a fluid or an extract. The electrophoresis may be performed with a small volume of sample {{in a number of}} alternative ways with or without a supporting medium: SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (in short: gel electrophoresis, PAGE, or SDS-electrophoresis), free-flow electrophoresis, electrofocusing, isotachophoresis, affinity electrophoresis, <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> counterelectrophoresis, and capillary electrophoresis. Each method has many variations with individual advantages and limitations. Gel electrophoresis is often performed in combination with electroblotting immunoblotting to give additional information about a specific protein. Because of practical limitations, protein electrophoresis is generally not suited as a preparative method.|$|E
50|$|The immunoelectrophoretic {{analysis}} ad modum Grabar is {{the classical}} method of <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b> Proteins {{are separated by}} electrophoresis, then antibodies are applied in a trough next to the separated proteins and immunoprecipitates are formed {{after a period of}} diffusion of the separated proteins and antibodies against each other. The introduction of the immunoelectrophoretic analysis gave a great boost to protein chemistry, some of the very first results were the resolution of proteins in biological fluids and biological extracts. Among the important observations made were the great number of different proteins in serum, the existence of several immunoglobulin classes and their electrophoretic heterogeneity.|$|E
50|$|Agarose is a {{preferred}} matrix for work with proteins and nucleic acids {{as it has}} {{a broad range of}} physical, chemical and thermal stability, and its lower degree of chemical complexity also makes it less likely to interact with biomolecules. Agarose is most commonly used as the medium for analytical scale electrophoretic separation in agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels made from purified agarose have a relatively large pore size, making them useful for separation of large molecules, such as proteins and protein complexes >200 kilodaltons, as well as DNA fragments >100 basepairs. Agarose is also used widely for a number of other applications, for example immunodiffusion and <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> as the agarose fibers functions as an anchor for immunocomplexes.|$|E
50|$|The precipitated cryoglobulins are {{examined}} by <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and immunofixation {{to detect and}} quantify the presence of monoclonal IgG, IgM, IgA, Îº light chain, or Î» light chain immunoglobins. Other routine tests include measuring blood levels of rheumatoid factor activity, complement C4, other complement components, and hepatitic C antigen. Biopsies of skin lesions and, where indicated, kidney or other tissues can help in determining {{the nature of the}} vascular disease (immunoglobulin deposition, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, or, in cases showing the presence of cryfibrinogenemia, fibrinogen deposition. In all events, further studies to determine the presence of hematological, infections, and autoimmune disorders are conducted {{on the basis of these}} findings as well as each cases clinical findings.|$|E
50|$|Chemistry tests include lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) levels, uric acid levels, {{erythrocyte sedimentation rate}} (ESR), kidney and liver function, total protein levels, and an albumin-to-globulin ratio. The ESR and uric acid level may be elevated. Creatinine is occasionally elevated and electrolytes are occasionally abnormal. A high blood calcium level is noted in approximately 4% of patients. The LDH level is frequently elevated, indicating the extent of WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia-related tissue involvement. Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, direct antiglobulin test and cold agglutinin titre results can be positive. Beta-2 microglobulin and C-reactive protein test results are not specific for WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia. Beta-2 microglobulin is elevated in proportion to tumor mass. Coagulation abnormalities may be present. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and fibrinogen tests should be performed. Platelet aggregation studies are optional. Serum protein electrophoresis results indicate evidence of a monoclonal spike but cannot establish the spike as IgM. An M component with beta-to-gamma mobility is highly suggestive of WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia. <b>Immunoelectrophoresis</b> and immunofixation studies help identify the type of immunoglobulin, the clonality of the light chain, and the monoclonality and quantitation of the paraprotein. High-resolution electrophoresis and serum and urine immunofixation are recommended to help identify and characterize the monoclonal IgM paraprotein.|$|E

However, {{the complexity of the}} extracts studied did not allow us to demonstrate specific constituents with these methods. Crossed-line <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> with and without absorption of antibodies in situ was then used, and four specific antigens unique to group A cytoplasmic extract were demonstrated, one of which appeared to be quantitatively important.

40|$|Crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> {{and other}} related {{quantitative}} immunoelectrophoretic techniques {{have been used to}} elucidate the antigenic complexity of a reference preparation of capsular extract, potassium thiocyanate extract, lipopolysaccharide, heat-stable antigens, and free endotoxin from Pasteurella multocida serotype 1. The reactions of these cellular fractions, in crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> with reference anti-whole cell immunoglobulins disclosed five antigens in the capsular extract, seven in the potassium thiocyanate extract, one to three in the lipopolysaccharide, three in the heat-stable antigens, and five in the free endoxin. Comparison of these reference antigen 2 Ì 013 antibody systems, in crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> with intermediate gel containing either a reference anti-cell envelope or anticytoplasmic immunoglobulins not only revealed the presence of additional antigens but also gave insight into the probable cellular origins (i. e., cell surface, cell envelope, or cytoplasm) of various antigens unveiled by reference anti-whole cell immunoglobulins. Using the principle of tandem crossed <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and crossed-line <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> the immunochemical relationships between the antigenic components of these reference antigen 2 Ì 013 antibody systems were established.

40|$|Nasopharyngeal {{isolates}} of H. influenzae were typed by {{the slide}} agglutination test, the Quelling reaction, the latex agglutination test, countercurrent <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> and the antiserum agar test. These tests gave essentially comparable results, with countercurrent <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and latex agglutination being slightly more sensitive. Cross-reactive problems encountered with latex agglutination and {{the expense of}} performing countercurrent <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> or the antiserum agar test made these tests less practical than the slide agglutination test to identify single strains that were already isolated. The Quellung reaction and slide agglutination were the most rapid tests used to type an organism. For mass screening of multiple samples, countercurrent <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> was the simplest technique. The antiserum agar test was slow but was the best technique to screen nasopharyngeal swab cultures to identify the presence of any encapsulated strains in the mixed flora.
