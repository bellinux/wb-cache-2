40|$|According to Tadeusz Kowzan, <b>facial</b> <b>mime</b> may be {{regarded}} as the system of kinetic signs that is closest to verbal expression. At the same time, as Kowzan contends, mime constitutes together with gesture the most personal and individualized expressive mode in the theatre, submitted as it is to the performers physical, psychological and actoral idiosyncrasies. In the dramatic production of the Afro-Caribbean playwright Edgar Nkosi White, mimic expression plays a prominent role: indeed, a broad variety of facial inscriptions informs both the dialogues and stage directions of his plays. Even if the mimic signs devised by the author have differentiated functions and do not exist in isolation, complementing as they do other verbal and non-verbal signs, most of them expose the inner and external tensions underlying situations of racial oppression. Considering the double axis of eye- and mouth-expression that determines facial gesturality, this essay intends to analyze the mimic expressivity of Edgar Nkosi White's characters and its specific contribution to the author's theatricalization of the phenomenon of racialism. At a more general level, the mimic designs inscribed in Edgar Nkosi White's plays will be shown to unveil the discourse of ambivalence that tinges the racialized body when this is portrayed and represented from the victim's point of view...|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{research}} for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis {{due to its}} abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, {{there is a limit}} on the type of practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include <b>facial</b> retraining, biofeedback, <b>mime</b> therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort.|$|R
5000|$|Harpo {{often used}} <b>facial</b> {{expressions}} and <b>mime</b> {{to get his}} point across. One of his facial expressions, which he used in every Marx Brothers film and stage play, beginning with Fun in Hi Skule, was known as [...] "the Gookie." [...] Harpo created it by mimicking the expression of Mr. Gehrke, a New York tobacconist who would make a similar face while concentrating on rolling cigars.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} changes and stabilities of long-term sequelae of facial paresis in outpatients receiving Mime therapy, a form of physiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Archived data of 155 patients with peripheral facial nerve paresis were analyzed. Main outcome measures were (1) impairments: facial symmetry in rest and during movements and synkineses; (2) disabilities: eating, drinking, and speaking; and (3) quality of life. RESULTS: Symmetry at rest improved significantly; the average severity of the asymmetry in all movements decreased. The number of synkineses increased for 3 out of 8 movements; however, the group average severities decreased for 6 movements; substantially fewer patients reported disabilities in eating, drinking, and speaking; and quality of life improved significantly. CONCLUSION: During a period of approximately 3 months, significant changes in many aspects of facial functioning were observed, the relative position of patients remaining stable over time. Observed changes occurred while the patients participated in a program for <b>facial</b> rehabilitation (<b>Mime</b> therapy), replicating the randomized controlled trial-proven benefits of Mime therapy in a more varied sample of outpatients...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{reflects}} values {{which are}} really useful {{and play a}} very important role in human life. Those values wise up men to see the aspects of life, to enable to find the philosophy upon the problems of life, to think positively, and to face life scrupulously. Also, literature often describes human experience. Thus, it is expected that through studying works of literature, one will get more experience and knowledge to enrich and widen the perception of life. In line with literary study, the writer chooses drama as his study. Drama performed in a theater uses gesture which often includes <b>mime,</b> <b>facial</b> expressions used by mute people to communicate non verbally and to express their thoughts and feelings. The writer analyzes George Bernard Shaw's play, Major Barbara. He analyzes what is going on, what is wrong, and what people should do. Hence, he raises three research questions. What are the lofty duties of the Salvation Army? What are the defects of the Salvation Army? And what are George Bernard Shaw's suggestions concerning the role of the Salvation Army? To analyze the ideas, the writer refers to the two approaches of theory of literature written by Rene Wellek and Austin Warren, intrinsic and extrinsic approaches. In his study he only uses intrinsic approach which deals with the element of theme. Having analyzed the main ideas of the three research questions raised, the writer concludes that the theme of the play is that poverty hampers human beings to humanize themselves and employment is the way to support to achieve life needs...|$|R
