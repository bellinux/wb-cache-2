5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has been threatened {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> continue to support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment can be {{distinguished}} from other activities such as education and marketing <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> {{have learned how to}} use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals.

5|$|There were 21 cyclists who had {{completed}} all six stages. For these cyclists, the times taken for each stage were added {{up for the}} general classification.

5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were only 5 percent of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups.|$|E

5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, a bonus was introduced to reward farmers who retained their best bulls, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were not productive. The increase in weight of the animals began with improved grassland. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of fertilizers and improved pastures such as clover and ryegrass, which not only improved the productivity of existing fields but also transformed the moorland pasture. Vineyards affected by phylloxera were also being returned to pasture.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features.

5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> may not necessarily have sex with each other).

5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The Korean {{investigators}} {{cast doubt}} on the U.S. report's suggestion of possible gunfire from among the refugees.

The No Gun Ri survivors denied it emphatically, and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire, and then inconsistently.|$|E

Andy comes in and questions Greg, pretending to be an FBI agent named Burt Macklin, but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying. Greg's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt.|$|E
