5|$|There was off-field intrigue in Australian cricket {{during the}} antipodean winter of 1935. Australia, {{scheduled}} {{to make a}} tour of South Africa {{at the end of}} the year, needed to replace the retired Bill Woodfull as captain. The Board of Control wanted Bradman to lead the team, yet, on 8 August, the board announced Bradman's withdrawal from the team due to a lack of fitness. Surprisingly, in the light of this announcement, Bradman led the South Australian team <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> programme of matches that season.|$|E
5|$|A {{featured}} match {{heading into}} Against All Odds was the debuting of Full Metal Mayhem, in which Abyss fought Jeff Hardy, with the winner becoming number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Full</b> Metal Mayhem match, {{two or more}} competitors fight to either gain a pinfall, submission, or climb a ladder to retrieve an envelope or a championship belt in no disqualification rules. In this particular one there were two envelopes, one with a contract for the championship match, while {{the other one was}} empty. At TNA's previous PPV, Final Resolution, Abyss attacked Hardy after his match with Scott Hall. On the January 21 episode of Impact!, Abyss attacked Hardy once again and this time by slamming him through a table. On the January 28 episode of Impact!, TNA advertised the debut of Full Metal Mayhem between Hardy and Abyss at Against All Odds. On the February 4 episode of Impact!, the second stipulation of the match was announced, that the winner would gain a future championship match on a future edition of Impact!.|$|E

50|$|Most watermills in Britain and the United States of America had a {{vertical}} waterwheel, {{one of four}} kinds: undershot, breast-shot, overshot and pitchback wheels. This vertical produced rotary motion around a horizontal axis, {{which could be used}} (with cams) to lift hammers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forge, <b>fulling</b> stocks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fulling</b> mill and so on.|$|R
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> score, {{because he was}} concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E
5|$|Montreal {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the Northeast Division in 1998–99 and missed the playoffs. Their 75 points was the lowest total <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> season in 40 years. The season concluded with rumours of the team being sold and relocated {{if it did not}} receive government subsidies to help alleviate pressures from Quebec's tax system and the record-low value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports. Montreal missed the playoffs again the next two seasons, and annual losses of $10–$12million and a desire to focus on its core brewing business led Molson to put the franchise up for sale in the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2014 at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, Devitt's fourteen-month {{reign as}} the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion {{came to an}} end, when he lost the title to Kota Ibushi in his fifth defense. Devitt {{wrestled}} the entire match <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> face and body paint, which he continued using for his bigger matches {{for the rest of}} his NJPW run. The following day, Devitt was attacked by the returning Ryusuke Taguchi, who had been sidelined with an injury for the past seven months, re-igniting the rivalry between the two former partners. On 6 April at Invasion Attack 2014, one year after the break-up of Apollo 55, Devitt faced Taguchi in a singles grudge match. During the match, Devitt repeatedly told The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson), the two newest members of Bullet Club, not to interfere in the match, which eventually led to them turning on him. In the end, Taguchi defeated Devitt, after which the two men shook hands, ending their rivalry with each other. The following day, New Japan announced Devitt's resignation from the promotion.|$|E

5|$|Swan turned {{professional}} with Leeds United in August 1984, having impressed {{those at}} the club so much as to earn comparisons to John Charles. Gary Speed was his boot boy. He was not utilised by Eddie Gray, but instead made his debut as a forward under Billy Bremner on 14 October 1985, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Full</b> Members Cup defeat to Manchester City at Maine Road. He won his first Football League start on 1 January 1986, playing alongside Neil Aspin in a Second Division fixture against Oldham Athletic. His first two senior goals came in a 4–0 win against Stoke City on 1 February, both were headers from John Stiles crosses. He finished the 1984–85 season with three goals in sixteen games.|$|E
5|$|The Sonic X-treme debacle {{has been}} cited {{as a reason for}} the {{ultimate}} failure of the Sega Saturn. With the Sonic the Hedgehog series being attributed to much {{of the success of the}} company's prior system, the Genesis, and Sony and Nintendo both having flagship 3D platformers available early in the life cycle of their consoles (Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, respectively), Sega was expected by fans to follow suit and produce an official 3D Sonic game. With the game's cancellation, the Saturn never did receive an exclusive Sonic platform game, but rather only the Genesis port of Sonic 3D Blast; Sonic Jam, a compilation of the 2D Genesis Sonic titles; and Sonic R, a racing game. Sonic's debut <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> 3D platform game was not until 1998, with Sonic Adventure as a Dreamcast launch title, well after the discontinuation of the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups. This proposed barrage would pass two miles (3km) west of Flat Holm. The study is expected to last {{at least two years}} and will be split into two stages with a decision point at the end of each. The first, which is likely to run until late 2008, will focus on high-level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision {{at the end of the}} first phase, the second phase will look at the issues in more detail and culminate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> public consultation in early 2010.|$|E
5|$|The storyline behind Styles versus Abyss {{began at}} TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February13, where Abyss {{defeated}} Jeff Hardy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Full</b> Metal Mayhem match {{to earn a}} future NWA World Heavyweight Championship title shot. During a backstage segment on the February18 episode of Impact!, Abyss gave the title match contract to Traci, wanting it given to DOA Dusty Rhodes as {{she was trying to}} become Rhodes' personal assistant at the time. On the March25 episode of Impact!, Abyss tried to retrieve his contract from now co-assistant to Rhodes, Traci. This led to a brawl with Styles as he tried to defend Traci and co-assistant Trinity as they fled in fear from Abyss. The match was then announced on the April1 episode of Impact!. Rhodes announced on the April8 episode of Impact! that the winner of the bout would get their title shot at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on May15.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana takes place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for {{almost all of the}} game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E

5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{returned}} from injury on the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, making an announcement that his brother, Matt, would face TNA World Heavyweight Champion Ethan Carter III <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Full</b> Metal Mayhem match, in which Matt was unsuccessful. After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was forced to be Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter with a Twist of Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the Twist of Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy made an appearance on January 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling on its live Pop TV debut backstage and ringside to support his brother Matt in the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which Matt had later lost.|$|E
5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!; TNA began to phase out the marriage between Styles and Karen also. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen. The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles, Angle, Tomko, Christian Cage, Rhino, Abyss, and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Afterwards, Team 3D and the team of Cage and Rhino {{became involved in the}} feud with Team 3D joining Angle, while Cage and Rhino sided with Styles. The two teams then fought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Full</b> Metal Mayhem at Victory Road, which the team of Angle and Team 3D won. The teams fought again on the July24 episode of Impact!, this time in a Six Man Tag Team Elimination Tables match, which Angle and Team 3D also won. On the July31 episode of Impact!, while Styles stood in a ring surrounded by a steel cage, Angle attacked Styles from behind and slammed him back-first into the mat, rendering him unconscious. As a result of this action, Styles challenged Angle to a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice; Angle accepted the challenge.|$|E
