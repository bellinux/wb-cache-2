40|$|Planetary Exploration Missions {{have been}} an ongoing aspect of the NASA {{tradition}} since 1957. In an effort {{to better understand the}} surfaces, atmospheres, and geographic properties of planets in the solar system, the planetary rover was invented. In 1997, the Pathfinder landed on Martian terrain. The Pathfinder contained an important robotic vehicle, the planetary rover Sojourner. Sojourner, developed by United States scientists and engineers, was the first rover to land on the surface of Mars. On soft, usually sandy, rocky surfaces the planetary rover has engaged in loss of traction and wheel slippage. In order to investigate wheel-surface interaction, an automated test simulation system was designed and built in the Space Systems Laboratory and the Manufacturing building at the University of Maryland. Experiments that tested the <b>draw-bar</b> <b>pull</b> produced at varying weights with multiple wheel designs in a manual test simulation system state were conducted in an effort to confirm previous assumptions. In an effort to measure the force required to pull a weighted cart through the sandy surface, a series of tests were conducted in which the force was measured over {{a short period of time}} using the test simulation system. Wheel-slippage occurred in several cases as the weight increased on the more narrow wheels. After the force was measured and recorded with the force gauge and the Logger Pro III software, the depth of the tread was measured. This process of collecting data was repeated for three different wheels and each wheel was tested under four and then six different weight conditions. In a continuation of the current experiment, a second experiment will be conducted in the near future to determine the <b>draw-bar</b> <b>pull</b> produced from varying wheel designs in an automated test simulation system with varying weights. Also, future experiments will test the torque produced from the wheel-surface interaction...|$|E
40|$|The concept development, testing, evaluation, and the {{selection}} of a final wheel design concept for a dual-mode lunar surface vehicle (DLRV) is detailed. Four wheel configurations were fabricated (one open wheel and three closed wheel) (and subjected to a series of soft soil, mechanical, and endurance tests. Results show that the open wheel has lower <b>draw-bar</b> <b>pull</b> (slope climbing) capability in loose soil due to its higher ground pressure and tendency to dig in at high wheel slip. Endurance tests indicate that a double mesh, fully enclosed wheel can be developed to meet DLRV life requirements. There is, however, a 1. 0 to 1. 8 lb/wheel weight penalty associated with the wheel enclosure. Also the button cleats used as grousers for the closed-type wheels result in local stress concentration and early fatigue failure of the wire mesh. Load deflection tests indicate that the stiffness of the covered wheel increased by up to 50 % after soil bin testing, due to increased friction between the fabric and the wire mesh caused by the sand. No change in stiffness was found for the open wheel. The single woven mesh open wheel design with a chevron tread is recommended for continued developmen...|$|E
40|$|Tillage {{operation}} in {{loamy sand soil}} for disc ploughing on an experimental plot of twenty different soil moisture levels at tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were conducted using trace tractor techniques. The variables: <b>draw-bar</b> <b>pull</b> force, moisture content, cone index, tractor forward speeds, widths of cut and depths of cut were measured. In determining the effect of moisture content and forward speeds on draught forces, results revealed that at lowest moisture content of 1. 53 % draught forces of 4688. 33 N, 5708. 33 N and 6758. 33 N at tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s, were obtained. The draught forces of 3008. 32 N, 4018. 66 N and 5068. os 33 N were obtained at highest moisture content of 24. 14 % with tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The tractor forward speeds of 2. 5 m/s recorded the highest draught force of 6758. 33 N. The lowest draught forces at respective moisture levels were obtained at tractor forward speed of 1. 94 m/s. It is clear that, draught forces increase with increase in tracto...|$|E
