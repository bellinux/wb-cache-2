5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, <b>Indian</b> <b>corn,</b> oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.|$|E

This land cannot be taken from them since they were taken from their {{original}} land. The Indians will do the planting {{of all of the}} food. During the proper seasons, the encomenderos (men looking over the Indians) will have the <b>Indians</b> plant <b>corn</b> and raise the hens.|$|R
25|$|Kashmir's {{economy is}} centred around agriculture. Traditionally the staple crop {{of the valley}} was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, <b>Indian</b> <b>corn,</b> wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its {{temperate}} climate, {{it is suited for}} crops like asparagus, artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, peaches, and cherries. The chief trees are deodar, firs and pines, chenar or plane, maple, birch and walnut, apple, cherry.|$|E
25|$|The {{market economy}} {{was based on}} extracting and {{processing}} natural resource and agricultural products for local consumption, such as mining, gristmills and sawmills, and the export of agricultural products. The most important agricultural exports were raw and processed feed grains (wheat, <b>Indian</b> <b>corn,</b> rice, bread and flour) and tobacco. Tobacco was a major crop in the Chesapeake Bay region and rice a major crop in South Carolina. Dried and salted fish was also a significant export. North Carolina was the leading producer of naval stores, which included turpentine (used for lamps), rosin (candles and soap), tar (rope and wood preservative) and pitch (ships' hulls). Another export was potash, which was derived from hardwood ashes and {{was used as a}} fertilizer and for making soap and glass.|$|E

Himself and one squaw and one [...] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and pease, and a mug, and other small things.|$|E
30|$|Before {{conducting}} our estimation, however, we need {{to check}} for the stationarity of our time series variables. We use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test for this purpose. The results from the ADF test, available upon request, show that nearly all our time series variables exhibit non-stationarity at the 5  % level of statistical significance. Few exceptions with stationary variables include corn and soybean prices in the <b>Indian</b> Kharif <b>corn</b> acreage model; corn acreage in Mexico; wheat acreage in Ukraine; and soybean acreage in Argentina.|$|R
2500|$|... "Maize (corn) did {{not make}} a {{substantial}} contribution to the diet until after 1150 BP", to quote Mills (OSU 2003). Eventually, tribal villages began depending on corn to feed their turkey flocks, as Kanawha Fort Ancients practiced bird husbandry. The local <b>Indians</b> made <b>corn</b> bread and a flat rye bread called [...] "banick" [...] as they emerged from the protohistoric era. A horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating Fireside Cabin culture. Trading posts were established by European traders along the Potomac and James rivers.|$|R

In March 1624 he was issued a commission to trade with the <b>Indians</b> for <b>corn.</b> On this voyage he purchased a [...] "great canoe" [...] for 10,000 blue beads. The Corporation of Elizabeth City states that “Captain Raleigh Croshaw planted by Patent 500 acres (2 km²) between Fox Hill and the Pamunkey River to establish Elizabeth City.” Captain Raleigh Croshaw was last referred to on November 22, 1624. On December 27, 1624, Captain Francis West was instructed to take an inventory of his estate.|$|R
500|$|The group {{remained}} {{on board the}} ship through the next day, a Sunday, for prayer and worship. The immigrants finally set foot on land at what became Provincetown on November 13. The first task was to rebuild a shallop, a shallow draft boat that had been built in England and disassembled for transport aboard the Mayflower. It would remain with the Pilgrims while the Mayflower returned to England. On November 15, Captain Myles Standish led a party of sixteen men on an exploratory mission, during which they disturbed a Native American grave and located a buried cache of <b>Indian</b> <b>corn.</b> The following week, Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine White on the Mayflower. He was the first English child born to the Pilgrims in the New World. The shallop was finished on November 27, and a second expedition was undertaken using it, {{under the direction of}} Mayflower master Christopher Jones. Thirty-four men went, but the expedition was beset by bad weather; the only positive result was that they found a Native burial ground and corn that had been intended for the dead, taking the corn for future planting. A third expedition along Cape Cod left on December 6; it resulted in a skirmish with local Native Americans known as the [...] "First Encounter" [...] near modern-day Eastham, Massachusetts. The colonists decided to look elsewhere, having failed to secure a proper site for their settlement, and fearing that they had angered the local Native Americans by robbing their corn stores and firing upon them. The Mayflower left Provincetown Harbor and set sail for Plymouth Harbor.|$|E
2500|$|George Washington {{came through}} the area during the American Revolution and again, as president, in October 1789. Between New York state and Stamford, the Virginia farmer thought the land seemed [...] "strong" [...] with plenty of grass. He also noticed the crops and livestock: plenty of {{pumpkins}} and <b>Indian</b> <b>corn</b> visible, droves of beef cattle and a flock of sheep. [...] "The cattle seemed to be of good quality, and their hogs large, but rather long legged." [...] He particularly noted the numerous [...] "fences of stone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phelps {{purchased}} {{land from}} the Indians {{on more than one}} occasion. In a deed dated March 31, 1665, Phelps recorded that he had purchased a parcel of land about 30 years previously from Sehat, a Paquanick sachem. He was unable to provide title and prove his previous payment, forcing him to buy the land again. He paid to Sehat's descendant “Nassahegan, an Indian sachem” and his kinsmen “four trucking coats” and wampum. He had previously paid [...] "two coats and 40 shillings in wampum for a third coat, and six bushels of <b>Indian</b> <b>corn,</b> and fifteen shillings in wampum for the fourth coat; and fifteen shillings in wampum is at six a penny." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was a {{small city}} during the colonial era, but its {{location}} amongst fertile and flat lands, and its position as a commercial center, improved its status little by little {{over the course of}} a few years. The Spanish chronicler Friar Antonio Vázquez Espinoza in his compendium and description of the West Indies describes his visit to Chinandega in 1613 as follows: [...] "The town of Chinandega is [...] many <b>Indians,</b> plentiful <b>corn,</b> and all of the fruits of the earth, and appears to be a piece of paradise." ...|$|R
50|$|From 1851, Corn Creek was the {{location}} where Brigham Young, as territorial superintendent of Indian affairs for Utah, established an Indian farm for the Pahvant Indians, {{one of a}} three such farms in Utah Territory. Settlers from Fillmore grew potatoes, wheat, and corn to supplement the beans, corn, potatoes, pumpkins and squash that the Corn Creek band of Pahvants had grown at their village farther up the creek for years under their chief Kanosh. Here at Kanosh's request {{they were to be}} taught the Mormon's farming methods under the direction of a local <b>Indian</b> agent. The <b>Corn</b> Creek <b>Indian</b> Farm on <b>Corn</b> Creek existed there from 1855 to 1867, when most of its native inhabitants took down their farms and moved to the new Ute reservation, leaving the land for the new settlement of Kanosh.|$|R
50|$|The {{church at}} Shrine Mont is the Cathedral Shrine of the Transfiguration, an open-air {{sanctuary}} consecrated in 1925. Each of its stones was pulled by horse or rolled by local {{people from the}} mountain that embraces it. The baptismal font was originally a dugout stone used by <b>Indians</b> to grind <b>corn.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Tohono O'odham {{lived in}} the region as well, but their main {{concentration}} was further to south of the Pima, and stretched {{all the way to the}} Mexican border. [...] Originally known to the European settlers as the Papago (which literally means [...] "tepary-bean eater"), in recent times the tribe has dropped usage of that name. [...] Living in small settlements, the O'odham were seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. [...] They grew crops such as sweet <b>Indian</b> <b>corn,</b> tapery beans, squash, lentils sugar cane and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants, such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). [...] They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit and javalina for meat.|$|E
2500|$|In 1775 General George Washington {{stopped in}} New Rochelle {{on his way}} to assume command of the Army of the United Colonies in Massachusetts, recounting: [...] "The road for the greater part, indeed the whole way, but the land strong and well covered with grass and a crop of <b>Indian</b> <b>corn</b> intermixed with Pompions (which were yet ungathered) in the fields... The {{distance}} of this day's travel was [...] in which we passed through Eastchester, New Rochelle, Mamaroneck, but as these places (although they have houses of worship in them) are not regularly laid out, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the immediate farms which are very close together and are separated as one inclosure from another is, by fences of stones which are indeed easily made as the country is immensely stony". The British Army briefly occupied sections of New Rochelle and Larchmont in 1776. Following British victory in the Battle of White Plains, New Rochelle became part of a [...] "neutral ground" [...] for General Washington to regroup his troops.|$|E
2500|$|In 1895 British {{archeologist}} Alfred Percival Maudslay and his wife, Anne Cary Maudslay, visited Zaragoza {{on their}} way from Antigua Guatemala to Santiago Atitlán. [...] Anne Maudslay told her adventure in the book A glimpse at Guatemala, from the Victorian Era perspective: [...] "After riding {{a mile or two}} along a road bordered by cottages bosomed in fruit trees we rose to a bleak tableland. [...] It was {{one of the very few}} days of unpleasant weather which we experience during the whole of our journey; a fierce wind raised clouds of dust and rustled through the ugly dry rastrojos, or stubbles of <b>Indian</b> <b>corn,</b> which covered the plain. We passed through the little Indian town of Zaragoza, chiefly noted for the manufacture of aparejos, the native pack-saddles. [...] I have been told that the Indians here have such a liking for dried alligator meat as a Lenten fare that the vendors of the highly-perfumed delicacy have to be locked up in the carcel (English: Jail for protection and sell the meat through the prison bars. [...] The streets were full of gaily-dressed people assembled for a fiesta, and dancing was going on in a shed, to a monotonous sound of a marimba. [...] We were not tempted to loiter for long, and rode on again over the dull plan to uninteresting town of Chimaltenango." ...|$|E

50|$|Among {{all three}} Indian groups — the Cuna, Guaymí, and Chocó — land was communally owned and farmed. In {{addition}} to hunting and fishing, the <b>Indians</b> raised <b>corn,</b> cotton, cacao, various root crops and other vegetables, and fruits. They lived then — as many still do — in circular thatched huts and slept in hammocks. Villages specialized in producing certain goods, and traders moved among them along {{the rivers and}} coastal waters in dugout canoes. The Indians were skillful potters, stonecutters, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. The ornaments they wore, including breastplates and earrings of beaten gold, reinforced the Spanish myth of El Dorado, the city of gold.|$|R
