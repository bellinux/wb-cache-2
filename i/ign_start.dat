50|$|Online gaming {{publications}} {{have launched}} relief drives of their own. <b>IGN</b> <b>started</b> up a fundraiser, wherein its staff plays 24 Japanese-made games in 24 hours {{in an attempt}} to garner donations of $24,000, while Brian Crecente of Kotaku will host the Japan Earthquake Relief Fundraiser on 24 March 2011 in Denver, Colorado, in which proceeds will go to the Japanese Red Cross Society. Game Informers Meagan Marie put up for auction her Mario-themed Nintendo DS autographed by several people with links to Nintendo, including Shigeru Miyamoto, Koji Kondo, Eiji Aonuma, Charles Martinet, and Martin Leung, with the proceeds to go to Japanese relief. Siliconera put up for auction an action figure of the fictional character Cecil from Dissidia: Final Fantasy, signed by Final Fantasy IV designer Takashi Tokita. The industry's online auction efforts organized into Play For Japan, which acts as an online hub for auctions of collectible video game paraphernalia.|$|R
5000|$|Bethesda Softworks and ZeniMax Media {{have been}} accused of {{attempting}} a hostile acquisition of Human Head Studios, as well as a successful hostile acquisition of Arkane Studios prior to that. According to a report from <b>IGN,</b> ZeniMax <b>started</b> purposefully failing Human Head's project milestones so that they wouldn't get paid, allowing ZeniMax to buy the company at a reduced rate. They were accused of doing the same thing with Arkane Studios, although in Arkane's case the studio gave in and allowed themselves to be bought. The failed hostile acquisition of Human Head Studios led to cancellation of Human Head's Prey 2 according to the report. Bethesda's Pete Hines replied to the accusations by saying the following: ...|$|R

Wired said [...] "Turbulence has it allâ€¦ Solid writing, great character development, humor, personal loss, and excellent points to ponder in every chapter." [...] <b>IGN</b> that <b>started</b> a campaign for a Hollywood adaptation of this superhero novel. It also won a Wired Geekdad Goldenbot Award and appeared at no.2 on the list of hot new Amazon Science Fiction titles on the week of its release. Superheronovels.com called it a contender for best superhero novel of all time. [...] "Resistance", the sequel, was published in the UK and the US in 2013.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Little Ice Age (LIA), and {{especially}} since the 1980 s, one of the most obvious impacts of climate change in mountain areas is the glacial retreat. However, this generalized shrinkage of the glaciers took place with periods of retreat, stagnation, and advance, that are accurately known at local scale for several well documented glaciers but not at the regional scale of the French Alps. The most recent data about French alpine glacier extension are from IGN topographical maps and the Vivian's database, both dating from {{the end of the}} 1960 s. Although <b>IGN</b> <b>starts</b> recently to update glacier surface areas on its maps, up to now there is no complete and accurate set of data about the present glacier extension in the French Alps. Furthermore, France is up to now missing in international databases like GLIMS or GlobGlacier. In order to fill this gap, an inventory of the post-LIA and present French glaciers is in progress since 2010, integrated in a GIS. Based on present maps, orthophotos and DEMs, it lists the French Alps glaciers, maps their limits, and implements a database. Proglacial margins are geomorphologically mapped using present orthophotos, completed by field check. This is needed because of low quality orthophotos, and debris- or snow-covered glacier margins, and to complete the maps derived from orthophotos or DEM. By crossing this database with former documents (e. g. ancient maps and terrestrial photos), it allows the reconstruction of the stages of the glacier retreat since the end of LIA, the survey of the present glacier extensions, and the quantification of the glacier retreat rates since 150 years. This work takes place in the EU-funded project GlaRiskAlp (Alcotra France-Italy). The inventory should be merged with the ones in Valley of Aosta and Piemonte (Italy), and integrate international databases. It will be used as a base for the recognition of areas in the Western Alps prone to hazards related with the glacial retreat...|$|R
500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Critics compared Rymdkapsel gameplay to Tetris and SimCity. Of its visual style, The New York Times published {{that the game}} makes others in the real-time strategy genre [...] "feel needlessly garnished". Reviewers generally appreciated the game's simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow <b>start.</b> <b>IGN's</b> Steve Watts thought that the game made too many [...] "design concessions" [...] to its minimalism, though he considered the style [...] "gorgeous", and {{felt that he was}} never fully in control of his base. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell said that the game's minimalism extended to its core gameplay, where the player should strive to [...] "play the game less and less". Joseph Leray of TouchArcade described the game's balance and pacing as [...] "impeccable". He gave Rymdkapsel a perfect score and wrote that it felt as if it were custom-made for iOS. Bryan Vore of Game Informer criticized the game's lack of features and thought that it [...] "fizzled out with no fanfare" [...] as a [...] "creative" [...] idea but without sufficient [...] "polish". The Verges Trent Wolbe called the soundtrack [...] "a minimalist achievement". Jonasson announced that the game had sold 200,000 copies as of December 2, 2013, {{due in large part to}} its inclusion in a Humble Bundle sale.|$|R
