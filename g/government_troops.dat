5|$|In September 1966 general {{elections}} were held, and Sangkum legislators with conservative and right-wing sympathies dominated the national assembly. In turn, they nominated Lon Nol, a military general who shared their political sympathies, as prime minister. However, their choice {{did not sit}} well with Sihanouk. To counterbalance conservative and right-wing influence, in October 1966 Sihanouk set up a shadow government made up of Sangkum legislators with left-wing sympathies. At the end of the month, Lon Nol offered to resign from his position, but was ironically stopped from doing so by Sihanouk. In April 1967 the Samlaut Uprising occurred, with local peasants fighting against <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> in Samlaut, Battambang. As soon as <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> managed to quell the fighting, Sihanouk began to suspect that three left-wing Sangkum legislatorsKhieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nimhad incited the rebellion. When Sihanouk threatened to charge Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon before a military tribunal, they fled into the jungle to join the Khmer Rouge, leaving Hu Nim behind.|$|E

5|$|Although the bunkers {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E
5|$|Dunstaffnage saw action {{during the}} Civil War, holding out against Montrose's army in 1644. The castle was burned by royalist troops, {{following}} {{the failure of}} the rising of the 9th Earl of Argyll in 1685, against the Catholic James VII. During the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, the castle was occupied by <b>government</b> <b>troops.</b> Flora MacDonald, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape from Scotland, was briefly imprisoned here while en route to imprisonment in London.|$|E

Savimbi was highly successful in this endeavour.|$|E

5|$|The Chevron Corporation {{discovered}} the Adar Yale field in 1981, {{shortly before the}} start of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005). Soon after Chevron had suspended operations in 1984, Sudanese <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> began attacking civilian settlements in the area, burning the houses and driving the people away, and in the late 1990s, Nuer militias from Nasir helped the army in clearing away the people to make way for the roads and infrastructure of the oilfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Bình Giã {{reflected}} the Viet Cong's growing military strength and influence, {{especially in the}} Mekong Delta region. It {{was the first time}} the Viet Cong launched a large-scale operation, holding its ground and fighting for four days against <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> equipped with armor, artillery and helicopters, and aided by U.S. air support and military advisers. The Viet Cong demonstrated that, when well-supplied with military supplies from North Vietnam, they had the ability to fight and inflict damage even on the best ARVN units.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the rebels}} in {{southern}} Iraq, where the uprisings began, were either demoralized soldiers of the Iraqi Army or members of anti-regime groups, in particular the Islamic Dawa Party and Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). Iraqi armed forces were composed largely of Shia conscripts and contained substantial anti-regime elements, and thus many of the <b>government's</b> <b>troops</b> quickly switched sides and defected to the rebels.|$|R
25|$|On 6 August 2011, the Transitional Federal <b>Government's</b> <b>troops</b> {{and their}} AMISOM allies managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants.

The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers {{have suggested that the}} pullout may at least in part have been caused by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization.|$|R
25|$|By 1951, Eagle Aviation had won {{its first}} regular <b>Government</b> <b>trooping</b> contracts, {{including}} the first regular contract awarded by the War Office for trooping flights between the UK and Singapore starting in August 1951. This helped keep its fleet of six Halifaxes and nine Avro Yorks busy and provided employment for 100 people including 12 pilots. Operations moved to Blackbushe Airport in 1952, followed a year later by the launch of secondary scheduled services in association with British European Airways (BEA), from whom Eagle had purchased a large fleet of Vickers Vikings.|$|R
5|$|The castle saw {{its last}} {{military}} event in 1746, when {{a unit of}} <b>government</b> <b>troops,</b> of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, occupied the building, causing further damage. By 1764, the York Buildings Company was bankrupt, and the remaining contents of the castle, including the roofs, were removed and sold to pay the company's creditors. The avenue of beech trees, which linked the castle and the village, was felled, and the property was sold to William Maule, Earl Panmure, nephew of the attainted Earl of Panmure. He died in 1782, and the property passed to his nephew, George Ramsay, 8th Earl of Dalhousie.|$|E
5|$|When South Kasai seceded, <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> {{from the}} Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC) were already {{fighting}} Katangese {{troops in the}} Kasai region. South Kasai held important railway junctions needed by the Congolese army for its campaign in Katanga, and therefore soon became an important objective. South Kasai also had important mineral wealth which the central government was anxious {{to return to the}} Congo. The central government also misunderstood the South Kasaian position, believing that, like Katanga, the region had declared full independence from the Congo and rejected Congolese sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} an outright invasion. Just {{coming off a}} disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E
25|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions. Some {{of the more}} radical elements, including Al‑Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al‑Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. By January 2009, Al‑Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal <b>Government's</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express {{was a special}} target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, {{not to mention the}} loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. <b>government</b> <b>troops,</b> after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Flooding also {{occurred}} in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated {{their homes in}} four different provinces in Cuba, including 400peasant families in Oriente Province. Near Santiago de Cuba, 25houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, {{a woman and her}} four sons drowned due to the swollen river. Additionally, a body of a man was recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $100,000. Ella had a role in the Cuban Revolution as the <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella. Later, when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio, Che Guevara taught his illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|In July 1994 {{one of his}} sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led {{a failed}} coup attempt to topple the government. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, but <b>government</b> <b>troops</b> soon {{discovered}} his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives {{to allow him to}} go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry's headquarters, convinced that there was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to the safer location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.|$|E
50|$|In late 1956, {{there were}} demands by {{regional}} commanders in Sumatra for more autonomy in the provinces. When these demands were not {{met by the}} central <b>government,</b> the <b>troops</b> began to rebel, and by early 1957, had forcefully taken over the governance of Sumatra. Then, on 15 February 1958, Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Hussein declared {{the establishment of the}} Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI).
