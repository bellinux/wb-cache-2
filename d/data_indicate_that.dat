5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea eagle {{are a little}} less clear; {{molecular}} <b>data</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the African fish eagle and the Madagascar fish eagle), while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E
5|$|Callisto's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 20%. Its surface {{composition}} {{is thought to}} be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral <b>data</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of pure water ice are intermixed with patches of a rock–ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR <b>data</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{variations}} in mitochondrial DNA indicate {{low levels of}} genetic divergence among bog turtle colonies. This is unusual in species such as the bog turtle, which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in bog turtle colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. <b>Data</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the bog turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a population bottleneck – as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as the bog turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|E
