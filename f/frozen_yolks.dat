40|$|Research {{was carried}} out to define the {{hygienic}} propriety of thermally treated eggs, i. e. eggs treated at pasteurization temperatures and those stored frozen. The average values {{of the number of}} the bacteria in the pasteurized yolk and egg white were log 4. 9 and 5. 1, respectively, those in the frozen-pasteurized yolk and egg white were log 5. 5 and 4. 8 and in the <b>frozen</b> <b>yolk</b> and white were log 7. 0 and 5. 9. The contaminants Salmonella spp., Proteus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium spp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica were tested for 306 samples of pasteurized, frozen and pasteurized and frozen products of eggs, egg-yolks and egg-whites. Presence of Salmonella spp. in the pasteurized yolk was 12...|$|R
40|$|Frozen egg {{products}} (egg white and egg yolk) {{were subjected to}} gamma irradiation at pasteurization dosages of 1 - 4 kGy. The apparent viscosity of <b>frozen</b> egg <b>yolk</b> was significantly (p ≤ 0 · 05) decreased by radiation treatment. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns and differential scanning calorimetric profiles of the egg white proteins were not affected by irradiation. The functional properties (foaming, emulsifying and gelling) of the {{egg products}} were generally not significantly (p > 0 · 05) affected by irradiation, or slightly decreased. Angel food cakes prepared with irradiated frozen egg white had increased cake volume, and mayonnaise prepared with irradiated <b>frozen</b> egg <b>yolk</b> had increased stiffness and stability. The results suggest that irradiation {{may be used as}} an alternative procedure for pasteurizing frozen liquid egg products. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this module is to {{calculate}} the number of Salmonella Enteritidis bacteria in six different egg products: liquid whole egg, liquid <b>yolk,</b> liquid albumen, <b>frozen</b> whole egg, <b>frozen</b> <b>yolk,</b> and <b>frozen</b> albumen. This is done by tracking the change in numbers of Salmonella Enteritidis through the production processes of egg products plants. The egg products industry processed 17 billion eggs or 27 % of the U. S. production of eggs in 1996 (Figure C- 1). Eggs arriving at egg products plants originate from two sources. Nest run eggs from poultry layer flocks constituted 88 % of all eggs processed in 1996. Restricted eggs sent from egg grading plants constituted 12 % of all eggs processed in 1996 (Figure C- 1). The six products modeled here (liquid and frozen forms of whole egg, albumen, and yolk) constitute about 44 % (32 % + 12 %) of the egg products produced (Table C- 1). The remaining 56 % of egg products shown in Table C- 1 are not simulated in this module. The estimates of the amounts of product in Table C- 1 are based on data collected by the Egg Products Inspection Division, Food Safety and Inspection Service for 1996. The amount and type of egg product formulations change significantly from year to year. Figure C- 2 illustrates the processes simulated in this module. In modeling frozen products th...|$|R
40|$|Scrub typhus immunogens were {{prepared}} from Rickettsia tsutsugamushi strains Karp, Kato, Gilliam, Kostival, and Buie by exposing <b>frozen</b> infected <b>yolk</b> sac suspensions to 300 krad of gamma radiation. Mouse protection {{tests showed that}} each of the irradiated immunogens protected C 3 H/HeDub mice against high challenge levels of Karp and Gilliam, but that none of these single-strain immunogens were capable of protecting against all five of the challenge strains. Broad-spectrum protection was achieved by using combinations of three strains of irradiated rickettsiae in a vaccination regimen of three injections at 5 -day intervals. A comparison of vaccination efficacy employing three such combinations (Karp-Gilliam-Kato, Karp-Kostival-Kato, and Buie-Kostival-Kato) indicated that both sequential administration of strains on successive vaccination days and multiple injections of trivalent mixtures produced protective responses superior to those obtained with single-strain immunogens. Trivalent mixtures of rickettsiae exhibited a striking synergistic effect on the immune response of C 3 H/HeDub mice and elicited a protective response against Kato challenge that could not be obtained with any single-strain immunogen. Mice vaccinated with the trivalent Karp-Gilliam-Kato immunogen resisted challenge with more than 10 (3) 50 % mouse lethal doses of Karp and Gilliam for 12 months, and were resistant to similar levels of challenge with Kato and Buie for 6 months...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to compare Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) {{antibody}} titers in serum and egg yolk samples from laying hens. Sixty paired blood and egg samples were collected from laying hens of two farms. Serum samples were <b>frozen,</b> while egg <b>yolk</b> samples were diluted (1 : 500) before freezing. Serum and yolk samples were tested {{for the presence of}} IBV antibodies by indirect ELISA (commercial kit) and titers were compared by a correlation test (alpha= 0. 05). There was a high correlation (r= 0. 62) between the two kinds of samples, which means that titers of IBV antibodies in the egg yolk and in serum samples are quite the same. Considering that blood collection causes deep stress that leads to economic losses, and since eggs are collected daily on the farm, results reported here are of importance to poultry production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Egg yolk {{consisted}} of lecithin and phospholipids {{are one of}} the most commonly used components that will protect spermatozoa against cold shock during cooling and freezing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different hen egg yolk on Tris extender on the freezability of local ram semen. Semen from six sexually matured local rams was collected weekly using artificial vagina. Collected semen was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically and extended using tris extender {{consisted of}} 20 % (v/v) regular egg yolk (TRCEY), native egg yolk (TNCEY), omega- 3 hen egg yolk (TOEY) and 6 % (v/v) glycerol. Those were packed in 0. 25 ml straws, equilibrated at 5 oC for 3 hours, frozen and stored in nitrogen tank for 24 hours, and thawed at 37 oC for 30 second. The result of the experiment showed that there were no significant differences on the sperm motility and the number of living sperm. Percentage of plasma membrane intact in TOEY (60. 3 %) was significantly higher compared to TREY (56. 9 %) and TNEY (55. 6 %). In conclusion, the addition of omega 3 egg yolk in Tris extender protects plasma membrane better than the regular or native hen egg yolk.
