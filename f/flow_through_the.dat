5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E

5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield was {{particularly}} hard-hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 'Big Freeze'. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Sheffield Wednesday grounds flooded due to {{being close to}} nearby rivers that <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents {{over the fate of}} the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been felled as part of a scheme to maintain the city streets.|$|E
5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> nasal cavity, {{and these are}} called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined {{by the way the}} tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E

5|$|The city {{developed}} {{on both sides}} of the prominent Arkansas River, which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Tulsa area is controlled by upstream flood control reservoirs, but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall or severe drought. A low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa. This portion of the river is known as Zink Lake.|$|E
5|$|The present {{geography}} of the Gulf Coast was formed during an ice age approximately 30,000 years ago when dramatic lowering of the sea level occurred. As the ice later melted, it formed a <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Trinity and San Jacinto rivers and carved wide valleys in the soft sediments, resulting {{in the creation of}} the modern system of bays and lakes approximately 4500 years ago.|$|E

5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which {{formed in the}} lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Han won the Best Entry Award {{from the}} Singapore National Theatre Trust for her {{participation}} in a show entitled Basics at the National Museum Art Gallery. She was awarded a scholarship for the Portland Sculpture Park on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England, by the Arts Council of Great Britain and the National Arts Council (NAC) in 1990. Together with the installation artist S. Chandrasekaran, she helped to transform an old limestone quarry into a sculpture park, creating a work called <b>Flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Rocks. In 1993 she received sponsorship from the Singapore International Foundation to attend the International Painting and Sculpture Symposium in Gulbarga (Kalburgi) in Karnataka, India, and served on the NAC's Arts Resource Panel between 1993 and 1994.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Midway area {{is former}} {{marshland}} {{which has been}} filled in for development. In fact, the San Diego River used to <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Midway area into San Diego Bay, isolating Point Loma from San Diego. Because of fears that San Diego Bay might silt up, the river was diverted to its present course north of Point Loma by a levee built in 1877. Parts of Liberty Station and Point Loma Village are also fill land, reclaimed from sand spits and wetlands surrounding the Bay. The only remnant of the formerly extensive wetlands in Point Loma, aside from the riverbed itself, is a city-owned nature preserve called Famosa Slough, which branches off from the river near its mouth.|$|E

5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} one element {{in a chain}} of {{evidence}} which helped identify and define the progression of the Missoula Floods, which occurred around 16,450 to 13,750 yearsBCE. During the floods, <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis. Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E
