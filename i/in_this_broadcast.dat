5000|$|Although Somoza was {{reckoned}} as {{a ruthless}} dictator, the United States continued {{to support his}} regime as a non-communist stronghold in Nicaragua. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) supposedly remarked in 1939 that [...] "Somoza may be {{a son of a}} bitch, but he's our son of a bitch." [...] According to historian David Schmitz, however, researchers and archivists who have searched the archives of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library have found no evidence that Roosevelt ever made this statement. The statement first appeared in the November 15, 1948 issue of Time magazine and was later mentioned in a March 17, 1960 broadcast of CBS Reports called [...] "Trujillo: Portrait of a Dictator". <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>broadcast,</b> however, it was asserted that FDR made the statement in reference to Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. It should be further noted that this statement has been attributed to a variety of United States presidential administrations in regard to foreign dictators. Thus the statement remains apocryphal at this point, though Roosevelt and later presidents certainly supported the Somoza family and their rule over Nicaragua. Andrew Crawley claims that the Roosevelt statement is a myth created by Somoza himself.|$|E

In 2008 she is back in the Ariston theatre supporting, with Marina Rei, Max Gazze competing in the Festival of Sanremo with the song Il solito sesso (The usual sex). From July 2008 she is again on stage with a double commitment: a rock tour and again with the theatrical performance Cielo. In December of the same year her book Con te accanto is released. The novel outlines the sweet - bitter experience of a friendship between two women; they met by accident in a hospital and, step by step they, they sort out together their physical and psychological pains. From April 2009 Paola Turci directs a Radio Due broadcast La mezzanotte di Radio Due (Radio 2 Middle night),. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Turci is able to interweave interaction with listeners and live music performed alone or with her guests. She plays her songs and interprets songs of other artists. In June 2009 La mangiatrice di uomini (The man-eater) written by F. Bianconi, Baustelle frontman. Became the first single of the new album Attraversami il cuore (Go through my heart). The new album is the first episode of a trilogy where the artist consolidates her authorial capacity in the form of an intimate and refined musical project. Nevertheless, there are some deem influences due to the cooperation with M. Murru and the jazz composer Paolo Fresu.Paola Turci is also took part in the special charity event organized by Laura Pausini, Amiche per l’Abruzzo (Friends for Abruzzi) organized following the L’Aquila earthquake. Social commitment is again the focus of the 20 December fundraising event, the Watoto Festival at Brancaccio theatre in Rome where, the roman artist, performs together with F. Mannoia and Noemi for Kenyan children.In April 2010 the second volume of the trilogy was released, Giorni di rose (Roses days). The new album is entirely dedicated to the female universe. The album includes an I.Fossati cover, Lunaspina (Moonthorn) performed with Fiorella Mannoia, and seven new songs written for Turci by 7 famous singers namely: Carmen Consoli, Nada, Marina Rei, Chiara Civello, Naïf Hérin, Grazia Verasani and Ginevra Di Marco. Danza intorno al sole (Dance around the sun), single of the album, is edited by Nada and Carmen Consoli. In the same year Turci is invited to participate in MTV days.|$|E

Cronkite was in the New York studio at Rockefeller Plaza as the first pictures to be transmitted and received were the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The first segment included a televised major league baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. From there, the video switched first to Washington, D.C.; then to Cape Canaveral, Florida; then to Quebec City, Quebec, and finally to Stratford, Ontario. The Washington segment included a press conference with President Kennedy, talking about the price of the American dollar, which was causing concern <b>in</b> Europe. <b>This</b> <b>broadcast</b> inaugurated live intercontinental news coverage, which was perfected later in the sixties with Early Bird and other Intelsat satellites.|$|R

Another objective is to analyze the viewership of biathlon programs broadcasted on Czech Television. Methods: A quantitative content analysis will be used in this study, through which it will determine how much time was devoted to various biathlon programs in different years and months. An electronic TV program of Czech Television will be analyzed. Results: The analysis shows that the space devoted to biathlon on Czech Television increases during this period of time.

40|$|We propose index codes, {{based on}} multidimensional QAM constellations, for the Gaussian {{broadcast}} channel, where every receiver demands all the {{messages from the}} source. The efficiency with which an index code exploits receiver side information <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>broadcast</b> channel is characterised by a code design metric called "side information gain". The known index codes for this broadcast channel enjoy large side information gains, but do not encode all the source messages at the same rate, and do not admit message sizes that are powers of two. The index codes proposed in this letter, {{which are based on}} linear codes over integer rings, overcome both these drawbacks and yet provide large values of side information gain. With the aid of a computer search, we obtain QAM index codes for encoding up to 5 messages with message sizes 2 ^m, m <= 6. We also present the simulated performance of a new 16 -QAM index code, concatenated with an off-the-shelf LDPC code, which is observed to operate within 4. 3 dB of the broadcast channel capacity.

30|$|This {{article has}} {{presented}} a layered multimedia broadcast scheme using rateless codes with progressive recovery over cooperative MIMO. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme, first a two-phase CB protocol is {{proposed to improve}} {{the reliability of the}} broadcast, which efficiently extends the coverage of the source nodes and decreases the packet loss rate of bad destination nodes. Second, we propose the PRC to enhance rateless codes with progressive recovery. By assigning unequal redundant packets to each layer with their importance, the PRC can recover layered multimedia at designated received ratio of output symbols, which outperforms the other unequal protected rateless codes such as SP-FEC and LA-FEC in [21] with much lower overhead. Third, based on the PRC and given PLRs of intended destinations in the system, a distortion-based layered multimedia broadcast optimization problem is formulated to improve the QoE of the broadcast system. By the optimized layered source bitrate and coding rates of PRC, the average transmission quality, i.e., PSNR of videos and images, has been maximized. Using resolution scalable Motion-JPEG 2000 video sequence, the receivers with different PLRs can recover a progressive resolution video stream adaptively. Analytical and experimental results suggest the superiority of the Cooperative broadcast scheme and the efficiency of the QoE-driven optimization algorithm.|$|E
