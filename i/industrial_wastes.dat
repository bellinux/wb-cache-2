5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E

The <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> management system in Thailand is still lacking comprehensive data on <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> generation and flow.

Therefore, <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> management program was done in Kavir Steel Complex, in Aran va Bidgol region to identify and classify <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> and also to present solutions for improving waste management. In this complex, production process is hot rolling steel and the product is rebar. Material and Method: The preset study was conducted in Kavir Steel Complex. Following survey of production process and sources of waste, the type and volume of produced waste were identified and measured during 3 months. Then, the classification of wastes was done according to the Bazel Convention and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and finally new industrial & health solid waste management program was presented. Result: Considering the volume, <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> of production process in Kavir Steel Complex was between 130 to 180 grams per each ton of rebar. Main <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> included oxide of steel billet, industrial sludge, used oil and lubricant which were classified according to the RCRA: 8 materials with T code, 1 with C code, 5 with I code and 3 materials with C code.
