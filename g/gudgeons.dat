They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and <b>gudgeons,</b> copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E
25|$|The nationally {{vulnerable}} Australian greyling {{has significant}} {{populations in the}} Tambo River. It is also a noted fishery for black bream. Low river flows that have been typical {{for a number of}} years have impacted on these species. The estuary perch is also common in the Tambo. Other fish that may be found in the river include native species such as the Australian bass, short-finned eel, long-finned eel, <b>gudgeons,</b> and the river blackfish, and introduced species such as brown trout and carp.|$|E

60|$|I couldn't help it. I tell it as a {{vindication of}} Roscoe {{and all the}} other navigators. The poison of power was working in me. I was not as other men--most other men; I knew what they did not know,-- the mystery of the heavens, that pointed out the way across the deep. And the taste of power I had {{received}} drove me on. I steered at the wheel long hours with one hand, and studied mystery with the other. By the end of the week, teaching myself, I was able to do divers things. For instance, I shot the North Star, at night, of course; got its altitude, corrected for index error, dip, etc., and found our latitude. And this latitude agreed with the latitude of the previous noon corrected by dead reckoning up to that moment. Proud? Well, I was even prouder with my next miracle. I was going to turn in at nine o'clock. I worked out the problem, self- instructed, and learned what star of the first magnitude would be passing the meridian around half-past eight. This star proved to be Alpha Crucis. I had never heard of the star before. I looked it up on the star map. It was {{one of the stars of}} the Southern Cross.

And when the stars came out, there shone the Southern Cross low on the horizon. Proud? No medicine man nor high priest was ever prouder. Furthermore, with the prayer-wheel I shot Alpha Crucis and from its altitude worked out our latitude. And still furthermore, I shot the North Star, too, and it agreed with what had been told me by the Southern Cross. Proud?
