5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the <b>day</b> <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to {{take an active role in}} the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E

One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E

Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.|$|E

5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron {{to know he was}} unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had lost weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E

Skin tests were performed 4 <b>days</b> <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> 4 and 15 days after parturition at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h after injection of 250 g of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA).
