40|$|High-speed {{railways}} (HSRs) {{have been}} widely deployed {{all over the world}} in recent years and China has entered an era with both high investments and rapid expansion of HSR transport infrastructure. One of the most challenging issues is how to keep the security and safety of millions of HSR infrastructures. Meanwhile, the emerging sensing and wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies for infrastructure health monitoring (IHM) are being substituted for traditional tethered monitoring systems. This paper presents a two-layer architecture of WSN which will be appropriate for infrastructure health monitoring of HSR. The upper layer is named as tree access network and the lower layer is called star detection network. By adapting to the special characteristics of IHM network, we design a short network address and an optimized communication frame structure, which can satisfy the actual requirements and special characteristics of the IHM network. In order to implement a better transmission performance, we propose a novel transmission power based method which adopts the knowledge update mechanism to detect the optimization result. In the end, the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> assignment and network construction are discussed, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a practical instance...|$|E

The Government of India in a notification dated 16 December 2010 recognizes the letter issued by Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) containing <b>details</b> <b>of</b> name, <b>address</b> and Aadhaar number, as an officially valid document. It neither aims to replace any existing identity cards {{nor is it a}} cognizance of citizenship. Aadhaar neither confers citizenship nor guarantees rights, benefits, or entitlements. Aadhaar is a random number which never starts with a 0 or 1, and is not loaded with profiling or intelligence into identity numbers that makes it insusceptible to fraud, theft and provides privacy in such perspective. The unique ID would also qualify for as a valid ID while availing various government services, like a LPG connection or subsidised ration or kerosene from PDS or benefits under NSAP or pension schemes, e-sign, digital locker, [...] Universal Account Number (UAN) under EPFO; and for some other services, like a SIM card or opening a bank account. According to the UIDAI website, any Aadhaar holder or service provider can verify an Aadhaar number for its genuineness through a user-friendly service of UIDAI called Aadhaar Verification Service (AVS) available on its website.
