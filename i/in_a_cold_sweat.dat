500|$|A {{writer for}} the Indonesian {{magazine}} Gatra described Chrisye's on-stage persona as [...] "stiff", with very little movement. Alex Hasyim, who did the choreography for Aku Cinta Dia and Hip Hip Hura, recalled that Chrisye was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> on their first day of practise and eventually created his own dancing style as he could not follow Hasyim's instructions.|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat.</b> Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E

60|$|Jerome Searing, {{the man of}} courage, the {{formidable}} enemy, the strong, resolute warrior, was as pale as a ghost. His jaw was fallen; his eyes protruded; he trembled <b>in</b> every fibre; <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> bathed his entire body; he screamed with fear. He was not insane--he was terrified.|$|R
60|$|A horrid misgiving that {{he could}} not visit her took {{possession}} of Grace, and she looked up anxiously for the lantern, which was hanging above her head. To light it and go {{in the direction of the}} sound would be the obvious way to solve the dread problem; but the conditions made her hesitate, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> pervaded her at further sounds from the same quarter.|$|R
2500|$|Furthermore, Maj. Richard Koch, {{chief of}} USAF Air Combat Command's {{advanced}} air dominance branch {{is reported to}} have said that [...] "I wake up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> at the thought of the F-35 going in with only two air-dominance weapons" [...] with an Aviation Week article casting an extremely skeptical eye over the (USAF) source of claims that the F-35 would be [...] "400% more effective" [...] than projected opponents.|$|E

40|$|Drug {{safety is}} an {{important}} palt of postmarketing surveillance. In ancient times, people were already {{aware of the fact}} that drugs could have side effects. The oldest drugs were mainly of plant and animal origin, but also mercury, arsenic and antimony were used, the toxic effects of which were well known. In 1224 Frederick II, Emperor of Hohenstaufen ordered inspection of drugs and mixtures prepared by apothecaries and in 1518 the Royal college of Physicians was founded, whose Fellows were also concemed with quality control of drugs. The first drug to be banned because of its toxicity was antimony in the 17 th century. It was used again, however, after it cured Louis XIV from typhoid fever. One of the first descriptions of an intoxication to a drug which is still in use today, was made by William Withering in 1785. He described digitalis intoxication as follows: "The Foxglove, when given in very large and quickly repeated doses, occasions sickness, vomiting, purging, giddiness, confused vision, objects appearing green or yellow, increased secretion of urine with frequent motions to patt with it, and sometimes inability to retain it; slow pulse, even as low as 35 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minute, <b>cold</b> <b>sweats,</b> convulsions, syncope and death"...|$|R

60|$|<b>A</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> {{ran down}} Chauvelin's spine as he gazed, mute and immovable, into those fish-like, bleary eyes, which were not--no! {{they were not}} those of the real Scarlet Pimpernel.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Then {{the snake}} vanished, seeming to wriggle down the left bottom bed-post, and I woke up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> my lord, {{and did what}} it had told me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{woman looked}} at Yeobright, and beheld him colourless, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat.</b> [...] "Isn't there meaning in it?" [...] she said stealthily. [...] "What {{do you think}} of her now?" ...|$|E
60|$|She drooped faint <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat.</b> It was {{the foot}} either {{of a man}} or woman, {{standing}} on the brewing-copper where the key had lain. A warm foot, covered with a polished boot.|$|E
60|$|Just for {{a moment}} the frozen, misty {{atmosphere}} took on a reddish hue, his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> broke out upon his forehead.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> {{broke out}} on him. This was the snub! She had not {{administered}} {{it in the}} Casino simply in order that, by being delayed, its force might be the more overwhelming.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> {{came over}} Arthur, and he grew more pale than ever. He {{realized}} {{now he was}} {{in the presence of a}} mystery that he could not unravel. She went on feverishly.|$|R

6000|$|So they started, and I lit out, all <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> and {{scrambled}} forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, {{in a kind}} of a coarse whisper, [...] "Jim!" [...] and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says: ...|$|E
60|$|This fear persisted. In her nightmare-ridden sleep {{it became}} an {{accomplished}} fact, {{so that she would}} awake, trembling, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> crying out. Her sleep had become wretched. Sometimes she was convinced that she did not sleep at all, and she knew that she had insomnia, and remembered that it was of insomnia her mother had died.|$|E
60|$|One of {{them came}} and listened to Hereward's breathing, {{and put her hand}} upon his chest. His hair stood on end; <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> came over him. But he snored more loudly than ever.|$|R
6000|$|So {{inconceivable that}} as they were trudging {{together}} through the sand of the roadway to the custom-house--another mud hovel--to pay the fine, Morrison broke into <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> stopped short, and exclaimed in faltering accents: ...|$|R

The woman seemed to say nothing, but when the sub-dean had passed by they came on towards the college gate.|$|E
60|$|That {{haunting}} visitation left Duane {{sitting there}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> a remorse gnawing at his vitals, realizing the curse {{that was on}} him.

He remembered how his father had been eternally pursued by the furies of accusing guilt, how he {{had never been able to}} forget in work or in sleep those men he had killed.|$|E
60|$|Dim imaginings {{ran through}} Ugh-lomi's mind as he watched--by virtue of which two rabbits lived the longer. And sleeping, his brains were clearer and bolder--for {{that was the}} way in those days. He came near the horses, he dreamt, and fought, smiting-stone against hoof, but then the horses changed to men, or, at least, to men with horses' heads, and he awoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> of terror.|$|E
60|$|The Author made a faint {{rattling}} {{sound in}} his throat and clung to the rail before him. The devil broke into <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat.</b> There, visible to all men, was a large black Wild Ass, kicking up its heels upon {{the floor of the}} House. And braying.|$|R
6000|$|Alon. But {{they have}} left me all unmanned; [...] I feel my sinews slacken with the fright; [...] And <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> trills down o'er all my limbs, [...] As if I were {{dissolving}} into water. [...] Oh Prospero, my crimes against thee sit heavy on my heart! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> {{of terror}} broke upon him.

On it came and on, until it was within perhaps three inches of the flesh.|$|R
6000|$|He {{fell asleep}} and I lay there <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> turning this new terror {{over in the}} {{whirling}} chaos which did duty as my mind. The burden of my thought was, How much did I divulge? How much does he know?--what a distress is this uncertainty! But by and by I evolved an idea--I would wake my brother and probe him with a supposititious case. I shook him up, and said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{she sank}} {{on the stone}} I had my supreme wrench, and it left me numb, hard, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat.</b> [...] "Don't betray me! I'll {{forestall}} him!

60|$|She dreamed {{often of}} being his {{companion}} and coming on {{hand in hand}} with him, bowing to the multitude, but when she was drawn to the tent-roof, she awoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> of fear, and so she determined to be a writer. She would write books like Ivanhoe. Those were great days! Her mind expanded like the wings of a young eagle. She read everything; the Ledger, the Weekly, and all the dog-eared novels of impassioned and unreal type in the neighborhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak to}} me, boy," [...] said Bumpus, still more sternly, while <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> stood <b>in</b> large beads on his pale forehead.

60|$|A moan of fear {{rose from}} the prisoners in the lift. Stangate felt <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> upon his brow as he passed his arm round the {{shrinking}} girl.

6000|$|He stood waiting, one minute--two--five? Was it an hour, rather? <b>A</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> bathed his limbs; {{the blood}} beat so {{fiercely}} within his temples, that his head rang again. Was that a death-bell tolling? No; {{it was the}} pulses of his brain. Impossible, surely, a death-bell. Whence could it come? ...|$|R
