40|$|In {{the current}} thesis {{the model of}} the ROS {{management}} network is built using the <b>domino</b> <b>principle.</b> The model offers insight into the design principles underlying the ROS management network and enlightens its functionality in the diseases such as cancer and Parkinson’s disease (PD). It is validated using experimental data. The model is used for in silico study of the ROS management dynamics under the stress conditions (oxidative stress). This highlights the phenomena of both adaptation to stress and the stress accumulation effect in case of repeated stress. This study also helps to discover the potential ways to a personalized treatment of the insufficient ROS management. The different ways of a control of the ROS management network are shown using the optimal control approach. Obtained results could be used for a seeking of the treatment strategies to fix the ROS management failures caused by an oxidative stress, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. Or, in vice versa, to develop the ways of a controllable cell death that might be used in cancer research...|$|E
