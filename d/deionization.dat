They have very high porosity (over 50%, with pore diameter under 100nm) and surface areas ranging between 400–1,000m2/g. They are often manufactured as composite paper: non-woven paper made of carbon fibers, impregnated with resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel, and pyrolyzed. Depending on the density, carbon aerogels may be electrically conductive, making composite aerogel paper useful for electrodes in capacitors or <b>deionization</b> electrodes. Due to their extremely high surface area, carbon aerogels are used to create supercapacitors, with values ranging up to thousands of farads based on a capacitance density of 104F/g and 77F/cm3.

50|$|Deionized water (DI water, DIW or {{de-ionized}} water), often {{synonymous with}} demineralized water / DM water, is water {{that has had}} almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as cations like sodium, calcium, iron, and copper, and anions such as chloride and sulfate. <b>Deionization</b> is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured ion-exchange resins, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, <b>deionization</b> produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. However, <b>deionization</b> does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove Gram-negative bacteria. <b>Deionization</b> can be done continuously and inexpensively using electrodeionization.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{that has}} been {{produced}} by distillation, <b>deionization,</b> reverse osmosis or similar processes is purified or demineralized water.|$|E
5000|$|Counter-current <b>deionization</b> is {{the more}} {{attractive}} method of ion exchange. Chemicals (regenerants) flow {{in the opposite direction}} to the service flow. Less time for regeneration is required when compared to cocurrent columns. The quality of the finished product can be as low as [...]5 parts per million. The main advantage of counter-current <b>deionization</b> is the low operating cost, due to a low usage of regenerants during the regeneration process.|$|E
50|$|Co-current <b>deionization</b> {{refers to}} the {{original}} downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter {{at the top of}} an ion exchange column and exit at the bottom. Co-current operating costs are comparatively higher than counter-current <b>deionization</b> because of the additional usage of regenerants. Because regenerant chemicals are dilute when they encounter the bottom or finishing resins in an ion exchange column, the product quality is lower than a similarly sized counter-flow column.|$|E
50|$|Since the ionic charge transported {{into the}} {{electrodes}} {{is equal to}} the applied electric current, applying a constant current allows a better control on the effluent salt concentration compared to the constant voltage operation mode. However, for a stable effluent salt concentration membranes should be incorporated in the cell design (MCDI), as the electric current does not only induce counter-ion adsorption, but co-ion depletion as well (see Membrane capacitive <b>deionization</b> vs. Capacitive <b>deionization</b> for an explanation).|$|E

50|$|Mixed bed <b>deionization</b> is a 50/50 {{mixture of}} cation and anion resin {{combined}} {{in a single}} ion exchange column. With proper pretreatment, product water purified from a single pass through a mixed bed ion exchange column is the purest that can be made. Most commonly, mixed bed demineralizers are used for final water polishing to clean the last few ions within water prior to use. Small mixed bed <b>deionization</b> units have no regeneration capability. Commercial mixed bed <b>deionization</b> units have elaborate internal water and regenerant distribution systems for regeneration. A control system operates pumps and valves for the regenerants of spent anions and cations resins within the ion exchange column. Each is regenerated separately, then remixed during the regeneration process. Because of the high quality of product water achieved, {{and because of the}} expense and difficulty of regeneration, mixed bed demineralizers are used only when the highest purity water is required.|$|E

50|$|Helium {{is used in}} helium-neon lasers and in some thyratrons {{rated for}} high {{currents}} and high voltages. Helium provides about as short <b>deionization</b> time as hydrogen, but can withstand lower voltage, so it is used much less often.|$|E
50|$|Milli-Q water purifiers use resin {{filters and}} <b>deionization</b> to purify the water. The system {{monitors}} the ion concentration {{by measuring the}} electrical resistivity of the water.

5000|$|In 1960 {{the concept}} of {{electrochemical}} demineralization of water was reported by Blair and Murphy. In that study, {{it was assumed that}} ions were removed by electrochemical reactions with specific chemical groups on the carbon particles in the electrodes. In 1968 the commercial relevance and long term operation of CDI was demonstrated by Reid. In 1970 Johnson et al. [...] introduced a theory for the CDI process called ‘potential modulated ion sorption’; the latter is today more commonly known as the Electric Double Layer (EDL) theory. From 1990 onward, CDI attracted more attention because of the development of new electrode materials, such as carbon aerogels or carbon nanotube electrodes. In 1996, Farmer et al. also introduced the term capacitive <b>deionization</b> and used the now commonly abbreviation “CDI” for the first time. In 2004, Membrane Capacitive <b>Deionization</b> was introduced in a patent of Andelman.|$|E
50|$|Capacitive <b>deionization</b> (CDI) is a {{technology}} to deionize water by applying an {{electrical potential difference}} over two porous carbon electrodes. Anions, ions with a negative charge, are removed from the water and are stored in the positively polarized electrode. Likewise, cations (positive charge) are stored in the cathode, which is the negatively polarized electrode.|$|E
50|$|Today, ion {{exchange}} (IX) and electrodeionization (EDI) {{are the primary}} <b>deionization</b> technologies associated with UPW production, in most cases following reverse osmosis (RO). Depending on the required water quality, UPW treatment plants often also feature degasification, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, ultraviolet irradiation, and measurement instruments (e.g., total organic carbon TOC, resistivity/conductivity, particles, pH, and specialty measurements for specific ions).|$|E

5000|$|Milli-Q is a {{trademark}} created by Millipore Corporation to describe 'ultrapure' water of [...] "Type 1", {{as defined by}} various authorities (e.g. ISO 3696), {{as well as their}} devices for producing such water. [...] The purification processes involve successive steps of filtration and <b>deionization</b> to achieve a purity expediently characterised in terms of resistivity (typically 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C). The term is also commonly used as a genericised trademark to refer to other purified waters and purification equipment.|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} aquarists may {{modify the}} water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases. This {{can be accomplished}} by additives such as sodium bicarbonate to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water using one of two processes: <b>deionization</b> or reverse osmosis. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) in order to have easy access to water that requires only minimal treatment.|$|E
50|$|Today, CDI {{is mainly}} {{used for the}} {{desalination}} of brackish water, which is water with a low or moderate salt concentration (below 10 g/L). Other technologies for the <b>deionization</b> of water are, amongst others, distillation, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis. Compared to reverse osmosis and distillation, CDI {{is considered to be}} an energy-efficient technology for brackish water desalination. This is mainly because CDI removes the salt ions from the water, while the other technologies extract the water from the salt solution.|$|E
50|$|When this {{technique}} was studied two purification methods {{were used to}} treat water. The first was a typical reverse osmosis technique used for pure water. The other was a double reverse osmosis technique with electric <b>deionization</b> which was continuously disinfected with UV light and disinfected weekly with ozone. The tubing it ran through was tested weekly for bacterial colonies. The highly purified water showed a sharp decrease in bacteria colony adherence. Water purification methods are being scrutinized here because {{it is in this}} state that contamination is thought to occur and biofilms are formed.|$|E
5000|$|Demineralization {{is often}} a term used interchangeably with <b>deionization.</b> Demineralization is {{essentially}} removing all the minerals {{that can be found}} in natural water. This process is usually done when the water will be used for chemical processes and the minerals present may interfere with the other chemicals. All chemistic and beauty products have to be made with demineralized water for this reason. With the demineralization process, the water is [...] "softened" [...] replacing the undesired minerals with different salts (NaCl). Demineralized water has a higher conductivity than deionized water.|$|E

50|$|Many reef {{aquarium}} keepers use {{reverse osmosis}} systems for their artificial mixture of seawater. Ordinary tap water can contain excessive chlorine, chloramines, copper, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, silicates, or many other chemicals {{detrimental to the}} sensitive organisms in a reef environment. Contaminants such as nitrogen compounds and phosphates can lead to excessive and unwanted algae growth. An effective combination of both reverse osmosis and <b>deionization</b> {{is the most popular}} among reef aquarium keepers, and is preferred above other water purification processes due to the low cost of ownership and minimal operating costs. Where chlorine and chloramines are found in the water, carbon filtration is needed before the membrane, as the common residential membrane used by reef keepers does not cope with these compounds.|$|E
50|$|As {{desalinization}} and purification {{of water}} is critical for obtaining deionized water for laboratory research, large-scale chemical synthesis in industry and consumer applications, the use of porous materials for this application has received particular interest. Capacitive <b>deionization</b> operates in a fashion with similarities to a supercapacitor. As an ion-containing water (electrolyte) is flown between two porous electrodes with an applied potential across the system, the corresponding ions assemble into a double layer in the pores of the two terminals, decreasing the ion content in the liquid exiting the purification device. Due {{to the ability of}} carbide-derived carbons to closely match the size of ions in the electrolyte, side-by-side comparisons of desalinization devices based on CDCs and activated carbon showed a significant efficiency increase in the 1.2-1.4 V range compared to activated carbon.|$|E

50|$|Purified {{water is}} water {{that has been}} {{mechanically}} filtered or processed to remove impurities and make it suitable for use.

Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce water of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). Purified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It can be produced on site for immediate use or purchased in containers.
