30|$|With the {{development}} of LTCC technology, the comprehensive mechanical model for LTCC mining face has been greatly improved. Liu Changyou, et al. used site observation, finite element numerical calculation, and the analogous material modelling method to investigate the comprehensive mechanical properties of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> and their effect {{on the relationship between}} support and surrounding rock. By considering the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> as a variable body, the characteristics of deformation and fracture of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> and the structural mechanical and stiffness properties of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> were studied. They proposed that the load of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is regionalized, and provided a calculation method for the stiffness of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof.</b> In addition, based on the stiffness characteristics of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> with a rectangle shape face, the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is divided into three categories as stiffness similar, zero stiffness and medium stiffness. When the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> stiffness is zero, the support is in the status of a “given load” or a “limited load”. When the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is in a stiffness similar status, the support is in a “given deformation” status. When the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is in a medium stiffness status, the “P–△L” curve shows a typical double curve relationship. When the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is in a zero stiffness status, the rational resistance force of support is mainly determined by its effect on the stability of the face ends.|$|E
30|$|The {{thickness}} {{variation of the}} <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> (including top coal) also affects the load bearing capacity of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof.</b> Cao Changsheng et al. (Liu et al. 1997; 2002; Cao and Liu 1997; Cao et al. 1998; 1999; Cao et al. 1999) presented a concept on the critical thickness of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> and believed that the “P–△L” double curve flattens when the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> thickness exceeds a critical thickness. In other words, the variations of support resistance and main roof overturn angles have {{little effect on the}} roof subsidence.|$|E

They state that when critical thickness is greater than actual thickness, or when the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> {{in front of the}} face enters a plastic zone, the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> would lose its load bearing capacity after it enters the roof control zone. Therefore, the mechanical relationship of support and surrounding rock will show a variation. In contrast, the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> will maintain a certain deformation capacity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of optimum chock (support) capacity is very crucial {{for a successful}} longwall mining. The {{selection of}} chock capacity depends on the site-specific geotechnical parameters, constraints and longwall panel geometry, which are generally not known in detail in priority. Hence, based {{on the field and}} laboratory data, various possible combinations should be analyzed to cater for the unforeseeable mining conditions. This paper discusses the use of numerical model for selecting an appropriate chock capacity based on the site-specific geological and geotechnical information and longwall panel geometry. The fracture mechanisms of <b>immediate</b> and main <b>roofs</b> are also discussed for various panel widths and support capacities. For the models considered, the chock convergence is predicted to increase by about 33 % due to the increase in face width from 100 to 260 m. Similarly, the massive roof strata are found to yield higher chock convergence compared to bedded strata...|$|R
40|$|As {{the amount}} of new {{fractured}} surfaces or "damaged rock layers" within roof rock increases, {{the stability of the}} rock mass decreases. While direct measurements of this phenomenon are not easily made, there is good circumstantial evidence to support this hypothesis. For example, it is common to observe increased cracks or fractures in the <b>immediate</b> mine <b>roof</b> rock before a roof fall. Likewise, roof drill holes placed in areas that later fail often reveal increased numbers and/or separations of fractures within the rock column through time. And finally, the frequency of microseismic activity, representative of rock fracturing, increases before a roof fall. For this study, more than 700 microseismic emissions were collected from two underground limestone mine roof fall areas in southwestern Pennsylvania. Microseismic events were located and magnitudes determined using the moment magnitude technique. Moment magnitude is based on the event seismic moment, which {{is a measure of the}} seismic deformation. The amount of new fracture surface length was calculated based on the stored strain energy within the rock prior to fracture. In the two case studies presented, a significant amount of microseismic activity was observed as much as two days before the first signs of failure in the roof fall areas. Additionally, results from this analysis reveal much about the behavior of strata prone to failure and allows for the construction of hazard maps based on microseismic emissions. The potential use of this technique as a means of anticipating roof falls is analyzed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{injuries}} are caused {{each year by}} rock falls in coal mines. Most of these {{injuries are}} not caused by major roof collapses, but from falls of smaller rocks from the <b>immediate</b> top or <b>roof</b> skin. Various surface controls are used in mines to control this surface rock. One that {{has been found to}} be very effective is roof screening. Depending on the size of the screen, roof coverage approaching 100 %can be achieved. Many mines are reluctant to use screen for primary skin control because of additional costs of time and materials, but others are having great success at both controlling costs and surface rock. Data is presented from two mines that show a dramatic reduction in roof skin injuries when screening is used. Much of this success is due to innovations in roof bolting machines. Four case studies of roof screen experience are presented along with associated costs of materials, impact on bolting advance rates, and potential ergonomic risks. The effects of roof screening on skin control and safety are also included. Finally, this paper will provide information about features of different roof bolting machines that affect production and safety...|$|R

30|$|In {{the study}} on the {{relationship}} between support and surrounding rock, to overcome the difference between the actual measurement and the traditional theory, Qian Minggao (Liu 1996; Qian et al. 1996 a, b; Liu et al. 2002) regarded the key blocks of the Voussoir beam as the top boundary condition of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof,</b> and believed that the support resistance force is mainly from “the pressure of loose blocks” and “the deformation pressure of overturned blocks” caused by the “S–R” movement of the “Voussoir beam”. The deformation of <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> results in the overturned deformation load of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> inserted by the Voussoir beam absorbed by the fractured <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> (including top coal) and the non-existence of double curve relationship in the “P–△L” relationship. Based on the mechanical properties and effect of various components in the support and surrounding rock system, the mechanical model of support and surrounding rock was established and provided a basis for further investigation {{on the relationship between}} the support and surrounding rock.|$|E
40|$|The present case shows {{a case of}} fracture-redislocation of the hip {{caused by}} a {{depressed}} fracture of the femoral head similar to a Hill-Sachs lesion. A 59 -year-old man fell from a roof and his left hip joint was dislocated posteriorly. He was admitted to a nearby hospital, and he was referred to our hospital more than 24 hours after injury. Computed tomography (CT) suggested a bone chip from the posterior wall of the acetabulum roof and a depressed femoral head that cut into the posterior margin of the acetabulum <b>roof.</b> <b>Immediate</b> manual repositioning was performed under general anesthesia on the same day. He left our hospital to go home on day 26 after repositioning, but his left hip joint was dislocated again when he went down the stairs. It was thought that this patient’s redislocation occurred due to a femoral head depressed fracture involving the same mechanism as the Hill-Sachs injury seen with dislocation of the shoulder. The remplissage method for the Hill-Sachs injury is difficult for the femoral head. Therefore, total hip replacement was performed, and the patient’s postoperative course was good.

30|$|Yang et al. (2009) {{state that}} the key to the {{interaction}} system of the support and surrounding rock is the interaction between the support and top coal. Under hard coal conditions, the overturn of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is affected by the support and top coal system, and the turning angle of the lower strata is less than the turning angle of the main roof. Under the medium hard coals and soft coals, the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> can equally transfer the overturn deformation of the main roof to top coals and the support system. With the consideration of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> as the top boundary of support-top coal systems, the mechanical model for two-leg shield support and surrounding rock can be established.|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly.

Influence of the thickness of <b>immediate</b> <b>roof,</b> height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The tensile stresses of the roof in the bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and the tensile stresses on the roof are larger than the tensile stresses on the floor. 2. When the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is thick, the tensile stresses on the roof and the compressive stresses on the side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is thin. 3. When the high roof is thick, the tensile stresses on the roof are still more small, and the compressive stresses on the side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when the high roof is thin. 4.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} varying <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> thickness on the lower strong roof strata movement and failure pattern in longwall coal mining with large mining height. The investigation is based on 58 geological drill holes and hydraulic shield pressure measurements around the longwall Panel 42105 of the Buertai Mine in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The longwall Panel 42105 is characterized by relatively soft <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> strata of varying thickness superposed by strong strata, herein defined as lower strong roof. A voussoir beam model is adopted to interpret the structural movement of the lower strong roof strata and shield pressure measurements. It is shown that when the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is relatively thick, the broken overlying lower strong roof tends to form a stable voussoir beam with previously broken layer, thus not exerting high pressure on the hydraulic shield and working face. When the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> is relatively thin, the broken overlying lower strong roof tends to behave as a cantilever beam, thus exerting higher pressure on the hydraulic shield and working face.

40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines study evaluates {{factors that}} {{influence}} longwall support and strata interaction. The longwall system is composed of an immediate and main roof structure and three supporting foundations: longwall panel, powered roof supports, and gob waste. The main roof forms a structure that is generally supported by all three foundations, while the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> acts as a beam that cantilevers from the coal face to the powered support. In most cases, shield loading involves a complex interaction of both main roof and <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> behavior and {{is a combination of}} loads produced from convergence of the main roof and displacements of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> caused by deformations of the cantilevered roof beam. Since the shield stiffness remains constant for all leg pressures and main roof convergence is irresistible in terms of shield capacity, the shield must be able to control the behavior of the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> or floor structure for shield loading to be sensitive to setting pressures. If the goal is to minimize total shield loading, any active setting force must be offset by reduced passive shield loading to justify the active setting loads.

The effective support working resistance and appropriate roof control technology are two critical factors for safe and productive mining in the THC. The load-estimate-method (LOEM) is the effective method {{to determine the}} support working resistance for normal working conditions (the mining height less than 3. 5 m). In order to prevent support crushing accidents from happening and {{to ensure the safety}} and high-efficiency in the THC, the LOEM was modified based on the structure of the overlying strata in the THC. The strata which can form the voussoir beam structure in normal working conditions and will break in the form of cantilever beam in the THC is defined as the key strata in the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof.</b> Therefore, the hanging length of the key strata in the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> was considered in the LOEM.

Operations are in the Great Northern seam, which until recent years were all conducted under an <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> of a strong conglomerate. Large areas of the current reserves at all operations are in areas of a “claystone” <b>immediate</b> <b>roof.</b> All three mines have attempted at various stages of their history to find an economic mining method under these claystone roof conditions, with varying degrees of success at each operation. Moonee currently operates a longwall under claystone roof while Chain Valley and Wallarah are place-changing operations which have operated under claystone with some success. The nature of the “claystone” roof horizons in the three mines is often seen as different at each operation but in practice all of the claystones exhibit similar properties – low strength layers particularly at the coal-claystone interface. Strata control in conditions where the <b>immediate</b> <b>roof</b> above the coal seam is claystone appears to be most sensitive to coal beam thickness left as roof coal, roof bolting pattern and anchorage strength, drivage standards, horizontal stress direction, frequency and type of structures present, exposure time before bolting and possibly depth of cover.
