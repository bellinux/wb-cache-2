50|$|In metadata, {{property}} equivalence is {{the statement}} that two properties <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> property extension or values.

5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E
