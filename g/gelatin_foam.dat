40|$|Biocompatible gelatin foams {{were found}} to exhibit {{significantly}} improved mechanical properties by the additions of sepiolite nanofibres. Gelatin nanocomposite foams containing various contents of sepiolite were prepared by lyophilization. With the presence of 9. 1 wt% sepiolite, the Young's modulus and compressive collapse strength of the <b>gelatin</b> <b>foam</b> with a cell size of 159 μm and a porosity of 98 % were increased by 288 % and 308 %, respectively. Such enhancements were attributable to the strong interactions between hydrophilic gelatin and sepiolite {{as suggested by the}} results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry which show substantial shifts in the characteristic absorption peaks and the glass transition temperature, to the reduced cell sizes characterised by scanning electron microscopy, and to the reinforcement effects of sepiolite on the gelatin solid material. The mechanical properties of the low-density closed-cell gelatin/sepiolite nanocomposite foams were well predicted using the Gibson–Ashby model for open cells after normalisation of the Young's modulus of the neat polymer foam...|$|E
40|$|Non-lethal {{weapons are}} {{in use in}} a lot of law-enforcement and {{military}} operations. While most of them are kinetic-energy systems, their effectiveness and dangerous limits on human targets are not clearly defined. The assessment of non-lethal projectiles effects on human targets follows usually two main directions: -	The evaluation of internal damage -	The evaluation of skin penetration This papers focuses on the second point. The literature gives some energy density values for a 50 % skin penetration probability when different parts of the human body are shot at. These values are mainly based on cadaver and animals tests conducted in USA. Some countries don’t allow these kinds of tests and it is certainly much more convenient to use a mechanical surrogate for testing purposes. In that case, a standard on which different countries can rely would be a must. Wayne State University proposed in March 2010 a draft proposal for a surrogate {{to be used as a}} basis for NATO standardization. This surrogate is based on ballistic <b>gelatin,</b> <b>foam</b> and chamois leather. This paper goal is to assess this future standard surrogate regarding: -	The equivalence between cadaver and surrogate penetration results -	The reproducibility of the method and its sensitivity to external parameters -	The availability and feasibility of basis elements of the surrogate. Our results rely on our own tests in our laboratory, and our views are presented in the final article. We give some recommendations about this standard, based on the statistical analysis of these results and on some practical considerations about the surrogate...|$|E

40|$|As {{the world}} faces {{resource}} management {{problems such as}} providing sustainable energy and sourcing rare elements, demand is growing for new materials to help combat these. Biopolymer sol-gel synthesis {{has the potential to}} create a wide range of functional materials, in particular from the spontaneous <b>foaming</b> of <b>gelatin</b> and metal nitrates upon drying. If this process can be controlled and expanded to other biopolymers then catalytic systems could be designed for many applications. The <b>gelatin</b> <b>foaming</b> mechanism was investigated by a variety of techniques including small angle neutron scattering and rheology. The cause of the foaming was attributed to the evaporation of water and the gels ability to stabilise the bubbles formed. Links between the structural properties of the gel and porous carbon have been suggested as a way of predicting and selecting certain morphologies whilst in the liquid state. Research has also been carried out using microwaves as an alternative to conventional furnaces, this was done to make the synthesis more environmentally friendly. During this research several metal carbides/nitrides were synthesised, including metastable phases. Using this biopolymer sol-gel synthesis, materials were synthesised and tested as catalysts for both methanol steam reforming and hydrogen evolution reactions as examples of possible applications for this research. Both sets of materials showed activity for their respective reactions in line with current literature. Finally, further optimisation is possible on all aspects of this thesis and future research should be carried out to maximise the potential of this facile and versatile synthesis technique...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} entropy-elastic gelatin based networks {{in the form of}} films or scaffolds. The materials have good prospects for biomedical applications, especially in the context of bone regeneration. Entropy-elastic gelatin based hydrogel films with varying crosslinking densities were prepared with tailored mechanical properties. Gelatin was covalently crosslinked in water above its sol gel transition, which suppressed the gelatin chain helicity. Amorphous films were prepared with tailorable degrees of swelling and wet state Young's modulus. The knowledge gained with this bulk material was transferred to the integrated process of foaming and crosslinking to obtain porous gelatin-based scaffolds. A <b>gelatin</b> solution was <b>foamed</b> in the presence of saponin and the resulting foam was fixed by chemical crosslinking with a diisocyanate.

40|$|Using {{differential}} {{radiation sensitivity}} of components of mouse embryonal thymus, an in vitro method for studying T-cell differentiation from hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the G 0 phase was established. Intrathymic T-cell precursors present in embryonal thymus {{were found to}} be quite radioresistant (up to 20 Gy), and consequently 25 -Gy-irradiated embryonal thymic lobes were used. Thymic lobes (25 -Gy irradiated) taken from mouse fetuses (gestation day 15) were placed in Millipore-HA culture plates supported on squares of <b>gelatin</b> <b>foam</b> sponge in 24 -well culture plates in which neonatal thymus stromal cells were cultured. HSCs (10 (5) cells per well) in the G 0 phase were added to these thymic lobes and cocultured at 37 degrees C in a 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air incubator. Half the culture medium was changed every week. After 3 weeks, a large number of colonies had formed. Immunohistochemical studies and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses revealed that the colonizing cells regularly develop and exhibit surface markers characteristic of T cells (Thy- 1, IL- 2 R, L 3 T 4, Lyt- 2, etc.). In situ hybridization analyses revealed that mRNA expression for T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains occurred within colonizing cells. Using a monoclonal antibody (F 23. 1), expression of TCR beta-chain variable domain (V beta 8) on the surface of these developing T cells was demonstrated. These cells responded to interleukin 2 and/or anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody, indicating functional T cells. This method will be useful in studying T-cell differentiation pathways from pluripotent HSCs and in clarifying the mechanisms involved in negative and positive selection of T cells within the thymus...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Direct {{percutaneous}} puncture for coil placement {{has been}} described for visceral aneurysms, but the proce-dure has not been previously reported for aneurysms {{of the head and}} neck. We report a case in which stent-assisted endovascular treatment was successfully combined with direct puncture for additional coil placement to treat a symptomatic giant aneurysm of the cervical internal ca-rotid artery. Pseudoaneurysms of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) are uncommon lesions that may be in-duced by trauma, dissection, or rarely, infection or tumor invasion (1 – 4). Open surgery for the treatment of such lesions has been partly replaced by endovas-cular treatment alternatives such as balloon occlu-sion, coil embolization, stent placement, and balloon-or stent-assisted coil embolization (1 – 3, 5 – 8). The last technique has found widespread application in the treatment of wide-necked intra- and extracranial an-eurysms, especially in recent years (1 – 3, 6 – 8). Direct percutaneous puncture and embolization of lesions such as arteriovenous malformations and hy-pervascular tumors {{has been described}} for the head and neck region (9, 10). Absolute alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol particles, <b>gelatin</b> <b>foam</b> pledgets, N-butyl cya-noacrylate, and coils have all been used for percuta-neous and transarterial embolization of these lesions (9, 10). Direct percutaneous puncture and embolization has been used in visceral (11) and peripheral (12) aneurysms, but the procedure has not been reported in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms of the ICA. Here we report a case of a cervical ICA dissecting aneurysm that was treated with a combination of stent-assisted coil placement followed by direct per-cutaneous puncture and further placement of Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC; Target Therapeu-tics, Fremont, CA) ...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Transcatheter arterial chemotherapy and embolization {{is the main}} method {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, but most of the reports do not study individually to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hypovascular and hypervascular lung cancer. The pre-embolization perfusion of hemotherapeutics is still being used routinely and seldom report to iodized oil embolization. The article summarized the quality of life after the treatment, clinical efficiency, survival time and complications to evaluate the clinical effect of primary hypervascular NSCLC treated with embolization of emulsion of chemotherapeutics and iodized oil. Methods The study totally analyzed 41 cases which confirmed by pathology and follow up study from January, 2008 to January 2009. The CT scan with IV contrast demonstrates over moderate enhanced lesion which indicate hypervascular. Within the 41 cases, 23 cases of central, 18 cases of peripheral. Suqamous carcinoma 21 cases, adenocarcinoma 15 cases and squamoadenocarcinoma 5 cases. Stage IIIb 34 cases, stage IV 7 cases. Superselective incubation with microcatheter under DSA, to embolize the capillary bed with liquefied iodized oil and the emulsion of pharmorubicin, to embolize the supply artery of the tumor with <b>gelatin</b> <b>foam</b> microparticle. The liquefied iodized oil 5 mL- 10 mL, pharmorubicin 10 mg- 30 mg. The longest follow up is 12 months and to compare with the references of 2007 - 2009. Results The KPS is widely acclaimed after the treatment (P < 0. 05), no complete response (CR), 31 cases of partial response (PR), 7 cases of no change (NC) and 3 cases of progressive disease (PD), the total efficiency (CR+PR) is 75. 6 %. The clinical efficiency (CR+PR+NC) is 92. 68 %. 33 cases of total survival tome over 12 months (80. 48 %), IIIb stage 29 / 34 (85. 29 %), IV stage 4 / 7 (57. 14 %). 1 case with severe complication-spinal injury. Conclusion To treat primary hypervascular NSCLC with simple embolization of emulsion of chemotherapeutics and iodized oil is very useful and can avoid the side effect of chemotherapeutics. The key point to avoid spinal injury and other severe complications is to distinguish the spinal aretery and intratumor AV fistula by using superselective incubation with microcatheter under DSA...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} approach to bone repair for less invasive surgical techniques, involves {{the development of}} biomaterials directly injectable into the injury sites and able to replicate a spatially organized platform with features of bone tissue. Here, the preparation and characterization of an innovative injectable bone analogue made of calcium deficient hydroxyapatite and <b>foamed</b> <b>gelatin</b> is presented. The biopolymer features and the cement self-setting reaction were investigated by rheological analysis. The porous architecture, the evolution of surface morphology and the grains dimension were analyzed with electron microscopy (SEM/ESEM/TEM). The physico-chemical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction and FTIR analysis. Moreover, an injection test was carried out to prove {{the positive effect of}} gelatin on the flow ensuing that cement is fully injectable. The cement mechanical properties are adequate to function as temporary substrate for bone tissue regeneration. Furthermore, MG 63 cells and bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were able to migrate and proliferate inside the pores, and hMSCs differentiated to the osteoblastic phenotype. The results are paving the way for an injectable bone substitute with properties that mimic natural bone tissue allowing the successful use as bone filler for craniofacial and orthopedic reconstructions in regenerative medicine.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{is a complex}} collection of structural and functional molecules. Therefore ECM {{can be defined as}} “a network of secreted extracellular macromolecules”, and, depending on the tissue, this network varies greatly in its form and components. A crucial step in several tissue-engineering techniques is the use of materials which conceivably recreate a spatially organized bone ECM. Acting as temporary matrix cell guidance they stimulate tissue ingrowth directly. Because of pivotal role of the ECM in morphogenesis tissue, the basic strategy of the recent tissue-engineering attempts is mimicking the topological and microstructural characteristic of bone ECM in a controlled fashion, and providing a mechanical support to the development of new tissue. An appropriate material for bone repair must possess transversal properties such as promoting all the specific and biunivocal cell-ECM cross-talks, leading to cell proliferation and the maintenance of their differentiated functions. Moreover its architectural features are centred on interconnected macro and microporosity, that ensure mass transfer of nutrients and metabolites and cellular distribution and migration. Further, the ECM analogs must possess mechanical strength to withstand the imposed load and let the cells “feel” the right stimuli to produce the right ECM type. This work is aimed to design and engineeer injectable analogs via innovative realization processes both for hard tissues, like bone, and for soft tissues like nucleus polposus NP of intervertebral disc. Two kind of injectable bone analogs were realized: a bioactive foamed injectable paste for bone repair, that intimate fits complex cavities by using a calcium phosphate and a <b>foamed</b> <b>gelatin</b> gel, and a bioactive injectable composite paste made up of polycaprolacton and hydroxyapatite obtained via sol-gel technique. The challenge for any acellular NP replacement material is to mimic the function of native NP but to date does not exist a defined NP analog because the final results depend on the synergistic interaction of several parameters of different nature. This experiment campaign highlight the sophisticated potentiality of natural polysaccarides and collagen gels based on hyaluronic acid to act as NP replacement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEpistaxis is an {{important}} emergency that can sometimes be life threatening without effective intervention. Persistent and recurrent bleeding can lead to aspiration, hypotension, hypoxia, or even severe and mortal cardiovascular complications. Providing prompt hemostasis is important, and the hemostatic method used must be easily and locally applicable, efficient, and inexpensive. ObjectiveThe {{aim of this study}} was to assess the hemostatic efficacy of Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) in an experimental epistaxis model and to determine the histopathologic alterations with topical ABS application. MethodsTwenty-eight New Zealand rabbits were evaluated in 4 study groups. Topical ABS, <b>gelatin</b> <b>foam</b> (GF), adrenalin + lidocaine (AL), and serum physiologic as negative control (C) were applied to the animals for controlling epistaxis. The bleeding was generated with a standard mucosal incision in all groups. Cotton pieces soaked with ABS, AL, C, and GF were applied to the nasal bleeding area. Time of hemostasis was recorded. Tissue samples were obtained after hemostasis for histopathologic examination. The samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) and were examined under a light microscope. In this experimental study, the observers were blind to ABS, AL, and C but not to GF, because of its solid nature. ResultsMedian durations required for hemostasis in ABS, AL, GF, and C groups were recorded as 30, 90, 90, and 210 seconds, respectively. The time until termination of bleeding in the ABS group was significantly shorter than that in the AL, GF, and C groups (P = 0. 002, P = 0. 002, and P = 0. 001, respectively). On histopathologic evaluation, after staining with HE, minimal fibrin at the incision edges and a few extravasated erythrocytes were observed in the C, AL, and GF groups. In the ABS group, a dark amorphous material surrounded by fibrin, filling the space between the edges of incisions, was noticed. Fibrin was determined in the C, GF, and AL groups with PTAH stain and in the positive control group. In the ABS group, it was observed that the amorphous substance surrounded by fibrin seen in the HE sections was not stained with PTAH. ConclusionsTopical nasal ABS application controlled epistaxis faster than C, GF, and AL in this animal bleeding model. The bleeding model used here might fail to replicate the type of injury that would be likely to result in life-threatening bleeding in humans, which should be considered a limitation of the present study. The histopathologic findings in the nasal incision area suggest that ABS might affect global hemostasis by inducing a unique protein network formation, potentially representing a different mechanism of action among conventional antihemorrhagic applications...|$|E
