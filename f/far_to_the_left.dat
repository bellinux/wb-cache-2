5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|With the ALP's {{governing}} bodies unwilling to reform themselves, Whitlam worked {{to build support}} for change among ordinary party members. He was successful in reducing union influence in the party, though he was never able to give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive. The Victoria branch of the party had long been a problem; its executive was <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> {{of the rest of the}} ALP, and had little electoral success. Whitlam was able to reconstruct the Victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders, and the reconstituted state party proved essential to victory in the 1972 election.|$|E

5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen {{in and out of the}} party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E

Ambert led the brigades of Simon and Paillard <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> to turn the Prussian position at Otterberg. Huet moved against the enemy position with Morlot's brigade. Under the crossfire of the Sambach and Erfenbach batteries, the Prussians fell back and the French crossed the Otterbach.|$|E

After opening the tournament with a two-over-par 74, he shot 68-66 {{in the next two}} rounds and ended up one stroke behind leader Peter Hanson by Saturday night. Mickelson had a poor start to his fourth round, scoring a triple-bogey when he hit his ball <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the green on the par-3 4th hole, hitting the stand and landing in a bamboo plant. This ended up being Mickelson's only score over par in the whole round, and he ended with a score of eight-under overall. Earlier in the tournament he had received widespread praise for being present to watch Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player hit the ceremonial opening tee-shots, nearly seven hours before Mickelson's own tee time.|$|E

25|$|Cantwell has {{expressed}} support for making Plan B contraceptives available to girls 16 and under. In 2007, she cosponsored the Prevention First Act, a bill that sought to increase national access to family planning and preventative methods {{as a means to}} reduce unwanted pregnancies. It included providing women with access to Plan B as well as expanding family planning to be covered under Medicaid. As an advocate of increasing access to family planning and sexual health education, Cantwell argues that these venues for increased education are necessary {{to reduce the number of}} unwanted pregnancies. She received criticism from her Republican challenger, State Senator Michael Baumgartner, who suggested that Cantwell was too extreme and too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of most Washington voters on this issue, and expressed concern about 11-year-olds getting these drugs without a prescription.|$|E

These were accompanied by artillery, firing 200 yards ahead, but it was ordered to stop when it began to hit too close to the troops. After nine hours of climbing they were two thirds of the way up, when they were hit by heavy fire. Five of the six tank commanders in the motorized force were hit by Syrian commandos lying {{at the side of the}} road. The reconnaissance company was also hit and its commander was killed. The exchange of fire took place at range of a few yards. In addition to snipers, the Syrians also used Israeli machine guns taken from the outpost after the first battle.|$|E
25|$|After {{successfully}} transporting {{the patient}} from Tingwall Airport in the Shetland Islands to Inverness, the pilot, nurse, and physician were {{returning to their}} home base in Tingwall. There was a strong and gusting right crosswind at the runway. The pilot's approach procedure required him to make right turns to line up with the runway. However, these right turns obscured the pilot's view of the runway, and when the pilot made his final right turn, the aircraft had been blown {{to the left of}} the runway, too far to make a safe landing. The pilot executed a go-around procedure and attempted another approach. Again, the aircraft was blown <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the runway centreline, and during the final approach turn, the aircraft lost a great deal of altitude, striking the ground 1.5km short of the runway and approximately 0.3km {{to the left of the}} runway centreline. The AAIB determined that nighttime visibility of the airport environment was inadequate, especially during right crosswind conditions, and recommended the Tingwall Airport add additional ground lighting to aid pilots' ability to acquire the runway during nighttime approaches.|$|E

25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing {{a way to}} bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and {{decided it was time to}} get rid of Thiers.|$|E

Writing in Science & Society, Harvey O'Connor also gave the book a mixed appraisal, observing that while the book constituted a [...] "comprehensive indictment ... {{of the power of}} great fortunes" [...] based on [...] "encyclopedic research", Lundberg suffered from [...] "the New York myopia" [...] in describing the situation he presents as essentially beyond correction.|$|E
500|$|Though Nixon {{was later}} criticized for his tactics in the campaign, he defended his actions, and {{also stated that}} Douglas's {{positions}} were too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> for California voters. Other reasons for the result have been suggested, ranging from tepid support for Douglas from President Truman and his administration to the reluctance of voters in 1950 to elect a woman. The campaign gave rise to two memorable political nicknames, both coined by Boddy or making their first appearance in his newspaper: [...] "the Pink Lady" [...] for Douglas and [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] for Nixon.|$|E

500|$|While {{considering}} {{a run for}} president, during an October 2006 interview with The Conservative President 2008 website, Baldwin expressed his frustration with the Republican Party, which he believed was on a course of [...] "self-destruction" [...] and that was only kept afloat by the [...] "absurd liberalism of Democrats." [...] He praised Congressmen Tom Tancredo and Ron Paul as well as activists Pat Buchanan and [...] Alan Keyes, but stated that the Republican Party had steered too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> for him to support any of their candidates for president. When {{asked if he would}} run for president in 2008 he stated that he had [...] "no desire to run" [...] but that he was [...] "always open to God's will."

500|$|Vice President Henry Wallace {{was popular}} among Democratic voters, {{but he was}} viewed as too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and too {{friendly}} to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. The President {{and several of his}} confidantes wanted to replace Wallace with someone more acceptable to Democratic Party leaders and Roosevelt's advisors, knowing that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer Edwin W. Pauley, strategist Ed Flynn, Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, and lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket. Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed. Truman did not campaign for the Vice-Presidential spot, though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the [...] "Senator from Pendergast".|$|E
500|$|On September 1, the regiment, now {{numbering}} 400, marched northwest from Centreville {{with the}} rest of Ferrero's brigade. Although the men did not know it, they were among the handful of brigades chosen by Pope to deflect Jackson's flanking movement. Forming battle lines in a field not far from Chantilly Plantation, the 21st watched the 51st New York advance into thick woods to probe the enemy lines. Orders were soon given to Col. Clark to lead the 21st into the woods to support the 51st. The woods were very dense and the advance was disorderly. Making matters worse, a powerful thunderstorm burst out as the 21st entered the woodland. Unknowingly, the regiment obliqued <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and lost contact with the 51st New York. Encountering a body of troops in their front and unable to identify them through the torrential rain, Col. Clark presumed he had found the 51st, ordered the 21st to rest in place and sent officer Lt. Colonel Joseph Parker Rice forward to make contact. The troops were, in fact, men of Jubal Early's brigade and, before this could be ascertained, the Confederates unleashed a devastating volley on the unsuspecting 21st. [...] "In the sudden anguish and despair of the moment," [...] wrote Capt. Walcott, [...] "the whole regiment seemed to be lying bleeding on the ground." [...] Col. Clark immediately ordered a withdrawal and the 21st left more than 100 dead or wounded in the woods.|$|E
