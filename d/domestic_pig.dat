25|$|A pig is any of {{the animals}} in the genus Sus, within the even-toed {{ungulate}} family Suidae. Pigs include the <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of a {{comparison}} of the histochemical properties of various types of porcine muscles in wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> In <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> the influence of growth rates on these properties were studied in five muscles: longissimus dorsi (LD), semimembranosus (SM), gluteus superficialis (GS), infra spinam (IS) and masseter (MAS). The growth rate was expressed as (i) live weight (LW) at 165 ± 2 d and (ii) daily LW gain from day 88 to day 165 (DG) on the experimental diet. LD, SM, GS and IS of wild pigs were found to contain a higher area percentage of oxidative type IIA fibres (type IIA%area) and a lower percentage area of glycolytic type IIB fibres (type IIB%area) than the same muscles of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> The capillary density in the light muscles (LD, SM, GS) of wild pigs was twice that of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> indicating higher oxidative capacity. In <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> the cross sectional area of type IIB fibres (CSAIIB) was markedly larger than the cross sectional area of type I (CSAI) and IIA (CSAIIA) fibres. The average fibre cross sectional area (CSAfibre) was about the same in the muscles of wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> except in LD and SM, where the average fibre cross sectional area was approximately 25 % smaller in wild <b>pigs</b> than in <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> This difference was caused by the large cross sectional area of type IIB fibres in the light muscles of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> In the light muscles of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> the cross sectional area of type IIA fibres increased most with increasing growth rate.

40|$|A panel {{comprising}} 16 short tandem repeats (STRs) and a gender-specific amelogenin marker was {{worked out}} and tested for robustness in discrimination between wild and domestic swine subspecies encountered in Europe, between regional populations of wild boars and between main breeds of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> reared in Belarus. The STR dataset comprised 310 wild boars, inhabiting all administrative regions of Belarus, and 313 <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> representing three local and three cosmopolitan lines. Additionally, {{a total of}} 835 wild boars were genotyped {{for the presence of}} melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R) alleles specific for <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> Correctness of assignment of STR profiles to appropriate populations was measured by log-likelihood ratios (log-LRs). All samples were correctly identified as wild boars or <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> with average log-LR of 42. 4 (LR = 2. 6 × 1018). On the other hand, as many as 50 out of 835 (6. 0 %) genotyped wild boars from Belarus possessed MC 1 R alleles specific to <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> demonstrating supremacy of our STR profiling system over traditional differentiation between wild boars and <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> based on single binary markers.

40|$|The {{domestication}} {{process of}} pigs {{was associated with}} substantial morphological and physiological changes. The {{aim of this study}} was to comparatively investigate muscle microstructure and biochemical properties of four different skeletal muscles (M. longissimus, M. semitendinosus, M. psoas major, M. rhomboideus) in growing <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> (n= 5) and wild boars (n= 4). The superiority of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> in body and muscle growth at three months of age was reflected by a 4 -fold body weight and higher absolute weights of heart, liver and muscles. Relative muscle weights of M. psoas major and M. rhomboideus were reduced, whereas a 1. 6 -fold heavier M. semitendinosus was observed in <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> compared with wild boars. In addition, the muscle cross-sectional area was greater in all muscles of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> resulting from about 3 -fold fibre cross-sectional area, whereas total fibre number remained unchanged. As a consequence of intensified fibre hypertrophy, the fibre area per capillary is higher in all muscles of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> Thus, the impaired supply with oxygen and nutrients may be one reason for the shift to the glycolytic muscle metabolism as indicated by a greater proportion of fast-twitch glycolytic fibres at the expense of fast-twitch oxidative fibres. This is also reflected by a higher ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Our data suggest that the intensified muscle growth was realized by myofibre hypertrophy at unchanged myofibre number in growing <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> It seems that domestication-induced changes were most pronounced in M. semitendinosus as the exterior ham muscle which may be related to muscle specific selection for lean growth...|$|R

The pig production is growing rapidly in Uganda and {{is not only a}} source of food but also an important income for many people living in the rural areas. African Swine Fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease, which can cause up to 100 % mortality among <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs.</b> This disease is endemic in Uganda and causes major economical and personal losses for farmers whom it affects directly or indirectly. Outbreaks occur every now and then, and in most cases the source of the infection is unknown. To better understand the dynamics of the disease, and sources of new infections, the aims of this study were to study different possible reservoirs for ASF (<b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> wild suids and Ornithodoros ticks), and also to estimate the prevalence in one district, Rakai, in Southern Uganda, where pig production is an important source of income for the rural community. Another aim was to investigate the spatial behavior of a small number of bushpigs, to understand the interaction between these wild suids and their domestic relatives. Do they ever get in contact and thereby have the possibility to transfer ASFV from one another? DNA from African swine fever virus (ASFV) was found by PCR in nine of 239 <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> with no clinical signs and in three out of four sampled soft ticks (Ornithodoros porcinus).

60|$|No {{doubt it}} appears {{at first sight}} in the highest degree {{improbable}} that in every horse of every generation {{there should be a}} latent capacity and tendency to produce stripes, though these may not appear once in a thousand generations; that in every white, black, or other coloured pigeon, which may have transmitted its proper colour during centuries, there should be a latent capacity in the plumage to become blue and to be marked with certain characteristic bars; that in every child in a six-fingered family there should be the capacity for the production of an additional digit; and so in other cases. Nevertheless, there is no more inherent improbability in this being the case than in a useless and rudimentary organ, or even in only a tendency to the production of a rudimentary organ, being inherited during millions of generations, as is well known to occur with a multitude of organic beings.

60|$|The {{work of the}} old master {{is lightly}} incised on {{reindeer}} horn, and represents two horses, of a very early and heavy type, following one another, with heads stretched forward, as if sniffing the air suspiciously in search of enemies. The horses would certainly excite unfavourable comment at Newmarket. Their 'points' are undoubtedly coarse and clumsy: their heads are big, thick, stupid, and ungainly; their manes are bushy and ill-defined; their legs are distinctly feeble and spindle-shaped; their tails more closely resemble {{the tail of the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> than that of the noble animal beloved with a love passing the love of women by the English aristocracy. Nevertheless there is little (if any) reason to doubt that my very old master did, on the whole, accurately represent the ancestral steed of his own exceedingly remote period. There were once horses even as is the horse of the prehistoric Dordonian artist. Such clumsy, big-headed brutes, dun in hue and striped down the back like modern donkeys, did actually once roam over the low plains where Paris now stands, and browse off lush grass and tall water-plants around the quays of Bordeaux and Lyons. Not only do the bones of the contemporary horses, dug up in caves, prove this, but quite recently the Russian traveller Prjevalsky (whose name is so much easier to spell than to pronounce) has discovered a similar living horse, which drags on an obscure existence somewhere in the high table-lands of Central Asia. Prjevalsky's horse (you see, as I have only to write the word, without uttering it, I don't mind how often or how intrepidly I use it) is so singularly like the clumsy brutes that sat, or rather stood, for their portraits to my old master that we can't do better than begin by describing him in propria persona.|$|E
60|$|A {{double and}} {{parallel}} series of facts seems to throw much {{light on the}} sterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring. On the one side, {{there is good reason}} to believe that slight changes in the conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all organic beings. We know also that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same variety, and between distinct varieties, increases the number of their offspring, and certainly gives to them increased size and vigour. This is chiefly owing to the forms which are crossed having been exposed to somewhat different conditions of life; for I have ascertained by a labourious series of experiments that if all the individuals of the same variety be subjected during several generations to the same conditions, the good derived from crossing is often much diminished or wholly disappears. This is one side of the case. On the other side, we know that species which have long been exposed to nearly uniform conditions, when they are subjected under confinement to new and greatly changed conditions, either perish, or if they survive, are rendered sterile, though retaining perfect health. This does not occur, or only in a very slight degree, with our domesticated productions, which have long been exposed to fluctuating conditions. Hence when we find that hybrids produced by a cross between two distinct species are few in number, owing to their perishing soon after conception or at a very early age, or if surviving that they are rendered more or less sterile, it seems highly probable that this result is due to their having been in fact subjected to a great change in their conditions of life, from being compounded of two distinct organisations. He who will explain in a definite manner why, for instance, an elephant or a fox will not breed under confinement in its native country, whilst the <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> or dog will breed freely under the most diversified conditions, will at the same time be able to give a definite answer to the question why two distinct species, when crossed, as well as their hybrid offspring, are generally rendered more or less sterile, while two domesticated varieties when crossed and their mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile.|$|E
6000|$|Increased {{fertility}} from domestication, {{without any}} reference to crossing, may be here briefly considered. This subject bears indirectly on two or three points connected with the modification of organic beings. As Buffon long ago remarked (16/31. Quoted by Isid. Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. Naturelle Generale' tome 3 page 476. Since this MS. has been sent to press a full discussion on the present subject has appeared in Mr. Herbert Spencer's 'Principles of Biology' volume 2 1867 page 457 et seq.), domestic animals breed oftener in the year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the same species; they, also, sometimes breed at an earlier age. The case would hardly have deserved further notice, had not some authors lately attempted to show that fertility increases and decreases in an inverse ratio {{with the amount of}} food. This strange doctrine has apparently arisen from individual animals when supplied with an inordinate quantity of food, and from plants of many kinds when grown on excessively rich soil, as on a dunghill, becoming sterile: but to this latter point I shall have occasion presently to return. With hardly an exception, our domesticated animals, which have been long habituated to a regular and copious supply of food, without the labour of searching for it, are more fertile than the corresponding wild animals. It is notorious how frequently cats and dogs breed, and how many young they produce at a birth. The wild rabbit is said generally to breed four times yearly, and to produce each time at most six young; the tame rabbit breeds six or seven times yearly, producing each time from four to eleven young; and Mr. Harrison Weir tells me of a case of eighteen young having been produced at a birth, all of which survived. The ferret, though generally so closely confined, is more prolific than its supposed wild prototype. The wild sow is remarkably prolific; she often breeds twice in the year, and bears from four to eight and sometimes even twelve young; but the domestic sow regularly breeds twice a year, and would breed oftener if permitted; and a sow that produces less than eight at a birth [...] "is worth little, and the sooner she is fattened for the butcher the better." [...] The amount of food affects the fertility of the same individual: thus sheep, which on mountains never produce more than one lamb at a birth, when brought down to lowland pastures frequently bear twins. This difference apparently is not due to the cold of the higher land, for sheep and other domestic animals are said to be extremely prolific in Lapland. Hard living, also, retards the period at which animals conceive; for it has been found disadvantageous in the northern islands of Scotland to allow cows to bear calves before they are four years old.
