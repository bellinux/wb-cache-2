In {{contrast to a}} multi degree-of-freedom structure, a single degree-of-freedom structure can be driven by a single actuator, reducing cost and simplifying the control. In this paper, we study single degree-of-freedom structures that can be formed by a lattice of single degree-of-freedom polyhedral expanding units. Due to built-in symmetries, the entire structure can <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> {{as one of the}} units in the structure is actuated. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The fluid {{dynamics}} of <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> tube is investigated mathematically using both the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations for an incompressible viscous fluid. The problem admits similarity solution, {{thereby reducing the}} unsteady Navier-Stokes equations to a parameter dependent fourth order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Analytical solutions are constructed for the problem using perturbation technique together with a new special type of Hermite-Padé approximants and important properties of the overall structure of the flow are discussed. The model is appropriate to simulate wind tunnel tests on rheological phenomenon in physiological systems.
