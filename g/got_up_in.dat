5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E
25|$|Ó Sé's {{body was}} found {{at his home in}} Ceann Trá early on 15 December 2012. His death, at the age of 57, was {{unexpected}} and was thought to have been {{as a result of a}} heart attack.

25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning {{the first thing he}} did was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have been}} using his diary to gain greater insight and {{understanding}} of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, the time he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He talked at length about his new watch (which had an alarm, a new thing at the time) which he was very proud of, a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he {{felt that it was}} too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning. Pepys's diary is one of the only known sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper middle class man during the seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of explicit memories.|$|E
2500|$|Carry Back {{was sent}} to {{his home state of}} Florida in early 1961 and {{recorded}} his first important win of the year on his third start when he produced [...] "one of his blazing finishes" [...] to beat Sherluck in the Everglades Stakes at Hialeah Park Race Track on February 15. Ten days later, he added the Flamingo Stakes in which he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the last strides to beat Crozier by a head. On April 1, Carry Back ended his Florida campaign with a repeat win over Crozier in the Florida Derby. According to press reports, the victory established him as [...] "the king of the Eastern three-year-olds" [...] and a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1993 All-Star Game held at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, he {{was criticized}} for not getting Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina into the game. Mussina <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the ninth inning to warm up in the bullpen. Mussina later claimed that he was simply doing a between-start workout, but some {{interpreted}} it {{was an attempt to}} force Gaston to put him into the game. As angry fans jeered in dismay, incredulous that Gaston would not use the popular local player and believing Mussina had been sent to warm up for no reason, Gaston instead allowed Blue Jays pitcher Duane Ward to close out the victory for the American League. Baltimore fans did not like this perceived snub, and T-shirts were sold outside of Camden Yards that season bearing the phrase, [...] "Will Rogers never met Cito Gaston", referencing the famous line by Will Rogers, [...] "I never met a man yet that I didn't like." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, Shakespeare {{must have}} used Hall for {{the scene where}} Gloucester is {{attempting}} {{to gain access to}} the Tower, and Woodville tells him that the order not to admit anyone came from Winchester. Dismayed, Gloucester refers to Winchester as [...] "that haughty prelate,/Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne're could brook" [...] (1.3.23–24). Only in Hall is there any indication that Henry V had a problem with Winchester. In Holinshed, there is nothing to suggest any disagreement or conflict between them. Another example of Shakespeare's use of Hall is found when Sir Thomas Gargrave is injured by the artillery strike at Orléans (1.5). In the play, he dies immediately, and the rest of the scene focuses on the death of the more senior soldier Salisbury. Likewise, in Hall, Gargrave dies immediately after the attack. In Holinshed, however, Gargrave takes two days to die (as he did in reality). The semi-comic scene where the French leaders are forced to flee Orléans half-dressed (dramatised in 2.1) also seems based on an incident reported only in Hall. When discussing the English retaking of Le Mans in 1428, Hall writes, [...] "The French, suddenly taken, were so amazed in so much that some of them, being not out of their beds, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their shirts.") Another incident involving Gloucester and Winchester is also unique to Hall. During their debate in Act 3, Scene 1, Gloucester accuses Winchester of attempting to have him assassinated on London Bridge. Hall mentions this assassination attempt, explaining that it was supposed to have taken place at the Southwark end of the bridge in an effort to prevent Gloucester from joining Henry V in Eltham Palace. In Holinshed however, there is no reference to any such incident. Another incident possibly taken from Hall is found in Act 3, Scene 2, where Joan and the French soldiers disguise themselves as peasants and sneak into Rouen. This is not an historical event, and it is not recorded in either Hall or Holinshed. However, a very similar such incident is recorded in Hall, where he reports of the capture of Cornhill Castle in Cornhill-on-Tweed by the English in 1441.|$|E
