500|$|Each of the {{characters}} were totally redesigned for the game, taking cues from previous iterations from the Transformers lore. [...] "What they've allowed us to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>take</b> a licensed property and treat it like a brand new IP" [...] stated Tieger. The vehicle modes for car-based characters initially consisted of wheels, however the developers found that it crippled gameplay by removing the player's ability to strafe while in vehicle mode. [...] Taking the dilemma to Hasbro, the two companies agreed that characters would turn their wheels down and hover while in vehicle mode, allowing for more movement. [...] The vehicles would then revert to the traditional wheeled mode while using a character's boost, maintaining what the Transformers license had established with previous canon.|$|E
500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a little bit of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>take</b> as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Accelerated Evolution {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Mike G. of Metal Maniacs called Accelerated Evolution [...] "the {{album of the}} year", praising it for [...] "the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy 'n' rockin' yet majestic and beautiful." [...] William Hughes of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "amazing", saying the album [...] "has elements that will appeal to fans of all different genres, from progressive to metal." [...] Alex Henderson of Allmusic called the album [...] "excellent", and praised Townsend's ability to blend genres and influences: [...] "The Canadian rocker provides enough downtuned guitars to put this CD in the alt rock category. And yet Accelerated Evolution has a big sound that suggests the pop-metal, arena rock and hard rock of the '70s and '80s – big melodies, big harmonies, big guitars, big vocals, big production." [...] Chris Hawkins of KNAC.com said, [...] "Like always, what Devin manages to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>take</b> the most infectious rhythm, place his stamp upon it, and thus create something completely original." [...] Xander Hoose of Chronicles of Chaos compared the album favorably to SYL, noting that [...] "there is more variation, and the songs are more memorable and layered than their one-dimensional SYL counterparts." [...] Hoose added, [...] "For those who thought Terria was going {{too much in the}} wrong direction, Accelerated Evolution will probably come as a relief." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hague has {{a widely}} known {{reputation}} for corruption and bossism {{and has been}} called [...] "the grandaddy of Jersey bosses." [...] By {{the time he left}} office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million {{at the time of his}} death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his [...] "guests" [...] to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. [...] However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallanan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that [...] "he last thing [...] would need to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>take</b> a bribe personally." [...] As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration.|$|E
2500|$|For the reboot film, Guillermo del Toro {{said his}} Frankenstein {{would be a}} {{faithful}} [...] "Miltonian tragedy", citing Frank Darabont's [...] "near perfect" [...] script, which evolved into Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein. Del Toro said of his vision, [...] "What I'm trying to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>take</b> the myth and do something with it, but combining elements of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein without making it just a classical myth of the monster. The best moments in my mind of Frankenstein, of the novel, are yet to be filmed ... The only guy that has ever nailed for me the emptiness, not the tragic, not the Miltonian dimension of the monster, but the emptiness is Christopher Lee in the Hammer films, where he really looks like something obscenely alive. Boris Karloff has the tragedy element nailed down {{but there are so}} many versions, including that great screenplay by Frank Darabont that was ultimately not really filmed." [...] He has also cited Bernie Wrightson's illustrations as inspiration, and said the film will not focus on the monster's creation, but be an adventure film featuring the character. Del Toro said he would like Wrightson to design his version of the creature. The film will also focus on the religious aspects of Shelley's tale. In June 2009, del Toro stated that production on Frankenstein was not likely to begin for at least four years. [...] Despite this, he has already cast frequent collaborator Doug Jones in the role of Frankenstein's monster. [...] In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Jones stated that he learned of the news the same day as everybody else; that [...] "Guillermo did say to the press that he’s already cast me as his monster, but we’ve yet to talk about it. But in his mind, if that’s what he’s decided, then it's done ... It would be a dream come true." [...] The film will be a period piece. It is unclear what stage of development this film is in.|$|E

He uses humanity's endless greed and desire to lure them into transactions, with the ultimate goal of collecting their soul, thereby ruling the world. The shop owner is hand-selected by Dark Shadow.

[...] If, Lisak says, police discount the report of a victim who was intoxicated or otherwise vulnerable, they are [...] "giving a free pass to sexual predators". Especially because of the prevalence of repeat offenders, he encourages police departments and prosecutors to investigate the background of people accused of sexual assault, as they do with, for instance, accused drug dealers, and also to investigate post-assault evidence such as PTSD in the victim.|$|E
