5|$|Traditionally, {{computer}} software {{has been written}} for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next one is executed.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{some other}} virtual-machine {{architectures}} {{in which the}} virtual <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> interpreted at run time, TIMI <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> never interpreted. They constitute an intermediate compile time step and are translated into the processor's instruction set as the final compilation step. The TIMI <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> stored within the final program object, {{in addition to the}} executable machine instructions. This is how application objects compiled on one processor family (e.g., the original CISC AS/400 48-bit processors) could be moved to a new processor (e.g., PowerPC 64-bit) without re-compilation. An application saved from the older 48-bit platform can simply be restored onto the new 64-bit platform where the operating system discards the old machine instructions and re-translates the TIMI instructions into 64-bit instructions for the new processor.|$|E

50|$|This <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> {{sensitive}} {{because it}} allows access to the entire status register, which includes not only the condition codes but also the user/supervisor bit, interrupt level, and trace control. In most later family members, starting with the MC68010, the MOVE from SR <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> provided to allow access to the condition code register only.|$|R
5000|$|To {{expand the}} memory from 2048 to 4096 words, a 33rd <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> added {{that uses the}} most {{significant}} bit of its address field to select the bank. (This <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> probably created using the [...] "No OP" [...] instruction, which appears to have <b>been</b> the only <b>instruction</b> with unused bits, as it originally ignored its address field.

25|$|The new <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> {{common in}} digital signal {{processor}} (DSP) architectures. They include variations on signed multiply–accumulate, saturated add and subtract, and count leading zeros.|$|E
25|$|The {{program counter}} has 32 bits. The two low-order bits always contain zero since MIPS I <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> 32 bits long and are aligned to their natural word boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Programming the DEUCE was {{different}} from other computers. The serial nature of the Delay Lines required that <b>instructions</b> <b>be</b> ordered such that when one instruction completed execution, the next one was ready to emerge from a Delay Line. For operations on the single registers, the earliest time that the next <b>instruction</b> could <b>be</b> obeyed was 64 microseconds after the present one. Thus, <b>instructions</b> <b>were</b> not executed from sequential locations. In general, instructions could transfer one or more words. Consequently, each instruction specified {{the location of the}} next instruction. Optimum programming meant that as each <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> executed, the next one was just emerging from a Delay Line. The position of instructions in the store could greatly affect performance if the location of an <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> not optimum.|$|R

50|$|The drum memory held 1K of 40-bit words. The {{computer}} was programmed using binary machine code instructions. When programming the 1201, the machine code <b>instructions</b> <b>were</b> not sequential but were spaced {{to allow for}} the drum's rotation.
