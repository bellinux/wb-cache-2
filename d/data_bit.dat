This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique {{is referred to as}} scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel {{at the same time and}} frequency, it is called code division multiple access.|$|E

The <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> are embedded in scattered way into the four blocks.

A projective transform is used to reconstruct the code maker, such that the positions of <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> can be easily predicted. Reading of individual <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> is performed using thresholding.

50|$|The data/parity/stop (D/P/S) {{conventional}} notation specifies {{the framing}} of a serial connection. The most common usage on microcomputers is 8/N/1 (8N1). This specifies 8 <b>data</b> <b>bits,</b> no parity, 1 stop bit. In this notation, the parity bit {{is not included}} in the <b>data</b> <b>bits.</b> 7/E/1 (7E1) means that an even parity bit is added to the 7 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> for a total of 8 bits between the start and stop bits. If a receiver of a 7/E/1 stream is expecting an 8/N/1 stream, half the possible bytes will be interpreted as having the high bit set.|$|R

50|$|Unlike current storage {{technologies}} that record and read one <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> at a time, holographic memory writes and reads data in parallel {{in a single}} flash of light.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} allow both bus widths, VME uses two {{different}} Eurocard connectors - P1 and P2. P1 contains three rows of 32 pins each, implementing the first 24 address <b>bits,</b> 16 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> {{and all of the}} control signals. P2 contains one more row, which includes the remaining 8 address <b>bits</b> and 16 <b>data</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Each byte is {{transmitted}} {{in the sequence}} [...] "1 start <b>bit</b> - 8 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> - 2 stop bits". The <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> are little-endian ordered.

5000|$|Another code in use at {{the time}} {{repeated}} every <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> multiple times {{in order to ensure}} that it was sent correctly. For instance, if the <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> to be sent is a 1, an n = 3 repetition code will send 111. If the three bits received are not identical, an error occurred during transmission. If the channel is clean enough, most of the time only one bit will change in each triple. Therefore, 001, 010, and 100 each correspond to a 0 bit, while 110, 101, and 011 correspond to a 1 bit, as though the bits count as [...] "votes" [...] towards what the intended bit is. A code with this ability to reconstruct the original message in the presence of errors is known as an error-correcting code. This triple repetition code is a Hamming code with m = 2, since there are two parity bits, and 22 − 2 − 1 = 1 <b>data</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E
