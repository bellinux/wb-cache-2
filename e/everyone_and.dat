5|$|His {{platform}} would {{consist of}} the main points of leading the city out of debt, assuring the completion of city projects that were in progress before introducing news ones, and again, ensuring that utilities were available to <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> were of high quality.

Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to run by a group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day came, and thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E
5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one.

5|$|Yoga and Vedanta are the {{two largest}} {{surviving}} schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style {{and some of their}} methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti.|$|E
5|$|After getting Ron released, {{the parks}} {{department}} holds an intervention for him about Tammy, even playing a previously recorded tape of Ron warning himself {{to stay away}} from her.

He literally carries Tom away, and the two later make amends. Despite the bad impression he made the day before, Ben asks Trumple for the Harvest Festival favor. The chief unconditionally agrees out of respect for Leslie, who he said always helps <b>everyone,</b> <b>and</b> because Leslie once dated his friend Dave (Louis C.K.).

After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul.

5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. <b>Everyone</b> <b>and</b> everything was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E
5|$|Felix {{is finally}} able to explain to Isaac why Alchemy's release is a {{necessary}} thing for <b>everyone,</b> <b>and</b> that Saturos and Menardi were aiming for this goal merely {{for the sake of}} the survival of their home colony of Prox to the far north, located near the Mars Lighthouse. He also reveals that his parents and Isaac's father are alive and currently being held hostage in Prox in order to coerce Felix's initial cooperation. Isaac and his company agree to aid Felix, and the group sets out north to activate the Mars Lighthouse. The group discovers that Karst and Agatio have been transformed into mindless dragons and are forced to defeat them - they return the Mars Star before succumbing to their wounds. When they reach the tower's top, the Wise One, the entity responsible for originally tasking Isaac to prevent the breaking of Alchemy's seal, confronts them. He warns them that mankind could very well destroy Weyard themselves if they had possession of such a power, and when Isaac insists on breaking the seal regardless the Wise One summons a giant, three-headed dragon for the party to battle in the final struggle. After slaying the dragon, the party of Adepts finish their objective and activate Mars Lighthouse; with all four towers across Weyard lit, the process that heralds the return of the force of Alchemy to Weyard ensues at the mountain sanctum Mt. Aleph. Alex is there, however; he took advantage of everyone else's quests so that he would gain immense power for himself from the light of the Golden Sun, a manifestation of Alchemy itself. However, he discovers that the Wise One had taken steps to prevent this and is left to die as the mountain collapses and sinks into the ground with him still on it.|$|E
