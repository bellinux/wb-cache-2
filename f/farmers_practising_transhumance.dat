5000|$|By the 13th century, {{sheep farming}} in Wales {{had become a}} major {{industry}} and source of income, largely from wool, much of which was exported. Large flocks of sheep were owned by Cistercian abbeys and monasteries, such as those at Strata Florida, Margam, Basingwerk and Tintern. [...] The woollen industry in Wales was {{a major contributor to}} the national economy, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's exports in 1660. [...] However, large-scale sheep rearing on the higher moors of Wales, such as those in Denbighshire, is only believed to have developed within the last 300 years. Sheep <b>farmers</b> often <b>practised</b> <b>transhumance,</b> with part of each household moving to live in the hills with the sheep during the summer; later, their seasonal hillside hafods or dwellings became permanent homes. In the past, grazing rights were determined by local courts.|$|R
30|$|The land {{provided}} within the grazing reserve is too limited in area and quality {{to meet the}} nutritional needs of the cattle population dependent on it. Poor grazing {{during the dry season}} and competition for the grazing during the wet season are the main motivations for transhumance as observed outside of the reserves. A recent survey on the Jos Plateau showed that 10 % of villages <b>practise</b> <b>transhumance</b> in the dry season, 17 % in the wet season and 47 % in both seasons with only 26 % not <b>practising</b> <b>transhumance</b> (Majekodunmi et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|The second, the ‘mixed’ strategy, {{is based}} on transhumance. It {{concerns}} the owners of medium-sized herds who <b>practise</b> minor <b>transhumance</b> and the owners of large herds that <b>practise</b> major <b>transhumance.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Scandinavia, {{transhumance}} {{is still}} practiced {{to a certain}} extent; however, livestock are transported between pastures by motorized vehicles, changing {{the character of the}} movement.

30|$|When crop {{residues}} {{have been completely}} grazed, and especially when finding water for the herd becomes particularly problematic, some pastoralists decide to send their herds on transhumance. Pastoralists with medium-sized herds <b>practise</b> <b>transhumance</b> for {{short periods of time}} (February to June) over short distances on the peripheral territory during winter. This transhumance ends when water and pasture resources in the attachment and peripheral territories are renewed after the start of the rains. This type of transhumance often involves the entire herd (horedji and suredji).|$|R
30|$|Dry season {{transhumance}} is a long-established {{practice of}} pastoral life. However, wet season transhumance {{is a more}} recent development both in the KGR and in Nigeria more generally and a direct response to reduction in grazing caused by land pressure. A recent study in 30 villages in Jos revealed that 73 % of herders <b>practised</b> <b>transhumance</b> with over half practicing both wet and dry season migration. The major driver of wet season migration was limited availability of resources and attendant restricted access to them (Majekodunmi et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|Results {{show that}} 67 % of all {{households}} <b>practised</b> <b>transhumance</b> and that {{over half of}} these practised both wet and dry season migration. Poor availability of resources is the main driver for dry season migration, being the reason cited by 71 % of respondents, almost twice the number who cited poor access {{as the reason for}} migration. However, poor access to available resources is the major driver for wet season migration, being the reason cited by 48 % of respondents, almost four times the number (13 %) who cited lack of resources as the reason for migration.|$|R
25|$|The Qashqai (Kashkai) are a Turkic {{tribe of}} {{southern}} Iran, {{who in the}} mid-20th century still <b>practised</b> <b>transhumance.</b> The tribe {{was said to have}} settled in ancient times in the Province of Fars, near the Persian Gulf, and by the mid-20th century lived beyond the Makran mountains. In their yearly migrations for fresh pastures, the Kashkai drove their livestock from south to north, where they lived in summer quarters, known as Yeilak, in the high mountains from April to October. They traditionally grazed their flocks on the slopes of the Kuh-è-Dinar; a group of mountains from 12,000 to 15,000 feet, part of the Zagros chain.|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} found that Romanian sheep <b>farmers</b> are still <b>practising</b> long-distance <b>transhumance</b> {{because they believe that}} it is {{beneficial}} to their animals, the environment and their produce. They also do it because they love it. But some are pessimistic about its future. As Huband et al. (2010) pointed out, pendulation may be the only way forward, but even that is under threat. The PASTORAL project suggests links between pastoralism and tourism as well as environmental conservation and the preservation of ‘public goods’ (PASTORAL 2000 – 2003). More proof is needed that naturally produced meat and milk - and wool for that matter - are not only superior in quality to industrially produced foods but also economically viable and attractive to consumers. Although the PASTORAL project made an excellent start, conservationists and policy-makers still need to talk to, and understand, small, <b>practising</b> <b>farmers,</b> and vice versa.|$|R

5000|$|Ngakarimojong is a Nilotic {{language}} of the Nilo-Saharan language family (Encyclopædia Britannica) spoken by at least 370,000 people in Uganda - the Karamojong people, or ŋiKarimojoŋ in their language. The name approximates to [...] "the old men sat down", dating from a time of migration 300 or more years ago when this group refused to travel further on (to what is now Teso). They are a cattle-keeping people <b>practising</b> <b>transhumance,</b> which {{is reflected in the}} language as are their traditional religious beliefs. Settled cultivation is relatively recent and thus words associated with this are usually borrowed from neighbouring languages or from languages introduced by, or as a result of, colonialism - English, Luganda, Swahili. Modern technical words come from these latter also.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} the KGR cannot support the cattle {{population}} within its boundaries forces pastoralists to undertake seasonal transhumance to sustain their cattle. In June 2011, 69 % of households <b>practised</b> seasonal <b>transhumance</b> to source adequate pasture for their cattle. Of these, 31 % <b>practised</b> dry season <b>transhumance</b> and 13 % wet season transhumance and 26 % practised both wet and dry season transhumance. By October 2011, 90 % of households reported having taken their cattle on dry and/or wet season transhumance during the previous 12  months from grazing pressures caused by the influx of refugees in June 2011 (Ducrotoy et al. 2016).|$|R
30|$|Pastoralism, as a livelihood, {{is coming}} under {{increased}} pressure across Africa, due to changing social, economic, political and environmental conditions. Prior to the 1950 s, {{a symbiotic relationship}} existed between pastoralists, crop farmers and their environment with pastoralists <b>practising</b> <b>transhumance.</b> During the dry season, pastoralists migrated to the southern parts of the Guinea savannah zone, where there was ample pasture and a lower density of crop farmers. In the wet season, these areas faced high challenge from African animal trypanosomiasis transmitted by tsetse flies, so pastoralists would migrate to visit farmlands within the northern Sudan savannah zone, supplying dairy products to the local farming community. Reciprocally, the farming community supplied pastoralists with grain, and after the harvest, cattle were permitted to graze on crop residues in fields leaving behind valuable manure.|$|R

5000|$|While the {{inhabitants}} of the Alps had <b>practised</b> <b>transhumance</b> for thousands of years, during the Late Middle Ages it became increasingly important as the population decreased following the Black Death and the wars of this era. [...] Cattle production was much less manpower-intensive than farming, which was ideal with the reduced population. However, cattle production is much more capital- and especially land-intensive. Cattle production became an investment opportunity for monasteries and citizens of nearby cities. The investors would purchase the cattle and then rent the beasts out to small farmers or to herders for the summer. The smaller alpine communities generally did not want [...] "foreign" [...] cattle pastured in their alpine pastures, which led to conflicts between the alpine farming communities and the neighboring cities and monasteries. [...] Conflicts over grazing rights and ownership of the alpine meadows led to several wars within what is now Switzerland, including the pivotal Battle of Morgarten (1315), which started due to a long-simmering feud between Schwyz and Einsiedeln Abbey.|$|R
25|$|The Van Gurjars ("forest Gurjars") {{are found}} in the Shivalik hills area of North India. The Van Gurjars follow Islam, and they have their own clans, similar to the Hindu gotras. They are a {{pastoral}} semi-nomadic community, <b>practising</b> <b>transhumance.</b> In the winter season, the Van Gurjars migrate with their herds to the Shiwalik foothills, and in summer, they migrate to pastures high up in the mountains. The Van Gurjars have had conflicts with the forest authorities, who prohibited human and livestock populations inside a reserved park, and blamed the Van Gurjar community for poaching and timber smuggling. After the creation of the Rajaji National Park (RNP), the Van Gurjars in Deharadun were asked to shift to a resettlement colony at Pathari near Hardwar. In 1992, when they returned to the foothills, the RNP authorities tried to block them from the park area. The community fought back and finally the forest authorities had to relent. Later, a community forest management (CFM) programme aiming to involve the Van Gurjars in forest management was launched.|$|R

30|$|Despite the {{widespread}} perception that grazing reserves are promoting sedentarisation of Fulani pastoralists and curbing transhumance, {{the inhabitants of}} the KGR were observed to <b>practise</b> wide-ranging <b>transhumance</b> both during wet and dry seasons driven by the limited availability of grazing. Some households selected a sub-sample of animals for transhumance rather than sending their whole herd, and some maintained cattle on alternative land-holdings outside the reserve.

40|$|MASTER OF SCIENCE IN RANGE MANAGEMENT (ECONOMICS OPTION), 2004 The East African {{governments have}} {{initiated}} land reform programmes {{with the objective}} of creating individualisation of land rights where rules of access, use and transfer are reformulated in order to adapt to rising population densities, land scarcity and agricultural commercialisation. This study assessed the effects of land tenure on land use and food security in Loitokitok Division, Kajiado District, Kenya. Purposive sampling was carried out by grouping locations within Loitokitok Division into two: those <b>practising</b> <b>transhumance</b> and the ones <b>practising</b> agropastoralism. <b>Transhumance</b> refers to seasonal movement with livestock for pastures and water while leaving the bulk of the households in permanent settlements. Agropastoralism refers to mixed farming in permanent settlements but sometimes includes transhumance. One location was randomly selected from each of the groupings and systematic sampling was carried out. Samples of 35 transhumant and agropastoral households respectively were then selected for the administration of a questionnaire. Also, village elders, chiefs and extension officers were interviewed, and more data were collected from annual reports and previous research studies. Data were analysed using both descriptives and regressions. Stratification of households showed that land tenure had influence on pastoral household size, herd size, milk yield, income from milk, total income, employment and remittance. In addition, agropastoral households were more food secure with a food poverty incidence of 0. 2 while that of transhumant households was 0. 6. The linear regression model showed that household size, diversification, total income, gender and land tenure had influence on both transhumant and agropastoral household food security at 5 per cent level of significance. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the government and other stakeholders create awareness on issues of land tenure by gradually introducing the concept of individualisation of land rights in pastoral areas. Also, for improved income in these areas, there is need to increase the livelihood sources through micro industries such as milk processing plants, and hides and skins. This will provide job <opportunities and ready markets for their products. Further, family planning programmes should be provided to ensure household dependency ratio is reduced.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on a panel survey {{interviewing}} 416 <b>farmers</b> <b>practising</b> conservation agriculture for at least five cropping seasons. Farmers obtained higher yields on conservation agriculture plots than on nonconservation agriculture ones. The mean maize yield on conservation agriculture was 1546 kg/ha compared to 970 kg/ha for non-conventional draft tillage plots across all 15 districts. However, the contribution of conservation agriculture to total household food security requirements was limited due to small plot sizes. Labor and land still remains a major challenge that limits the expansion of conservation agriculture area. Winter weeding remains a challenge, with 63 % of farmers practicing it. Application of residues is still limited (56 % of <b>farmers</b> <b>practising</b> it). Fertilizer application is largely dependent on access to free fertilizer. The survey results show that the 78 % of the respondent farmers were initially selected by the NGOs and were provided with inputs such as seed and fertilizer. The other 22 % of the farmers in the sample were selected as spontaneous adopters, who did not initially receive any NGO support to implement conservation agriculture practices. Eleven percent of the interviewed farmers had stopped conservation agriculture practices by the 2008 / 09 cropping season due to withdrawal of input support by NGOs. Research should continue to explore different recommendations for different areas as farmers face dynamic agro-ecological and soil environments. Conservation agriculture should not be introduced as a blanket technology for all areas, but should be flexible and adaptable to local conditions. conservation agriculture, planting basins, yield gains, adoption labor, and fertilizer, Farm Management, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

Others highlight their high-quality meat and milk. Their meat is said to be tastier and leaner, as the cows are fit and sturdy. Their milk is said to be of better quality and have a fuller and deeper taste thanks to the rich variety of fodder that the cows eat, resulting in cheese that tastes different every time.

30|$|In both {{observation}} years, transhumance {{from the}} coastal plain to the limestone plateau started between late December and early January, with herders leading their cattle from Ankilibory and Efoetse to neighbouring destination areas on the plateau at about 45  km from the home village. This transhumance movement took one or two days. In the destination area, the animals were kept in corrals which remained unused {{for the rest of}} the year. The timing of departure, the migration routes, and the target villages or hamlets were clearly determined by family relations and kinship. From the six study herds <b>practising</b> <b>transhumance,</b> five already returned to their home territories after spending only a few weeks on the plateau, due to the increasing risk of cattle raids towards the end of the rainy season when long-distance pathways across the plateau were again passable and thus better accessible for thieves. This menace was generally regarded to be much lower in {{the coastal plain}}. In both observation years, only one cattle owner from Miarintsoa sent his herd to the coastal region in the course of the dry season. Apart from these yearly east-west herd movements between the two survey regions, individual herds of both cattle and goats also temporarily moved in a north-south direction towards areas about 10 to 30  km away from their home location to gain access to better feeding resources. However, such movement patterns, but also individual herd management characteristics, were too variable to justify the grouping of respective herds into subcategories for analysis.|$|R
