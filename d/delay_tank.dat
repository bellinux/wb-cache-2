40|$|In {{response}} to stricter requirements on increased efficiencyand reduced environmental impact, production plants in theprocess industries are becoming tightly integrated withextensive recycling {{of material and}} energy. This thesisconsiders some consequences of such recycling for the dynamicbehavior of process systems. The {{focus is on the}} dynamics ofmain importance for the ability to handle process systems usingfeedback control, i. e. the plant controllability. It is shown that material and energy recycling imposepartial feedback mechanisms in a plant, and that such partialfeedback can induce unstable zero dynamics in control relevanttransfer-functions. The presence of unstable zero dynamics willimply a hard limitation in the process controllability. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence ofunstable zero dynamics as a consequence of partial feedback arederived. The conditions are well suited for incorporation in aprocess design framework for dealing with controllabilitythrough process design. The derived results are of relevancealso to other systems with partial feedback, e. g. decentralizedfeedback control systems. The disturbance sensitivity of an integrated plant is to alarge extent caused by interactions between various processunits, imposed by recycle flows. In this thesis, a systematicmethod is proposed for modifying these interactions, so as toreduce the disturbance sensitivity to a desired level, usingstorage capacities integrated in the plant. It is shown thatthe minimal required capacity for a given disturbancesensitivity reduction is obtained with a plug flow (delay) tankintegrated in the recycle path, combined with a mixed tankcascaded with the plant. The <b>delay</b> <b>tank</b> serves to modify thefeedback properties imposed by the recycle flow, while themixed tank acts as a low-pass filter. It is shown that the sizeof capacities required with the proposed method can besignificantly smaller than that required by a traditionalcascaded buffer system. The use of integrated buffers with theaim of stabilizing unstable process systems is alsoaddressed. The last part of the thesis considers the effect of processintegration on the controllability of a bleach plant in thepulp and paper industry. A flexible dynamic model, allowing forvarious degrees of integration to be studied, is constructedand calibrated against available data. A controllabilityanalysis reveals that, while the low-frequency disturbancesensitivity is significantly increased by the integration, thecontrollability is only slightly affected. A systems analysis,based on decomposing the overall model, is used to explain theresults of the controllability analysis. NR 2014080...|$|E

40|$|A {{workshop}} {{was held}} on January 23 - 24, 2007 to discuss the status of processes to leach constituents from High Level Waste (HLW) sludges at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites. The objective of the workshop {{was to examine the}} needs and requirements for the HLW flowsheet for each site, discuss the status of knowledge of the leaching processes, communicate the research plans, and identify opportunities for synergy to address knowledge gaps. The purpose of leaching of non-radioactive constituents from the sludge waste is to reduce the burden of material that must be vitrified in the HLW melter systems, resulting in reduced HLW glass waste volume, reduced disposal costs, shorter process schedules, and higher facility throughput rates. The leaching process is estimated to reduce the operating life cycle of SRS by seven years and decrease the number of HLW canisters to be disposed in the Repository by 1000 [Gillam et al., 2006]. Comparably at Hanford, the aluminum and chromium leaching processes are estimated to reduce the operating life cycle of the Waste Treatment Plant by 20 years and decrease the number of canisters to the Repository by 15, 000 - 30, 000 [Gilbert, 2007]. These leaching processes will save the Department of Energy (DOE) billions of dollars in clean up and disposal costs. The primary constituents targeted for removal by leaching are aluminum and chromium. It is desirable to have some aluminum in glass to improve its durability; however, too much aluminum can increase the sludge viscosity, glass viscosity, and reduce overall process throughput. Chromium leaching is necessary to prevent formation of crystalline compounds in the glass, but is only needed at Hanford because of differences in the sludge waste chemistry at the two sites. Improving glass formulations to increase tolerance of aluminum and chromium is another approach to decrease HLW glass volume. It is likely that an optimum condition can be found by both performing leaching and improving formulations. Disposal of the resulting aluminum and chromium-rich streams are different at the two sites, with vitrification into Low Activity Waste (LAW) glass at Hanford, and solidification in Saltstone at SRS. Prior to disposal, the leachate solutions must be treated to remove radionuclides, resulting in increased operating costs and extended facility processing schedules. Interim storage of leachate can also add costs and <b>delay</b> <b>tank</b> closure. Recent projections at Hanford indicate that up to 40, 000 metric tons of sodium would be needed to dissolve the aluminum and maintain it in solution, which nearly doubles the amount of sodium in the entire current waste tank inventory. This underscores the dramatic impact that the aluminum leaching can have on the entire system. A comprehensive view of leaching and the downstream impacts must therefore be considered prior to implementation. Many laboratory scale tests for aluminum and chromium dissolution have been run on Hanford wastes, with samples from 46 tanks tested. Three samples from SRS tanks have been tested, out of seven tanks containing high aluminum sludge. One full-scale aluminum dissolution was successfully performed on waste at SRS in 1982, but generated a very large quantity of liquid waste ({approx} 3, 000, 000 gallons). No large-scale tests have been done on Hanford wastes. Although the data to date give a generally positive indication that aluminum dissolution will work, many issues remain, predominantly because of variable waste compositions and changes in process conditions, downstream processing, or storage limitations. Better approaches are needed to deal with the waste volumes and limitations on disposal methods. To develop a better approach requires a more extensive understanding of the kinetics of dissolution, as well as the factors that effect rates, effectiveness, and secondary species. Models of the dissolution rate that have been developed are useful, but suffer from limitations on applicable compositional ranges, mineral phases, and particle properties that are difficult to measure. The experimental bases for the models contain very few data points...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{inexpensive}} frequency-modulated contin-uous-wave (FMCW) {{radar system}} {{is presented in}} this paper, which, nevertheless, meets all industrial requirements. The FMCW radar uses a low-cost nonlinear voltage-controlled os-cillator (VCO), operating at an IF of 2. 45 GHz to generate the frequency modulation of the radar system. This VCO signal is applied twice, first to generate the radar transmitter signal at 24 GHz, and then it {{is fed to a}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line. The SAW delay line generates a fixed delay time, which corresponds with a fixed radar distance. Thus, all systematic non-linearities and stochastic phase errors of the FMCW system can be monitored and, afterwards, can be compensated for in real time. This linearization technique leads to a significant enhancement in dynamic range for a FMCW radar system. For this FMCW system, SAW delay lines with a linear phase characteristic have been designed using a linear optimization program. The delay line consists of two chirped and weighted interdigital transducers. For high volume, low-cost, and high-yield production of the required SAW structures, with linewidths down to 0. 3 m, technological improvements had to be achieved, especially in photolithography. Based on these design and fabrication techniques, delay lines at 2. 45 GHz operating at the fundamental and third harmonic with bandwidths up to 800 MHz have been realized.

For example, transfers of tank S- 102 waste were suspended due to a plugged pipeline or a mechanical problem with the transfer pump. The replacement pump then failed within 2 weeks. In contrast, since full-scale waste remediation activities such as vitrification were initiated, the SRS has encountered {{a wider range of}} problems due to unwanted solids. The 2 H evaporator system was shut down because of the formation of aluminosilicate deposits with enriched uranium in the evaporator pot. While high concentrations of aluminum are expected in the tank waste due to previous canyon operations, the primary source of silicon is the recycle stream from the vitrifier. While solids formation can be expected when waste streams are combined, the formation of the aluminosilicate deposits required an elevated temperature within the evaporator. The shutdown of the 2 H evaporator led to a severe shortage of tank space. Therefore, the SRS tank farm was forced to transfer highly concentrated waste, which led to a plugged transfer pump in tank 32. For each of the proposed cesium removal technologies for the SRS, unwanted solids formation occurred during the large laboratory-scale tests prior to the final selection of the solvent extraction process. It can be expected that further problems will be encountered as more unit operations of the remediation effort are deployed and as more waste streams are combined. Since these problems have already led to costly schedule <b>delays,</b> the <b>tank</b> farm operators at both sites have identified the prevention of solids formation as a high-priority need. In response to this need, the Tank Focus Area has assembled a team of researchers of researchers from AEA Technology, Florida International University (FIU), Fluor Hanford, Mississippi State University (MSU), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) to evaluate various aspects of the waste preparation and transport chemistry. The majority of this effort was focused on saltcake dissolution and saltwell pumping. The results of the AEA Technology, FIU, and MSU studies of saltcake dissolution and slurry transfers for Hanford are discussed in detail in a companion report prepared by T. D. Welch in 2001 (ORNIJTM- 2001097). Staff members at Fluor Hanford have continued to conduct saltcake dissolution tests on actual tank waste (documented in reports prepared by D. L. Herting in 2000 and 2001). It should be noted that full-scale saltcake dissolution at Hanford is scheduled to begin in FY 2002. While the Hanford effort is focused on the transfer of waste from one tank to another, the objective of the SRTC study is the formation of aluminosilicates at elevated temperatures, which are present in the waste evaporator...|$|R
40|$|Working {{memory is}} a type of memory that is active only {{for a short period of}} time (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Goldman-Rakic, 1992). A common example of working memory is our ability to hold a phone number in our minds transiently, until it is dialed. Working memory is {{critical}} for many cognitive tasks, such as making decisions and guiding subsequent actions (Goldman-Rakic, 1992; Wickelgren, 2001). Deficits in working memory are associated with numerous pathological conditions, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, aging, and stress (Birnbaum et al., 2004; Goldman-Rakic, 1992; Goldman-Rakic and Selemon, 1997). Therefore, it is important to understand the neural basis of working memory. During performance of a working memory task, pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are able to maintain sustained firing during a delay period between an informative cue and the appropriate behavioral response (Goldman-Rakic, 1995). Thus, stimulus-specific persistent neural activity is thought to be a neural substrate for holding memories over short time <b>delays</b> (Major and <b>Tank,</b> 2004). Once persistent activity is triggered within a neuron or neural circuit, its activity can be maintained after the stimulus has terminated. Three general (non-mutually exclusive) mechanisms of persistent activity have been hypothesized: recurrent network activity (Compte et al., 2000; Wang, 2001), short-term synaptic plasticity (Mongillo et al., 2008) and intrinsic biophysical cellular properties. Several studies have demonstrated the role of intrinsic biophysical cellular properties in persistent activity (Egorov et al., 2002; Egorov et al., 2006; Fransen et al., 2006). This firing behavior is linked to cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation and phospholipase C (PLC) signaling in the absence of synaptic reverberations. Two fundamental questions are: (1) What mechanism underlies the generation of sustained firing at a single cell level? (2) What role does intrinsic persistent firing play in working memory? Pharmacological studies suggest that persistent activity relies on activity of Ca 2 +-activated non-selective cation (CAN) current (ICAN) (Egorov et al., 2002; Egorov et al., 2006). However, the molecules that constitute CAN channels in the brain are not well studied, and the importance of CAN channels to working memory is unknown. I seek to identify molecular mechanisms to convert subthreshold input into intrinsic persistent neural firing in PFC layer 5 pyramidal neurons. I hypothesize that CAN channels are responsible for the intrinsic properties that mediate persistent neural activity in PFC layer 5 neurons. During muscarinic receptor activation, bursts of action potentials will lead to Ca 2 + influx. CAN channels will be activated due to the increased intercellular Ca 2 + and promote a slow afterdepolarization (sADP), a transition state between subthreshold input and suprathreshold sustained firing. If the sADP is strong enough, it will trigger subsequent spikes, causing further opening of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels and Ca 2 + influx, and thus further opening of CAN channels. Therefore, ICAN will be maintained by a positive feedback loop, generating persistent activity. I have combined electrophysiology, pharmacology, genetics and behavioral analyses to address the potential roles of CAN channels and persistent activity in working memory. First, I confirmed that in the presence of the muscarinic agonist carbachol a brief burst of action potentials triggers a prominent sADP and persistent activity in these neurons. Second, I confirmed that this sADP and persistent firing require activation of a PLC signaling cascade and intracellular calcium signaling. Third, I obtained direct evidence that the transient receptor potential melastatin 5 channel (TRPM 5), which is thought to function as a CAN channel in non-neural cells, makes an important contribution to sADP and persistent activity in the layer 5 neurons. Importantly, Trpm 5 -/- mice show deficits in a Delayed-Non-Match-to-Sample maze (DNMTS) task, a working memory task in the mouse model. Furthermore, PFC-specific expression of TRPM 5 using a virally-mediated delivery system in Trpm 5 -/- mice produced a partial rescue of deficits in the working memory tasks, indicating the importance of TRPM 5 in mPFC for performance of these tasks. Lastly, I found that PFC-specific expression of TRPM 5 partially rescued the electrophysiological defects in Trpm 5 -/- mice. By identifying an ion channel contributing to working memory, this work opens the possibility of discovering new drugs for treating working memory deficit...|$|R
