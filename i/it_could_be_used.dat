5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, {{but the idea that}} <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The canal had a lock at Thorne {{and another}} where it joined the River Trent at Keadby. This lock had {{four sets of}} gates, so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> whether {{the level of the}} river was higher or lower than that of the canal.

5|$|The lancers {{advanced}} {{from the}} east onto the ridge overlooking Beit Hanun, and despite meeting considerable resistance, captured the position. In the process, they secured twenty-three prisoners, some artillery pieces and a large quantity of ammunition. They also captured the town's water pumping machinery intact, but were forced to withdraw back to Jebaliye for water as the equipment ran on gas made from charcoal, {{which had to be}} converted before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{top floor}} of the mill is the dust floor. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for storage of grain and gives {{internal}} access to the cap. The cast-iron wallower, which is driven by the brake wheel is carried {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, in the centre of the mill.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E

5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or Malagasy history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to Malagasy of three major Western novels was significant because they enriched Malagasy literature by introducing elements of the novel form that had never before been attempted in Malagasy language. These efforts demonstrated to other Malagasy language writers the versatility of the language and the possibility that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|Ginetta, then {{seventeen}} years old, was already {{active in the}} resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to Jews who were in hiding. Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to forge letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E
5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

5|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{was originally}} discovered by physicists. Mathematicians {{became interested in}} this relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.|$|E
5|$|St Deiniol's is {{no longer}} in use; in 2006, a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that no {{services}} had been held for a number of years, and added that ivy was growing across the building. The church's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll, served by St Mary's, Llanfairpwll. As of January 2011, the church (without the grounds) was on sale for £50,000; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a studio or for storage, subject to necessary consents being obtained.|$|E
5|$|The Central Pacific Hurricane Center retired {{the name}} Iwa {{subsequent}} to the storm {{and replaced it with}} Io. However, in 2007 the CPHC revised the four rotating lists of tropical cyclone names and replaced the name Io with Iona before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> Iwa was the first retired hurricane in the Central Pacific since the modern system of using Hawaiian naming began in the early 1980s, and it remains one of only four to be retired as of 2015.|$|E

5|$|The base also {{contained}} a Noncommissioned Officers Club and an Officers Club. The Noncommissioned Officers Club, or Club 42 {{as it was}} known, allowed in all military members and civilians up the GS-7. Many varieties of food were also offered there, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for live entertainment, {{in addition to the}} booking of parties. As the Visiting Officers Quarters and the Unaccompanied Officers Quarters were nearby, the club was also a convenient stopover for transient officers as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern {{platforms}} for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake {{should be done in}} 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some calling it a better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Lemon Tree {{was based}} on a real life incident. Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz moved to the border within Israel and the {{occupied}} territories and security forces began cutting down the Lemon trees beside his house, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by terrorists as a hiding place. The Palestinian family who owned the trees sued the minister and took the case {{all the way to the}} Israeli Supreme Court. They lost, and their trees had to be cut down. Riklis watched a news blurb about the case online. He then developed the story further in a fictional setting. Riklis explicitly designed the protagonist's part for actress Hiam Abbass.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, {{the ship}} was {{canceled}} on 11 August 1945, {{when she was about}} 22% complete. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945. Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the belief that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a target in nuclear weapons tests. However, the some $30million it would cost to complete the ship {{enough to be able to}} launch her proved too great and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was broken up on the builder's ways.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{brothers}} received initial {{support from the}} government, the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. They claimed <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an air force base—and thus would {{be a violation of}} the Svalbard Treaty—and pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer. From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport. At first they asked the company to cease operations, then asked the American military to cut funding. They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground. The government also used Gunnar's military rank to hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing the plans. The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping the plans.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
