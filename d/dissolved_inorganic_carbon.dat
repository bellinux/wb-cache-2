40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of human {{pressures}} on water quality is difficult. First, {{there is a high}} temporal and spatial variability of climate and human activity. Second, chemical elements have their own characteristics mixing short and long term dynamics. High frequency, long-term and multi-element measurements are required. But, such data series are scarce. This paper aims at determining what the hydro-chemical particularities of a livestock farming catchment are in a temperate climatic context. It is based on an original and never published time series, from Kervidy-Naizin headwater catchment. Stream chemistry was monitored daily and shallow groundwater roughly every four month, for 10 yr and five elements (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and <b>dissolved</b> organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon).</b> The five elements present strong but different seasonal patterns. Nitrate and chloride present a seasonal flush, all along or {{at the beginning of the}} wet season, respectively. Sulphate, organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> present storm flushes, with constant or decreasing peaks throughout the wet season. These depicted nitrate and chloride patterns are typical of a livestock farming catchment. There, nitrate and chloride coming from organic fertilisation have been accumulating over years in the shallow groundwater. They are seasonally flushed when the groundwater connects to the stream. Sulphate, organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> patterns do not seem specific to agricultural catchments. These elements are produced each year and flushed by storms. Finally, a generic classification of temporal patterns and elements is established for agricultural catchments. It is based on the distance of the source component to the stream and the dominant controlling process (accumulation versus production). This classification could be applied to any chemical element and help assessing the level of water disturbances...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 2003 Georgia Water Resources Conference, held April 23 - 24, 2003, at the University of Georgia. Relationships between water chemistry, {{microbial}} activity, and hydrology {{were examined}} in Chickasawhatchee Creek, a small coastal plain stream in southwestern Georgia. Microbial activity in the creek was determined by measurement of water-column respiration rates and growth-limiting substrates through oxygen consumption experiments. Water chemistry parameters (nitrate-N, soluble reactive phosphate, <b>dissolved</b> organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon,</b> major cation species) were measured in order to evaluate introduction and removal of various compounds and to identify ground water contributions. Results indicated substantial differences in water chemistry between the upstream and downstream reaches that were related to streamflow variation. During low flow periods, the upper reach of the creek was regulated by surface runoff while groundwater inflow played a more {{important role in the}} lower reach. Conversely, during periods of high flow, surface water runoff dictated streamflow for the entire system. There is strong evidence that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) always served as the growth-limiting substrate, and that DOC concentrations varied based on dilution by low-DOC groundwater. However, there was no correlation between measurements of water-column respiration and dissolved organic carbon...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigh-frequency, {{long-term}} and multisolute {{measurements are}} required {{to assess the impact}} of human pressures on water quality due to (i) the high temporal and spatial variability of climate and human activity and (ii) the fact that chemical solutes combine short- and long-term dynamics. Such data series are scarce. This study, based on an original and unpublished time series from the Kervidy-Naizin headwater catchment (Brittany, France), aims to determine solute transfer processes and dynamics that characterise this strongly human-impacted catchment. The Kervidy-Naizin catchment is a temperate, intensive agricultural catchment, hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Over 10 yr, five solutes (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and <b>dissolved</b> organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon)</b> were monitored daily at the catchment outlet and roughly every four months in the shallow groundwater. The concentrations of all five solutes showed seasonal variations but the patterns of the variations differed from one solute to another. Nitrate and chloride exhibit rather smooth variations. In contrast, sulphate as well as organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> is dominated by flood flushes. The observed nitrate and chloride patterns are typical of an intensive agricultural catchment hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Nitrate and chloride originating mainly from organic fertilisers accumulated over several years in the shallow groundwater. They are seasonally exported when upland groundwater connects with the stream during the wet season. Conversely, sulphate as well as organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> patterns are not specific to agricultural catchments. These solutes do not come from fertilisers and do not accumulate in soil or shallow groundwater; instead, they are biogeochemically produced in the catchment. The results allowed development of a generic classification system based on the specific temporal patterns and source locations of each solute. It also considers the stocking period and the dominant process that limits transport to the stream, i. e. the connectivity of the stocking compartment. This mechanistic classification can be applied to any chemical solute to help assess its origin, storage or production location and transfer mechanism in similar catchments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{phytoplankton}} growth {{a fraction}} of dis-solved <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> (DIC) assimilated by phytoplankton is exuded {{in the form of}} dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which can be transformed into extracellular particulate or-ganic carbon (POC). A major fraction of extracellular POC is associated with carbon of transparent exopolymer parti-cles (TEP; carbon content = TEPC) that form from dissolved polysaccharides (PCHO). The exudation of PCHO is linked to an excessive uptake of DIC that is not directly quantifi-able from utilisation of <b>dissolved</b> <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen (DIN), called carbon overconsumption. Given these conditions, the concept of assuming a constant stoichiometric carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio for estimating new production of POC from DIN uptake becomes inappropriate.

Annual hydrograph is analyzed by characterizing the river flow components using geochemical tracers (anions, cations, and <b>dissolved</b> organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon),</b> stable isotopes (δ 2 H, δ 18 O, and δ 13 C) and radioactive isotopes (14 C and 3 H).
