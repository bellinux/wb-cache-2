5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle.

Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage.

5|$|The filmmakers chose St. Vincent {{as their}} primary {{shooting}} location, as it contained the quietest beach they could find, and built three piers and a backlot for Port Royal and Tortuga.

For budget reasons, the ships were built on docks, with only six days spent in the open sea for the battle between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor. The Dauntless and the Black Pearl were built on barges, with computer-generated imagery finishing the structures. The Black Pearl was also built on the Spruce Goose stage, {{in order to control}} fog and lighting. The Interceptor was a re-dressed Lady Washington, a full-scale replica sailing ship from Aberdeen, Washington, fully repainted before <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 40-day voyage beginning December 2, 2002, arriving on location on January 12, 2003.
