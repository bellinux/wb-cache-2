5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him. He finishes dressing for the fight and, as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the camera pulls back to reveal that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Joffrey lies to the courtly entourage and accuses Arya and her direwolf of ganging up on him. Unwilling to lose {{favor with}} her betrothed by {{publicly}} exposing his lie, Sansa claims she remembers nothing. Sick of the petty bickering, King Robert chastises his son for allowing {{himself to be}} disarmed by the younger girl and declares that the fathers themselves will punish their respective children, dismissing the audience. However, Robert gives in to his wife Cersei's demands and orders the direwolf killed. Since Nymeria has fled, Sansa's wolf, Lady, is to be sacrificed. Unable to convince the king otherwise, Eddard takes responsibility for killing Sansa's pet himself. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of the}} inn, he encounters Joffrey's bodyguard, Sandor [...] "The Hound" [...] Clegane, who has ridden down the butcher's boy and brought in his bloody corpse for the prince.|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack {{over his shoulder and}} the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E
5000|$|On {{his first}} march <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> Annapolis, Maryland, the state capital. On his second march <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the White House. He arrived {{at about the}} same time that Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was being {{released}} from the Birmingham jail after protests in that city. His letter to President John F. Kennedy said that <b>he</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Mississippi and [...] "If I may deliver any letters from you to those on my line of travel, I would be most happy to do so." ...|$|R

500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on December 5, 1990, {{and it was}} filmed on December 11. Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where all filming for the second season took place. As only one {{location}} was used, it took roughly half {{of the time it}} usually took for an episode to be filmed. Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode. A few changes were made; in the first draft of the script, George, Jerry, and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday. In the version that aired, they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and garbagemen into a single job. In the original draft, the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future, with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring a jigsaw puzzle with nothing but penguins. One scene was cut before broadcast, featuring George explaining to Jerry that he pulled his hamstring while trying to untuck the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston. George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the phone. The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} official synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Tom Wilk is a poor country lad, living alone with his stepfather, who ill-treats him. Tom leaves his work one day to follow a circus parade. He is fascinated with {{the wonders of the}} parade and follows it to the circus grounds, around which he stays all morning, and is finally tempted by his great wish to see the show, to crawl under the tent. He is discovered by a circus guard, and ordered off the ground. A small girl, Lillie Lockwood, and her father come to the circus, and witness Tom's ejection. Urged by his daughter, Lillie's father buys Tom a ticket of admission, giving him his first happy day. In return, Tom gives Lillie, as a keepsake, his most treasured possession, his pocket knife. On returning home, Tom is severely chastised by his step-father, after which he decides to run away. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> a neighboring town, and is there engaged as an office boy by Gates, a lawyer. After some years of faithful service, in various capacities, Tom becomes a member of the firm. Lillie obtains a position as a stenographer in their office. She and Tom do not recognize each other, until Tom accidentally sees in her hand the little knife he had given her in the long ago. He declares he had loved her through the years, and has been patiently waiting for her, so the romance that began at the circus finds a happy climax at the altar." ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY. Glad to. Good-bye for the present. (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> {{windows on}} the far right, turning his back considerately on their leave-taking.) ...|$|E
60|$|She did not reply, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the window}} and looked out on the garden.|$|R
60|$|Trafford {{had left}} her side. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the window {{and sat down in}} a chair.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the table}} and poured a stiff drink of Scotch into a glass.|$|R
60|$|DR. FREEMANTLE. You {{mean to tell}} me--[He jumps up. With {{his hands}} in his jacket pockets, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> and fro.] I suppose it's possible.|$|E
60|$|SLOAN (looking around him). Couldn't be more pleasant, I must say--light and airy. (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> {{where he}} can take a peep into the dining-room.) Ah, they're all at breakfast, I see.|$|E
6000|$|WILLIS: 'It isn't {{a simple}} matter like telling them to start the {{elevator}} down when they couldn't start her up.

60|$|Then {{without more}} words <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> his camp, {{the gates of}} which were closed behind him.|$|R

60|$|Each {{policeman}} {{has his own}} district, {{which is}} called his beat; and <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> and fro in this beat all the time while he is on duty. There is a station near this beat, to which he takes any delinquents or criminals {{that he may have}} occasion to arrest, in order that they may be examined, and, if found guilty, sent to prison.|$|E
60|$|There was no reply, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the bunk}} softly {{and pulled the}} {{blankets}} over the engineer.|$|R
60|$|His voice choked. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the door, stood a moment, came back. His {{eyes were}} full of tears.|$|R

6000|$|LADY CHESHIRE {{suddenly}} rises, looking {{towards the}} billiard-room [...] door, listening. They all follow her eyes. She sits down [...] again, passing {{her hand over}} her lips, as SIR WILLIAM enters. [...] His hunting clothes are splashed; his face very grim and set. [...] <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the fore without a glance at any one, and stands [...] looking down into it. Very quietly, every one but LADY CHESHIRE [...] steals away.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the window, and {{the others}} are going out by the door. But they do not go. There is a hitch somewhere--at the window apparently, for DEARTH, having begun to draw the {{curtains}} apart lets them fall, like one who has had a shock. The others remember long afterwards his grave face as he came quietly back and put his cigar on the table. The room is in darkness save for the light from one lamp.) ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} who came {{regularly}} to inquire of him, and each afternoon I {{would see the}} broad shoulders and genial face of Governor Sharpe in the gateway, completing his walk by way of Marlboro' Street. I loved and admired him, for {{he had been a}} soldier himself before he came out to us, and had known and esteemed my father. His Excellency should surely have been knighted for his services in the French war. Once he spied me at the window and shook his cane pleasantly, and in <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the room where I sat reading of the victories of Blenheim and Malplaquet, for chronicles of this sort I delighted in.|$|E

60|$|It is {{not much}} of a dream, {{considering}} the vast extent of the domains of dreamland, and their wonderful productions; it is only remarkable for being unusually restless and unusually real. He dreams of lying there, asleep, and yet counting his companion’s footsteps as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> and fro. He dreams that the footsteps die away into distance of time and of space, and that something touches him, and that something falls from his hand. Then something clinks and gropes about, and he dreams that he is alone for so long a time, that the lanes of light take new directions as the moon advances in her course. From succeeding unconsciousness he passes into a dream of slow uneasiness from cold; and painfully awakes to a perception of the lanes of light—really changed, much as he had dreamed—and Jasper walking among them, beating his hands and feet.|$|E
60|$|On {{the brow}} of a grassy slope dotted over with mimosa thorns, {{and close to}} a gushing stream of water, stands a house, or rather a hut, built of green brick and {{thatched}} with grass. Behind this hut is a fence of thorns, rough but strong, designed to protect all within it from the attacks of lions and other beasts of prey. At present, save for a solitary mule eating its provender by {{the wheel of a}} tented ox-waggon, it is untenanted, for the cattle have not yet been kraaled for the night. Presently Thomas Owen enters this enclosure by {{the back door of the}} hut, and having attended to the mule, which whinnies at the sight of him, goes to the gate and watches there till he sees his native boys driving the cattle up the slope of the hill. At length they arrive, and when he has counted them to make sure that none are missing, and in a few kind words commended the herds for their watchfulness, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the front of the house and, seating himself upon a wooden stool set under a mimosa tree that grows near the door, he looks earnestly towards the west.|$|E
60|$|Her laugh is {{very like}} David's, whom I could punch {{all day in}} order to hear him laugh. I dare say she put this laugh into him. She has been putting qualities into David, {{altering}} him, turning him forever on a lathe since the day she first knew him, and indeed long before, and all so deftly that he is still called a child of nature. When you release David's hand he is immediately lost like an arrow from the bow. No sooner do you cast eyes on him than you are thinking of birds. It is {{difficult to believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> the Kensington Gardens; he always seems to have alighted there: and were I to scatter crumbs I opine he would come and peck. This is not what he set out to be; it is all the doing of that timid-looking lady who affects to be greatly surprised by it. He strikes a hundred gallant poses in a day; when he tumbles, which is often, he comes to the ground like a Greek god; so Mary A---- has willed it. But how she suffers that he may achieve! I have seen him climbing a tree while she stood beneath in unutterable anguish; she had to let him climb, for boys must be brave, but I am sure that, as she watched him, she fell from every branch.|$|E
