50|$|The EU {{currently}} has a limited mandate over defence issues, with {{a role to}} explore the issue of European defence agreed to in the Amsterdam Treaty, as well as oversight of the Helsinki Headline Goal <b>Force</b> <b>Catalogue</b> (the 'European Rapid Reaction Force') processes. However, some EU states may and do make multilateral agreements about defence issues outside of the EU structures.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released without the track [...] "24 Hour Party People". In its {{place was a}} track entitled [...] "Desmond", which borrowed heavily from [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] by The Beatles. A few hundred copies of the album were released with the [...] "Desmond" [...] track, but the usage was not cleared and Michael Jackson, then-owner of The Beatles' back <b>catalogue,</b> <b>forced</b> {{the removal of the}} track from future pressings, with [...] "24 Hour Party People" [...] taking its place.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, {{the jury}} {{in the case of the}} alleged rape and murder of Blackpool schoolgirl Charlene Downes, 14, heard a police {{surveillance}} tape of Jordanian Iyad Albattikhi, 29, and Iranian Mohammed Reveshi, 50, allegedly detailing her stabbing, and her later alleged disposal in their [...] "Funny Boyz" [...] kebab shop's mincing machine by the prosecution. Albattikhi allegedly boasted that he had sold her remains in kebabs. Both men were acquitted of the alleged offence. John Bromley-Davenport, for the defence, said: [...] "We have uncovered within the Blackpool Police <b>force</b> an astonishing <b>catalogue</b> of incompetence, failure to disclose, manipulation and lies, some of which were uttered on oath during the trial last year. If the jury at that trial had swallowed the lies and been duped by the manipulation then a grave miscarriage of justice would have occurred." ...|$|R
5000|$|From the Petersberg task {{scenarios}} envisaged, the EU Military Staff {{generated the}} [...] "Helsinki Headline Catalogue" [...] which specifies which capabilities are required {{in each of}} 144 capability areas. In November 2000, the European Union held a Capabilities Commitment Conference in Brussels, which elicited commitments for over 100,000 (existing) troops that were declared available for {{what became known as}} the Helsinki <b>Force</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> A year later, a Capabilities Improvement Conference was held during which further military forces and 5,000 police were added to the catalogue.|$|E
50|$|The Military Staff has {{supervised}} {{a number}} of deployments since its establishment. The term EUFOR or European Union Force {{has been used to}} describe {{a number of}} military deployments, and has been used four times so far: in the Republic of Macedonia from March 2003 to December 2003 as EUFOR Concordia, in Bosnia from 2004 as EUFOR Althea, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006 (EUFOR DR Congo), and in Chad (EUFOR Tchad/RCA) and the Central African Republic since 2007. EUFOR is a temporary military deployment, not a permanent military force, and {{should not be confused with}} the Eurocorps, Eurofor or the Helsinki Headline Goal <b>Force</b> <b>Catalogue,</b> sometime misleadingly known as the 'European Rapid Reaction Force'. The name 'EUFOR' probably was patterned in imitation of NATO's IFOR, SFOR, and KFOR.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{demographic}} {{changes and the}} increasing proportion of orthogeriatric patients, the German Trauma Society (DGU) established a certification process for geriatric fracture centres (AltersTraumaZentrum DGU®). This article is a detailed illustration of the certification process and the related Registry. The main goal of the certification is to support orthogeriatric comanagement and {{to improve the quality}} of care for geriatric patients. The requirements of the Criteria <b>Catalogue</b> <b>force</b> participating centres to continuously survey and improve their standards and structures. As a result, the requirements should lead to a high quality of care. To prove that the certification leads to higher quality of care, the DGU started a Geriatric Fracture Registry (AltersTraumaRegister DGU®) in 2016, which is obligatory for all certified centres. Studies on comanaged care and the improvement of quality by certified geriatric fracture centres are planned. Further health-care research will also be possible with the collected data...|$|R
5000|$|Bengen's {{early work}} {{contains}} elements of Jugendstil (corresponding {{in some ways}} to [...] "Art nouveau"). His artistic offering is much taken up with presentations of women. His most original and personal works - often using strong colours - date from the decade before the First World War. Much of his contribution to teaching is acknowledged in biographical works concerning his former pupils, while much of his own later artistic output was destroyed by the Second World War. Most of the earlier works, however, including many from the 1920s, survived undisturbed in a cellar until {{after the death of}} Bengen's widow, at which point, through the efforts of his three daughters, they again saw the light of day. Some were exhibited early in the twenty-first century as part of an exhibition featuring the [...] "Hiddensee" [...] artists' colony, and have subsequently returned in <b>force</b> to the <b>catalogues</b> of the art dealers.|$|R
40|$|To become valuable, such design {{patterns}} should encode {{the structure of}} a solution and its associated <b>forces,</b> rather than <b>cataloguing</b> just a solution, often for a specific platform. We introduce the generative pattern as a way of both documenting and implementing the human–computer interaction (HCI) patterns. A generative pattern not only tells us the rules for implementing a user interface (UI) design is considered as a generic solution to a problem at different levels of abstraction (in the way that a UI could be modeled), but also shows us how to transform these expressions into programmable codes for the diverse computing platforms, while being compliant with the style guide rules that may prevail for these platforms. As a case study, the master-detail (M-D) pattern, one popular and frequently used HCI design pattern, is developed: this displays a master list of items and the details for any selected item. While this MD pattern is documented in very different, possibly inconsistent, ways across various computing platforms, the M-D generative pattern consolidates these particular implementations into a high-level pattern description based on design options that are independent of any platform, thus making this pattern “cross-platform. ” A framework provides developers and designers with a high level UI process to implement this pattern in using different instances and its application in some designated languages. Some examples of applying an M-D generative pattern are explained as well as a particular implementation for the Android platform...|$|R
