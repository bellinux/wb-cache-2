5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short <b>heights,</b> <b>hover</b> and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|R
50|$|On August 28, 2012, Colin Gore powered the Gamera II for 65.1 seconds, {{within a}} 10 meter x 10 meter area. Two {{of the three}} {{criteria}} prescribed to meet the American Helicopter Society Sikorsky Prize competition were achieved, with only <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> falling short. Sonar altimeters and a modified transmission were added for the effort.|$|R
25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a single piston engine, driven by {{expelled}} air. Demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow in 1960, it was shown that this simple craft could carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment {{as well as the}} pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> proportional to the load carried. The SR.N1 did not have any skirt, using instead the peripheral air principle that Christopher had patented. It was later found that the craft's <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air. The skirt was an independent invention made by a Royal Navy officer, C.H. Latimer-Needham, who sold his idea to Westland (by then the parent of Saunders-Roe's helicopter and hovercraft interests), and who worked with Christopher to develop the idea further.|$|R
25|$|Pave Hawk combat {{enhancements}} {{include a}} radar warning receiver, infrared jammer and a flare/chaff countermeasure dispensing system. HH-60G rescue equipment includes a hoist capable of lifting a 600-pound (270kg) load from a <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> of 200 feet (60 m), and a personnel locating system.

30|$|We hypothesise {{that the}} {{difference}} in the distribution of deposited dye {{at the base of the}} canopy (compared to the top and middle regions) was due to the angle of the spot-gun relative to the helicopter downwash. Further study could verify this hypothesis and also optimise the method, with respect to helicopter <b>hovering</b> <b>height</b> and/or the position of the spot-gun nozzles relative to the helicopter’s downwash.|$|R

2500|$|At the 1920 Rhön meeting Klemperer {{flew the}} FVA-1 three times on 3 September, making {{the first ever}} bungee launches, a system devised by Klemperer himself. The longest flight that day was [...] with a {{duration}} of 142s, much further and longer than the previous best in the competition, set by Pelzner in his hang glider, of [...] in 52s. The FVA-1 flew again on 7 September in a brisk [...] wind, actually gaining [...] in <b>height</b> whilst <b>hovering</b> over the ridge, before landing. Two more FVA pilots flew the FVA-1 that day but the aircraft was seriously [...] damaged when the third pilot stalled and crashed the FVA-1 spectacularly.

40|$|Abstract – A {{simplified}} {{analysis is}} presented for controller design of small scale helicopters for non-aggressive flight scenarios. A MATLAB based detailed approach was followed {{to analyze the}} mathematical characteristics of the system, and to aid the design process of PID/PD and fuzzy logic controllers for the yaw, the pitch, the roll (Euler angles) and the <b>height</b> variables for <b>hover</b> and slow flight. Both controllers have demonstrated promising results and they are simple and mathematically sound...|$|R
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra <b>height</b> or <b>hover</b> over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the dynamic {{stability}} of the hovering magnetic top from first principles without using any preliminary assumptions. We write down the equations of motion for all {{six degrees of freedom}} and solve them analytically around the equilibrium solution. Using this solution we then find conditions which the <b>height</b> of the <b>hovering</b> top above the base, its total mass, and its spinning speed have to satisfy for stable hovering. The calculation presented in this paper {{can be used as a}} guide to the analysis and synthesis of magnetic traps for neutral particles.

40|$|The U-CAS is a {{spinning}} magnetized top that is levitated in a static magnetic field. The field {{is produced by}} a permanent magnet base, positioned below the hovering top. In this paper we derive {{upper and lower bounds}} for h - the maximum <b>hovering</b> <b>height</b> of this top. We show that the bounds are of the form a*L where a is a dimensionless number ranging from about 1 to 12, depending on the constraints on the shape of the base and on stability considerations, and L is a characteristic length for the problem. For modern permanent magnets we find that L=~ 1 [meter], thus limiting h to about few meters. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, uses IEEEtans. cl...|$|R
2500|$|A novel cargo {{handling}} {{feature of the}} SA-15 class freighters was an air cushion platform which could be carried on the weather deck and used to transport cargo ashore or directly to a warehouse in locations having little or no {{cargo handling}} facilities. These hovercrafts, manufactured by Wärtsilä, were powered by a 625kW stern-mounted diesel engine driving two fans giving the platform a <b>hovering</b> <b>height</b> of [...] They were capable of carrying a payload of 38 tonnes over ice, water, land and marshy terrain when towed by a tractor or a tug or, if necessary, by using an auxiliary propulsion unit that gave the platform a speed {{of at least two}} knots. However, the air cushion platforms were rarely used and have not been seen on board the SA-15 class freighters since the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{domain of}} landowners over {{airspace}} {{is limited to}} the lower atmosphere; in United States v. Causby et ux. landower domain was limited to the space below 365 feet, Justice Douglas reasoned that, should it find in the landowners' favor and accept the [...] "ancient doctrine that at common law ownership of land extends to the periphery of the universe — Cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum," [...] "every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits." [...] Citizens have a right to fly in the [...] "navigable airspace" [...] Thirty one years later, in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, an English court reached a similar conclusion, finding an action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred meters above the land: [...] "if the latin [...] maxim were applied literally it would lead to the absurdity of trespass being committed every time a satellite passed over a suburban garden." [...] Parliament subsequently reinforced Berstein in the Civil Aviation Act 1982, providing that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable <b>height.</b> Objects <b>hovering</b> above a person's property, though attached to the ground, may constitute trespass. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an 8 foot advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. However, should the overhang fail to generate actual harm, the court may deny a plaintiff equitable relief despite the technical trespass.|$|R
40|$|A highly-instrumented UH- 60 A {{aircraft}} was tested at NASA-Ames Research Center from August 1993 to February 1994 obtaining an extensive data base for level flight, maneuvers, acoustics (both {{with respect to}} ground microphone arrays and inflight microphones), and flight dynamics. A majority of the data obtained are now in an electronic data base, however, {{only a small fraction}} of the data have been examined. The proposed paper will examine the issue of hovering steadiness in more detail. In particular, a single set of data obtained during ground acoustic testing may provide considerable insight as the wind speeds were measured at a <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> of 250 feet and the {{aircraft was}} positioned in 15 deg. steps in heading from 0 to 180 deg. Also, hover housekeeping data were obtained for many of the 31 flights and these will also allow a characterization of the unsteadiness. The variation in section lift will be examined in terms of the induced flow angle variation and this will be related to possible physical explanations...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics in hover of an 11 / 36 %-scale, powered, twin-tilt nacelle {{model were}} {{measured}} in the NASA Ames Research Center's 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The model was powered by two high-pressure air-driven turbofan propulsion simulators. The position of the sting-mounted model was fixed and a movable ground plane was used to vary ground <b>height</b> and orientation. <b>Hover</b> characteristics were investigated {{in and out of}} ground effect for roll angles of - 2 deg to + 14 deg and pitch angles of - 15 deg to + 10 deg. Results for the basic configurations are compared with data from hover tests of the full-scale tilt nacelle model. Two methods were investigated to increase vertical vane effectiveness: (1) extending the maximum vane deflection from 20 deg to 70 deg, and (2) adding a third vertical vane. The goal was to increase the roll-control capability to significantly reduce or balance the strong, unfavorable rolling moment created by the loss of one engine. Results indicate that the three-vertical-vane configuration is more effective than two vertical vanes and that extended vane deflections significantly reduce the engine-out roll in hover...|$|R
50|$|The {{main focus}} of the SLIDE is in the {{levitation}} of the hoverboard. The levitation is achieved {{through the use of}} superconductors inside the board. Superconductors are conductors that have no internal resistance {{as long as they are}} kept below a certain temperature. When a metal has no internal resistance, that means with a current running through the metal, the current will run forever without a power source. When a superconductor is subjected to a magnetic field, essentially the superconductor aligns itself with the magnetic field and floats on top of it. The magnetic field in which the SLIDE will ride on has a magnetic pole of two south poles on the ends with a north pole in the middle. Generally with magnetic fields, the direction goes from north pole to south pole, so to simplify, the magnetic field created for the SLIDE pushes upwards in the middle and outwards equally split in both directions of the board keeping it levitating. The SLIDE maintains a <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> of about 1 to 2 inches above ground and can support about 440 pounds in weight. Superconductors only have their no internal resistance property when cooled to a certain temperature. In order to achieve this the SLIDE uses liquid nitrogen to cool it down to -197° Celsius. Even though liquid nitrogen cools down the superconductors of the SLIDE, it also boils at -197° Celsius. Because of this, it is difficult to have a constant supply of liquid nitrogen to continually cool down the superconductors, this is why the SLIDE can go for an average of 20 minutes on maximum liquid nitrogen capacity. Ross McGouran managed to get a maximum ride time of 30 minutes.|$|R
