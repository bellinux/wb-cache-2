5|$|Malcolm {{leaves the}} table {{only to return}} furious; Archie was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the bill, and fetches a knife and {{chopping}} board. Archie and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who will remove the body.|$|E

Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She {{walks out of the}} office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|Material cause {{describes}} the material {{out of which}} something is composed.

25|$|This {{novel is}} based on the idea of {{traveling}} to another time period. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> basic time travel. The author {{is quick to point out}} that the traditional idea of time travel is not possible. Instead, the author uses quantum mechanics to suggest that other universes exist at the same time as ours, each existing in another time and place.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception {{would have to be}} sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

The primary theme for the series is friendship and [...] "growing older." [...] Philip Glenister elaborated, saying <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> [...] "a group of blokes hitting their 40s and having a jolly-up, {{that would have been}} boring" [...] but is [...] "an undercurrent of something a bit darker", and [...] "about reaching a stage in life, looking at what you've achieved and where you go next, it's about how normal people deal with a certain situation and how they can implode".|$|E
500|$|Somalia was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Mohamed Daud Mohamed, a 5000 metres runner. It marked his first appearance at an international athletics competition, following a transition into athletics from football. He said prior to the Olympics, [...] "I am improving by the day and I hope to improve on my finish time. Running is hard and all athletes aim to win. My objective is to win; but there are different ways of winning. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> being first, second or third. If I set a new personal record, it is a win for me". Mohamed competed on 17 August in the first heat of the 5000 metres, finishing in 24th position out of the 25 runners, only ahead of Rosefelo Siosi of the Solomon Islands, thus eliminating him from the competition.|$|E
500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2004 interview, Guthrie {{spoke about}} spirituality {{and the role}} it plays {{in his life and}} on Outlasting the Blues. I'm not a big fan of overly happy spirituality ... Life ain’t happy all the time. For me, spirituality <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> being happy. <b>It's</b> about what to do when times <b>are</b> tough, <b>not</b> just for you {{personally}} but for everybody. There are times when disasters strike ... So, for me, spirituality is what to do about that, and then what to do in your own personal life when you're confronting things that hurt, things that ain't fun. Outlasting the Blues <b>was</b> <b>about</b> that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> preachin', <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> telling people what's right, although there's {{a little bit about what}} I found was right.|$|R

500|$|Maslin {{called the}} film an {{impressive}} directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, and Klady saying the only failings came when Darabont focused {{for too long}} on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. The Hollywood Reporter said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film's long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film's mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a [...] "bunch of swell and softhearted guys" [...] to cast the prison experience in a [...] "rosy glow". Klady summarized the film as [...] "estimable and haunting entertainment," [...] comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy's and Red's reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. Ebert noted that the story works because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.|$|E
2500|$|Because of his rationalism, Nadir Afonso confronted Kandinsky, {{the father}} of {{abstract}} art, and criticized him for subduing geometry to the human spirit instead of making it the essence of art. This [...] "geometry of art" [...] is not however the [...] "geometry of geometrists", as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> symbols nor anything in particular; rather, it is the spatial law itself, with the four qualities of perfection, harmony, evocation, and originality.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983 the BBC used The King's Hall as {{a setting}} for its 1984 comedy series, Cockles, {{starring}} Joan Sims, {{in which it}} was called the [...] "Marine Pavilion, Cocklesea". During this time the back of the auditorium and bar were filled with props, scaffolding and lighting equipment, causing complaints from the local amateur group, Theatrecraft, as the equipment compromised audience space and therefore revenue. Joan Sims said that although the TV show represents Cocklesea as a run-down resort, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> Herne Bay.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Fellini’s film {{discussed}} below, the {{caricature of}} the Satyricon does not deform the everyday {{life of the}} Roman people. [...] Petronius uses real names for all his characters, most of them laypeople, who talk about the theatre of ancient Rome, the amphitheatre and the circus with the same enthusiasm of today’s fans of football and other team sports. If there is parody in the Satyricon <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the main characters—Encolpius, Giton and Ascyltos—but of the described social reality, and the literary genres of certain famous poets and writers, Homer, Plato, Virgil and Cicero included. Petronius's realism has a Greek antecedent in Aristophanes, who also abandoned the epical tone to focus on ordinary subjects.|$|E
2500|$|... ("One {{that your}} right hands possess" [...] means a slave.) At first glance, {{this can be}} {{interpreted}} in many different ways, depending on one's agenda. However, {{it is important to}} understand the verse in context of both the Qur'an as well as the historical context when it was revealed. These Verses were revealed after the Battle of Uhud, in which many Muslim men were killed, leaving widows and orphans. Thus, many argue that these Verses have been revealed [...] "because of Allah's concern for the welfare of women and orphans who were left without husbands and fathers who died fighting for the Prophet and for Islam. It is a verse about compassion towards women and their children; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> men or their sexuality." ...|$|E

5000|$|Margaret Wilkerson, an {{acclaimed}} African-American {{historian and}} playwright, criticized the play because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "black experience." [...] Sidney Brustein, a white, Jewish male, {{is the main}} character. Hansberry's only African-American character is Alton. Sidney has deep connection with his Judaism, and with that connection comes an understanding of oppression, which connects him with the oppressed African Americans of that time period. This connection is represented in Sidney's feelings for Alton.|$|R
2500|$|A {{focal point}} of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 disco hit [...] "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?", which was {{atypical}} of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics. In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become [...] "tarty", has defended the lyrics {{by pointing out that}} the song is a third-person narrative slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> him. The song's refrain was identical to Brazilian Jorge Ben Jor's earlier [...] "Taj Mahal" [...] and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from [...] "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" [...] to UNICEF, and he performed it with his band at the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in 1979.|$|E

[...] Addressing the racial dust-up and the other campaign back-and-forths between himself and the Clintons, he said, [...] "The choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders.

[...] Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; {{that he had not}} stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that [...] "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS" [...] was intended to be—and was regarded as—purely a humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption.
