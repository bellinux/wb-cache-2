5|$|Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) was a British natural philosopher, Dissenting clergyman, {{political}} theorist, theologian, and educator. He is {{best known}} for <b>his</b> <b>discovery,</b> simultaneously with Antoine Lavoisier, of oxygen gas.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{recognition}} for Priestley's work {{is marked by}} a National Historic Chemical Landmark designation for <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> of oxygen, made on 1 August 1994, at the Priestley House in Northumberland, Penn., by the American Chemical Society. Similar international recognition was made on 7 August 2000, at Bowood House in Wiltshire, UK.|$|E

In 1981, he discovered 3102 Krok, a near-Earth {{object of the}} Apollo group.

5|$|For <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> of the neutron, Chadwick {{was awarded}} the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. <b>His</b> <b>discovery</b> of the neutron made it {{possible}} to produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{initially}} named <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), but {{the names}} that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius. Marius discovered the moons independently {{at the same}} time as Galileo, and gave them their present names, which were suggested by Johannes Kepler, in his Mundus Jovialis, published in 1614.|$|E

5|$|Hordern's mother, Margaret Murray, was {{descended from}} James Murray, an Irish {{physician}} whose research into digestion led to <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> {{of the stomach}} aid milk of magnesia in 1829.

By means of Iorga's {{academic}} journal Revista Istorică, he also publicized <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> of a 17th-century Romanian glossary, which emissaries of the Holy See used on their missions to the Danubian Principalities. He returned in 1927 with a work tracing the very history of the Legislative Council: Originea și menirea Consiliului Legislativ ("The Origin and Purpose of the Legislative Council").|$|E
5|$|Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler is {{credited}} with the first synthesis of DDT (DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane) in 1874. The insecticidal properties of DDT were identified in 1939 by chemist Paul Hermann Müller of Geigy Pharmaceutical. For <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods, {{he was awarded the}} 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the fall of 1942, samples of the chemical were acquired by the United States, Britain and Germany. Laboratory tests demonstrated that it was highly effective against many insects.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name <b>his</b> <b>discovery,</b> Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{initially}} called <b>his</b> <b>discovery</b> the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), {{in honour of}} Cosimo II de' Medici (1590–1621). At Cosimo's suggestion, Galileo {{changed the}} name to Medicea Sidera ("the Medician stars"), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo, and Lorenzo). The discovery was announced in the Sidereus Nuncius ("Starry Messenger"), published in Venice in March 1610, {{less than two months}} after the first observations.|$|E
