500|$|The CPC's {{organizational}} {{principle is}} democratic centralism, {{which is based}} on two principles; democracy (synonymous in official discourse with [...] "socialist democracy" [...] and [...] "inner-party democracy") and centralism. This has been the guiding organizational principle of the party since the 5th National Congress, held in 1927. In the words of the party constitution, [...] "The Party is an <b>integral</b> <b>body</b> organized under its program and constitution and on the basis of democratic centralism". Mao once quipped that democratic centralism was [...] "at once democratic and centralized, with the two seeming opposites of democracy and centralization united in a definite form." [...] Mao claimed that the superiority of democratic centralism lay in its internal contradictions, between democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline. Currently, the CPC is claiming that [...] "democracy is the lifeline of the Party, the lifeline of socialism". But for democracy to be implemented, and functioning properly, there needs to be centralization. The goal of democratic centralism was not to obliterate capitalism or its policies but instead it is the movement towards regulating capitalism while involving socialism and democracy. [...] Democracy in any form, the CPC claims, needs centralism, since without centralism there will be no order. According to Mao, democratic centralism [...] "is centralized on the basis of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance. This is the only system that can give full expression to democracy with full powers vested in the people's congresses at all levels and, at the same time, guarantee centralized administration with the governments at each level exercising centralized management of all the affairs entrusted to them by the people's congresses at the corresponding level and safeguarding whatever is essential to the democratic life of the people".|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 1920s {{the efforts to}} unify a boat and an {{automobile}} mostly came down to simply putting wheels and axles on a boat hull, or getting a rolling chassis to float by blending a boat-like hull with the car's frame. One of the first reasonably well documented cases was the 1905 amphibious petrol-powered carriage of T. Richmond (Jessup, Iowa, USA). Just like the world's first petrol-powered automobile (1885, Carl Benz) it was a three-wheeler. The single front wheel provided direction, both on land and in the water.

50|$|Midland Electric milk floats were {{produced}} by Midland Vehicles Ltd of Leamington Spa. Their first design was a 10-15 cwt chassis, which {{was launched in}} January 1937. It was designed by J Parker Garner, {{who at the time}} was a well-known designer, having been involved in the manufacturing of vehicles for a number of years. In early 1938, Midland added a model B20 to their range, which was designed for a 20 cwt payload, but was otherwise very similar to the earlier model. It was showcased at the British Industries Fair, held at Castle Bromwich in February. The vehicle on display consisted of a chassis and a van body which had been cut in half, so that visitors to the show could see both the look of the vehicle and the construction of the chassis. By 1943, Midland Electric were producing five models, which could be fitted with various types of bodywork, including a flat-bed truck for coal deliveries. The B12 catered for a payload of 10-12 cwt, the BA12 for 12-15 cwt, the B20 for 18-22 cwt, the B25 for 25-28 cwt, with the largest model, the B30, suitable for 30-35 cwt. They produced a new 10-cwt lightweight design in 1949, which features an all-welded chassis with an <b>integral</b> <b>body</b> frame. The 10-cwt model was called the Midland Vandot when it was showcased at an exhibition in 1953, organised by the Electric Vehicle Association and the South Eastern Electricity Board. The company was listed in a 1956 directory of electric vehicle manufacturers published in Commercial Motor, but the company closed in 1957.|$|E
