40|$|NOTE: This {{document}} will be periodically {{updated with}} new terms. Anomaly – is a {{deviation from the}} norm or average. Arbitrage – is {{taking advantage of a}} price differential. The two most common types of arbitrage related to food security are spatial arbitrage (where commodities are moved from areas or markets with lower prices to areas or markets with higher prices and the difference exceeds the transfer costs) and temporal arbitrage (where commodities are obtained, stored and sold at a point in the future when prices are expected to be higher and the difference exceeds the costs associated with the temporal transfer. Assembly market – is a market where smaller quantities of a commodity are accumulated or aggregated usually from different farmers and small scale traders. Assembly markets facilitate marketing and the movement of commodities as well as reduce the costs of marketing. They can also enable sellers of smaller surpluses from more remote locations to reach distant buyers. Budget share – is the portion (percentage) of the household budget spent on a given good (maize), service or <b>grouped</b> <b>goods</b> and services (food). This is essentially the same thing as expenditure shares. Commodity – is something tangible, that has value and can be exchanged. Commodities include food and cash crops, livestock, non‐food consumer items and even labor...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} characteristics {{of people who}} brush their teeth (including cleaning dentures) 2 times or more a day, {{which is one of}} the preventive health behaviors, in terms of the condition of receiving medical treatment for lifestyle- related diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), and higher-level functional capacity. The subjects comprised all 1701 individuals aged 40 years or older living in a village in Nara Prefecture. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions on oral health behavior, lifestyle (eating, drinking, smoking, exercise behaviors), current health conditions, and the TMIG index as an index of higher-level functional capacity. A total of 1543 individuals (mean age, 64. 9 years) who submitted the questionnaire were categorized into four groups: A <b>group</b> (<b>good</b> lifestyle ≧ 3 items and toothbrushing ≧ 2 times a day), B <b>group</b> (<b>good</b> lifestyle ≧ 3 items and toothbrushing < 2 times a day), C <b>group</b> (<b>good</b> lifestyle < 3 items and toothbrushing ≧ 2 times a day), and D <b>group</b> (<b>good</b> lifestyle < 3 items and toothbrushing < 2 times a day). A significant difference in the percentages of those who were under medical treatment for DM was found between the men of A group (3. 2 %) and B group (7. 9 %). However, the percentages of those who were under medical treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia were similar among all the groups, regardless of gender. Moreover, significant differences in the percentages of subjects who had a perfect "Intellectual Activity" score, {{which is one of the}} sublevels of the TMIG index, were found between men in the C group (59. 4 %) and the D group (48. 4 %) and between women in the A group (63. 4 %) and the B group (36. 6 %). The higher- level functional capacity may be higher among individuals with toothbrushing ≧ 2 times a day, compared with those with toothbrushing < 2 times a day, if the number of good lifestyle items which individuals practice is similar...|$|R

Warehouse {{management}} systems, particularly distribution warehouse is usually done manually, such as collection of goods entering into the warehouse and <b>grouping</b> <b>goods</b> according to its type. This method is felt less effective and efficient as it can cause a collection of errors due to inaccurate calculations. This problem then becomes the basis of design model of collection of goods system that enter into the warehouse automatically using barcode media, where the barcode contains information of goods. Collection of goods is done by reading a barcode through the barcode scanner that is connected with a Personal Computer connected to the microcontroller to drive the conveyor and sliding motor that controlled by motor drivers for collection and <b>grouping</b> <b>goods</b> according to its type automatically. <b>Goods</b> can be <b>grouped</b> according to its type after collection of goods through the barcode scanner...|$|R

40|$|There {{are always}} {{difficult}} {{day to day}} decisions to be faced when caring for a person with dementia - from knowing {{how to deal with}} wandering to end of life decisions. Many of these decisions are underpinned by value judgments about right and wrong and reflect a particular view of dementia. This book considers these ethical decisions in the context of relationships, treatment, safety and quality of life, offering practical guidance and advice. It draws on the experiences of family carers as well as on existing research and emphasizes the importance of empathy and the need to acknowledge different perspectives in order to reach the best decision for the person with dementia. In particular the authors discuss the way that decision makers are themselves changed by the decisions they make, and the impact of this on the decision-making process. This book should be read by all those who work caring for people with dementia.
