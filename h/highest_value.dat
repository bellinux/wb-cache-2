5|$|Samarium (and its sesquioxide) are {{paramagnetic}} at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2µB, are the 3rd lowest {{among the}} lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They {{can also be}} doped between the C60 molecules in the fullerene solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56K, which is the <b>highest</b> <b>value</b> achieved so far in this series.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 230, the fourth <b>highest</b> <b>value</b> on record, behind only the 1893, 2005, and 1933 seasons. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of}} the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, such as the fourth hurricane, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, such as the Miami hurricane and Havana, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39mph (63km/h), which is tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an ACE rating of approximately 165 units, the highest since 2005, and the eleventh <b>highest</b> <b>value</b> since 1944 at the time. Broadly speaking, ACE {{is a measure}} of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Igor, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39mph (63km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included in the count. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC re-examines the data and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the original value.|$|E

In order to achieve this, literature on <b>high</b> <b>value</b> manufacturing and organisational transformation is reviewed; Highland Spring Limited transformation story is described, including the research methods used; and finally, Highland Spring's transformation story is analysed and discussed.

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{continued}} decline in the traditional Gaelic heartlands, today no civil parish in Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 65% (the <b>highest</b> <b>value</b> is in Barvas, Lewis, with 64.1%). In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the <b>highest</b> <b>value</b> is in Ardnamurchan, Highland, with 19.3%). Out {{of a total of}} 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in 7 parishes, exceeds 25% in 14 parishes, and exceeds 10% in 35 parishes. Decline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the country's 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), Aberdeen City (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208).

40|$|The {{formalism}} {{for evaluating}} first strike costs and incentives for military targeting generalize to include <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> targets. That introduces two new allocations {{to the usual}} allocation between missiles and military targets, {{but they can be}} performed analytically. As the number of weapons on each side decreases, the optimal fraction of second strike weapons allocated to military values falls. The shift to <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets is more pronounced below about 1, 000 weapons for nominal parameters. Below 500 weapons the first striker's cost of action drops below its cost of inaction. A strike would induce a second strike of about 250 weapons on <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets. An increase in the first striker's preference for damage to the other's <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets increases or a decrease in its preference for preventing damage to its own <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets decreases first strike costs and stability margins. Including defenses complicates allocations slightly. The main effect is increased attrition of second strikes, particularly at larger defenses, which makes it possible to significantly reduce damage to <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets. At 1, 000 weapons, by 300 to 400 interceptors the first striker's costs are reduced to 30 % below that of inaction and the number of weapons delivered on the first striker's <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets is reduced to about 100...|$|R
