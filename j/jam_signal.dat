The signal {{is subject to}} pulsednoise jamming, when either the desired signal alone or the desired <b>signal</b> and the <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> are subject to Nakagami fading. As expected, the implementation of forward error correction (FEC) coding with soft decision decoding (SDD) and maximumlikelihood detection improves performance as compared to uncoded signals. In addition, the combination of maximum-likelihood detection and error correction coding renders pulsed-noise jamming ineffective as compared to barrage noise jamming. When the <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> encounters fading as well, {{we assume that the}} average jamming power is much greater than the AWGN power. For uncoded <b>signals,</b> a <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> that experiences fading actually improves performance when the parameter of the information signal s m is {{less than or equal to}} one. Surprisingly, for larger values of s m a <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> that experiences fading works in favor of the information signal only for small signal-tointerference ratio (SIR). When SIR is large, performance when the <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> experiences fading is worse relative to performance when the <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> does not experience fading. For error correction coding with SDD, we investigate only continuous jamming since it is by far the worst-case.

The half-duplex device ceases its current data transmission, sends a <b>jam</b> <b>signal</b> instead and then retries later as per CSMA/CD. This results in the full-duplex side receiving an incomplete frame with CRC error or a runt frame. It does not detect any collision since CSMA/CD is disabled on the full-duplex side. As a result, when both devices are attempting to transmit at (nearly) the same time, the packet sent by the full-duplex end will be discarded and lost due to an assumed collision and the packet sent by the half duplex device will be delayed or lost due to a CRC error in the frame.|$|E

50|$|A {{network hub}} is an unsophisticated device in {{comparison}} with a switch. As a multiport repeater it works by repeating bits (symbols) received from one of its ports to all other ports. It is aware of physical layer packets, that is it can detect their start (preamble), an idle line (interpacket gap) and sense a collision which it also propagates by sending a <b>jam</b> <b>signal.</b> A hub cannot further examine or manage any of the traffic that comes through it: any packet entering any port is rebroadcast on all other ports. A hub/repeater has no memory to store any data in - a packet must be transmitted while it is received or is lost when a collision occurs (the sender should detect this and retry the transmission). Due to this, hubs can only run in half duplex mode. Consequently, due to a larger collision domain, packet collisions are more frequent in networks connected using hubs than in networks connected using more sophisticated devices.|$|E
