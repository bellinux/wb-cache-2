5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central <b>highlands.</b> Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the <b>highlands</b> around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern <b>highlands,</b> then later in the northern <b>highlands</b> of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the conquest}} the <b>highlands</b> of Guatemala were {{dominated}} by several powerful Maya states. In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish the K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan <b>Highlands</b> and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K'iche' allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'. Other highland groups included the Tz'utujil around Lake Atitlán, the Mam in the western <b>highlands</b> and the Poqomam in the eastern <b>highlands.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} <b>Highlands</b> and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The <b>highlands</b> are further divided into the Northwest <b>Highlands</b> and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England ran. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width and, because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional government. However, the Southern Uplands, and particularly the <b>Highlands</b> were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. The Uplands and <b>Highlands</b> had a relatively short growing season, in the extreme case of the upper Grampians an ice free season of four months or less and for much of the <b>Highlands</b> and Uplands of seven months or less. The early modern period also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, with 1564 seeing thirty-three days of continual frost, where rivers and lochs froze, leading to a series of subsistence crisis until the 1690s.|$|E

5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. The Maya <b>highlands</b> extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the <b>highlands</b> were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern <b>highlands,</b> a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The <b>highlands</b> extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the <b>highlands</b> and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This {{cessation}} in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western <b>highlands</b> combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central <b>Highlands</b> Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central <b>Highlands.</b> Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central <b>Highlands</b> could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central <b>Highlands</b> Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central <b>highlands</b> from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central <b>highlands</b> between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the <b>highlands</b> by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E

5|$|In March 1975 the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) 4th Corps {{staged a}} {{large-scale}} offensive, known as Campaign 275, {{with the aim}} of capturing the Central <b>Highlands</b> from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in order to kick-start the first stage of the 1975 Spring Offensive. Within ten days, the North Vietnamese destroyed most South Vietnamese military formations in II Corps Tactical Zone, exposing the severe weaknesses of the South Vietnamese Army. For South Vietnam, the defeat at Ban Me Thuot and the disastrous evacuation from the Central <b>Highlands</b> came about as a result of two major mistakes. Firstly, {{in the days leading up}} to the assault on Ban Me Thuot, ARVN Major General Pham Van Phu repeatedly ignored intelligence which showed the presence of several North Vietnamese combat divisions around the district. Secondly, President Nguyen Van Thieu's strategy to withdraw from the Central <b>Highlands</b> was poorly planned and implemented.|$|E

5|$|In the Scottish <b>Highlands,</b> popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the <b>Highlands</b> was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture.
