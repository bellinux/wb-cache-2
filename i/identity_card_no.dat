50|$|After the Second World War the {{government}} of Clement Attlee decided to continue the scheme {{in the face of}} the Cold War and the perceived Soviet threat, though it grew ever less popular. In the mind of the public it was more and more associated with bureaucratic interference and regulation, reflected, most particularly, in the 1949 comedy film Passport to Pimlico. <b>Identity</b> <b>cards</b> also became the subject of a celebrated civil liberties case in 1950.

5000|$|Since West Berlin {{was not a}} {{sovereign}} state, it did not issue passports. Instead, West Berliners were issued with [...] "auxiliary identity cards" [...] by the West Berlin authorities. These differed visually from the regular West German <b>identity</b> <b>cards,</b> with green bindings instead of the grey standard, they did not show the [...] "Federal Eagle" [...] or coat of arms, and did not contain any indications as to the issuing State. However, they did have a statement that the holder of the document was a German citizen. From 11 June 1968, East Germany made it mandatory that West Berlin and West German [...] "transit passengers" [...] obtain a transit visa, issued upon entering East Germany, because under its second constitution East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners as foreigners. Since <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> had <b>no</b> pages to stamp visas, issuers of East German visas stamped their visas onto separate leaflets which were loosely stuck into the <b>identity</b> <b>cards,</b> which, until the mid-1980s, were little booklets. Although the West German government subsidized visa fees, they were still payable by individual travellers.|$|R

40|$|Without a birth certificate, <b>no</b> <b>identity</b> <b>card</b> can {{be issued}} and without <b>identity</b> <b>card,</b> there is <b>no</b> access to formal {{financial}} services. This link {{seems to be}} trivial in industrialized countries, where {{the ability of the}} individual to participate in economic life is rarely hindered by a lack of identification. In many developing countries, however, access to financial services is often denied, because potential customers cannot be identified based upon official identity documents-a basic due diligence requirement under international anti-money laundering regulations. In many developing and emerging countries, poor people have no opportunity to obtain such documents, as {{a large portion of the}} population has not been registered at birth. Without a birth certificate, however, <b>no</b> <b>identity</b> <b>card</b> can be issued, which is required by banks for customer identity verification. To date, the problem of identification has not played a prominent role in research concerning access to financial services. In the past, researchers have primarily focused on microfinance. In order to expand access to formal financial services, new methods for customer identification must be developed which address the realities in developing countries. Initial steps to expand access for the poor population have already been taken in countries such as India and South Africa. Aside from addressing problems associated with missing identification, it is also necessary to introduce basic financial products such as micro accounts, where the low risk associated with them is taken into account. Less demanding identification means for low-risk financial products ought to be internationally recognized and instituted in order to dispel legal ambiguities. ...|$|R
