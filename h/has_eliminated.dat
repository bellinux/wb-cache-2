5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add iodine to the diet <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|There are {{localized}} {{versions of}} the Whopper in several of its international operations, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper.

5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Joaquín {{purchased}} land on {{the outskirts}} of Guadalajara with the intent of forming a small community made up exclusively by members of LLDM. The land was then sold at reduced prices to church members. The community included most necessities; services provided in Hermosa Provincia included health, education, and other urban services, which were provided in full after six years partly with help that the Church received from municipal and non-municipal authorities. This dependency upon outside assistance to obtain public services ended by 1959 when residents formed the Association of Colonists of Hermosa Provincia, which was used to directly petition the government. Hermosa Provincia received a white flag from the city for being the only neighborhood in the city that <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> illiteracy by the early 1970s. Joaquín started missionary efforts in Central America and by the early 1960s, La Luz del Mundo had 64 congregations and 35 missions. By 1964, after his death, the Church had between 20,000 and 30,000 members spread through five countries, including Mexico. The neighborhood became a standard model for the Church which has replicated it in many cities in Mexico and other countries.|$|E

Run of the river projects have continued to be built, such as the 695MW Keeyask Project in Canada which began construction in 2014. The absence of a reservoir results in both seasonal and annual variations in electricity generated.|$|E
25|$|Many partially-worked hand axes do {{not require}} further work {{in order to be}} {{effective}} tools. They can be considered to be simple hand axes. Less suitable tool stone requires more thorough working. In some specimens the cortex is unrecognisable due to the complete working that it has undergone, which <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> any vestige of the original cortex.|$|E
25|$|The {{fear and}} the {{collective}} response to these epidemics would give rise to extraordinary public reaction and mobilization; spurring {{the development of new}} methods to prevent and treat the disease, and revolutionizing medical philanthropy. Although the development of two polio vaccines <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> poliomyelitis in all but two countries, the legacy of poliomyelitis remains, in the development of modern rehabilitation therapy, and in the rise of disability rights movements worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{certifies}} {{countries as}} <b>having</b> <b>eliminated</b> maternal or neonatal tetanus.

In 2000, an attempt was made to count indigenous ethnicities, regardless of language spoken. This count ranked Puebla as fifth with a total population of 957,650. However, according to the 2005 census, there were 548,723 people who spoke an indigenous language.|$|E
25|$|Pine {{restoration}} {{has been}} attempted {{dating back to}} 1902, but with limited success. Fire suppression in the area <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> wildfires in the park since the 1920s. Fire is necessary to the regeneration of white, red, and jack pines in the area because it opens the forest floor and canopy for new trees to grow. An overpopulation of white-tailed deer also stunt the regeneration efforts of these pines, as deer browse young pine seedling and prevent them from maturing into trees.|$|E

25|$|Passenger yards are at Long Branch and Bay Head. Long Branch Yard {{is fully}} electrified, and mostly interlocked. Bay Head {{contains}} a large balloon (circular looping) track where entire trains can reverse direction without backing up or uncoupling the locomotive, and obviating {{the need for}} a turntable. It remains in service, even though push-pull operation <b>has</b> <b>eliminated</b> the need for turning of trains. Bay Head Yard has no interlocking; all switches are hand-operated. A yard and sidings formerly existed at South Amboy, dating back to when electrification ended there, but have been removed; trains terminating at South Amboy can be bypassed by using the other track, as the new station has a single island platform.|$|E

An offer of free X-rays was presented to 300 breeders to find a folded cat with healthy hind legs but it was never taken up. A similar offer was set up by the World Cat Federation together with researcher Leslie Lyons but there was also no response. FiFe stated that they will not consider recognizing Scottish Folds if breeders will not allow their breed to be scrutinized.|$|E
25|$|The Holocaust {{has been}} {{explained}} away officially as merely {{the relocation of}} the Jewish population into areas of Eastern Europe where communications and transport networks are still very poor.

Some surviving Jews escaped to Soviet territory, where they have provided testimony of the extermination efforts - while Nazi authorities decry this as Bolshevik propaganda, the outside world {{is aware of the}} Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral so as not to further damage relations, and refers only to vague 'human rights violations' he wishes to investigate while visiting Berlin.|$|E
