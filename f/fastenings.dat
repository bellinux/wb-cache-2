5|$|Atherton, {{the third}} largest retail centre in the Wigan Borough, has a small {{pedestrian}} shopping centre. Most shops front onto Market Street and date from late Victorian times, the majority operated by small independent retailers, {{although there is a}} supermarket that brings customers into the town centre. Older, low cost, mostly terraced housing, surrounds the centre of town. Bolts and <b>fastenings</b> are still manufactured in Atherton by Smith Bullough, one of a few remaining bolt and nut manufacturers in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The tugs {{took the}} hulk of the Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking {{advantage}} of the beginning of the slack water. They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other <b>fastenings</b> to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced <b>fastenings.</b> Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

25|$|Slip-ons: There are no lacings or <b>fastenings.</b> The popular loafers {{are part}} of this category, as well as less popular styles, such as elastic-sided shoes.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{thickness}} of the leather, the seams of these coats were all butt-jointed, with hidden or partially hidden stitches. Extant examples are lined, either with coarse linen or silk. Many high quality examples show apparent <b>fastenings</b> of gold or silver tape at the front, however, these were merely decorative, the real <b>fastenings</b> being hidden hooks and eyes attached {{to the inside of the}} join. The extant collection of buff coats preserved at Littlecote House dating to 1649-1660, contains examples with leather varying from 0.06 to 0.22 inches (1.5 to 5.5 millimeters) in thickness and entire coats weighing between 4lb 4oz and 7lb 8oz (1.9 to 3.4 kilograms).|$|E
25|$|At 350 tons, Nantucket was {{the first}} Nantucket Island ship built of Live oak with copper <b>fastenings.</b> The {{construction}} cost for the vessel was $52,000. Nantucket's short life ended when she was wrecked in 1859.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} two torcs made from single twisted bars of gold, a British style. One is complete, with a {{diameter}} of 18.6cm, the other a semi-circular fragment. Despite unusual hook-in-loop <b>fastenings</b> and other features, these are probably imports from what is now south-eastern England.|$|E
25|$|Also {{built in}} 1838 of live oak and copper <b>fastenings</b> was the whaler 'Lexington' at 399 tons. She was valued at $24,000 and ended her life when wrecked in 1859. Mrs. Eliza Spenser Brock wrote a {{detailed}} and important {{history of a}} whaling voyage when she accompanied he husband, and Lexington's captain, on a Lexington whaling voyage in 1853.|$|E
25|$|Jeans, made of denim, are {{a form of}} {{trousers}} {{for casual}} wear, now widely worn {{all over the world}} by both sexes. Shorts are often preferred in hot weather or for some sports and also often by children and adolescents. Trousers are worn on the hips or waist and may be held up by their own <b>fastenings,</b> a belt or suspenders (braces).|$|E
25|$|Roach {{thereafter}} began canvassing {{the local}} shipyards for business. Although New York's shipbuilders {{were still at}} this time constructing mostly wooden sailing ships, each ship needed about forty pounds of iron <b>fastenings</b> and cables, {{in addition to a}} number of anchors. In one ninety-day period, Roach made a profit from such sales of $8,000, giving his business a solid foundation.|$|E
25|$|Schiaparelli {{was also}} renowned for her unusual buttons, which could {{resemble}} candlesticks, playing card emblems, ships, crowns, mirrors and crickets; or silver tambourines and silk-covered carrots and cauliflowers. Many of these <b>fastenings</b> {{were designed by}} Jean Clemént and Roger Jean-Pierre who also created jewellery for her. In 1936 Schiaparelli {{was one of the}} first people to recognise the potential of Jean Schlumberger who she originally employed as a designer of buttons.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 1980 at 06:29 local time, a Vickers Viscount of Far Eastern Air Transport (registered PK-IVS) crashed near Jakarta {{during a}} {{scheduled}} passenger flight from Banjarmasin that was operated {{on behalf of}} Bouraq, killed 31 passengers and 6 crew on board. The pilots had {{lost control of the}} aircraft whilst approaching Soekarno–Hatta International Airport when the right elevator broke off. It was later determined that the <b>fastenings</b> had exceeded their lifetime by a factor of three without having been substituted during maintenance checkups.|$|E
25|$|Northern and {{southern}} Albanians each had {{several types of}} xhamadan, which differed in color and cut. Northern Albanians would usually wear a xhamadan of red velvet, embroidered in black silk or, sometimes, gold. The quality of the embroidery itself indicates social rank. In particular, the xhamadan worn by Albanians {{in the region of}} Tetovo (now R. Macedonia), is white, or creamy, and richly embroidered. It is sleeveless, and open on the chest, but it can be closed, with special <b>fastenings.</b> It has been a tradition that the bridegroom would wear it on his wedding day.|$|E
25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such <b>fastenings</b> or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
25|$|Rome's {{governing}} elite produced laws {{designed to}} limit {{public displays of}} personal wealth and luxury. None were particularly successful; the same wealthy elite had an appetite for luxurious clothing. Exotic fabrics were available, at a price; silk damasks, translucent gauzes, cloth of gold, and intricate embroideries; and vivid, expensive dyes such as saffron yellow or Tyrian purple. Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. The <b>fastenings</b> and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display.|$|E
25|$|The barge Lady of the Lea {{was built}} of wood in Rotherhithe in 1931 by boat-builders Hyam & Oliver (who {{operated}} {{well into the}} 1960s) for the War Department, following the original plans of canal barges from a century earlier. She was built small enough to pass under the low bridges of the River Lea and Bow Creek in London and was originally tiller steered and stumpy rigged, without top mast or topsail. The bottom was built of pine (doubled up) and the sides of oak and elm with copper <b>fastenings</b> and brass knees. Unusually, the sails were white and not the normal russet colour (of other Thames barges). Her original tonnage and dimensions are not known.|$|E
25|$|Each {{student is}} allowed to bring a cat, toad, rat or owl. Along with the {{acceptance}} letter, first-year students are sent a list of required equipment which includes a wand, subject books, a standard size 2 pewter cauldron, a set of brass scales, a set of glass or crystal phials, a kit of basic potion ingredients (for Potions), and a telescope (for Astronomy). The Hogwarts uniform consists of plain work robes in black, a plain black hat, a pair of protective gloves, and a black winter cloak with silver <b>fastenings.</b> Each uniform must contain the wearer's nametag. First years are not allowed a broomstick of their own, though an exception to this rule is made for Harry {{in his first year}} after he demonstrates an excellent ability as a Seeker in Quidditch.|$|E
25|$|Shipwreck D {{provided}} {{the team with}} an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction {{during a time of}} transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no mortise and tenon <b>fastenings,</b> and no sewing. Shipwreck D {{may be one of the}} earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{traditional}} shirt has long tails, extending {{almost to the}} knees at the back, and so has seven or eight buttons. The vertical strip of fabric running down the front opening is called the placket, and gives a more symmetrical appearance to the joint between the left side, on top, and the right. This left over right order is also seen in waistcoat and coat <b>fastenings,</b> though women's clothing buttons the other way (right over left). The buttonholes, aligned vertically, are placed on the placket, though the top button and buttons {{at the bottom of}} stiff fronts are aligned horizontally. The buttonholes {{are one of the few}} places where the difference between hand and machine stitching can be observed while the shirt is being worn, and fashion designers sometimes use contrasting thread here or on the buttons themselves for extra impact.|$|E
25|$|As tailcoats evolved rapidly {{among the}} wealthy during the Regency period, various styles of closure saw popularity, from <b>fastenings</b> at the top, the middle, or even hanging open. The turn-down collar popular on earlier {{garments}} like the frock was succeeded by long lapels folded down to below the waist (fashionably tightly nipped in). Invariably, there were long rows of buttons down the front, {{most of which}} did not fasten; in fact even into the late Victorian era, all frock coats had a long row of button holes on the lapel, long since obsolete. As buttoning styles changed, the loosely folded front of the coat correspondingly shifted shape, and the V then formed by {{the meeting of the}} fold and the collar continues now in the traditional shape of notched and peaked lapels, both of which originate from that period.|$|E
500|$|The {{monument}} is {{endangered by}} the climate (which has caused damage by frost and rain) and by air pollution. Although in 1990 {{the area around}} the monument was pedestrianized, there are still three streets carrying traffic around it. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument. In addition, water has caused cracking of the reinforced concrete core and rusting of its steel reinforcements and the <b>fastenings</b> of the monument, which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic. [...] The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as moss and lichens. Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument. To prevent its further decay some of the <b>fastenings</b> were replaced with polyurethane filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.|$|E
500|$|Infantry {{units in}} 1809 {{wore a black}} polrock or [...] "Polish coat", a type of frock coat derived from a Lithuanian garment called a litewka which had six pairs of black lace <b>fastenings</b> down the front. A tall collar showed the regimental colour. Trousers were black with a blue stripe; {{footwear}} was black shoes with buttoned gaiters. They wore a shako on their heads, with the skull or a hunting horn badge for light infantry, also a black feather or horsehair plume. The shako, backpack and other equipment were of Austrian design and manufacture. The Sharpshooter companies wore a dark green Prussian-style coatee and a tall hat of Austrian origin with an elongated brim turned-up at one side. In the Peninsular War, the polrock {{was replaced by a}} short black koller or cavalry-style tunic. Equipment and badges of rank were of British pattern.|$|E
2500|$|A screw steamer, United States was {{brigantine}} rigged (square rigged on the foremast and fore-and-aft rigged on the mainmast). She had {{a medium}} model, iron strapped, wood hull with three decks, a round stern, and deck saloons. She was built of white oak and cedar. Her <b>fastenings</b> were copper alloy (probably copper and zinc) and iron {{and she had}} a copper bottom (probably Muntz Metal, which was 60% copper and 40% zinc, with a trace of iron). She was built under inspection and classed A-1 for insurance purposes. She had a vertical direct action steam engine with two [...] cylinders with a 40-inch piston stroke.|$|E
2500|$|The gyil's {{design is}} similar to the balaba or balafon used by the Mande-speaking Bambara, Dyula and Sosso peoples further west in {{southern}} Mali and western Burkina Faso, as well as the Senoufo people of Sikasso, a region that shares many musical traditions with those of northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called liga attached to a wooden frame, below which hang calabash gourds. [...] Spider web silk covers small holes in the gourds to produce a buzzing sound and antelope sinew and leather are used for the <b>fastenings.</b> [...] The instrument is played with rubber-headed wooden mallets.|$|E
2500|$|Boadicea {{was one of}} a {{batch of}} large frigates ordered in 1795, all of which were the largest of their type, and the {{majority}} of which were to the draught of captured French ships, the Navy then being under the sway of Middleton and the French school of thought, a school supposing that the design of warships in France was of a higher quality. She was built to the design of Imperieuse, a 40-gun ship completed in 1787 and captured in October 1793. [...] Changes were made to the shape of the topsides, and the scantlings and <b>fastenings</b> were strengthened to reflect British practice. She retained her shallow French hull form, and as a result the holds and magazines were considered cramped.|$|E
2500|$|Sparrow-Hawk {{was buried}} in the sand and marsh mud of an Orleans, Massachusetts beach that {{came to be known as}} “Old Ship Harbor”. Her 'grave' was a low oxygen {{environment}} which greatly aided preservation of hull timbers which were described as devoid of worms and barnacles. All metal <b>fastenings</b> had disappeared through oxidation. Her keel and hull timbers were visible from time to time when high winds shifted sand on the beach. Visitors were struck by the long [...] "tail-like" [...] projection from the stern. Although a single fierce storm in this area can move sand to a depth of six feet, it is judged that it took several years for the Sparrow-Hawk to be completely buried. Her burial site retained the name Old Ship Harbor into the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exceptionally}} large Virgin & Child (36 in high) {{known as}} Our Lady of Westminster, sculpted circa 1450 in Nottingham and exported {{from there to}} France, {{can be found in}} the Lady Chapel of Westminster Cathedral, London, whence it was installed after being bought at the Paris Exhibition of 1954. This image still carries numerous traces of its original polychromy, such as the characteristic [...] "daisy pattern" [...] against a dark green ground on the base, red and blue in the garment folds and gilding on the crown and mantle <b>fastenings.</b> This image is very similar stylistically to one found buried in the churchyard of Broughton-in-Craven and may have been from the same workshop. [...] Over a dozen English alabaster statues of the Madonna and Child have been traced, mostly recovered from France; the smallest is 16inches high up to size of the Westminster statue.|$|E
2500|$|Maxentius {{chose to}} make his {{stand in front of}} the Milvian Bridge, a stone bridge that carries the Via Flaminia road across the Tiber River into Rome (the bridge stands today at the same site, {{somewhat}} remodelled, named in Italian Ponte Milvio or sometimes Ponte Molle, [...] "soft bridge"). Holding it was crucial if Maxentius was to keep his rival out of Rome, where the Senate would surely favour whoever held the city. As Maxentius had probably partially destroyed the bridge during his preparations for a siege, he had a wooden or pontoon bridge constructed to get his army across the river. The sources vary as to the nature of the bridge central to the events of the battle. Zosimus mentions it, vaguely, as being constructed in two parts connected by iron <b>fastenings,</b> while others indicate that it was a pontoon bridge; sources are also unclear as to whether the bridge was deliberately constructed as a collapsible trap for Constantine's forces or not.|$|E
2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient <b>fastenings,</b> although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E
2500|$|The La Merced monastery was {{the first}} in the city founded by the Mercedarians from Guatemala in 1537. [...] It was built as a {{fortress}} with barracks for soldiers and space for citizens in case of attack. The church entrance has a massive wooden door with wrought iron hinges and <b>fastenings.</b> There are very few windows and those that exist are built to allow muskets to fire on attackers. The entire structure is built with extensions and abutments to provide for interlocking fields of fire. Entry to the fortifications is denied as too dangerous. The church still functions as such. It consists of a single nave, with interior remodeled in Neoclassical design during the Porfirio Díaz era. The oldest part of the structure is an arch and columns located in the interior of the sacristy, which is decorated in stucco of various colors with floral and vegetative motifs. At the foot of the column, there are two lions symbolizing Spanish domination. [...] In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, the structure was used as a military barracks and in 1960, it was converted into the city jail which it remained until 1993. In 2000 the former monastery was further converted into the Museum of Amber, which has a collection of over three hundred pieces and is the only one of its kind in the Americas.|$|E
