50|$|A <b>jockey</b> <b>wheel</b> is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel used on {{the front}} of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The <b>jockey</b> <b>wheel</b> is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in screw jack to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The screw jack can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The <b>jockey</b> <b>wheel</b> is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} two methods {{employed}} by rear derailleurs to maintain the appropriate gap between the upper <b>jockey</b> <b>wheel</b> and the rear sprockets as the derailleur moves between the large sprockets and the small sprockets.|$|E
50|$|Lucien Charles Hippolyte Juy was a French {{industrialist}} {{who made}} derailleur gears. He {{is credited with}} making the first derailleur with a collapsible parallelogram. A hinged frame swung in and out from the frame and fed the chain to {{one of a number}} of sprockets attached to the hub. Juy's derailleurs, sold as Simplex derailleurs, were novel in having a <b>jockey</b> <b>wheel</b> to correct the tension of the chain as it moved across differently sized sprockets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jockey</b> <b>wheels</b> {{incorporate}} a castor action, permitting travel {{in any direction}} while manhandling a trailer {{while it is not}} attached to a vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|The first steel {{passenger}} vehicle, {{known as}} the Escape Pod, would carry 15 passengers in four rows and weighed around [...] The car was equipped with four large steel road wheels that run on the track, measuring [...] in diameter at the front and [...] at the rear. Smaller <b>jockey</b> <b>wheels</b> run {{on the other side}} of the track such that the track sits between the pairs of wheels.|$|R
50|$|Vollmer {{subsequently}} {{moved to}} Czechoslovakia, {{to join the}} Skoda company for whom he designed a wheel/track light tank, the KH-50 (Kolo-Housenka). This design had roadwheels mounted on the drive sprockets and <b>jockey</b> <b>wheels</b> behind them to support the tracks. Despite impressive specifications for the period - 13 mm armour, 37 mm turret-mounted armament, and a 50 hp engine capable of driving the tank at 8 mph (on tracks) and 22 mph (on wheels) - it {{was rejected by the}} Czech army.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{decision}} to limit funding and staff {{for research and}} development caused running issues with new products. The first sign of trouble came with returns on SunTour's SR MounTech rear derailleur, caused by failures of the innovative spring-loaded <b>jockey</b> <b>wheel</b> that was fitted with a seal that proved inadequate to keep out dirt and mud. In road bicycle components, the company fared no better. SunTour had introduced the SuperbeTech derailleur in 1983 with a streamlined, enclosed parallelogram. However, the design was too fragile, with internal pivots and the return spring failing frequently. It took special tools to repair and reassemble a SuperbeTech derailleur, resulting in many unhappy customers. SunTour no longer had the resources to debug prototype designs before introducing them to the market, which cost the company in returns, repairs, and damaged reputation.|$|E
5000|$|The design, {{developed}} by Shimano, improves on their earlier Uniglide design (which used beveled gear teeth instead of ramps), and was introduced {{as part of}} a commercially viable index shifting system. The Hyperglide ramps, along with laterally floating derailleur <b>jockey</b> <b>wheels,</b> allows for enough [...] "slop" [...] in the system to make indexed shifting reliable, despite variations in shift cable adjustment and manufacturing or assembly tolerances. A Hyperglide freewheel or cassette on a bike with friction shifters can further improve shifting.|$|R
2500|$|External gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The rear derailleur also has spring-mounted <b>jockey</b> <b>wheels</b> which take up any slack in the chain.|$|R
50|$|After World War I the Polish army {{began the}} design of tankettes, light tanks, and armored vehicles, many by Škoda. A German {{engineer}} Joseph Vollmer after the war, joined Škoda and designed a wheel/track light tank, the KH-50 (Kolo-Housenka). This design had roadwheels mounted on the drive sprockets and <b>jockey</b> <b>wheels</b> behind them to support the tracks. During World War I, Vollmer was chief designer for the German War Department's motor vehicle section, and he had designed the World War I German tanks A7V, K-Wagen, LK I and LK II. Despite the new design for the KH-50 (Kolo-Housenka) impressive specifications for the period - 13 mm armour, 37 mm turret-mounted armament, and a 50 hp engine capable of driving the tank at 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) (on tracks) and 22 miles per hour (35 km/h) (on wheels) - it {{was rejected by the}} Czech army.|$|R
