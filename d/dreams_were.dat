5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> a simple subterfuge.|$|E
25|$|Opinions {{about the}} meaning of dreams have varied and shifted through time and culture. Many endorse the Freudian theory of dreams – that dreams reveal insight into hidden desires and emotions. Other {{prominent}} theories include those suggesting that dreams assist in memory formation, problem solving, or simply are a product of random brain activation. The earliest recorded <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> acquired from materials dating back approximately 5000 years, in Mesopotamia, where they were documented on clay tablets. In the Greek and Roman periods, the people believed that <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> direct messages from deities or deceased persons, and that they predicted the future. Some cultures practiced dream incubation with the intention of cultivating dreams that are of prophecy.|$|E
25|$|There is longstanding {{uncertainty}} and scholarly controversy {{over whether the}} Sophistic works of Antiphon and a treatise on the Interpretation of <b>Dreams</b> <b>were</b> also written by Antiphon the Orator, or whether they were written by a separate man known as Antiphon the Sophist. This article only discusses Antiphon the Orator's biography and oratorical works.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> {{successions}} of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations {{that occur}} involuntarily {{in the mind}} during certain stages of sleep (mainly the REM stage).

40|$|Dreams {{and their}} {{meanings}} have challenged man {{for thousands of}} years. Numerous theories of dreams have had their day {{in the sun and}} then died. Among contemporary writers, certain assumptions seem to dominate. The major assumption <b>is</b> that <b>dreams</b> have some meaning. Stemming from this major premise, other assumptions or hypotheses have <b>been</b> advanced. 1. <b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> wish fulfillment. Alternatively, following Freud, <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> the guardian of sleep. 2. <b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> an attempt at problem solving. This has been particularly elaborated by French. 3. <b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> a manifestation of certain psychological processes of which the dreamer is totally unaware; that <b>is,</b> <b>dreams</b> spring from the unconscious. 4. The content of <b>dreams</b> <b>is</b> continuous with the content of the individual’s waking ideation and behavior (Adler). Or the opposite view has been advanced, namely that the content of the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> reciprocal to the waking behavior...|$|R

25|$|Christians mostly {{shared the}} beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> of a supernatural {{character}} because the Old Testament includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most famous of these dream stories was Jacob's dream of a ladder that stretches from Earth to Heaven. Many Christians preach that God can speak to people through their dreams.|$|E
25|$|This {{theory can}} also be {{supported}} by neglect in dreams (Figliozzi et al., 2007). The study was run on a neglect patient by tracking his eye movements while he slept, during the REM cycle. Results showed {{that the majority of}} the eye movements were aimed to his right side, indicating that the images represented in his <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> also affected by hemispatial neglect.|$|E

2500|$|Lucid <b>dreaming</b> <b>is</b> the {{conscious}} perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have {{some degree of}} {{control over their own}} actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. <b>Dream</b> control has <b>been</b> reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> not necessary for a dream to qualify as [...] "lucid" [...] — a lucid <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> any <b>dream</b> during which the dreamer knows they <b>are</b> <b>dreaming.</b> The occurrence of lucid <b>dreaming</b> has <b>been</b> scientifically verified.|$|R
25|$|A <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> a {{succession}} of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and purpose of <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, {{as well as a}} subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout recorded history. <b>Dream</b> interpretation <b>is</b> the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message.

25|$|The Greeks {{shared their}} beliefs with the Egyptians {{on how to}} {{interpret}} good and bad dreams, {{and the idea of}} incubating dreams. Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs about <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the divine message was given.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Ages {{brought a}} harsh {{interpretation}} of dreams. They {{were seen as}} evil, and the images as temptations from the devil. Many believed that during sleep, the devil could fill the human mind with corrupting and harmful thoughts. Martin Luther, founder of Protestantism, believed <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> {{the work of the}} Devil. However, Catholics such as St. Augustine and St. Jerome claimed that the direction of their lives was heavily influenced by their dreams.|$|E

25|$|Who could {{sanction}} me {{to write}} Babi Yar, or my protests against the (1968) Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia? Only I criticised Khrushchev to his face; not even Solzhenitsyn did that. It is only the envy of people who couldn't stand against the propaganda machine, and they invented things about my generation, the artists of the '60s. Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of our <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{dream of}} his own death {{and his mother had}} the same dreams. Since <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> usually prophetic, this {{depressed}} him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except mistletoe—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{contains}} {{descriptions of}} at least twenty <b>dreams</b> that <b>are</b> recalled by Harriet, Monty, Blaise and Harriet's son David.

The subject of <b>dreams</b> <b>is</b> also relevant to Blaise's work as a psychoanalyst.|$|R
6000|$|As a rule such <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> only {{mentioned}} {{after the}} event, {{and so are}} not worth noticing. Very often the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> forgotten by the dreamer till he hears of or sees the event. He is then either reminded of his dream by association of ideas or he has never dreamed at all, and his belief that he has <b>dreamed</b> <b>is</b> only a form of false memory, of the common sensation of [...] "having been here before," [...] which he attributes to an awakened memory of a real dream. Still more often the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> unconsciously cooked by the narrator into harmony with facts.|$|R

25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E
500|$|Sleep and <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> common {{subjects}} for the Zürich-born Henry Fuseli, though The Nightmare is unique among his paintings for {{its lack of}} reference to literary or religious themes (Fuseli was an ordained minister). His first known painting is Joseph Interpreting the Dreams of the Butler and Baker of Pharaoh (1768), and later he produced [...] (1798) inspired by John Milton's Paradise Lost, and Richard III Visited by Ghosts (1798) based on Shakespeare's play.|$|E
500|$|Baker's work {{received}} mixed reviews. His {{only two}} books not specifically gay themed (though containing gay characters and a somewhat gay sensibility), Boy Wonder and Fuel-Injected <b>Dreams,</b> <b>were</b> better received by critics, and more popular with readers, {{though he was}} never a bestselling novelist. Baker himself estimated that his books sold approximately 25,000 copies each. His following book, however, Tim and Pete, met with hostile reviews, primarily for its advocacy of political assassination and terror tactics in combating AIDS discrimination. Baker himself was ambivalent on the subject. [...] "I think assassination does change things ... But I'm not really calling for violence," [...] he said. [...] "It's a novel, not a position paper." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Paper Hearts" [...] {{was written}} {{specifically}} with Tom Noonan {{in mind for}} the role of Roche, and was amongst the first television work the actor had done. Writer Vince Gilligan came up with the concept for the episode [...] when thinking about the series' longest running storyline, the abduction of Samantha Mulder. Gilligan came up with a story questioning whether Samantha had not been abducted by aliens, but was rather murdered by a child killer instead. He decided to help convince Fox Mulder of this through a series of prophetic dreams. The laser lights in Mulder's <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> influenced by Gilligan's experience with laser holograms while he was a film student. The laser {{was supposed to be the}} color blue, but was changed to red in production to reduce costs. Wanting to include some kind of fetish for the killer, Gilligan settled on having Roche cut heart shaped fragments from his victim's clothing, thinking that having him mutilate his victims' bodies would be going too far.|$|E
500|$|Pausch {{then went}} to the first part of his speech, {{explaining}} his childhood dreams and how he accomplished (or tried to accomplish) them. Pausch first explained his childhood, as well as his family life in the 1960s. Pausch stated that he had a [...] "really good childhood", and, when going back through his family archive of photographs, had never found a picture of him not smiling. Some of these pictures were shown on the projection as slides, including one of him dreaming. He explained how he was inspired by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Pausch then transitioned to a slide which contained a list of his childhood dreams, and explained them. His <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> being in zero gravity, playing in the National Football League, being the author of a World Book Encyclopedia article, being Captain Kirk, being [...] "one of the guys who won the big stuffed animals in the amusement park", and becoming a Disney Imagineer.|$|E
500|$|... {{immediately}} {{became evident}} {{to family and}} friends. He was on medication for stomach problems and tightly wound, with any unexpected sound triggering a defensive reflex reaction to an imagined attack. When he slept, {{it was with a}} loaded pistol under his pillow. Recurring nightmares had him reliving the war, repeatedly calling out to individual soldiers. Turning the lights on sometimes brought relief, if only to keep him from falling asleep again. He had waking graphic flashbacks that caused him to freeze, reliving a life-threatening moment on the battlefield. His first wife Wanda Hendrix stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being moved to tears by newsreel footage of German war orphans, guilt-ridden that his war actions might have been the cause of their having no parents. As others had noticed since his return from Europe, Hendrix said his <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> punctuated with the battles he had fought. She tried to coax him into seeking psychiatric help. During a publicity tour in 1952, his dreams caused him to beat the wall of his motel room until his fists bled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> also {{difficult}} to remember, {{with no more}} than 5% to 10% of dreams being remembered the following day. The parts of the <b>dream</b> that <b>are</b> retained the next day likely dissipate overnight. However, <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> not all negative and can have much to say about daily life. Broader possibilities for <b>dreams</b> can <b>be</b> presented by stressing their social aspect. Through this method dreams have a different, but equally important hold on psychoanalysis.|$|R
