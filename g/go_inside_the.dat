5|$|While Agni is the saviour in the Kurma Purana, the Rama-centric Adhyatma Ramayana replaces Agni {{with the}} omniscient Rama as the mastermind. Rama knows of Ravana's {{intentions}} and orders Sita to place her chaya (shadow) outside the hut for Ravana to abduct and <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> hut and live {{hidden in the}} fire for a year; after Ravana's death, she would unite with him again. Sita complies and creates her illusionary form, Maya Sita, and enters the fire. After Maya Sita's seizure, Rama grieves for Sita. It is unclear if Rama pretends to grieve or forgets that Maya Sita is the one actually kidnapped. After Ravana's death, Maya Sita has to face the Agni Pariksha and vanishes in the fire. Agni reinstates Sita and declares that Rama created the illusionary Sita to bring about Ravana's annihilation and with that purpose served, the true Sita returns to Rama. Inspired by Adhyatma Ramayana, the Ramacharitmanas has a very similar narrative; however, Agni Pariskha narrative is longer and Maya Sita is explicitly stated to be destroyed in the fire. The Nepali Bhanubhakta Ramayana by Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814 – 1868) portrays Rama creating the illusionary Sita from the sacred Kusha grass and entrusting Sita to Agni; at Agni Pariksha, the grass Maya Sita turns into ashes while the true Sita reappears before the world. A popular Indian television series Ramayan (1987–88) by Ramanand Sagar reveals that Maya Sita had replaced Sita only in the Agni Pariksha scene and uses flashback to narrate about the exchange.|$|E

This raised eyebrows among the students opposed to the occupation, who demanded an explanation given that access had been denied to university administrators, academics and students not in favour of the occupiers' approach. The main spokesman for the occupying students Ivaylo Dinev claims that Pardew was not permitted to <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> university building by student security (as the students were not fully convinced in the sincerity of his motives), but did speak to three of the student representatives inside the university premises.|$|E

25|$|Medical imaging {{is often}} {{perceived}} to designate {{the set of}} techniques that noninvasively produce images of the internal aspect of the body. In this restricted sense, medical imaging {{can be seen as}} the solution of mathematical inverse problems. This means that cause (the properties of living tissue) is inferred from effect (the observed signal). In the case of medical ultrasonography, the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes that <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> tissue to show the internal structure. In the case of projectional radiography, the probe uses X-ray radiation, which is absorbed at different rates by different tissue types such as bone, muscle and fat.|$|E

Mistress Quickly overhears and quietly vows to thwart Ford's scheme.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the suits were designed using ZBrush. A scan of an actor's body was taken, which was then encased to decipher the fabric, {{the location of the}} foam, amongst other concerns. With a computer numerical cutting of dense foam, a small scale output would be created to perfect fine details before initiating construction of the suit. Upon downloading the participant's body scan, the illustrations were overlaid to provide an output manufacturing element. Describing the computer numerical cutting process, Chris Lavery of Clothes on Film noted that it had a tendency to elicit bubbles and striations. Clark stated: [...] "The [...] suit is all made of a hexagon mesh which we also printed and made the fabric from 3D files. This would go onto the hard form; it would <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> mould which was silicon matrix. We would put those together and then inject foam into the negative space. The wiring harness is embedded into the mould and you get a torso. We then paint it and that’s your finished suit." ...|$|E
500|$|Southampton's fifth round {{match was}} against Norwich City {{at home on}} 5 February 2003. Two goals {{in the space of}} three minutes, scored by Svensson and Tessem was enough to take the team into the quarter-finals. Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam was pleased with the win and said {{following}} the match: [...] "When you get to this stage in the competition you have to believe you can win it." [...] The club then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the following round. Former Wolves player Chris Marsden gave Southampton the lead in the 56th minute and with nine minutes remaining of normal time, the team added a second goal when Tessem's shot took a deflection off Paul Butler's legs to <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> goal net. The victory meant Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} 17 years. At Villa Park, Southampton played First Division team Watford on 13 April 2003. Brett Ormerod opened the scoring two minutes before half time and set up the second goal which the ball was taken over the line by Watford defender Paul Robinson. Despite Marcus Gayle scoring a late header to half the scoreline Southampton won the match.|$|E

He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the one thing is common among all artists, singers, painters, etc., is 'pain,' especially, via a heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since he hasn't yet seen bad times, he won't {{be able to reach}} his idol's (Jim Morrison) level of fame. JJ accidentally sees a beautiful girl rehearsing before a dancing contest called [...] "Shut Up & Dance" [...] when he and his friends go to venue, where the contest is about to start. He goes inside only to see this girl's performance, even though he initially refuses to <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> auditorium. He watches the performance of Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), a Kashmiri Pandit from St. Stephens College, and overhears that she is the [...] "perfect heartbreaking machine". Since JJ wanted to succeed, and he remembers the word of Khatana telling him that pain, especially from heartbreak, is the way to become an artist, he decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he deciphers as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. However, over time, JJ and Heer will become good friends, often going on fun, nasty, naughty, and spicy adventures together and sometimes engaging in behavior which the conservative JJ thinks is risky.|$|E

Belcher and Perkins had been {{introduced}} through Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles, whose wife was a first cousin of Perkins. Perkins had also done volunteer work in the community, and with the Chiefs {{as part of its}} Women's Organization, a group of players' wives and significant others who do charity work and run awareness campaigns. Friends said the couple argued frequently, including after Perkins returned at 1:00 A.M. from a Trey Songz concert at the Midland Theatre on the night of November 30, 2012. After the argument, Perkins went to the Power and Light District, an entertainment area by the Midland and Sprint Center in downtown Kansas City. Belcher was also in the Power and Light District with a different woman. After losing the woman in the crowd, Belcher drove to her apartment, but she was not home at the time. Police found him there at 2:50 A.M., after receiving a 911 call about a suspicious person in a car parked on Armour Boulevard. He told police he was waiting for his girlfriend, and forgot the code to her apartment. The police discussed the temporary tags on the car and urged him to <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building, saying they were [...] "trying to cut [...] a break here." [...] Belcher did not smell of alcohol and was not slurring his words, police said. He was later buzzed into the building by neighbors and allowed to stay the night.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only was}} the {{credibility}} of the main accuser, his mother, and entire family in question, but also that of the many witnesses called to testify in the trial. Prosecution witness Chris Carter, who had been Jackson's bodyguard from August 2002 through August 2003, was arrested in Las Vegas on February 19, 2005, after police searched his mother's house and found a handgun. In addition, he had been accused of robbing a RadioShack in October 2003, a Subway sandwich shop in August 2004, a KB Toys store in January 2005, and a Jack in the Box restaurant in February 2005. He refused to testify. Adrian McManus, a former maid in Neverland and one of the [...] "Neverland Five" [...] who lost their suit against Jackson, was convicted of stealing a sketch of Elvis Presley made by Jackson and selling it to a tabloid for $30,000. Philippe Lamarque, a potential witness who ultimately did not testify, was the host of a porn site called [...] "Virtual Sin." [...] Tapes of a conversation he had with Paul Baressi revealed that for $100,000, Lamarque would say he saw Jackson touch Macaulay Culkin's crotch outside of his shorts, but for $500,000, the hand would <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> shorts. Journalist Matt Taibbi wrote: [...] "The trial featured perhaps the most compromised collection of prosecution witnesses ever assembled in an American criminal case...the chief drama of the trial quickly turned into a race to see if the DA could manage to put all of his witnesses on the stand without getting any of them removed from the courthouse in manacles." ...|$|E
