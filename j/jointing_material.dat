40|$|Concrete block {{pavement}} performance {{depends on}} many factors. <b>Jointing</b> <b>material</b> {{is one of}} the components that affect the performance of concrete block pavement. As there are many coastal areas around the world, then marine sand may replace the river sand as <b>jointing</b> <b>material.</b> The massive availability of marine sand and the ease of transportation make this material to be selected as a replacement for river sand. This paper presents a study of laboratory research of <b>jointing</b> <b>material</b> that was made from marine sand and mixtures of marine sand and Portland cement in comparison with river sand. The pavement was tested by push-in test and pull-out test under circumstance which was wetted condition. Water seepage test and erosion test were also conducted in this study. This research used 3 mm joint width, two cement percentages (6 % and 8 %), and three durations of after rain time (1 day, 3 days, and 7 days).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of modifying aluminum oxide slips with magnesium oxide (MgO) to create a <b>jointing</b> <b>material</b> for In-Ceram ® Alumina. Jointed In-Ceram ® Alumina bars with In-Ceram ® Alumina slips con-taining 0 － 1. 0 mass ％ MgO were examined by a three-point bending test. Joint-free bars were also tested as controls. Fracture surfaces were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, linear shrinkage and fracture toughness were assessed. The 0. 3 mass ％ MgO group showed the highest flexural strength among the jointed groups, and there were no statis-tical differences between the joint-free control groups. The fracture surface of 0. 3 mass ％ MgO group showed increased sintering densification with reduced micropore size. No linear shrinkage was observed with the addition of MgO to the alumina slip. Added MgO was also effective in boosting fracture toughness. The present findings indicate that the MgO-supplemented binding material is useful for clinical applications...|$|E

A current {{research has been conducted}} to investigate fatigue vibration life and response under constant loading of dissimilar <b>joint</b> <b>materials.</b> The investigation focusing on two dissimilar joint Stainless Steel to Mild Steel (SSMS), with two benchmark comparisons of MS-MS and SS-SS. The defined three sets of specimens followed standard test of Tensile, Hardness and Fatigue. The monitoring of fatigue vibration was conducted by using laser Doppler; a nondestructive technique.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} new and traditional surface materials for use in cattle barns. The evaluated concrete materials had different compositions and included different additives and coatings. Contact angle meter, optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy SEM were used for characterization of surface properties. Radiochemical methods and a biochemical adenosine triphosphate ATP method were used to determine cleanability. A specific methodological aim was to examine the correlations between these determination methods. A statistically significant difference was observed between contact angles of non-coated concretes, coated concretes and <b>joint</b> <b>materials.</b> In general, coatings smoothened surfaces and the <b>joint</b> <b>materials</b> were the roughest surfaces, as illustrated by profilometry and SEM. On the basis of the radiochemical determination methods, coatings improved the cleanability of concrete. An epoxy <b>joint</b> <b>material</b> was cleaned efficiently from the oil model soil and from the labelled feed soil when compared to the two cement-based <b>joint</b> <b>materials.</b> According to the results of the biochemical ATP method the manure test soil was cleaned better from a concrete including inorganic sealant than from the other materials examined. The cleanability results of oil model soil used in the radiochemical method correlated with the results of the test feed soil used in the biochemical ATP method. Both determination methods of cleanability appeared to be suitable for examining the cleanability of surfaces soiled with agricultural soils. Only the radiochemical determination gives detailed quantitative results, but it can be used only in laboratory studies. The results of this laboratory study will be used for selecting materials for a pilot study in a cattle barn. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{recent years}} the use of Vacuum Insulation Panels in {{buildings}} applications has been improved, because of their both higher performances and lower thickness compared to traditional insulation materials. These performances are due to the interior vacuum degree, which represent also the main problem connected with the applications of this technological solution in buildings constructions: to maintain the vacuum condition the panels are enclosed in an envelope layer, characterized by an higher thermal conductivity. Moreover {{they have to be}} assembled to each other or to additional different <b>joint</b> <b>materials</b> in practical building application, generating a thermal bridging effect. The aim of present work is to analyse the critical aspects related to this insulation technology for building application.

For determining a critical factor of safety, the direction of the inertial seismic force should be considered vertically downward.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Chlamydia trachomatis and Borrelia burgdorferi {{infections are}} {{frequently}} {{the cause of}} unexplained oligoarthritis, as shown by identification of bacteria specific DNA in <b>joint</b> <b>material</b> from patients with reactive arthritis, Lyme arthritis, and undifferentiated oligoarthritis. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the two organisms occur simultaneously in <b>joint</b> <b>material</b> from patients with arthritis.  METHODS—Seventy six patients with unexplained arthritis were prospectively studied. Synovial fluid was obtained from all patients and examined for DNA from C trachomatis and B burgdorferi using specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. Data concerning prior genitourinary infection or a history of tick bite were recorded and serum antibodies to C trachomatis and B burgdorferi were determined.  RESULTS—Six patients (8 %) had DNA from both C trachomatis and B burgdorferi in the same synovial fluid specimen (mean leucocyte count 11. 925 /mm 3, 65 % granulocytes). These patients (four men, two women; mean age 33. 7  years) all had oligoarthritis of the knee, ankle, or both (mean disease duration 11. 3  months). From the history and serological examination, four patients had some evidence of actual or previous infection with one or other of the bacteria, while the other two patients had a positive serological test for Chlamydia only.  CONCLUSIONS—DNA from two different microorganisms which are known to be triggering agents for arthritis may be present simultaneously in <b>joint</b> <b>material</b> from patients with unexplained oligoarthritis. This finding raises the question as to whether, in such cases, one or both bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease or whether they are only innocent bystanders. ...|$|R

40|$|Accuracy {{of fatigue}} life {{prediction}} of solder <b>joint</b> <b>materials</b> using the {{finite element method}} (FEM) depends on realistic and reliable constitutive models and the FEM procedure itself. The effectiveness and accuracy of a constitutive model to simulate and predict the behavior of materials strongly depends on consistent, reliable and precise experimental data. In this research, a thermomechanical digital image correlation test device has been developed to investigate solder <b>joint</b> <b>material</b> behavior under thermal mechanical and cyclic loading. The test device is composed of two high precision actuators driven by two brushless servo-motors; a vacuum chamber used to prevent the heating and cooling plate from heating and cooling {{the air in the}} vacuum chamber and other components to save the energy needed to heat and cool the specimen; a heating and cooling unit composed of four Peltier devices; a digital correlation deformation and displacement measurement system and various load and displacement sensors. The test device is controlled by Labview. Two closed loop system control programs in Labview were developed to control the device and perform tests under specified loads, displacements and temperature profiles. The temperature, loads, and displacements can be applied manually and automatically. A series of tests such as normal load tests, temperature and rate dependent tests, isothermal mechanical fatigue and thermomechanical fatigue tests have been carried out on 63 Sn/ 37 Pb and 60 Sn/ 40 Pb solder <b>joint</b> <b>materials.</b> The rate and temperature dependent test results are consistent, which shows that newly developed test device is reliable. Material parameters for the HISS and DSC models were computed from the test data, which can be used to investigate the failure mechanism of solder joints in electronic packaging to improve the reliability of electronic packaging. Disturbed State Concept (DSC) constitutive model is a powerful tool for the simulation and prediction of material damage, failure and fatigue. Strain localization and material softening cause negative-semi definite finite element stiffness-matrix, which create numerical difficulties for the calculation of DSC. A new DSC finite element scheme was proposed and implemented to overcome the numerical difficulties. The finite element thermoplastic formulation was modified and implemented based on Drucker's postulate. Thermoplastic deformation and viscoplastic deformation usually happen sequentially or combined. An alternative finite element computational method for viscoplastic problem was proposed and the FE program is modified. Computational examples show the new procedures produce accurate and consistent results and the program is robust. Material parameters for the HISS and DSC models were used to back predict the rate and temperature dependent test results using the modified finite element program. These back predictions showed that the HISS and DSC constitutive models and the FE program can be used to accurately simulate solder <b>joint</b> <b>material</b> behavior and predict solder joint damage and failure...|$|R
