5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary <b>east</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the <b>east</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E
