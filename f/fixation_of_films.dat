40|$|The {{detergents}} are {{a special}} group of nonpolar-polar surface-active organic electrolytes. They reduce the interfacial tension not only between water and air, but also between water and certain organic liquids. Their molecules {{are composed of}} two portions, one polar hydrophilic, which {{has a tendency to}} anchor the molecule to water, and one nonpolar hydrophobic organophilic, which is attracted towards the non-aqueous phase. The result is a molecular orientation at the interface due to the opposing forces. These can be, more or less, in balance according to the strength of the alternative affinities. In general, an increase of hydrophilic affinity in the interracial array of the nonpolar-polar molecules will lead to a stronger pull on the nonaqueous phase toward the water and may have a disintegrating or a dispersing effect. Stronger organophfllc properties on the other hand will favor a wetting action; v/z., the <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> water on the nonaqueous phase or on its separate components.

40|$|Objective: To {{create a}} {{simulation}} model for endoscopically assisted <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the intraoral vertical subsigmoid ramus osteotomy for training purposes. Materials and Methods: A polyurethane {{model of the}} upper and lower jaws in prognathism with or without mandibular asymmetry was created and covered by stretchable rubber material to simulate the cheeks. Vertical subsigmoid ramus osteotomy was performed intraorally in the usual manner. A straight endoscope was used intraorally to monitor and assist in <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the segments through the transbuccal approach. Results: Both monocortical miniplate fixation and bicortical screw <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the vertical subsigmoid ramus osteotomy were feasible using the above model, and enabled satisfactory stability and control of the segments while achieving the planned movements. Conclusion: The simulation model is a useful tool for learning the procedure of endoscopically assisted rigid <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the vertical subsigmoid ramus osteotomy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: Fat-embolism {{syndrome}} and pulmonary dysfunction may develop in multiply injured {{patients who have}} a fracture of a long bone. Although early <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture is beneficial, intramedullary nailing may exacerbate pulmonary dysfunction by causing additional embolization of marrow fat. We examined the pulmonary effects of the timing and method <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture in a canine fat-embolism model. Fat embolism was induced in forty-one adult dogs by reaming the ipsilateral femur and tibia followed by pressurization of the intramedullary canal. The animals were divided into a control group of eight dogs that had induction of fat embolism alone and an experimental group of thirty-three dogs that had induction of fat embolism and internal <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a transverse fracture of {{the middle of the}} contralateral femoral shaft. In the control group, four dogs each were killed four hours and twenty-four hours after induction of fat embolism. In the experimental group, a femoral fracture was created and fixation was performed four hours after embolic showering in fifteen animals and twenty-four hours after embolization in eighteen animals. The two experimental groups were subdivided according to the method <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture: eleven dogs each had application of a plate, nailing without reaming, and nailing with reaming. The pulmonary arterial pressure and the alveolar-arterial gradient were measured preoperatively, during induction of fat embolism, and as long as one hour after <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture but before the animal was killed. The lungs, brain, and kidneys were examined for pathological and physiological evidence of intravascular fat. The intravascular fat persisted for twenty-four hours after induction of pulmonary fat embolism. Pulmonary arterial pressure remained elevated at four hours after the embolic showering, before creation and <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture. By twenty-four hours after the induction of fat embolism, pulmonary arterial pressure had returned to the baseline level. Neither the creation nor the <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture affected pulmonary arterial pressure. In the animals that had <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture four hours after embolization, both nailing with reaming and nailing without reaming produced alveolar-arterial gradients that were higher than the baseline values, whereas fixation with a plate did not change the alveolar-arterial gradient significantly from the baseline value. In addition, the alveolar-arterial gradients in the animals that had nailing with reaming and nailing without reaming four hours after embolization were, respectively, four and 3. 5 times higher than that in the animals that had <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the femur with a plate. In the animals that had fixation twenty-four hours after embolization, none of the methods for fixation affected the alveolar-arterial gradient. The amount of embolic fat in the lungs, brain, and kidneys was not affected by <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture when it was performed at either the four-hour or the twenty-four-hour time-interval. Scores for pulmonary edema were increased by <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture, but there was no difference among the scores associated with the three methods <b>of</b> <b>fixation.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of the present study indicated that the amount of intravascular fat persisting in the lungs, kidneys, and brain twenty-four hours after pressurization of the intramedullary canal is not affected by the method <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture. <b>Fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture is associated with minimum evidence of acute inflammation and has no effect on pulmonary artery pressure. The development of pulmonary dysfunction from fat emboli depends on other factors, not just on the presence of fat in pulmonary vessels. It appears that the method <b>of</b> fracture <b>fixation</b> has little influence on the outcome of treatment...|$|R
