40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} impact of the health status of farm {{households}} with respect to HIV/AIDS on their cropping patterns, incomes and technical efficiencies in Benue State of Nigeria. Primary data was collected from 155 farm households made up of 55 HIV/AIDS and related sicknesses infected households and 100 non- infected households. The results demonstrated that HIV/AIDS has led to decreased farm size and reduction in the variety of crops cultivated on HIV <b>farms.</b> The average <b>gross</b> revenue, average <b>gross</b> margin and <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> on non-HIV <b>farms</b> were higher than on HIV <b>farms.</b> The average <b>gross</b> margins for the two farm groups are statistically different at 1 percent level. The significant variables that affect output levels on HIV farms are farm size, hired labour and fertilizer. On non-HIV farms, output levels are affected by farm size, family labour and fertilizer. The technical efficiencies for the two farm groups are statistically different at 1 percent level. Generally, non-HIV farms are more technically efficient with a mean of 0. 70 as compared with 0. 52 on HIV farms. Increase in the years of schooling reduces the technical inefficiencies of farms in both groups...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{producers}} confront increasing price {{risks from}} both {{inputs and outputs}} as the prices of milk, corn and soybean become more volatile in recent years. These risks significantly affect dairy producer's profit margin. This thesis proposes two futures contracts - milk-to-corn price ratio futures and milk-to-feed price ratio futures, both serving the purposes of protecting profit margin for dairy producers with only one hedging position. A theoretical framework is developed in which the stochastic processes and specifications of the two futures contracts are constructed and a simple <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> model is established. Six scenarios of dairy <b>farm</b> <b>profits</b> are considered in this thesis. Optimal hedge ratios are derived based on commodity price levels for each hedging strategy. To examine {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed price ratio futures contracts, an empirical analysis is applied to a sample of 36 New York State dairy farms from 1996 to 2010, assuming each farm had routinely hedged. By qualitatively comparing the mean and variance of the calculated <b>farm</b> <b>profits</b> under the above six scenarios for each sample farm, milk-to-corn and milk-to-feed futures contracts would have been effective in managing price risks and protecting profit margin based on the sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} value of pasture improvement in a farming {{system in a}} Mediterranean-type environment is assessed using farm modelling. Bioeconomic modelling combined with sensitivity analysis is used to explore how new annual legume species may impact on <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and land use. If introduced on all suitable soils the new pastures lead to a 26 % increase in <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> with an additional 12 % of farm area being switched into pasture to support more livestock. However, stocking rates decline slightly, the enterprise mix becomes less diversified and several rotational changes are required. If the new pastures are only introduced on particular soils then <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> increases by a lesser percentage and the pathways to additional profit vary, with both the pasture area and stocking rate either increasing or decreasing. To extract maximum profit from pasture improvement on any particular land management unit often requires management changes on other land management units, apart from those on which pasture improvement initially takes place. The {{economic value}} of pasture improvement is found {{to depend on the}} portfolio of pastures available for improvement and the nature and mix of the farm's land management units.

40|$|A linear {{programming}} model {{was used to}} analyze the effects of different herd and fodder management levels on agricultural income of small-scale mountain dairy farmers in northern Peru.

Because of feeding deficiencies, especially in the dry season, recommended extension activities primarily must emphasize fodder storage and improved pasture management, to subsequently also enhance better herd management practices...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{policies}} {{for the management}} of nonpoint source pollution are difficult to apply given asymmetric information, spatial and temporal variability, and uncertainty. There is increasing awareness that these limitations may be overcome where profitable mitigation practices are broadly adopted by polluters. Nitrification inhibitors (chemicals applied to paddocks that retard the nitrification process in soils) are a rare example of a mitigation practice that reduces pollutant loads and potentially increases <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> through promoting pasture production. This study investigates their capacity to achieve both goals to inform policy makers and producers of their potential for simultaneously improving <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and water quality. With an assumed 10 percent increase in pasture production in response to nitrification inhibitor application, nitrification inhibitors are a profitable innovation because greater pasture production supports higher stocking rates. Nonetheless, their overall impact on <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> is low, even when the cost of inhibitors or their impact on subsequent pasture production is substantially altered. However, inhibitors are found to be a critical mitigation practice for farmers posed with decreasing leaching loads to satisfy regulatory requirements. These findings suggest that, despite their shortcomings for nonpoint pollution regulation, direct policies appear to {{be the only way to}} motivate producers to account for their impact on environmental values given the current lack of profitable mitigations...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical and {{computerized}} {{models are}} developed {{to design and}} optimize furrow irrigation systems. The optimization process starts with land grading design, if any is needed, followed by a prediction of maximum non-erosive furrow stream size allowed on a given soil and the associated furrow-advance function. An average depth of application per irrigation is then assumed from which the wetting pattern along the furrow and the amounts of runoff water are predicted. A design of an Irrigation Runoff Recovery System, IRRS, is then executed, if desired, and system cost is determined. Using the predicted wetting pattern and the appropriate Crop Production Function, the gross return and the net <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> associated with that particular average depth of application per irrigation are determined. The iterative procedure is continued by changing the average depth of application per irrigation and evaluating net <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> until a depth and the associated system design and management program which yield the highest net profit are found.

In order to understand variations of attitudes within the group of agricultural producers, their economic interest (production of heavily exported commodities and high <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> income) is weighed as an independent variable against more commonly cited determinants of world view such as education, partisanship, group membership, and age. The general hypothesis is that the production of heavily exported commodities correlates with a more internationalist perspective. ^ Primary findings are: (1) Higher <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> income is correlated with the belief that more exports mean greater profits.

(4) Foreign policy goals with a humanitarian emphasis are supported by those who expect more profits from increased exports, as well as by older, more liberal agricultural producers and those favoring an active role for the U. S. in the world. (5) More militaristic foreign policy goals are correlated with Republican Party affiliation, lower education levels, interest in world news, and support for U.
