Until the introduction of heavy Dutch cannons in the early 17th century, there were even attempts by the Ming to make large heavy versions of such guns.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, she {{was cast}} as Andie Walsh in another successful Hughes film called Pretty In Pink (1986). Ringwald's role as Andie {{went on to}} become one of her most recognizable performances. When first asked to be <b>in</b> <b>Pretty</b> in Pink, Ringwald was reluctant, but after seeing how hard it was for the producers to find a replacement for her, she decided she would portray Andie in the film. Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film called Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) but she turned down the role as she felt it was too similar to her other films she worked on with Hughes. After Pretty In Pink, Ringwald planned to star in more mature roles. Ringwald was later featured on the cover of Time magazine on May 26, 1986.|$|E
25|$|After Superman IV in 1987, Reeve's {{relationship}} with Exton fell apart, and they separated. He moved to New York without his children. He became depressed {{and decided that}} doing a comedy might be good for him. He was given a lead in Switching Channels. Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. Reeve later stated {{that he made a}} fool of himself in the film and that most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. The film did poorly, and Reeve believed that it marked the end of his movie star career. He spent the next years mostly doing plays. He tried out for the Richard Gere role <b>in</b> <b>Pretty</b> Woman but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.|$|E

A precedent for feather loss can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost, and scales reappeared. Although gigantism has been suggested as a mechanism, Phil R. Bell, who co-authored the study, noted that the feathered Yutyrannus overlapped in size with Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus.

500|$|In 1990, Dennis Hopper {{directed}} The Hot Spot, {{in which}} Connelly played Gloria Harper, a woman being blackmailed. The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised. Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today, [...] "Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up {{fast in the}} movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [...] in The Hot Spot. Not yet 20, Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue". During an interview with Shaeffer, Connelly commented on her first nude scene: [...] "The nudity {{was hard for me}} and something I thought about...but it's not in a sleazy context". The same year, director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward <b>in</b> <b>Pretty</b> Woman, but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part.|$|E

Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{reported that}} [...] "Winter Madness" [...] fell {{into the category of}} an episode that featured [...] "a lot of funny gags but aren't wholly satisfying" [...] and added that it [...] "just stopped, rather than building to a real conclusion". Sean Gandert of Paste rated unfavorably the pairing of Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore's characters, citing {{that they do not have}} [...] "much rapport, so the scenes with the two of them together are a bit dead, as much as I usually enjoy seeing Julianne Moore <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> much anything."

500|$|There {{has also}} been {{the fact that the}} {{composer}} did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed [...] "a professional reevaluaton" [...] of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes, [...] "It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded {{in the context of the}} whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1894, Courtenay {{followed}} Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, {{where she}} was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: [...] "I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!" [...] His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead. [...] As {{a result of the}} incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal. Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. [...] A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer Alec Hurley, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy <b>in</b> <b>Pretty</b> Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe.

Although the live-action sequences with Conway Twitty from previous episodes were highly criticized, IGN writer Ahsan Haque {{felt that the}} live-action footage in this episode [...] "blends <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> well". Haque praised Barrymore's portrayal of Jillian in the episode, saying that she had [...] "some great comedy moments." [...] He went on to grade the episode 8 out of 10, {{and said that the}} live-action footage [...] "seemed to work somehow here, and the storyline took center stage here" [...] and that [...] "you can't argue against an attempt to tell an actual story, and for that reason, this episode's definitely worth watching." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the live-action footage as well, saying that he [...] "liked the splicing in of late night hosts and their jokes about Brian and , if only to add a certain element of timeliness to the material." [...] Heisler graded the episode B-, the second highest grade of the night. He said that [...] "often Family Guy is unbearable" [...] and [...] "has established a certain style and rhythm, jokes come off as smug", but said that he found himself enjoying the episode [...] "more and more as it went on [...] because it was willing to fully embrace the silliness and ridiculousness of what it was setting up." ...|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{made his}} film {{debut in the}} direct-to-video release Cool Blue (1990), as Buzz. His first theatrically {{released}} feature film appearance came the same year <b>in</b> <b>Pretty</b> Woman, as a police detective. His next major film role was as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 film Quiz Show, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film The Birdcage. For the role, which Azaria considers to be his [...] "big break", he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, and critically branded [...] "the most hilarious performance in the film," [...] by Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle, while Empire wrote that he [...] " [...] the show." [...] For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance. Agador was originally {{going to be a}} single scene part, with the larger role of the housekeeper being played by David Alan Grier. With the producers fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part, Azaria inherited the full role.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Many reviewers were pleased {{with what they}} saw as a return-to-form sound reminiscent of the Blue Album (1994) and Pinkerton (1996) albums. Pitchfork Media writer Marc Hogan gave the song a positive review and described the song as, [...] "a catchy, self-referential rocker, with the buzzsaw guitars and big choruses of Weezer's glory days, and that familiar, self-assured lameness." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a positive review, [...] "That chunka-chunka guitar hook is pure [...] gold, so much so that I didn't focus on Rivers Cuomo's very clever lyrics at first." [...] Stereogum was also impressed with the song stating it was a [...] "sweet, savory dose of self-referential, self-deprecating Weezer rock... This stuff sounds very familiar in a good, good way." [...] NME described the song as having [...] " [...] best chorus in ages". However, Internet reviewer David Ritter speculated that the song was either [...] "voided by the wholesale capitulation involved in going home and writing said commercial material" [...] or [...] "a calculated attempt to boost record sales by wrapping faux-defiance <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> paper," [...] going on to compliment its [...] "Scorcho-y acoustic guitar," [...] he then said that this, along with the [...] "keyboard twinkles" [...] and [...] "squeals and squeaks", has little effect on the song and that they barely register on top of the much more noticeable lead vocals and power chords.|$|E
