5|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>driven</b> <b>wheel,</b> a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
25|$|The penny-farthing is a {{direct-drive}} bicycle, {{meaning the}} cranks and pedals are fixed {{directly to the}} hub. Instead of using gears to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> is enlarged {{to be close to}} the rider's inseam, to increase the maximum speed. This shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat.|$|E
25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and drive axle {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E

30|$|In the {{proposed}} method using cooperative {{control of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> and the linear actuator, the linear actuator stretches to lift the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> onto the step. However, in this motion, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> could move backwards and lose contact with {{the side of the}} step, and the user {{would not be able to}} control this by electric operation. To avoid this situation, the wheelchair first performs a static wheelie motion on the step to hover the front casters above the ground in advance. By cooperative control of the shrinking motion of the linear actuator and the traction force of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> then climbs onto the step at the same time that the front casters land on the step. Thus, using this proposed method, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can climb over a step without relying on the wheel radius. This advantage was also confirmed by an experiment in which the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbed over a step higher than its wheel radius.|$|R

25|$|The {{described}} system handles extremely well, {{as it is}} able {{to accommodate}} various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel will spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheel slip.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rotating}} {{drive wheel}} is usually {{equipped with a}} pin that reaches into a slot-shaped groove located in the other wheel (<b>driven</b> <b>wheel)</b> that advances it by {{one step at a}} time. The main wheel also has an elevated circular blocking disc that [...] "locks" [...] the rotating <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> in position between steps.|$|E
5000|$|Consider {{for example}} a Geneva drive, a device for {{creating}} an intermittent {{rotation of the}} <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> (blue) from a continuous rotation of the driving wheel (red). On one cycle of the driving wheel there is {{a variation of the}} angular position [...] of the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> by one quarter of a cycle, and a constant angular position on the remainder of the cycle.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{condition}} {{required for the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> to climb the step was analyzed. As previously described, for the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> to climb over the step, the wheelchair has to first perform a wheelie motion, for which the design condition has already been obtained. Therefore, by satisfying the same condition, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can also climb the step.|$|R
30|$|For {{the method}} that uses only the {{traction}} {{force of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can perform up-and-down motion without attaching the proposed mechanism. The wheel radius of the active-caster is assumed as 65  mm, and the height of the step is 100  mm, as previously mentioned. In this method, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbs along {{to the side of the}} step, but a force is required to make the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> contact the side of the step in order to generate the traction force. However, generating this force for contact is difficult without the proposed mechanism. Thus, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> cannot climb over a step higher than its wheel radius by the method that uses only the traction force.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traction}} control system uses four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) to apply and release the disc brakes on the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> that has lost traction. The ABS clamps down on the slipping <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> or wheels, [...] "brake locking" [...] the differential, which can transfer up to 100 percent of supplied torque to the opposing <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> with better traction. By ABS [...] "brake locking" [...] both {{the front and rear}} differentials, the {{traction control}} system can simulate front and rear differential locks. The system works even if two of its <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> (one front, one rear) are completely off the ground.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tractive efficiency of all-wheel-drive vehicles {{in general and}} the slip efficiency in particular. It focuses on the analysis of the conditions for achieving the optimal slip efficiency. Results of detailed theoretical analyses indicate that all <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> operating at the same slip will be the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the optimal slip efficiency, if their thrust-slip relationships are either linear or nonlinear with similar characteristics. If the thrust-slip relationships of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> are nonlinear with different characteristics, the optimal slip efficiency will be reached with the slips of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> not being equal. The basic findings of this investigation are substantiated with experimental data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the requirement for all <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> operating at the same slip provides a reasonable basis for a practical control strategy of an active system to distribute torque (thrust) among the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> to achieve the optimal (or close to the optimal) slip efficiency of all-wheel-drive vehicles under most operating conditions.

40|$|This is a final thesis done at BT, {{considering}} one {{of their}} forklift truck models called Reflex. The {{first part of this}} report is about a preliminary investigation investigating what kind of diagnostic systems BTwants to use, and also which demands there are to meet all expectations on such system. Secondly a diagnostic system, which will show if the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> is worn out, will be presented. In the preliminary investigation, two kinds of diagnostic systems were mentioned. These were Model based diagnosis and Predictive analysis. Model based diagnosis is based on measurements made by sensors at the truck, while predictive analysis is based more on statistics and retrieved data about the lifetime of a truck in specific environments. The diagnosis system for the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> is based on a model made in Matlab's Simulink. Due to poor documentation, rough simplifications in the model have been made. However, one can still see the differences of principle. The main thought was detecting a difference in the lowest torque level from the engine, varying the diameter of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel.</b> By measurements made directly at the truck, different torques could be observed with varying diameter of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> varying load on the truck and varying friction in the gearbox. Using hypothesis tests, it is possible to say whether the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> is worn out or not. Results show that if the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter is reduced by 25 mm, torque is reduced by 7 % and if the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter is reduced as much as 50 mm, a torque reduction of 11 % would be achieved...|$|R

The angle by which the drive wheel has to rotate to effect one step rotation of the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> is always smaller than 180° in an external Geneva drive and always greater than 180° in an internal one, where the switch time is therefore greater than the time the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> stands still.|$|E

A clutch action was made by lifting the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> off the drive disc. Moving the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> past the centre gave a reverse gear. The smaller car with an engine rated for taxation at 5/6hp had tandem seating with the driver sitting behind the passenger. The larger model had a 7/9hp engine.|$|E
