5|$|In 2005, AFLPA moved all {{services}} provided under the Player Development Program <b>in-house,</b> employing {{experts in the}} fields of education, player welfare and career transition.|$|E
5|$|Windows RT {{does not}} include Windows Media Player, in favor of other {{multimedia}} apps found on Windows Store; devices are pre-loaded with the <b>in-house</b> Xbox Music and Xbox Video apps.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Lasseter renamed Walt Disney Feature Animation to Walt Disney Animation Studios, and re-positioned {{the studio}} as an {{animation}} house that produced {{both traditional and}} computer-animated projects. In order {{to keep costs down}} on hand-drawn productions, animation, design, and layout were done <b>in-house</b> at Disney while clean-up animation and digital ink-and-paint were farmed out to vendors and freelancers.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{confirmed}} that players would reprise {{the role of}} Gordon Freeman, unlike the original Half-Life expansion packs, which all dealt with different characters. Valve decided to develop Episode One <b>in-house,</b> as opposed to working with outside contractors as with previous expansions, because the company was already comfortable with the technology and construction tools of Half-Life 2.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wisden, who {{had played}} the {{original}} role, was available for the episode. In addition to his appearance on The X-Files, he had also appeared on the Chris Carter-created series Millennium. Diana Scarwid was cast as Modell's sister. The body of Nathan Bowman, Linda's husband, was created by drenching an <b>in-house</b> dummy with the correct shade of paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} devised by the then <b>in-house</b> development team at BBC Entertainment Events and was announced by the BBC in April 2006. BBC One broadcast the programme, which was hosted by Graham Norton, on Saturday evenings from 29 July through 16 September 2006.|$|E
5|$|American Type Founders {{created a}} revival of the Imprimerie Nationale fonts from around 1917, which was {{designed}} <b>in-house</b> by its design department led by Morris Fuller Benton under the influence of its historian and advisor Henry Lewis Bullen. It received a sumptuous showing, marketed especially towards advertisers, in ATF's 1923 specimen book. Also involved in the design's development was book and advertising designer T.M. Cleland, who created a set of matching borders and ornaments, and according to Warde and Garnett also designed the swash characters.|$|E
5|$|As growth {{continued}} The Churchill Machine Tool Co's {{share capital}} was increased to £70,000, and in 1911 the four directors, {{who had not}} drawn a salary since its inception, were voted £25 each as remuneration. By 1913 the businesses had attained such a position with <b>in-house</b> manufacturing of grinding machinery that Charles Churchill was able to ignore a threat to withdraw from him, {{on the grounds of}} conflict of interest, the agency agreement with US company Brown & Sharpe which had been set up in 1872 before his bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: <b>in-house</b> formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The formative research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's television viewing was studied scientifically.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} by Southend Interactive {{and published by}} Ubisoft Entertainment. It was released as an Xbox gaming system exclusive on 18 October 2002 in Europe and four days later in North America. Deathrow development began in May 1999 as an online PC (player computer) game. In early 2001, Southend transitioned to an Xbox console release, which let the team use pixel shaders, bump mapped textures, and specular lighting. Deathrow was built on an <b>in-house</b> 3D game engine and was Southend's first full release.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2: Episode One is {{the first}} in a trilogy of episodes serving as the sequel of the 2004 first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. In February 2006, Valve {{announced}} that they would be releasing a trilogy of episodes covering the same story arc. While the plots and dialogue of Half-Life and Half-Life 2 were written solely by Valve's <b>in-house</b> writer Marc Laidlaw, the Half-Life 2 Episodes were collaboratively written by Laidlaw, Chet Faliszek, and Erik Wolpaw, with Laidlaw retaining overall leadership of the group.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{an expert}} system called XCON was {{completed}} at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It {{was an enormous}} success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986. Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to <b>in-house</b> AI departments. An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{a team of}} {{production}} companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included {{what is now the}} Klasky Csupo animation house. During the years of producing the shorts, everything was created <b>in-house.</b> Due to the increased workload of the full-length episodes, production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM. While character and background layout is done by the domestic studio, tweening, coloring, and filming are done by the overseas studio.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios {{presented}} {{a look at}} Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included The Avengers, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members. Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's {{executive vice president of}} worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions <b>in-house.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lacking Havok, Euphoria, and DMM, Krome's Wii version {{relies on}} the company's <b>in-house</b> physics engine. Some {{character}} animations may be ragdoll while others are preset; in developing the game, Krome tried to blur {{the distinction between the}} two. The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E
5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely <b>in-house,</b> but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled <b>in-house</b> using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|Mad Max {{is powered}} by the Avalanche Engine, an <b>in-house</b> {{proprietary}} engine developed by Avalanche and also used in Just Cause 2. According to lead graphics designer Alvar Jansson, new graphical features {{were introduced to the}} engine during the development of Mad Max and it was designed and optimized for open-world games. The team also worked on improving the world's draw distance and ensuring that gameplay across the three major platforms have no significant difference.|$|E
5|$|New {{music was}} mostly {{recorded}} from Psygnosis's <b>in-house</b> music team, CoLD SToRAGE, for versions released outside the PlayStation. The {{songs of the}} PlayStation, Sega Saturn and the Windows and Mac versions could also be listened to by inserting the CD into a CD player (and skipping the first track). The soundtrack was also released as an audio CD, though with a different artist and track listing.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2008, {{before the}} release of Left 4 Dead, Valve Corporation {{announced}} that it had purchased Turtle Rock {{in an effort to}} expand the company's console market. Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve Corporation, added that it was an easy decision for the company to make, as they had high expectations for Left 4 Dead and considered themselves having a long-term relationship with Turtle Rock. After being acquired by Valve, Turtle Rock served as Valve's <b>in-house</b> satellite development team, and was renamed Valve South.|$|E
5|$|Production of Star Trek began {{three years}} before release under Tom Lesinski at Paramount Digital Entertainment. Lesinkski had a {{background}} in video game production, having previously worked at companies such as Crystal Dynamics, Ion Storm and Kuju Entertainment. He {{made the decision to}} produce a game <b>in-house,</b> rather than licensing it out to a third party as had previously been the case under the previous ten-year Activision contract. As a result, the game was the first ever to be produced and released by Paramount Studios directly.|$|E
5|$|Significant amongst its {{specialist}} {{consultancy services}} are its fire consultancy group, FEDRA, and software development group SMART which worked with Sheffield University to develop Vulcan software, widely {{used throughout the}} fire engineering industry. SMART also develops Buro Happold's <b>in-house</b> software Tensyl, a non-linear finite element analysis and patterning program for fabric structures, and people flow modelling software. Also notable is its group COSA, which undertakes computational modelling and analysis and the Sustainability and Alternative Technologies Group.|$|E
5|$|Sixense {{developed}} {{a version of}} Portal 2 to support the Razer Hydra motion controller for PC that allows enhanced control of some game elements. Ten extra single-player levels are available as downloadable content for this version. Writer Chet Faliszek said Sixense developers spent nine {{months to a year}} <b>in-house</b> at Valve preparing the native version. A limited edition of the Razer Hydra comes bundled with a copy of Portal 2 for PC.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers {{provided}} {{a wide range}} of <b>in-house</b> services for their tenants, including shops, restaurants, barbers, tobacconists, newsagents, tailors, professional specialists and libraries. Skyscrapers also employed a substantial number of service staff to maintain and support them; a building such as the Chicago Board of Trade spent 20 percent of its rental revenue on service staff, employing 41 people, including janitors, elevator operators, engineers, and an electrician. With this collection of services and facilities, skyscrapers of the period were often referred to as small cities in their own right.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{had hoped}} {{to work in a}} more modern {{facility}} than EMI's London studios at Abbey Road, and so sent Epstein to Memphis in March 1966 to investigate the possibility of their recording at Stax Studio. According to a letter written by Harrison two months later, the group intended to work with Stax's <b>in-house</b> producer, Jim Stewart. The idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative plans to use either Atlantic Studios in New York or Motown's facility in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The Coast Guard is {{actively}} promoting U.S. Coast Guard college and career opportunities amongst Hispanics. Captain Adolfo Ramirez is an <b>in-house</b> Executive on Loan at the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities at San Antonio, Texas, which {{represents more than}} 330 colleges and universities. His job is to explain the college programs, and military and civilian career opportunities that the Coast Guard can provide to Hispanic communities in education, and in service to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Employment Development Centres {{continuously}} seek {{to increase}} their diversity of contract work, <b>in-house</b> industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for persons with intellectual disability. These efforts go towards providing income for the trainees {{to pay for their}} own transport, food and leisure. But more importantly, with jobs to do, persons with intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) is the European Parliament's <b>in-house</b> {{research}} department and think tank. It provides Members of the European Parliament - and where appropriate, parliamentary committees - with independent, objective and authoritative analysis of, and research on, policy {{issues relating to}} the European Union, in order {{to assist them in}} their parliamentary work. It is also designed to increase Members' and EP committees' capacity to scrutinise and oversee the European Commission and other EU executive bodies.|$|E
5|$|The children's {{television}} show Sesame Street, which premiered on public broadcasting television stations in 1969, {{was the first}} show of its kind that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. Its goals were garnered from <b>in-house</b> formative research and independent summative evaluations, and its first curriculum was created {{in a series of}} five seminars in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} aim to {{make the}} kernel and usermode APIs more compatible with Windows NT version 5.2 (Windows Server 2003) and to add support for more applications and hardware with plans to target newer versions of Windows as development matures. DirectX support is undertaken through ReactX, an <b>in-house</b> implementation. 2D hardware-accelerated rendering is done natively, while other drawing functionality is redirected to OpenGL as a stopgap solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} redesigned {{the game}} engine, {{the software that}} handles rendering and much of gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in motion capture to develop more realistic character animations. Building a motion capture studio <b>in-house</b> saved Bungie time as motion capture data {{could be applied to}} the game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music is}} {{composed}} by Borislav Slavov and Peter Antovszki, Crytek's <b>in-house</b> composers. Slavov had previously led the soundtrack development of Crysis 3 and Warface. The soundtrack development began in February 2013, {{right after the}} completion of Crysis 3. Slavov considered composing the music for Ryse a great challenge, as he had to compose 250 minutes of music within a short time frame. Crytek also hired an external composer, Tilman Silescu, to help compose the music for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainwater}} which {{falls on}} Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain gutters {{and used to}} irrigate the temple grounds, {{as well as to}} generate electricity used for charging the batteries of <b>in-house</b> motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made potable.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the game led to a sequel, Halo2, which was {{announced}} on August 8, 2002, at Microsoft's New York City X02 press event. It featured improved graphics, new weapons, and a multiplayer mode on Xbox Live. Halo3 was announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The initial conception for the third game was done before Halo2 was released in 2004. It utilized a proprietary, <b>in-house</b> graphics engine, and employed advanced graphics technologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual arts}} program {{includes}} drawing, painting, photography, sculpting, digital art, and art history. The program is highly structured, emphasizing technique {{and control over}} free expression, which has attracted criticism from the local art community. Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, and work at <b>in-house</b> galleries and off-site exhibits. Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses {{by the end of}} their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} {{for the season}} was Mark Kolpack, with Los Angeles-based visual effects company FuseFX the main visual effects vendor. Kevin Lingenfelser started the season focused on 2D supervising, but took over as lead <b>in-house</b> visual effects supervisor after episode eight from David Altenau. Two separate production management and creative teams were established {{to work on the}} show, with most of the episodes being worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the same}} group that set up and {{maintained}} the <b>in-house</b> digital ink and paint systems for Hanna Barbera {{as well as the}} Avid and Pro Tools systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. Real Adventures maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.|$|E
