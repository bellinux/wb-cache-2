5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila.

5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J. Collins script The Way Back which created the fictional scenario that filming To Hell and Back had been so therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> <b>after</b> with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

When Karen attempts to investigate Dave's background, Edie realizes she knows very little about his past.

40|$|Once upon a paradox... {{an opening}} more {{appropriate}} for the tale of Cinderella considering the difficult position she is in. Time and time again, Cinderella's transformational journey from maid to princess has been adapted to an ever-changing audience. In 1812, the Brothers Grimm published a collection of fairy tales, titled Children's Household Tales, for a nineteenth-century German audience. The story of Aschenputtel depicts {{a beautiful young woman}} as she magically fulfills her dream of becoming a princess. Erica Silverman put a Jewish twist on this classic in her 1999 picture book titled Raisel's Riddle. The similar stories of Raisel and Aschenputtel reinforce ideas of womanhood through their significant roles in the home and driving desire to marry a wealthy prince. At first, both must obey a strong female character and become responsible for running households on their own. Despite their pure hearts and beautiful faces, neither Raisel nor Aschenputtel can capture the love of a prince without magical intervention. Their domestic duties create an unattractiveness that leaves them only dreaming for marriage. Ironically, they must inhabit this stained social position to fulfill one area of womanhood: the domestic queen. However, this domestic work negates any efforts to fulfill the criteria for women to be beautiful and poised enough for marriage. All that is womanly remains tied to marriage for Raisel and Aschenputtel. They become undesirable through their physical labor as women but must leave their true identities behind to earn their <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> <b>afters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Esmeralda was Thomas's first opera {{to receive}} a full staging. It was {{commissioned}} by the Carl Rosa Opera Company following a very successful performance of excerpts from his opera The Light of the Harem in 1879 at the Royal Academy of Music {{where he was a}} student at the time. Alberto Randegger (the musical director of the Carl Rosa company) and the eccentric British poet Theo Marzials co-wrote the libretto. Its subject, Esmeralda, a central protagonist in Victor Hugo's novel Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame), had already been the focus of several earlier operas, including Louise Bertin's La Esmeralda (1836), Alexander Dargomyzhsky's Esmeralda (1847), and Fabio Campana's Esmeralda (1869).In the tragic denouement of Hugo's original novel, Esmeralda dies on the scaffold. However, Marzials and Randegger's libretto gave the story a happy ending, a decision heavily criticised in a review of the premiere published in The Theatre: That Esmeralda and Phoebus should get married {{at the close of the}} fourth act, and live <b>happily</b> for <b>ever</b> <b>after,</b> is all very well from the school-girl novel-reading point of view; but, as a new ending to Notre Dame de Paris, it appearsto me no less revolting than impertinent.|$|R
