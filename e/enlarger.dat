25|$|At {{this time}} to {{differentiate}} between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens, MINOX introduced an edge code in the negative. Since the MINOX C (the first camera released with the new minox lens) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera. The reason was that commercial processors used MINOX enlargers. As the minox lens replaced the complan, so the enlargers had to change lenses: MINOX II enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses, MINOX III enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses. Ironically, owners of Rigas and model II cameras would get better results from a MINOX III <b>enlarger</b> than a MINOX II <b>enlarger.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early Minox cameras from Minox A/III to Minox B were {{equipped}} with a four-element, three-group Complan (lens) designed by ex-Leica lens designer Arthur Seibert. The Complan lens has a curved film plane, hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the edge-to-edge sharpness of the image. The Minox <b>enlarger</b> also holds the negative in this same curve. Later models, beginning with late model Minox B, to the current model TLX, using the 15mm f/3.5 four-element, three-group flat-field Minox lens, and the negative was held flat. The advance was attributed by Kasiemeir (Small MINOX Big Pictures 1971 edition) to new rare-earth elements. Note that lens performance between old and new complan/minox lenses was rated by MINOX themselves as identical.|$|E

500|$|After the Spanish film {{development}} lab {{discovered that}} telephone lines, helicopters and cars were {{visible in the}} footage, they tried to incinerate it, telling Bakshi's first assistant director, [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." [...] When Bakshi returned to the United States, {{he learned that the}} cost of developing blown-up prints of each frame had risen. He did not want to repeat the process that had been used on Wizards, which was unsuitable for the level of detail he intended for The Lord of the Rings, so Bakshi and camera technician Ted Bemiller created their own photographic <b>enlarger</b> to process the footage cheaply. Live-action special effects and analog optics were used in place of animation to keep the visual effects budget low and give the film a more realistic look. Among the voice actors was the well-regarded John Hurt, who performed the role of Aragorn. The project's high-profile brought heavy trade journal coverage, and fans such as Mick Jagger visited the studio for the chance to play a role. Animator Carl Bell loved drawing Aragorn so much that Bakshi gave Bell the live-action costume, which he wore while animating.|$|E

2500|$|Typically, a lens is used {{to focus}} the light {{reflected}} or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically [...] "developed" [...] into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on {{the purpose of the}} photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an <b>enlarger</b> or by contact printing.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic {{emulsion}} film sometimes {{appears to}} exaggerate {{the color of the}} light, as it does not respond to lighting color in the way human visual perception does. An object that appears to the eye to be white {{may turn out to be}} very blue or orange in a photograph. The color balance may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a neutral color print. [...] The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the [...] "wrong" [...] light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the <b>enlarger.</b> [...] Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.|$|E
