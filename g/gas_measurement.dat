5|$|Arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>measurement</b> {{is usually}} {{performed}} {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the fall}} of 2008, AVO has flown 13 <b>gas</b> <b>measurement</b> flights, and of these, 5 have {{occurred}} since the eruption began on March 15, 2009. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates (up to 2000 tonnes/day) were measured in October–November, 2008. Starting in late January 2009, and coincident with a strong increase in seismicity, gas emission rates rose to a level (> 5000 tonnes/d) suggesting significant unrest at the volcano, and emissions stayed at this level until the eruption began. Since that time, emissions of both CO2 and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have been very elevated, sometimes reaching levels in excess of 10,000 tonnes/d. These volcanic gas emission rates are among the largest ever measured in Alaska, though such high values are consistent with an openly degassing volcanic system that is actively extruding lava. Based on measurements and observations from Redoubt's previously observed eruptions, these gas emission rates are likely to drop substantially when the eruption wanes.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{diagnostic}} techniques {{can be found in}} the literature for anaerobic threshold (AT) assessment. The aim of this study was to investigate if the heart rate (HR) at the modified Dmax method (Mod-Dmax) using parallel straight line slope (PSLS) mathematical model and the Narita target heart rate equation was comparable with the HR measured at the AT by the continuous respiratory <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> in healthy young girls. Eight (age 19. 29 ± 1. 70 years) healthy young girls performed an exhaustive treadmill exercise test for determination of the HR at Mod-Dmax using PSLS model and Narita equation. The AT of the participants was also calculated by the continuous respiratory <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> according to the Craig method. There was no significant difference between the HR determined at the Mod-Dmax method and the HR measured at the AT by the continuous respiratory <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> (167 ± 9. 22 vs. 165. 25 ± 6. 32 b/min). Bland and Altman plots revealed a good agreement between the determined HR at Mod-Dmax and values of the HR measured at the AT by the continuous respiratory <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> (95 % CI =− 20 to+ 22. 8 b/min). According to the results, the Mod-Dmax using PSLS model and the Narita equation during the exhaustive treadmill exercise test is an accurate and reliable noninvasive alternative to the cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming invasive methods. Therefore, the Mod-Dmax method can be used for the determination of AT in healthy young girls...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} Volatile Analysis by Pyrolysis of Regolith (VAPoR) {{instrument}} design and demonstrate {{the validity of}} an in situ pyrolysis mass spectrometer for evolved gas analyses of lunar and planetary regolith samples. In situ evolved gas analyses of the lunar regolith {{have not yet been}} carried out and no atmospheric or evolved <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> have been made at the lunar poles. VAPoR is designed to do both kinds of measurements, is currently under development at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and will be able to heat powdered regolith samples or rock drill fines up to 1400 C in vacuo. To validate the instrument concept, evolved gas species released from different planetary analogs were determined as a function of temperature using a laboratory breadboard. Evolved <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> of an Apollo 16 regolith sample and a fragment of the carbonaceous meteorite Murchison were made by VAPoR and our results compared with existing data. The results imply that in situ evolved <b>gas</b> <b>measurements</b> of the lunar regolith at the polar regions by VAPoR will be a very powerful tool for identifying water and other volatile signatures of lunar or exogenous origin as potential resources for future human exploration...|$|R

Bibliographic references and thousands of papers, available for free in PDF format, were collected and indexed by CEESI. CEESI made agreements with the American School of <b>Gas</b> <b>Measurement</b> Training, American Gas Association, and the Natural Gas Sampling Technology Conference {{to allow for the}} downloading of papers on flow measurement topics. CEESI also reached agreements with the International School of Hydrocarbon Measurement (ISHM) to which resulted in ISHM allowing their publications be made available via download through the library. Similarly, the organizers of the International Symposium on Fluid Flow Measurement (the North American Fluid Flow Measurement Council) also granted CEESI permission to allow users of the Flow Measurement Technical Library to download symposium proceedings. CEESI entered into a partnership with the Pipeline Research Council International (also known as [...] "PRCI") in 2008 which allowed the expansion and further development of the library; the library’s name was changed to the “Flow Measurement Technical Library” after this partnership began. By 2012, the following organizations/conferences that have allowed some portion of their papers to be downloadable by the public through the Flow Measurement Technical Library: International School of Hydrocarbon Measurement, International Symposium on Fluid Flow Measurement, Acadiana Flow Measurement Society, American School of <b>Gas</b> <b>Measurement</b> Technologies, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Western <b>Gas</b> <b>Measurement</b> Short Course, Canadian School of Hydrocarbon Measurement, Flow Measurement Institute, South East Asia Hydrocarbon Flow Measurement Workshop, North Sea Flow Measurement Workshop, and the Appalachian <b>Gas</b> <b>Measurement</b> Short Course.

LIS allows construction of an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm that explores only a reduced dimensional space but still produces a good approximation of the original full dimensional Bayesian posterior distribution. This in effect makes the statistical estimation problem independent of the discretization of the inverse problem. In addition, we compare LIS to a dimension reduction method based on prior covariance matrix truncation used earlier (S. Tukiainen et al. 2016) ...|$|R
