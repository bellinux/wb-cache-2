500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back.

It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>love</b> that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start.

500|$|Aly Semigran for Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} episode [...] "was {{nowhere near as}} good" [...] as other recent episodes as it was [...] "too {{dependent}} on obvious physical comedy." [...] IGN writer Robert Canning took no strong position on the episode, saying it had [...] "jokes {{enough to make it}} funny, but nothing over the top to make it classic," [...] rating the episode 8.2 out of 10. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin was more clearly positive about the episode, calling it a [...] "glorious return to form" [...] and grading the episode an A-. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad opined he was not thrilled with Jenna's plot, observing that it was [...] "kinda ridiculous (and unfunny, which is the worse sin)." [...] Sassone, however, said that Liz and Tracy feuding and Jack and his mother battling [...] "are plots that are always good for some laughs."

The script dares to deal with issues of race and gender from a typically irreverent perspective."

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>love</b> the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.

[...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered.
