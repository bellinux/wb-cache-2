5|$|A large {{percentage}} of people who live in urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which are probably the only connections they have with nature. A study shows that having contact with nature helps promote our health and well-being. People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> those who did not.|$|E

5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E

5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E
5|$|The bird's {{head and}} upper body {{typically}} vary between pale brown and some shade of grey (especially {{on the forehead}} and back) in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles except on the remiges and rectrices (main wing feathers), which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is brown. The underparts, including the tarsometatarsal (lower leg) feathers, vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It {{has been found that}} at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> plainer birds. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The beak varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue, and the iris is blackish brown. The talons, like the beak, vary in colour, ranging from pink to dark pinkish-grey and the talons are black.|$|E
25|$|Wolf-dog hybrids are {{generally}} {{said to be}} naturally healthy animals, and are affected by fewer inherited diseases than most breeds of dog. Wolfdogs are usually <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> either parent due to heterosis. Some of the established breeds of wolfdog that exist today were bred specifically to improve the health and vigor of working dogs.|$|E

25|$|Production of {{hydrogenated}} fats increased steadily until the 1960s, as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries.

25|$|White {{turkey meat}} is often {{considered}} <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> dark meat {{because of its}} lower fat content, but the nutritional differences are small.

The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.|$|E
25|$|Vegetarian or vegan {{cat food}} has been {{available}} for many years, and is targeted primarily at vegan and vegetarian pet owners. While {{a small percentage of}} owners choose such a diet based on its perceived health benefits, the majority do so due to ethical concerns. Despite this, most vegans who feed their cats a vegan diet believe that a vegetarian diet is <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> a conventional diet. There is much controversy over feeding cats a vegetarian diet. While there is anecdotal evidence that cats do well on vegetarian food, studies on commercial and homemade vegetarian cat foods have found nutritional inadequacies.|$|E

It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.|$|E
25|$|Silkworm {{breeding}} {{is aimed}} at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced {{are directly related to}} the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.|$|E
25|$|The Hornets {{franchise}} {{returned to}} New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season, with all 41 home {{games in the}} New Orleans Arena.

The Hornets also won their first-ever division title, winning the Southwest Division.

25|$|His wife Mary has {{recently}} returned from treatment for drug addiction and has put on weight as a result. She is looking much <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} tested these {{hypotheses}} {{and some have}} led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests {{some of the more}} generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was <b>healthier</b> <b>than</b> Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack. The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.|$|E
