5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages</b> as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed.

5|$|The Corded Ware culture, in {{existence}} in central Europe between 3000 and 2000 BCE, originated most likely from Proto-Indo-European nomadic {{people of the}} Black Sea steppes. It was a pastoral culture at least <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> {{for the most part}} lacking permanent settlements and known primarily from the burial grounds (a large one with many richly furnished graves was discovered in Złota near Sandomierz). They moved together with their herds of cattle, sheep, goats and horses along the river valleys of southern Poland, but also engaged in flint mining and manufacturing of tools and weapons for their own use and trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the Byzantine Empire, at least <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> had a variety of mother tongues including Greek. These included Latin, Aramaic, Coptic, and Caucasian languages, while Cyril Mango also cites evidence for bilingualism {{in the south and}} southeast. These influences, as well as an influx of people of Arabic, Celtic, Germanic, Turkic, and Slavic backgrounds, supplied medieval Greek with many loanwords that have survived in the modern Greek language. From the 11th century onward, there was also a steady rise in the literary use of the vernacular.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> {{esophageal cancer}} {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> {{the storm}} dropped {{moderately}} heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides {{on the west}} coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7million (1959USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49ft (15m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959CAD, $781,000 1959USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> an {{intoxicated}} {{person may}} experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the mid-1950s}} in Britain the blues {{was seen as}} a form of folk music. When Broonzy toured England he played a folk blues set to fit British {{expectations}} of American blues, rather than his current electric Chicago blues. Skiffle clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages</b> these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues. As the skiffle craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs, following the lead of MacColl, began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music, often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English folk clubs.|$|E

5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while it was still <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E
5|$|In 723, al-Harashi was {{replaced}} as governor by Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, who resolved late {{the next year}} to launch an expedition {{with the goal of}} seizing Ferghana.

This brought the long-simmering tribal rivalries of the Arabs of Khurasan came to the fore: the Yemeni (southern Arab) troops in Balkh initially refused to join the campaign, as they expected the imminent recall of al-Kilabi (who was of northern Arab stock) by the new regime. Only after Nasr ibn Sayyar led a force of Mudaris (northern Arabs) against them and defeated them at Baruqan did the Yemenis join al-Kilabi's army. The campaign eventually went ahead as Khalid al-Qasri wrote to al-Kilabi, urging him to proceed with it until his replacement, Khalid's brother Asad, arrived in Khurasan. Nevertheless, 4,000 troops from the Yemeni Azd tribe withdrew from the army.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> the {{depression}} moved west-northwestward between {{the islands of}} St. Vincent and St. Lucia {{under the influence of}} a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24hours before forming, {{the depression}} exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00UTC on October5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph (119km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60mph (95km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155mi (250km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.|$|E

5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with Earth <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages.</b> Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 {{billion years ago}} brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant portion of it. Others have cast doubt on this idea. The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis. In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{states the}} need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering {{that it would be}} dangerous during revolutionary times. It compared the South American revolution, still <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> with the French and North American ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing out that none of those relied solely in conspiracies or secret meetings. The document proposes to favor patriots, and fill the state offices with them. Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta, and executed if they were rich or influential. For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network. This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and similar to the one employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after. Moreno thought that José Gervasio Artigas would be an invaluable ally, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism. He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay, and urged support of local patriots against local royalists.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kujira, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Amang, was an {{extremely}} long-lived tropical cyclone that lasted for 16days affected the island nations of Micronesia, Taiwan, and Japan in April2003, {{as well as the}} earliest typhoon in a calendar year to ever make landfall on the latter. Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April9 well removed form any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April14. Intensification continued and late on April15, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April21, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April24, Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April2003.|$|E
