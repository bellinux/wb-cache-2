40|$|ABSTRACT: Collisions on {{construction}} sites {{are one of}} the major causes of fatal accidents. The complexity of equipment operations require detailed planning and better real-time control of the work. Research involving artificial intelligence in construction industry has been done to enhance communication between team workers and resolve distributed problems, for example, agent systems have been used for construction claims and dynamic rescheduling negotiation. However, little research has focused on real-time control of construction equipment operations using agents to improve safety on site. The present paper proposes a multi-agent-based approach to provide real-time support to the construction staffs. Collision avoidance is achieved by <b>informing</b> <b>workers</b> and equipment operators about potential collisions, and by providing re-planning for equipment.

How can new technologies be evaluated {{in such a way that}} many voices can be heard? How can divergent ideas for change be translated into action that makes a difference? While the importance of stakeholder imvolvement in effective organisational change has long been recognised (Lewin, 1952) and there are numerous processes for engagement available in the marketplace (Holman and Devane, 1999), techniques that enable workable outcomes in the context of conflict and disagreement are not common. Many of the available techniques fail to effectively include different interests and thus do no support true engagement. They can more accurately be characterised as consultative (often interpreted as management <b>informing</b> <b>workers</b> of change) rather than participative (in which many voices take part in the development of change) since they do not provide less powerful stakeholders with real influence over outcomes. This partly results from reluctance to deal with conflict in organisational change processes; unrealistic performance targets, short timelines, historic conflicts and limited experience of participation can all result in processes that seek to avoid confrontation, rather than using different points of view to engender a creative response.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{abuse of}} {{fixed-term}} contracts raises various concerns. In most countries, fraud {{related to these}} contractual practices may occur when they are used for activities whose nature is not temporary or when they are renewed for longer periods or with a higher number of renewals than those permitted by law. These concerns were already present {{at the end of}} the 1990 s, when some provisions were taken at European level to address the issue. In order to improve the quality of fixed-term work and to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts (excluding apprenticeship and training schemes and temporary agency work contracts), the interprofessional European social partners’ organisations concluded the European framework agreement on fixed-term contracts on 18 March 1999 (ETUC et al, 1999), later transposed into Directive 1999 / 70 /EC. The directive: sets out a general principle of non-discrimination against fixed-term employees compared with permanent employees;details responsibilities on the part of the employer in terms of <b>informing</b> <b>workers</b> on fixed-term contracts about vacancies in the organisation; and sets out measures aimed at preventing abuses. In particular, the directive requires Member States to introduce one or more of the following measures: objective reasons justifying the renewal of fixed-term contracts the maximum total duration of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships...|$|E
40|$|Chemical risk {{protection}} in the workplace relies partly on <b>informing</b> <b>workers</b> about possible risks using {{material safety data sheets}} (MSDS). This article reports on phase 2 of a project (phase 1 reported in Cox et al.), which employed a mental models approach to improve on data sheets as communicative interventions for perchloroethylene in dry cleaning and rosin-based solder flux in the electronics industry within small businesses in the United Kingdom (small enterprises (SEs) < 25 employees in the workplace). It focuses on the efficacy of a multimethod evaluation strategy to assess (1) the capacity of a mental models approach to yield contextually relevant data for intervention design and (2) the effectiveness of the strategy itself in validating the mental models data. The evaluation was conducted using postal questionnaires and semi-structured verbal protocols to provide responses to the alternative intervention content and to prioritize risk messages. User discussion groups were then employed, particularly as a means of establishing whether contextual information could be obtained that would differ qualitatively from the kind elicited through individual (semi) structured methods. We conclude that the mental models approach as part of an iterative process including systematic multimethod evaluation is successful in supporting the design of relevant communications to the users of chemicals. The overall viability of communicative interventions in the context of health and safety in small businesses remains in question. Future research might aim to develop a more holistic approach to interventions in complex occupational contexts...|$|E

40|$|Safety {{and health}} {{management}} system has started since {{last thirty years}} ago. At that time, the systems focused on protecting and <b>informing</b> <b>workers</b> {{with the assumption that}} workplace accidents were generally the result of individual unsafe acts. Safety standards were poor if compared with today, until the introduction of legislation in the 1970 s. It was the first time, law placed responsibilities on employers and managements for ensuring {{the health and safety of}} the workers and the general public. Organizations management were started to view health and safety as an integral part of their business management and kept improving it by involving governmental and non-governmental organizations. Many organizations believed in effective health and safety management as one of the major factors for their profitability, not only contributing to reduce the cost of damage, down time and compensation, but also has significant effects on maximizing team and individual performance. An assessment known as Chemical Hazard Risk Assessment (CHRA) was carried out continuously for the purpose of safety and health improvement at workplace. In this paper, CHRA that was conducted in one of petrochemical companies in Malaysia is reported. Two work units have been chosen in which the workers were exposed to different types of chemical, duration of exposure and different mode of handling. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that the workers are in safe workplace environment. In this assessment, hazards of every chemical were studied by referring to Material Safety Data Sheet or Chemical Safety Data Sheet which provided by chemical suppliers. Every task performed by workers was investigated to find out the safety work practice and degree of hazards released by the chemicals. Once the assessment was completed, actions required to control the risk at the workplace were determined. Results revealed that some work units were good at meeting the safety standards, but with CHRA, better safe workplace could be provided. More intensive enforcement by government agencies such as Department of Organization Safety and Health (DOSH) are required to ensure employers pursue relevant initiatives to meet the safety laws and regulations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. All are in personnel economics, {{using data from the}} trucking industry. Training by firms is a central means by which workers accumulate human capital, yet firms may be reluctant to train if workers can quit and use their gained skills elsewhere. "Training contracts" that impose a penalty for premature quitting can help alleviate this inefficiency. The first essay from this dissertation studies training contracts in the U. S. trucking industry where they are widely used, focusing on data from one leading firm. Exploiting two plausibly exogenous contract changes that introduced penalties for quitting, I confirm that training contracts significantly reduce quitting. To analyze the optimal design of training contracts and their welfare consequences, I develop and estimate a structural learning model with heterogeneous beliefs that accounts for many key features of the data. The estimation combines weekly productivity data with weekly subjective productivity forecasts for each worker and reveals a pattern of persistent overconfidence whereby many workers believe they will achieve higher productivity than they actually attain. If workers are overconfident about their productivity at the firm relative to their outside option, they will be less likely to quit and more likely to sign training contracts. Counterfactual analysis shows that workers' estimated overconfidence increases firm profits by over $ 7, 000 per truck, but reduces worker welfare by 1. 5 %. Banning training contracts decreases profits by $ 4, 600 per truck and decreases retention by 25 %, but increases worker welfare by 4 %. Despite the positive effect of training contracts on profits, training may not be profitable unless some workers are overconfident. A robust finding in experimental psychology and economics is that people tend to be overconfident about their ability. However, much less is known about whether overconfidence can be reduced or eliminated, particularly in field settings. The second essay of this dissertation provides new evidence using data from the workplace. A field experiment with a large trucking firm shows that workers tend to systematically overpredict their productivity and that their overconfidence is unaffected by whether workers receive financial incentives of different sizes for accurate guessing. Randomly <b>informing</b> <b>workers</b> about other workers' overconfidence reduces overconfidence in the short-run, but the effect fades within two weeks. Neither the incentives or information treatments have any effect on worker satisfaction or search behavior. Using long-term survey data from a second firm, I show that experience reduces overconfidence, but only quite slowly. Although workers at both firms exhibit aspects of Bayesian updating, overconfidence appears to be sticky and difficult to change. The third essay analyzes worker referrals. Many firms use referrals in their recruitment and hiring procedures. Are these practices profitable, and if so, why? A model is developed where referrals may improve selection and reduce moral hazard. The model is testedusing extremely detailed personnel and survey data from a leading firm in the trucking industry. Referred workers are similar to non-referred workers across a large number of background characteristics and lab experimentally-measured dimensions of preferences. Referred workers are between 10 - 25 % less likely to quit; the effects are strong across all groups of drivers, including new workers for whom the firm invests in expensive firm-sponsored general training. However, referred workers attain similar initial productivity and productivity growth as non-referred workers, and are no {{more likely to engage in}} various forms of moral hazard. The accumulation of friends after the starting work does not positively affect retention, productivity, or moral hazard. On net, the evidence is consistent with the idea that referrals benefit firms by selecting workers with a better fit for the job, as opposed to selecting workers with higher overall quality, by affecting worker behavior, or by changing job amenities...|$|E
