25|$|One of the {{simplest}} truss styles to implement, the <b>king</b> <b>post</b> consists of two angled supports leaning into a common vertical support.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame of}} the {{building}} is composed largely of oak. The roof frame consists of six sets of rafters. The four interior trusses are composed of doubled rafters, rafter ties, and <b>king</b> <b>posts.</b> The <b>king</b> <b>posts</b> are braced longitudinally through the building by horizontal beams linking them at mid-height, and by diagonal braces which extend from points near the tops and bottoms of the <b>king</b> <b>posts</b> to the midpoints of the horizontal beams.|$|R

25|$|Construction of all Pterodactyl {{aircraft}} was of similar material, predominantly anodized 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, braced with swaged steel cables {{supported by a}} <b>king</b> <b>post,</b> with a sewn Dacron sail for wing covering. Fittings to join the tubing was either extruded or made from sheet, connected with aircraft AN bolts. The sails came {{in a wide variety}} of colour combinations.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} XA {{model is}} constructed from bolted together anodized aluminum tubing, with a fiberglass hull. The wire-braced wing {{is supported by}} a <b>king</b> <b>post</b> and is of aluminum structure, covered with pre-sewn Dacron covers. The wing features 2/3 span ailerons and no flaps. The tail wheel is retractable via a cable control, while the main landing gear is removed by the pilot in flight and stowed in the cockpit for landing on water after a land take-off.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of buildings have wooden roofs, generally {{of a simple}} truss, tie beam or <b>king</b> <b>post</b> form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at the monasteries of Rates or Pa√ßo de Sousa. Some others are completely barrel vaulted or a mix between wooden roofs and a vaulted apse. In later stages rib vaulting started {{to be used as}} an experiment in main altar roofs.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{also holds}} the {{distinction}} of not only being the shortest covered bridge in Parke County but also the only bridge left that is not of Burr Arch construction, it is a four-segment <b>Kings</b> <b>Post</b> truss bridge. It took these honors in 1957 when its sister bridge, the Weisner Covered Bridge, was washed out. The Weisner Covered Bridge had been built {{the year before the}} Phillips Covered Bridge by J.A. Britton also using a four-segment <b>Kings</b> <b>Post</b> truss but was shorter than the Phillips Bridge.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of buildings have wooden roofs, generally {{of a simple}} truss, tie beam or <b>king</b> <b>post</b> form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at Ely and Peterborough cathedrals in England. In churches, typically the aisles are vaulted, but the nave is roofed with timber, {{as is the case}} at both Peterborough and Ely. In Italy where open wooden roofs are common, and tie beams frequently occur in conjunction with vaults, the timbers have often been decorated as at San Miniato al Monte, Florence.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February 1962 her {{conversion}} {{was completed}} to an Advance Aviation Base Ship (one of two ships of the steam-powered LST-1153-class) and redesignated USS Tallahatchie County (AVB-2.) Her aft superstructure was extended forward and her forecastle built up; electronic antennas {{and a heavy}} <b>king</b> <b>post</b> were mounted amidships. As an AVB, Tallahatchie County was designed to provide command and logistic facilities to a squadron of P-2 Neptune or P-3 Orion antisubmarine patrol planes operating from an improvised land base in Souda Bay, Crete. Squadron equipment was carried in mobile vans, transported in Tallahatchie County's tank deck, and landed over her bow ramp.|$|E
500|$|The {{house is}} the finest {{of a number of}} {{timber-frame}} houses in the High Street and The Square. The three-storey building is jettied on two adjacent sides and has three gables on the longer side. [...] On the first and second floors curved brackets can be seen which support the floor above. The structure is based around a single wooden post, known as a <b>king</b> <b>post,</b> at the front corner of the building, which supports the floor boards and the horizontal dragon beams that carry the projection of the upper floors at each level.|$|E
6000|$|Encouraged by this opening, Julian {{asked if}} his {{attendant}} knew why his prison was changed. [...] "To {{teach you to}} become a <b>King's</b> <b>post</b> without commission," [...] answered the fellow.|$|R
25|$|In the {{interior}} {{roof of the}} solar room, the rigid 15th or 16th century structure of <b>king</b> <b>posts,</b> tie beams and principal rafters forms the main frame of the roof, {{as a series of}} triangular trusses.|$|R
50|$|He {{resigned}} the Treasurership of the Chamber {{and retired}} from his other posts in 1616, {{and died in}} 1621. He was succeeded in his peerage (and as Master of the <b>King's</b> <b>Posts)</b> by his son, Charles Stanhope.|$|R
2500|$|Early European truss bridges used <b>king</b> <b>post</b> {{and queen}} post configurations. Some early German bridges {{included}} diagonal panel bracing in trusses with parallel {{top and bottom}} chords. [...] To {{solve the problem of}} deterioration of the wood upon exposure to weather, various forms of covering came to be employed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{queen post}} truss, {{sometimes}} queenpost or queenspost, {{is similar to}} a <b>king</b> <b>post</b> truss in that the outer supports are angled towards the centre of the structure. [...] The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the centre which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.|$|E
2500|$|The chancel {{was built}} in 1499. It has a double plinth course, gargoyles, parapets, coped gables, and angled {{buttress}}es. Each buttress had an east window of five-light panes; {{the north and south}} sections had three-light windows. [...] The chancel was built with a moulded <b>king</b> <b>post</b> truss roof and many rosettes, angels and other carvings. The wide panelled chancel arch has a well preserved Devon-style timber screen.|$|E
50|$|From 1536 The Swan Inn was the {{coaching}} inn, and permitted {{a change of}} horses for the royal couriers of the <b>King's</b> <b>Post</b> en route from London to the coast, before the long climb up the South Downs at Bury Hill.|$|R
5000|$|The Howard Wright 1910 biplane was a two-bay pusher biplane of {{what was}} then {{referred}} to as the [...] "Farman type", two pairs of booms in front of the wings bearing a single elevator and four wire-braced wooden booms behind the wings carrying a single rudder half above and half below a fixed horizontal surface bearing a second elevator. The wings had a mahogany main spar braced with piano-wire and a series of short sheet-metal <b>king</b> <b>posts.</b> Removable extensions could be fitted to the upper wing, each of these being braced from by a pair of additional <b>king</b> <b>posts.</b> The undercarriage consisted of a pair of skids each bearing a pair of wheels attached by shock cords.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is painted plaster and the nave has an open, timbered ceiling supported by <b>king</b> <b>posts</b> and hammer beams. The floors are timber {{and that in}} the sanctuary is raised above the level of the nave. The sanctuary has timber panelled walls and a segmental timber vault.|$|R
2500|$|The {{base model}} Profi wing is a cable-braced, king post-equipped hang glider-style wing for two-place trikes, while the Profi TL is a [...] "topless" [...] design, lacking the <b>king</b> <b>post</b> and using {{streamlined}} lower lift struts instead of wires. The topless design lowers the overall {{height of the}} wing and allows storage in lower-roofed hangars. A carbon fibre leading edge insert is optional, while winglets are standard on the TL model.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reconstruction}} {{work was done}} in Portland at the yard of the Portland Shipbuilding Company. [...] The reconstruction gave Pomona {{the look of a}} completely different vessel. [...] The pilot house, texas, and the name appeared to be among the main remaining features. [...] To clear the Kelso bridge, the <b>king</b> <b>post,</b> hog posts and smokestack were all cut down. [...] New engines and a new boiler were installed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{plan has been}} substantially altered over the centuries, and the interiors [...] modernised. The internal beams of the former buttery are more crudely finished {{than those of the}} parlour, and this wing has a sandstone chimneystack. The staircases date from the late 17th or 18th century; that in number 67 has latticework in the Chinese Chippendale style. The roof truss is unusual in having a short <b>king</b> <b>post</b> from the collar beam.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} a Grade II* listed building. The south porch has a wide outer {{entrance}} with moulded round arch and moulded imposts. The inner door, probably C13th, has a pointed arch with two orders of sunk quadrant moulding. The porch roof has two short <b>king</b> <b>posts</b> rising from collars.|$|R
50|$|The nave has two unequal bays. Its roof, built {{higher than}} that of the chancel and dating from the 15th century, has tie beams and <b>king</b> <b>posts.</b> The aisles {{incorporate}} reworkings of some 14th-century work (in particular, capitals and responds on the pillars) and may even include some older material.|$|R
50|$|In 1685, French fur traders set up {{a trading}} post near Lake Ashuapmushuan that {{remained}} almost continuously in operation {{until the middle of}} the 19th century. It successively came under control of the Traite de Tadoussac (French period), <b>King's</b> <b>Posts</b> (English period), the North West Company (1802), and the Hudson's Bay Company (1821).|$|R
2500|$|The bridge has {{a single}} span, wooden, double pyramidal-shaped Burr-type trusses and {{multiple}} <b>king</b> <b>post</b> truss design {{with the addition of}} steel hanger rods. [...] It is the only bridge in the county to use this design. [...] The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. [...] Both portals to the bridge are painted in red with white trim.|$|E
2500|$|Victorian {{restoration}} {{was carried}} out at the church, as at many ancient churches in Sussex. [...] Spencer Slingsby Stallwood, a Reading-based architect, was commissioned {{to carry out his}} only work at a Sussex church at St Giles' in 1885, in association with his colleague Joseph Morris. [...] The work may have continued until 1888, and involved the construction of a north aisle and arcade, the replacement of the 18th-century <b>king</b> <b>post</b> roof, and some improvements to the north chapel, apparently instead of an earlier scheme (announced in 1840) to rebuild the demolished north transept. [...] The old <b>king</b> <b>post</b> roof had been installed in 1714. [...] Changes inside included the removal of old box pews and a wooden gallery at the west end, which had latterly been used by church musicians. [...] The work cost ¬£2,300. [...] The Saxon doorway, which was once believed to be a [...] "Devil's door", was inserted in the new north aisle during this work. [...] More restoration {{was carried out}} between 1959 and 1960 or 1961 by Brighton architect John Leopold Denman's firm Denman & Son; his work revealed traces of an old Norman window in the nave.|$|E
2500|$|Inside the church, {{remnants}} of the original Norman building {{can be seen at}} opposite ends: in the west wall of the nave and the east end of the chancel. [...] The chancel, nave and aisles were rebuilt (to the same dimensions as the original building) when English Gothic architecture was at its height, and the chamfered arches, octagonal pillars, chancel arch, blind arches and mouldings are considered good examples of their kind. [...] The <b>king</b> <b>post</b> roof of the nave has also been praised.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} superficially {{resembled the}} Bl√©riot XI {{in terms of}} overall configuration but was in almost every design detail different from this aircraft. Like the Bl√©riot, control was effected using wing-warping via wires attached to <b>king</b> <b>posts.</b> However the Macfie monoplane incorporated many innovative features and in particular was designed for ease of construction, maintenance and repair.|$|R
50|$|The fate of MV Fairwind was not {{positively}} established until August 2009, {{when her}} wreck {{was found in}} deep water off South West Rocks {{by a team of}} amateur divers. The wreck sits upright at a depth of 87 m. The wreck itself is mostly intact, with the forward and aft <b>king</b> <b>posts</b> projecting 15 m from the seabed.|$|R
25|$|Inside, {{the lack}} of a chancel arch creates a large single space, {{enhanced}} by the nave and aisles having the same roofline. The roof is timber-framed with <b>king</b> <b>posts,</b> tie-beams and double trusses (in the absence of a chancel arch, these form the only demarcation between the nave and chancel). There is also a smaller timber-framed roof in the separate south chapel.|$|R
