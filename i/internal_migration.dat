5|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>migration</b> was {{likewise}} {{instrumental in}} the development of the new domains emerging in former royal lands. The new landholders granted personal freedom and more favorable financial conditions to those who arrived in their estates, which also enabled the peasants who decided not to move to improve their position. BélaIV granted privileges to more than a dozen towns, including Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia) and Pest.|$|E
5|$|Settlements were a type {{of rural}} {{locality}} that first appeared in Adygea during the Soviet times.

5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved {{to the center of}} the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more <b>internal</b> <b>migration</b> into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Unemployment {{resulting}} from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed.

The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections.

5|$|As of 2013, Ratanakiri Province had a {{population}} of approximately 184,000. Its population nearly doubled between 1998 and 2013, largely due to <b>internal</b> <b>migration.</b> In 2013, Ratanakiri made up 1.3% of Cambodia's total population; its population density of 17.0 residents per square kilometer was just over one fifth the national average. About 70% of the province's population lives in the highlands; of the other 30%, approximately half live in more urbanized towns, and half live along rivers and in the lowlands, where they practice wetland rice cultivation and engage in market activities. Banlung, the provincial capital located in the central highlands, {{is by far the}} province's largest town, with {{a population}} of approximately 25,000. Other significant towns include Veun Sai in the north and Lomphat in the south, with populations of 2,000 and 3,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Kurds are {{the largest}} non-Turkic ethnicity, around 18–25 percent of the population.

In addition, due to <b>internal</b> <b>migration,</b> Kurdish communities exist in all major cities in central and western Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, where there are an estimated 3 million Kurds, making Istanbul the city with the largest Kurdish population in the world. The minorities besides the Kurds are thought to make up an estimated 7–12 percent of the population.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{concentrations}} of Nahuatl speakers {{are found in}} the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, and Guerrero. Significant populations are also found in the State of Mexico, Morelos, and the Federal District, with smaller communities in Michoacán and Durango. Nahuatl became extinct in the states of Jalisco and Colima during the 20th century. As a result of <b>internal</b> <b>migration</b> within the country, Nahuatl speaking communities exist in all states in Mexico. The modern influx of Mexican workers and families into the United States has resulted in the establishment of a few small Nahuatl speaking communities in that country, particularly in California, New York, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of <b>internal</b> <b>migration,</b> especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Białystok {{has been}} a {{destination}} for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, {{there was a significant}} Jewish majority in Białystok. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). Białystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this, in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Białystok, but in 1946 – only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tatars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on <b>internal</b> <b>migration</b> within Poland and urbanization of surrounding areas.|$|E

40|$|In Italy, between 1995 and 2005, {{the changes}} of {{residence}} between Italian municipalities increased of nearly 19 %.

Structural factors and a greater propensity to mobility may partly explain the foreign population’s contribution to internal mobility. This work aims at assessing the structural characteristics of <b>internal</b> <b>migrations</b> of the foreign and the Italian population. Besides the classical measures, we adopt a gravitational model which allows to quantify the effects on internal mobility due to the dimension of the populations in the areas of origin and destination and the distance between macro-areas. The estimates obtained for the years 1995, 2000 and 2005, clearly highlights the different behaviours of Italians and foreigners and a different evolution of phenomenon...|$|R

25|$|Under-reporting {{of deaths}} {{was also a}} problem. The death {{registration}} system, which was inadequate before the famine, was completely overwhelmed by {{the large number of}} deaths during the famine. In addition, many deaths went unreported so that family members of the deceased could continue to draw the deceased's food ration. Counting the number of children who both were born and died between the 1953 and 1964 censuses is problematic. However, Ashton, et al. believe that because the reported number of births during the GLF seems accurate, the reported number of deaths should be accurate as well. Massive <b>internal</b> <b>migration</b> made both population counts and registering deaths problematic, though Yang believes the degree of unofficial <b>internal</b> <b>migration</b> was small and Cao's estimate takes <b>internal</b> <b>migration</b> into account.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, the {{population}} of Catalonia was 1,966,382 people and in 1970 it was 5,122,567.

40|$|<b>Internal</b> Westward <b>Migration</b> in Germany: 1989 - 1994 Amy Hubbard Abstract: Contemporary German {{history has}} been beleaguered with political, social, and {{economic}} upheaval, the consequences of which have led to its modern day composition. One such consequence of Germany's past {{is the problem of}} <b>internal</b> westward <b>migration</b> between 1989 and 1994. This analysis looks at the political, social, and economic factors that have led to the increase of <b>internal</b> westward <b>migration</b> from the states of the former German Democratic Republic to the states of the former Federal Republic of Germany. The political, social, and economic developments of the German Democratic Republic combined with the reunification process have led to a feeling of insecurity in the east. People with a strong sense of political, social, or economic insecurity will have a stronger propensity to migration to a stable environment. A variety of governmental programs have been developed to quell the problem but they have been widely unsuccessful. Additionally, there have been a series of negative consequences caused by the existence of <b>internal</b> westward <b>migration</b> on such a scale, such as, the rise of extremist parties in the eastern states of Germa...|$|R
