40|$|Background: Minimally {{invasive}} direct {{coronary artery}} bypass (MIDCAB) grafting is an accepted therapeutical option especially in multimorbid, elderly and reoperative patients with single vessel disease. To expand the benefits of MIDCAB to patients with multivessel disease, an interdisciplinary hybrid approach was recently introduced. This study comprises follow-up information by coronary re-angiography. Methods: 35 patients (29 male, 6 female, mean age 56. 7 +/- 17 years) underwent a "hybrid" revascularisation using a primary MIDCAB procedure with LIMA bypass to LAD followed by staged angioplasty and stenting of additional coronary lesions. Follow-up was performed in the outpatient department {{at the time of}} control angiography. Results: After an uneventful <b>hybrid</b> <b>revascularisation</b> without procedure related complications, all patients were alive and angina-free with normal-stress ECG after 11. 4 +/- 7. 7 months postoperatively. Control angiography (n = 14) revealed a patency rate of 100 % (LIMA bypasses) and 93. 3 % (PTCA), respectively. Conclusions: The "hybrid" approach to myocardial revascularisation is safe and effective for complete revascularisation in selected patients with multivessel involvement. Especially elderly and reoperative patients with significant comorbidity may benefit from hybrid procedures avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midsternotomy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{expand the}} {{benefits}} of the minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) concept to patients with multivessel disease, a hybrid procedure combining surgical revascularisation of the left anterior descending artery with interventional procedures for additional coronary lesions has recently been introduced. Preliminary results in patients undergoing this hybrid procedure are presented.  DESIGN AND PATIENTS—Since December 1996,  35  patients (29  male, 6  female, mean (SD) age 56. 7  (17) years) underwent a <b>hybrid</b> <b>revascularisation</b> performed as a primary MIDCAB procedure for grafting of the left anterior descending artery with the left internal mammary artery, followed by staged angioplasty and stenting of additional coronary lesions.  RESULTS—After MIDCAB grafting the postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. Coronary reangiography after a median of seven days revealed patent and functioning left internal mammary artery grafts in all patients. Applying subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and occasional stenting (n =  14), a total of 47  lesions were treated successfully. Procedure related complications did not occur. All patients remained free from angina and no stress ECG changes were recorded.  CONCLUSIONS—The preliminary results of this hybrid approach to myocardial revascularisation suggest that this is a safe and effective procedure for complete revascularisation in selected patients with multivessel disease. Elderly and reoperative patients with significant comorbidity may benefit especially from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and mid sternotomy.    Keywords: hybrid revascularisation; minimally invasive cardiac surgery; interventional treatment; multivessel revascularisatio...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Hybrid</b> {{coronary}} <b>revascularisation</b> (HCR) for multi-vessel {{coronary artery}} disease combines surgical bypass grafting for the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for non-LAD coronary arteries. The present systematic review was conducted to assess the available evidence on robotic-assisted HCR and explore the potential advantages and disadvantages it proposes. Methods: A comprehensive search from six electronic databases was performed for studies reporting outcomes for robotic-assisted <b>hybrid</b> coronary <b>revascularisation.</b> Eight studies were identified from six electronic databases amenable for qualitative assessment and pooled quantitative analysis. Results: There were no in-hospital deaths reported. Pooled myocardial infarction rates was 1. 2 % (range 0 - 3. 7 %), pooled strokes was 0. 8 % (range: 0 - 1. 7 %), freedom from reintervention was 92. 5 % (range 70. 4 - 100 %), and freedom from angina was 92. 9 % (range 74. 3 - 100 %). LITA patency ranged from 89 - 100 %, while hospital stay ranged from 4 - 8. 1 days. Conclusions: The current data suggests potentially acceptable mortality and complication rates, when patients are carefully selected and operated on by expert cardiovascular teams. However, due to the heterogeneous {{nature of the evidence}} and lack of long-term outcomes, this promising technique warrants future comparative and randomised studies before becoming a part of mainstay coronary interventions. 9 page(s...|$|R
