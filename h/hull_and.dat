5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} of hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and flavanols were estimated in <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> de-hulled seeds of buckwheat breeding lines.

5|$|The {{design for}} the Königsbergs was {{prepared}} in 1913. The design was an incremental improvement over the previous , with a larger <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> greater displacement, but with the same armament, speed, and armor protection. By 1916, thirteen German light cruisers had {{been lost in the}} course of World War I; after they were commissioned, the ships of the Königsberg class took the names of four of these lost cruisers.|$|E

5|$|The <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> turrets of the T-26 mod. 1931 had {{a maximum}} armour {{thickness}} of 13–15mm (until 1938, see below), which {{was sufficient to}} withstand light machine gun fire. Many twin-turreted tanks of the first series had 10mm armour plates of low quality, which could be penetrated by 7.62mm armour-piercing bullets from 150m.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{condition}} of the Betelgeuse for which its operator, Total S.A., was to blame: Immediately before the incident, the vessel's <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> tanks were cracked, corroded, and leaking. The 11-year-old vessel had been worked hard and {{was at the end}} of her service life.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron <b>hull,</b> <b>and</b> total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E

5|$|The town of Hull {{was founded}} {{late in the}} 12th century. The monks of Meaux Abbey needed a port where the wool from their estates could be exported. They chose {{a place at the}} {{confluence}} of the rivers <b>Hull</b> <b>and</b> Humber to build a quay.|$|E
5|$|There were rumours that Levant would swiftly {{return to}} active service, but these proved unfounded and she {{remained}} tied up at Portsmouth.

5|$|Train {{operators}} {{active in}} the area are Northern, Virgin Trains East Coast and TransPennine Express. Hull Trains is an 'open access' operator established in 2002 running fast services between London and Hull. Bus services are provided by several operators including FirstGroup, which provides services from the East Riding into York, Goole Town Service and also services from Goole to Doncaster. Stagecoach provides services from the East Riding to <b>Hull</b> <b>and</b> into Lincolnshire, and East Yorkshire Motor Services, historically the dominant area operator, provides a wide variety of bus services throughout the East Riding. Yorkshire Coastliner provides services from Bridlington to Malton, York and Leeds. Holderness Area Rural Transport, a charity, provides a community transport service for North Holderness, taking people to medical appointments in <b>Hull</b> <b>and</b> to the shops.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the vehicle}} entered service in 1955 {{and in the}} same year the No. 174 Works located in Omsk began {{producing}} the <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> turrets, the first vehicles were completed in 1957 [...] after the first 249 57mm twin S-68 guns were produced by the Artillery Works No. 946 located in Krasnoyarsk. A total of 5,300 of these weapons were produced {{by the end of the}} 1950s. The <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> turrets were produced by No. 174 Works where the final assembly also took place while the Krasnoyarsk Works, belonging to the Ministry of Heavy Engineering, participated in some production stages. The ZSU-57-2 remained in production until 1960 when the No. 174 Works stopped producing the <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> turrets for ZSU-57-2. More than 2,023 ZSU-57-2s were produced in Soviet Union.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E

Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis <b>Hull</b> <b>and</b> the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score.

5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop <b>hull,</b> <b>and</b> oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of Ditylenchus destructor following storage of infected <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> seeds of groundnut cv. Sellie and infested soil, {{and the capacity}} of D. destructor to undergo complete dehydration and enter {{in a state of}} anhydrobiosis was investigated. The results show that D. destructor can survive in the field in the absence of host plants <b>and</b> in <b>hulls</b> left in the field after harvest for at least 28 to 32 weeks. In contrast, nematode numbers in fragmented <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> fragmented or whole seeds stored in paper bags at 10 -degrees-C (whole seeds) or 22 -degrees-C (fragmented <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> seeds) decreased with increasing storage time, especially during the first 12 weeks. Very few nematodes survived in whole seeds stored in paper bags at 10 -degrees-C but the surviving nematodes were able to build up large populations and to cause damage. Finally, the results show that the freshness of the tissues {{played an important role in}} the efficiency of the soaking method : stored <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> seeds must be soaked longer than 24 h to make a reliable estimate of the number of nematodes present. status: publishe...|$|R
