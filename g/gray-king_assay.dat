30|$|Using the ISO {{classification}} {{in which}} the free swelling index or Roga index determines the group number, the volatile matter (daf) up to 33 % and the calorific value (MJ/kg) above 33 % of the volatile matter determine the class number, the dilatometric or <b>Gray-King</b> <b>assay</b> parameter determines the sub-group number, the Tai, Garin Maiganga and Shankodi-Jangwa coal samples are of 900, 800 and 622 classes, respectively. The first number indicates the class of the coal, the second number indicates the group of the coal and the third number indicates the sub-group number.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of sulfur {{forms in the}} products of low temperature pyrolysis of Carboniferous high sulfur coal from Northwest China was investigated. The typical method of <b>Gray-King</b> <b>assay</b> was used {{to carry out the}} low temperature pyrolysis experiments. GC-MS analysis was used to investigate the composition of sulfur compounds in the coal tar. The results show that sulfur mainly remained in the semi-coke and accounted for 80. 97 % of the total sulfur. Pyrites decomposed and transformed into sulfates and organic sulfur. 5 sulfur containing compounds were detected in the coal tar and they are dibenzothiophene, benzonaphthothiophene and their substituted homologs...|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis of Shenmu coal was {{performed}} in fixed-bed reactors indirectly heated by reducing operating pressure and mounting internals in the reactor to explore their synergetic effects on coal pyrolysis. Mounting internals particularly designed greatly improved the heat transfer inside coal bed and raised the yield of tar production. Reducing pressure further facilitated the production of tar through its suppression of secondary reactions occurring in the reactor. The absolute increase in tar yield reached 3. 33 wt% {{in comparison with the}} pyrolysis in the reactor without internals under atmospheric pressure. The obtained tar yield in the reactor with internals under reduced pressurewas even higher than the yield of <b>Gray-King</b> <b>assay.</b> Through experiments in a laboratory fixed bed reactor, it was also clarified that the effect of reducing pressure is related to volatile release rate in pyrolysis. It did not obviously vary tar yield at pyrolysis temperatures below 600 degrees C, while the effect was evident at 650 and 700 degrees C but became limited again above 800 degrees C. Under reduced pressure the produced tar contained more aliphatics and phenols but less aromatics. (C) 2016 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press.

40|$|The Nigerian Enugu and Polish Bellview coals were {{subjected}} to proximate analysis and <b>Gray-King</b> coke <b>assay</b> type tests. Proximate analysis gave the ash content as 7. 57 and 5. 56 %, the volatile content as 51. 76 and 31. 06 %, respectively for Enugu and Bellview coals. For the <b>Gray-King</b> coke type <b>assay</b> test, the coke types of B and G, the percentage coke yield of 71. 70 and 80. 40 % and percentage tar yield of 23. 30 and 11. 40 %, respectively, were determined for Enugu and Bellview coals. The coke type, the ash content and percentage coke yield confirms Bellview coal as a medium coking coal, suitable for cokemaking but with a volatile content that exceeds the upper limit of 30. 3 % for cokemaking at Ajaokuta and Enugu coal as a high volatile non-caking coal. However, the higher yield of tar from Enugu coal may be an advantage in its use as a binder in producing formed coke...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{sustainability}} of biomass pyrolysis requires a thorough assessment of the product yields and energy densities. With this purpose, a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor (FBR) was adapted from the standard <b>Gray-King</b> (GK) <b>assay</b> test on coal to conduct fixed bed pyrolysis experiments on agricultural and agro-industrial by-products. The present study provides results on the pyrolysis of two types of biomass: chipped olive tree trimmings (OT) and olive pomace (OP). Solid (char) and liquid (tar) product yields are reported. Mass yields are determined and compared with values obtained in similar works. Results indicate that char yield decreases from 49 % (OT-db) and 50 % (OP-db) at 325 °C to 26 % (OT db) and 30 % (OP-db) at 650 °C. Tar yield is almost constant (42 %) at different reaction temperatures for OT, while it decreases slightly from 42 % to 35 % for OP. Energy density of the products at different peak temperatures is almost constant for OT (1. 2), but slightly increases for OP (from a value of 1. 3 to a value of 1. 4) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{fluidized bed}} (IFB) consisting of an upper transport bed section and a bottom fluidized bed section was adopted {{to investigate the}} transport bed coal pyrolysis by varying its reaction temperature and reaction atmosphere adjusted to simulate steam-containing syngas produced by the bottom fluidized bed char gasification. Steam and syngas, in comparison with N- 2, as the reaction atmosphere little affected the tar yield below 600 degrees C but significantly decreased it for the former and increased it for the latter at rather higher temperatures. The presence of H- 2 in the syngas increased tar yield significantly because it could suppress polymerization and condensation reactions through providing H as radical stabilizer and hydrogenation agent. In the steam-containing syngas atmosphere, the tar yield obtained from transport bed rapid pyrolysis increased rapidly with raising temperature to a peak value of 10. 5 wt. % (daf) at 600 degrees C, about 1. 1 wt. % higher than the <b>Gray-King</b> <b>assay</b> yield, and then decreased due to the excessive secondary reactions. Analyzing tar composition further showed that steam-containing syngas combined their respective advantages that syngas improved the yields of both light and heavy tars while steam reduced the heavy tar yield, especially at temperatures above 600 degrees C. The steam-containing syngas atmosphere also promoted CH 4 production in comparison with syngas atmosphere below 700 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
