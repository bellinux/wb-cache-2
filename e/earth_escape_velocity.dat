5000|$|In the future, the {{possibility}} of black hole production at the highest energy accelerators may arise if certain predictions of superstring theory are accurate. This and other possibilities have led to public safety concerns that have been widely reported {{in connection with the}} LHC, which began operation in 2008. The various possible dangerous scenarios have been assessed as presenting [...] "no conceivable danger" [...] in the latest risk assessment produced by the LHC Safety Assessment Group. If black holes are produced, it is theoretically predicted that such small black holes should evaporate extremely quickly via Bekenstein-Hawking radiation, but which is as yet experimentally unconfirmed. If colliders can produce black holes, cosmic rays (and particularly ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, UHECRs) must have been producing them for eons, but they have yet to harm anybody. It has been argued that to conserve energy and momentum, any black holes created in a collision between an UHECR and local matter would necessarily be produced moving at relativistic speed with respect to the Earth, and should escape into space, as their accretion and growth rate should be very slow, while black holes produced in colliders (with components of equal mass) would have some chance of having a velocity less than <b>Earth</b> <b>escape</b> <b>velocity,</b> 11.2 km per sec, and would be liable to capture and subsequent growth. Yet even on such scenarios the collisions of UHECRs with white dwarfs and neutron stars would lead to their rapid destruction, but these bodies are observed to be common astronomical objects. Thus if stable micro black holes should be produced, they must grow far too slowly to cause any noticeable macroscopic effects within the natural lifetime of the solar system.|$|E

5000|$|A space gun, {{sometimes}} called a Verne gun {{because of its}} appearance in From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, is a method of launching an object into space using a large gun- or cannonlike structure. Space guns could thus potentially provide a method of non-rocket spacelaunch. It has been conjectured that space guns could place satellites into Earth's orbit (although after-launch propulsion of the satellite {{would be necessary to}} achieve a stable orbit), and could also launch spacecraft beyond Earth's gravitational pull and into other parts of the Solar System by exceeding <b>Earth's</b> <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> of about 11.2 km/s or 40320 kph mph.

40|$|Two small {{satellite}} {{concepts are}} presented for low cost Mars system exploration. Both concepts use solar electric propulsion (SEP) {{to move from}} a low velocity Earth escape orbit to captured Mars orbits, and so {{are able to make}} use of smaller launcher vehicles, while still providing significant payload accommodation, despite their small size. Both missions achieve their Mars system operational orbits in less than 20 months from launch. The Mars Global Atmosphere Survey (MGAS) mission design has a launch mass of 120 kg. It uses a QinetiQ T 5 ion engine, with around 24 kg of Xe propellant, which provides sufficient ÄV for transfer to a low Mars orbit. Payload mass is around 12 kg, dependent on <b>Earth</b> <b>escape</b> <b>velocity,</b> required final Mars orbit, and the time permitted for the transfer. The small launch mass allows a number of such spacecraft to be launched together on either Soyuz, DNEPR or Rockot-Breeze launchers, so providing a small Mars constellation. This fact was exploited by the proposed payload which uses the RF occultation method to measure temperature, density and pressure at the limb, aiding the characterisation of global circulation of the Martian atmosphere. The Mars Phobos and Deimos Survey (MPADS), at 320 kg launch mass, is a minisatellite. It uses the larger QinetiQ T 6 ion engine, with around 50 kg of Xe propellant, with payload mass of 60 kg. The spacecraft enters a large circular Mars orbit which is gradually reduced in size by electric propulsion in order to rendezvous with the Martian moons. The mission consists of either a single satellite visiting both moons, or two spacecraft, one at each moon, with the option of providing a lander package on one. These concepts have been studied under national funding with the aim of defining highly cost-effective options for the delivery of on-board instrumentation into Mars orbit, for remote sensing, or deployment of lander packages for Mars or Mars moon surface exploration. The mission design process reported considers all aspects of spacecraft bus, payload, trajectory and operations. The low thrust trajectory design and tradeoffs are described in some detail.

The absence of a large amount of collisional debris in the less than 50 microns size range indicates these large micrometeorites are not the few, rare survivors of a mostly collisionally disrupted population. The measured space exposure ages, which are about an order of magnitude larger than their calculated catastrophic collision lifetimes, confirm the survival of these large micrometeorites for times much longer than the calculated catastrophic collision lifetimes.

Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.|$|R
40|$|Solar Thermal Propulsion (STP) is {{a concept}} which {{operates}} by transferring solar energy to a propellant, which thermally expands through a nozzle. The specific impulse performance is about twice that of chemical combustions engines, {{since there is no}} need for an oxidizer.

The primary application of STP is with upperstages taking payloads from low earth orbit to geosynchronous earth orbit or <b>earth</b> <b>escape</b> <b>velocities.</b> STP engines are made of high temperature materials since heat exchanger operation requires temperatures greater than 2500 K. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium have been examined. The materials must also be compatible with hot hydrogen propellant.

Future engines will be made of high temperature carbide materials, which can withstand temperatures greater than 3000 K, hot hydrogen, and provide higher performance. A specific impulse greater than 1000 seconds greatly reduces the amount of required propellant. A special 1 OkW solar ground test facility was made at MSFC to test various STP engine designs. The heliostat mirror, with dual-axis gear drive, tracks and reflects sunlight to the 18 ft. diameter concentrator mirror.
