On 28 September 2007, former Solicitor General and retired Senator of the College of Justice, Lord McCluskey, gave an interview to The Herald stating that he believed Lord Hamilton had no grounds to accuse Elish Angiolini of threatening the independence of the judiciary. He is quoted as saying, 'He's quite wrong. What he fails to see is that it is sometimes essential for a minister to comment upon a case. It <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in parliament'.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know where they are going. This <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|E

Jaffrey commented, [...] "I {{really wanted to do}} the role because Indian women are usually portrayed as so proper and withdrawn – the kind of women who just stay at home cooking and cleaning. I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.' What my character has done <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in India; {{there are all kinds of}} stories of people running away and marrying their lovers. This is what commonly happens in those places, but somehow the image of Indian womanhood is different." [...] Pushpa was a guest character only appearing for the duration of a storyline that revealed Dan had been lying about her death and had actually left him for another man, Pradeep (Kaleem Janjua) Dan's best friend.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

There is no such thing in reality as rebirth or reincarnation. If all is anattā, there is nothing to get reborn.

That means that birth is <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> but it is never the same person being born a second time.

Winter contrasted any possible punishment of Henry with the two-month ban issued to Diego Maradona for simply 'insulting reporters'. Diana Worman on Aljazeera.net criticised FIFA's decision to investigate Henry for an act that <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and would have only warranted a yellow card, writing [...] "Henry should never have been expected to make a 'sportsmanlike' decision after the goal and it's unfair for Fifa to make an example of him". The Canadian Press criticised FIFA's [...] "cowardly" [...] decision to investigate Henry and do nothing to change the situation for the 2010 World Cup.
