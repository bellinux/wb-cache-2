5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the species}} of birds found in Egypt, a country in {{north-east}} Africa. The avifauna of Egypt include a total of 498 species of birds, of which thirteen are classified as globally threatened and five <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> having been introduced to Egypt. None of the species are endemic to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), {{common mullein}} (Verbascum thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species {{that have been}} {{recognized}} more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|E

5|$|Finance and {{professional}} services, tourism and culture, and computer and internet based services <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> growth industries in Greater Manchester and {{are concentrated in}} Manchester and Salford. Average house prices in the City of Salford are sixth {{out of all the}} metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester, 7.6% lower than the average for the county. There are, however, areas of considerable affluence, within the city, such as Broughton Park, parts of Kersal, Ellesmere Park, Worsley, parts of Swinton and Pendlebury and the ultra-modern Salford Quays.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among the destinations Paris was the most important, but also Cologne, Orléans, Wittenberg, Louvain and Vienna.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD435 and AD437. In 1995 a tomb {{underneath}} the talud-tablero Hunal temple {{was discovered by}} a team of archaeologists led by Robert Sharer and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.|$|E

5|$|Pigments {{responsible}} for the orange to red colors of the mature fruit bodies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> carotenes, predominantly lycopene and beta-carotene—the same compounds {{responsible for}} the red and orange colors of tomatoes and carrots, respectively. Lycopene is also the main pigment in the closely related fungus Clathrus archeri, while beta-carotene is the predominant pigment in the Phallaceae species Mutinus caninus, M.ravenelii, and M.elegans.|$|E
5|$|The Hills {{conceal the}} largest {{underground}} river system in Britain; attempts {{to move from}} one cave to another through the underground rivers {{led to the development of}} cave diving in Britain. The first cave dive was attempted at Swildon's Hole in 1934, and the first successful dive was achieved the following year at Wookey Hole Caves, which has the deepest sump in Britain at 76m (250ft). The cave complexes at St. Dunstan's Well Catchment, Lamb Leer, and Priddy Caves <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Sites of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
5|$|The chapter-general re-elected Vermigli to the Spoletan abbacy in 1534 {{and again}} in 1535, {{but he was not}} elected to lead any house the {{following}} year. He may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a promising reformer who could help with reform efforts in higher places. Vermigli was in contact with the Catholic leaders working on the Consilium de emendanda ecclesia, an internal report on potential reforms of the Church commissioned by Pope PaulIII. He may have even travelled to Rome to assist in writing it.|$|E

5|$|The {{comparative}} {{simplicity and}} regularity of the cerebellar anatomy {{led to an}} early hope that it might imply a similar simplicity of computational function, as expressed {{in one of the}} first books on cerebellar electrophysiology, The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E
5|$|The first fortifications in Malta {{were built}} during the Bronze Age. At least six sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> {{possible}} fortified settlements. The best preserved {{of these is}} the village of Borġ in-Nadur, close to the modern town of Birżebbuġa. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar access to their village. The wall was built facing inland, showing that the people living in the village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Thelephoric acid {{is present}} in several Hydnellum species. This compound, derived metabolically from the shikimic acid pathway, {{inhibits}} the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in deteriorating certain neuropeptides that are believed to contribute to memory and learning. Hydnellum caeruleum and H.concrescens have several para-terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins (specifically, variants thelephantins I–N), some of which can inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The compounds hydnellins A and B are terphenyls found in H. suaveolens and Hydnellum geogerirum. The chemicals responsible for the fragrant anise-like aroma of H.suaveolens <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> coumarin and para-anisaldehyde.|$|E
