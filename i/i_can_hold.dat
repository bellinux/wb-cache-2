500|$|The {{next day}} Presley {{recorded}} [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] and [...] "Gentle on My Mind", leaving the studio {{while working on}} the latter to rest his throat. The following night, he did not appear, as his cold worsened, and on January 15 and 16 the house band recorded backing tracks for subsequent sessions. Presley returned on January 20, recording [...] "In the Ghetto" [...] in 23 takes and finishing the vocal track for [...] "Gentle on My Mind". On January 22, he recorded Eddy Arnold's [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Hold</b> You in My Arms)" [...] and the non-album single [...] "Suspicious Minds". Presley then took a break from recording for a vacation trip to Aspen, Colorado to celebrate his daughter Lisa Marie's first birthday.|$|E
500|$|The twelve {{tracks on}} the album were {{selected}} from thirty-one which were recorded in the American Sound sessions. The first song, [...] "Wearin' That Loved On Look" [...] features an electric-bass lead {{for the first time}} in a Presley recording. The second is [...] "Only the Strong Survive", with Presley backed by bass and drums. He plays piano on the third track, the country song [...] "I Hold You in My Heart ('Till <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Hold</b> You in My Arms)". Presley's voice is roughened by a cold on the fourth song, the country-rhythm-and-blues [...] "Long Black Limousine" [...] featuring a trumpet solo. The fifth song, Johnny Tillotson's traditional country-western [...] "It Keeps Right on A-Hurtin'", was arranged to sound more like Memphis soul. Side one ends with a version of Hank Snow's country-western [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] with a strong bass line and driving rhythm.|$|E
500|$|The book, or {{elements}} of it, {{has been mentioned}} multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in this way. In 2004, MAD magazine published [...] "The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which George W. Bush's State of the Union promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), [...] "I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake! [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> up these books! [...] And the fish on a rake!" [...] In 2007, during the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor. He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for [...] "If {{you go back and}} read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess." [...] In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.|$|E

500|$|Prior to performing, Staton {{received}} a 12-page document that outlined the story, {{and the history}} of Phelps. He has said that he received the document as there wasn't enough time to read the 2,200-page script before filming began. Staton cumulatively worked on L.A. Noire for about eighteen months. He said, [...] "consecutively I think I worked six months, and then for the next year here and there picking things up, adding, changing and tweaking things". When discussing his character, McGowan felt that Bekowsky was initially jealous of Phelps, but eventually warmed up to him. [...] "Like a good older brother he'll always have his back but will never take shit from him," [...] he said. McGrady, who portrayed Rusty Galloway, said his own introverted personality helped him connect to the character. [...] "I am a classic introvert but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> court when I need to. I think Rusty is that way too," [...] McGrady said. Harrington described Roy as [...] "jaded, tough, mean, cruel, brutally honest and ... very funny". He took credit for all of Roy's facial expressions, but said that all of the dialogue was scripted, as opposed to ad-lib. Many characters in the game are influenced by real people and events; for example, Captain Donnelly is loosely based on both McNamara's father, and LAPD Captain Jack Donahue. Additionally, many cases that Phelps solves are based off real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case.|$|E
500|$|... "Something New" [...] was {{recorded}} in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. [...] "Something New" [...] opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing [...] "Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / You boys better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show" [...] over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, [...] "after a generic dance beat kicks in, {{the rest of the}} track is a mish-mash of rap and mixed solos." [...] As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, [...] "All I want is something new / Something <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> on to / I don’t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby let it drop / Catch me if you can." [...] Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns [...] "to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound." [...] It ends with the group shouting, [...] "Boy you better watch your back / Cause we're the leaders of the pack." [...] A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] (2007), and thought that [...] "Something New" [...] echoed the group's previous single, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), {{not only because of the}} title, [...] "but it also has the same slightly demented feel to it, all distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit." [...] Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's [...] "odd" [...] structure, which is noted as [...] "typical" [...] and the group's [...] "signature style".|$|E

2500|$|Starting with Josiah Gilbert Holland's 1866 Life of Abraham Lincoln, {{a number}} of sources recount an anecdote about Douglas at Lincoln's first inauguration.

Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and do you do it? Well I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth as long as I could hold a tone.

2500|$|Hood {{then moved}} {{to the west and}} crossed the Coosa River in the {{vicinity}} of Rome, Georgia, near the Alabama state line. He turned north in the direction of Resaca, Georgia, and joined with Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry, which had been previously raiding in Tennessee. On October 12, Hood demanded the surrender of the Union brigade stationed at Resaca and left Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps there to invest the city. The 700 Union men under Col. Clark R. Weaver refused Hood's ultimatum to surrender, which warned that no prisoners would be taken. Weaver replied [...] "In my opinion <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> this post. If you want it, come and take it." [...] Hood declined to attack the Union position because he believed that it would be too costly, instead bypassing the city, moving north, and continuing the destruction of the railroad.|$|E

Later that episode, in his most serious crime, he knocked down Juanita [...] "Mama" [...] Solis with his car while drunk. Mama survived this but was in a coma in {{hospital}} and died later after waking up from the coma and falling down stairs. His parents help him cover it up but Andrew doesn't feel any remorse for his crime. He continues to misbehave and Bree gets him dropped from the school swim team for smoking marijuana in an attempt to make him regret his actions. Further angered by her refusal to allow Rex to convalesce from heart surgery at home, Andrew threatens, [...] "You wanna see how long <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> a grudge? Go ahead and abandon my father because I promise you will be sorry." [...] When he finds out about his father's adultery, however, he apologizes to Bree and is angry with Rex.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} the {{strength}} was estimated at 68,000 rifles and sabres and morale of the Ottoman defenders very strong, the harvest coming in and food abundant. While the EEF was defending its line with every available unit. As Allenby {{wrote in a letter}} to the War Office on 15 June 1918, [...] "all my goods are in the shop window." [...] The [...] EEF line stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River was strong, supported by roads and communications behind. However the line was wide in comparison with the size of the EEF it. Allenby saying, [...] "It is the best line <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold.</b> Any retirement would weaken it. My right flank is covered by the Jordan; my left by the Mediterranean Sea. The Jordan Valley must be held by me; it is vital. If the Turks regained control of the Jordan, I should lose control of the Dead Sea. This would cut me off from the Arabs on the Hedjaz railway; with the result that, shortly, the Turks would regain their power in the Hedjaz. The Arabs would make terms with them, and our prestige would be gone. My right flank would be turned, and my position in Palestine would be untenable. I might hold Rafa or El Arish; but you can imagine what effect such a withdrawal would have on the population of Egypt, and on the watching tribes of the Western Desert. You see, therefore, that I cannot modify my present dispositions. I must give up nothing of what I now hold. Anyhow, I must hold the Jordan Valley." ...|$|E

2500|$|December 13 began {{cold and}} overcast. A dense fog {{blanketed}} {{the ground and}} {{made it impossible for}} the armies to see each other. Franklin ordered his I Corps commander, Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, to select a division for the attack. Reynolds chose his smallest division, about 4,500 men commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, and assigned Brig. Gen. John Gibbon's division to support Meade's attack. His reserve division, under Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday, was to face south and protect the left flank between the Richmond Road and the river. Meade's division began moving out at 8:30a.m., with Gibbon following behind. At around 10:30, the fog started lifting. They moved parallel to the river initially, turning right to face the Richmond Road, where they began to be struck by enfilading fire from the Virginia Horse Artillery under Major John Pelham. Pelham started with two cannons—a 12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore and a rifled Blakely—but continued with only one after the latter was disabled by counter-battery fire. [...] "Jeb" [...] Stuart sent word to Pelham that he should feel free to withdraw from his dangerous position at any time, to which Pelham responded, [...] "Tell the General <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> my ground." [...] The Iron Brigade (formerly Gibbon's command, but now led by Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith) was sent out to deal with the Confederate horse artillery. This action was mainly conducted by the 24th Michigan Infantry, a newly enlisted regiment that had joined the brigade in October. After about an hour, Pelham's ammunition began to run low and he withdrew. General Lee observed the action and commented about Pelham, age 24, [...] "It is glorious to see such courage in one so young." [...] The most prominent victim of Pelham's fire was Brig. Gen. George D. Bayard, a cavalry general mortally wounded by a shell while standing in reserve near Franklin's headquarters. Jackson's main artillery batteries had remained silent in the fog during this exchange, but the Union troops soon began to receive direct fire from Prospect Hill, principally five batteries directed by Lt. Col. Reuben Lindsay Walker, and Meade's attack was stalled about 600 yards from his initial objective for almost two hours by these combined artillery attacks.|$|E
