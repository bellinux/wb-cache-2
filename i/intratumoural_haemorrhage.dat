40|$|Answer: Ovarian {{dermoid cyst}}(Mature cystic teratoma) An ovarian dermoid cyst (mature cystic teratoma) is a {{congenital}} benign germ cell tumour that contains tissues derived from allthree germ cells layers (ecto, endo and mesoderms), {{but with a}} predominance of ectodermal components. These cysts may contain hair, skin, epithelium, fat and teeth. Dermoid cysts can occur elsewhere in the body, such as the orbit, spine and neck. They occur most commonly in the reproductive years, and usually present with either chronic pelvic pain, a palpable mass or less commonly with acute pain due to torsion or <b>intratumoural</b> <b>haemorrhage.</b> Although torsion {{is the most common}} complication, cysts may also rupture and rarely undergo malignant change developing into squamous cell carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|Ependymomas {{presenting}} with intratumoural and/or subarachnoid haemorrhages {{are seen}} rarely. These haemorrhages are mostly due to anticoagulation, epidural analgesia or pregnancy. A 62 -year-old male farmer with cauda equina syndrome after a work-related trauma is presented. He {{was admitted to}} our hospital with paraparesis, faecal incontinance and sensory loss {{below the level of}} the lumbar- 2 dermatome. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine displayed an intradural mass lesion {{at the level of the}} first lumbar vertebrae. The lesion was excised totally via dorsal midline approach. Histopathologic examination revealed grade- 3 ependymoma with <b>intratumoural</b> <b>haemorrhage.</b> The patient’s symptoms were relieved completely on postoperative day 7. The patient was given information about periodical examination for recurrence and discharged on the third postoperative week. Asymptomatic spinal lesions should be considered for operation whenever detected because of unpredicted complications...|$|E
40|$|A 56 {{year old}} normotensive, nondiabetic male {{attended}} the neurosurgery outpatient department with the complaint of vertigo for 3 months, vomiting for 4 - 5 days, blurring {{of vision and}} disorientation for 2 days. On clinical examination, no significant findings were detected. Multiplanar and multisequence MRI (with contrast) and spectroscopy of the brain revealed a pineal mass with suggestion of <b>intratumoural</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and intraventricular extension to third ventricle with mass effects causing obstructive hydrocephalous. After surgery, tissue from pineal mass sent for histopathological examination. Grossly, the tumour was composed of multiple small soft greyish brown pieces of tissue. Microscopic examination reveal proliferation of diffuse sheets and lobules of monomorphic, uniform, round cells with mild to moderate focal atypia (Fig 1), microvascular proliferation, focal calcification and presence of occasional tumour giant cells. Immunohistochemistry for Neuron specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) shows positivity in tumour cells and supporting stroma. Based on location, histomorphology and immunohistochemical reactivity, pineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation (PPTD) diagnosis was made...|$|E
30|$|The {{response}} to treatment is evaluated on metabolic and/or anatomic images. A minimum of 6 to 8  weeks after treatment {{is necessary to}} assess the metabolic response on FDG-PET/CT. For anatomical response evaluation, an even longer time scale is required to avoid wrong interpretation because of the <b>intratumoural</b> inflammation, <b>haemorrhage</b> and oedema peripheral to treated lesions [3]. Consequently, within this delay the disease can progress especially in case of aggressive diseases [3].|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to reach}} {{consensus}} in imaging for staging and follow-up {{as well as for}} therapy response assessment in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). The German GIST Imaging Working Group was formed by 9 radiologists engaged in assessing patients with GIST treated with targeted therapy. The following topics were discussed: indication and optimal acquisition techniques of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) /CT; tumour response assessment considering response criteria and measurement techniques on CT, MRI and PET/CT; result interpretation; staging interval and pitfalls. Contrast-enhanced CT is the standard method for GIST imaging. MRI is the method of choice in case of liver-specific questions or contraindications to CT. PET/CT should be used for early response assessment or inconclusive results on morphologic imaging. All imaging techniques should be standardized allowing a reliable response assessment. Response has to be assessed with respect to lesion size, lesion density and appearance of new lesions. A critical issue is pseudoprogression due to myxoid degeneration or <b>intratumoural</b> <b>haemorrhage.</b> The management of patients with GIST receiving a targeted therapy requires a standardized algorithm for imaging and an appropriate response assessment with respect to changes in lesion size and density...|$|E
40|$|Met protein, {{the high}} {{affinity}} receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), was highly {{expressed by the}} tumour cells of 64 well-differentiated papillary carcinomas of the thyroid. The p 145 mature form and the p 170 precursor form of the protein were both isolated from the tumours. Enhanced expression of Met protein {{was associated with a}} 9. 5 ± 5 -fold increase in MET RNA transcript levels, suggesting increased transcription of the gene. In the same tumours, the levels of RNA transcripts for hypoxia inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1), a potent stimulator of met gene transcription, were 4. 5 ± 3 -fold higher than those present in the surrounding normal thyroid tissues. HIF- 1 is generally induced by hypoxia. Histological features suggestive of a hypoxia were observed in 37 of 50 tumours and included coagulative necrosis, psammoma bodies, cystic changes, <b>intratumoural</b> <b>haemorrhage,</b> and hyalinization of the fibrous stroma. Immunostaining for Met protein was particularly intense in some cells located at the tumour periphery which were characterized by an invasive phenotype. Microdissection of tumour cell nests from the invading front revealed that the levels of RNA transcripts for MET/HIF were higher than in the centre of the tumour in four of nine cases. Taken together, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that HIF- 1, perhaps driven by hypoxia, may be one of the factors leading to the increased transcription of met gene in papillary carcinoma and that this event is often more pronounced at the tumour periphery...|$|E
40|$|Sustained {{growth of}} solid tumours {{can rely on}} both the {{formation}} of new and the co-option of existing blood vessels. Current models suggest that binding of angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2) to its endothelial Tie 2 receptor prevents receptor phosphorylation, destabilizes blood vessels, and promotes vascular permeability. In contrast, binding of angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1) induces Tie 2 receptor activation and supports the formation of mature blood vessels covered by pericytes. Despite the intense research to decipher the role of angiopoietins during physiological neovascularization and tumour angiogenesis, a mechanistic understanding of angiopoietin function on vascular integrity and remodelling is still incomplete. We therefore assessed the vascular morphology of two mouse mammary carcinoma xenotransplants (M 6378 and M 6363) which differ in their natural angiopoietin expression. M 6378 displayed Ang- 1 in tumour cells but no Ang- 2 in tumour endothelial cells in vivo. In contrast, M 6363 tumours expressed Ang- 2 in the tumour vasculature, whereas no Ang- 1 expression was present in tumour cells. We stably transfected M 6378 mouse mammary carcinoma cells with human Ang- 1 or Ang- 2 and investigated the consequences on the host vasculature, including ultrastructural morphology. Interestingly, M 6378 /Ang- 2 and M 6363 tumours displayed a similar vascular morphology, with <b>intratumoural</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and non-functional and abnormal blood vessels. Pericyte loss was prominent in these tumours and was accompanied by increased endothelial cell apoptosis. Thus, overexpression of Ang- 2 converted the vascular phenotype of M 6378 tumours into a phenotype similar to M 6363 tumours. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} Ang- 1 /Tie 2 signalling is essential for vessel stabilization and endothelial cell/pericyte interaction, and suggest that Ang- 2 is able to induce a switch of vascular phenotypes within tumours...|$|E
