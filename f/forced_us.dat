5|$|Operating at the Kum River {{during the}} Battle of Taejon, {{troops of the}} U.S. Army's 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, were cut off from {{resupply}} by a roadblock established by North Korean troops of the NK 3rd Division. The roadblock proved difficult to break, and <b>forced</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops to move through nearby mountains to evacuate their wounded.|$|E
5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces {{began the}} effort of {{surrounding}} the Pusan Perimeter from all sides {{in an attempt to}} envelop it. The North Korean 4th Infantry Division and the North Korean 6th Infantry Division advanced south in a wide coordinated maneuver that was aimed at the UN's left flank. Advancing on UN positions, they repeatedly <b>forced</b> <b>US</b> and South Korean forces to withdraw. Although they were steadily pushed back, South Korean forces increased their resistance further south in an effort to delay North Korean units as much as possible. North and South Korean units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The Republic of Korea Army forces defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back. They also performed well in the Battle of Andong, where they were successful in repelling North Korean advances.|$|E

Widespread employee discontent and a high volume of employee sick calls were blamed by the airline for a staff shortage around the 2004 Christmas holiday, a public relations disaster which led to speculation that the airline could be liquidated; the USDOT found that the problems were caused primarily by poor airline management.|$|E

25|$|Within {{hours of}} Cahill's murder, the Provisional IRA claimed {{responsibility}} {{in a press}} release. The reasons cited were Cahill's alleged involvement with a Portadown unit of the Ulster Volunteer Force. The unit in question had attempted a bomb attack on a south Dublin pub which was hosting a Sinn Féin fund-raiser on 21 May 1994. The UVF operatives were halted by the doorman Martin Doherty. In the ensuing struggle Doherty, who the IRA subsequently announced was a volunteer in their Dublin Brigade, was shot dead. The Provisionals further alleged that Cahill {{had been involved in}} selling the stolen Beit paintings to the UVF gang led by Billy Wright. The UVF then fenced the paintings for money, which they used to buy guns from South Africa. This act supposedly sealed Cahill's fate, and put him at the top of an IRA hit list. In a later statement, the IRA said that it was Cahill's involvement with and assistance to pro-British death squads which <b>forced</b> <b>us</b> to act.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, the U.S. Justice Department {{filed suit}} against USG and six other {{wallboard}} manufacturers, charging them with price fixing under §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The claim stemmed from US Gypsum's 1929 cross-licensing agreements for its patented wallboard, which set prices at which the wallboard must be sold. In 1950 the Supreme Court <b>forced</b> <b>US</b> Gypsum and its six licensees [...] who produced all of the wallboard sold east of the Rocky Mountains [...] to cease setting prices, and US Gypsum was enjoined from exercising its patent-licensing privilege.|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} DNA results came back negative, Nifong and other city {{officials}} such as Durham Mayor Bill Bell {{spoke at a}} community forum on April 12, 2006, on violence against women at N.C.

[...] One questioner said that Duke University hospital must have tampered with the DNA sample for it to come back negative, while another suggested that the accuser {{ought to have been}} helicoptered to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center for treatment since Duke had a conflict of interest. [...] One NCCU student, Chan Hall, as quoted by Newsweek, [...] stated, [...] "It's the same old story. Duke up, Central down." [...] He continued that he wanted to see the Duke students prosecuted [...] "whether it happened or not. It would be justice for things that happened in the past." [...] NCCU Chancellor James H. Ammons Jr. said that [...] "his incident has <b>forced</b> <b>us</b> to examine issues relevant to any campus environment -- sexism, racism and the need to educate our students about sexual assault and violence against women." [...] At the same time, he urged the crowd to be patient and let the legal process take its course.|$|E
