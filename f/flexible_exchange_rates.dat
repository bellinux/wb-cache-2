2500|$|The post-Keynesian {{economist}} Thomas Palley {{argues that}} MMT {{is largely a}} restatement of elementary Keynesian economics, but prone to [...] "over-simplistic analysis" [...] and understating the risks of its policy implications. Palley denies the MMT claim that standard Keynesian analysis doesn't fully capture the accounting identities and financial restraints on a government that can issue its own money. He argues that these insights are well captured by standard Keynesian stock-flow consistent IS-LM models, and have been well understood by Keynesian economists for decades. He also criticizes MMT for essentially assuming away the problem of fiscal - monetary conflict. In Palley's view the policies proposed by MMT proponents would cause serious financial instability in an open economy with <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> while using fixed exchange rates would restore hard financial constraints on the government and [...] "undermines MMT’s main claim about sovereign money freeing governments from standard market disciplines and financial constraints". He also argues that MMT lacks a plausible theory of inflation, particularly {{in the context of}} full employment in the 'Employer of last resort' policy first proposed by Minsky and advocated by Bill Mitchell and other MMT theorists; of a lack of appreciation of the financial instability that could be caused by permanently zero interest rates; and of overstating the importance of government created money. Palley concludes that MMT provides no new insights about monetary theory, while making unsubstantiated claims about macroeconomic policy, and that MMT has only received attention recently due to it being a [...] "policy polemic for depressed times".|$|E

The <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime is generally shown to be superior, assuming PPP. This study is a fresh examination of the popular assertion that <b>Flexible</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> regime outperforms other <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> regimes. We analyze {{the effect of the}} violation of purchasing power parity combined with deviations in output target and real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> from their long-run equilibrium values on government’s decision domain, which we call government’s loss function.

The intuition for this result lies in the combined expenditure switching and terms of trade effects, which favor the domestic country under a <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, but are absent in a monetary union.
