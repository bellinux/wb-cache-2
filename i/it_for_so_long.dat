500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long.</b> That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of an}} {{extensive}} advertising campaign, [...] Reynolds discussed {{taking part in the}} production of a nude scene. The scene was filmed in a period of three days, and took approximately twelve takes to complete. Expressing that she was initially nervous, Bullock stated in an interview with Sky News that [...] "when everyone else acts like it's just a normal day it really helps you relax." [...] Although she revealed that producers provided them with fig leaves, Bullock stated that they would continuously fall off. She added, [...] "You could literally see everything." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Reynolds, who in an interview with People, stated, [...] "Filming a scene that involves being entirely naked and takes a couple days can be a little awkward." [...] He continued: [...] "Thankfully you're there for so long and you're doing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that you dispense with the awkwardness pretty quickly and start to have mundane, normal conversations – the difference being you're not wearing pants." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off {{a lot of the stuff}} that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, Volume 1 was {{released}} on DVD and VHS on April 13, 2004, the week Volume 2 {{was released}} in theaters.

[...] The United States does not have a DVD boxed set of Kill Bill, though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom. Upon the DVD release of Volume 2 in the US, however, Best Buy did offer an exclusive box set slipcase to house the two individual releases together. Volume 1, along with Volume 2, was released in High Definition on Blu-ray on September 9, 2008 in the United States.|$|E

You and I see so well the utter barbarism of warfare, the hideous waste of our mighty armaments, draining the money like blood from our countries, and all for senselessness, all just to keep alive that strange spirit which belongs to the days of romance, and the days of romance only. It's a workaday world now, Maraton. We draw nearer to the last bend in the world's history. Oh, this is the truth! I have seen <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long.</b> It's my religion, Maraton.

6000|$|When I sent you, a {{few weeks}} ago, the Tale of 'Peter Bell', you asked [...] "why THE WAGGONER was not added?"--To say the truth,--from the higher tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not {{accompany}} it without disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, THE WAGGONER was read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> a time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you, it may prove acceptable to others.

They would not even let me choose my roads. I should have got myself a car long ago, and driven it, if it wasn't for that infernal business with a handle one had to do when the engine stopped. But here, you see, is a reasonably cheap car with an electric starter--American, I need scarcely say. And here I am--going at my own pace." ...|$|E
