5|$|On 28 April, Tan Son Nhut Air Base (lying {{adjacent}} to the airport) came under artillery fire and attack from Vietnamese People's Air Force aircraft. The fixed-wing evacuation was terminated and Operation Frequent Wind commenced. The evacuation took place primarily from the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) compound, beginning around 14:00 {{on the afternoon of}} 29 April, and ending that night with only limited small arms damage to the helicopters. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon was intended to only be a secondary <b>evacuation</b> <b>point</b> for embassy staff, but it was soon overwhelmed with evacuees and desperate South Vietnamese. The evacuation of the embassy was completed at 07:53 on 30 April, but some Americans chose to stay or were left behind and some 400 third country nationals were left at the embassy.|$|E
5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an <b>evacuation</b> <b>point</b> and {{emergency}} shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E

5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an <b>evacuation</b> <b>point,</b> firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, Baroness Symons, {{a junior}} {{minister}} in the MoD, told the House of Lords that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the <b>evacuation</b> <b>point</b> in Freetown to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of Freetown {{in an attempt to}} reassure residents. HMS Illustrious, with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from Illustrious began flying reassurance patrols over Freetown and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, should it be necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and Freetown {{might not be able to}} stand up to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President Ahmad Kabbah formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled Civil Defence Force and the West Side Boys) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by Harriers and a Nimrod R1.|$|E

5|$|The {{two major}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>points</b> chosen for Operation Frequent Wind were the DAO Compound {{adjacent}} to Tan Son Nhut Airport for American and Vietnamese civilian evacuees, and the US Embassy, Saigon for Embassy staff. The {{plan for the}} evacuation included buses positioned at 28 buildings throughout metropolitan Saigon designated as pick-up points, with American civilian bus drivers standing by at those buildings. The buses would follow one of four planned evacuation routes from downtown Saigon to the DAO Compound, each route named after a Western Trail: Santa Fe, Oregon, Texas, etc.|$|R
25|$|Under this plan, CH-53 and CH-46 {{helicopters}} {{were used}} to evacuate Americans and friendly Vietnamese to ships, including the Seventh Fleet, in the South China Sea. The main <b>evacuation</b> <b>point</b> was the DAO Compound at Tan Son Nhat; buses moved through the city picking up passengers and driving {{them out to the}} airport, with the first buses arriving at Tan Son Nhat shortly after noon. The first CH-53 landed at the DAO compound in the afternoon, and by the evening, 395 Americans and more than 4,000 Vietnamese had been evacuated. By 23:00 the U.S. Marines who were providing security were withdrawing and arranging the demolition of the DAO office, American equipment, files, and cash. Air America UH-1s also participated in the evacuation.|$|E
25|$|While American {{citizens}} were generally assured {{of a simple}} way to leave the country just by showing up to an <b>evacuation</b> <b>point,</b> South Vietnamese who wanted to leave Saigon before it fell often resorted to independent arrangements. The under-the-table payments required to gain a passport and exit visa jumped sixfold, and the price of seagoing vessels tripled. Those who owned property in the city were often forced to sell it at a substantial loss or abandon it altogether; the asking price of one particularly impressive house was cut 75 percent within a two-week period. American visas were of enormous value, and Vietnamese seeking American sponsors posted advertisements in newspapers. One such ad read: “Seeking adoptive parents. Poor diligent students” followed by names, birthdates, and identity card numbers.|$|E
25|$|Evacuations of {{personnel}} from Java and diversion {{of resources to}} India and Australia began 20 February. By 24 February only ten heavy bombers, four A-24 dive bombers, and 13 P-40 fighters remained flyable against Japanese forces. ABDA Command was officially dissolved the next day. The ground echelons of both heavy bomb groups began evacuation by sea on 25 February, while the bombers, carrying up to 20 passengers each, made daily six-hour flights to Broome, Western Australia, an intermediate <b>evacuation</b> <b>point</b> for all aircraft fleeing Java. Malang/Singosari closed on 28 February and Jogjakarta the next night, following the final bomber sorties. 260 men, including {{the remnants of the}} 17th Pursuit Squadron, were evacuated by five B-17s and three LB-30s. 35 passengers crammed the final LB-30 that took off at 12:30am of 2 March.

40|$|Tsunami hazards {{are more}} than evident in the Pacific coast of Ecuador, but {{especially}} on its westernmost Peninsula called Salinas. As the potential impact time is relatively short {{for the public to}} reach natural high ground or at least leave the tsunami inundation area, a different approach to rescue lives has been applied with geomatic tools. The buildings inside the tsunami hazard zone have been first evaluated for their seismic resistance. Those buildings, which have been proven to withstand a seismic event, have been chosen to serve as elevated safe zones for a subsequent vertical tsunami evacuation. The used geographic tools allowed reducing time spans between initial <b>evacuation</b> <b>points</b> towards safe zones inside the tsunami inundation areas.

25|$|Nomad gets {{trapped and}} decides to {{continue}} into the alien structure. It soon turns into a zero gravity environment. Nomad uses his hydro-thrusters to maneuver and encounters hostile sentient aliens. He also sees a possible invasion force consisting of many alien machines. Nomad manages to escape, but the structure creates a massive sphere of energy that freezes everything inside its structure to -200°F (-129°C). Once outside, Nomad is attacked by various Alien machines before finding Prophet. Prophet was able to engineer a weapon using the aliens' technology, the Molecular Accelerator (MOAC). Prophet's Nanosuit malfunctions, requiring him to frequently stop and recharge using heat sources, such as the burning wrecks of military vehicles. The two leave the ice sphere and rescue Helena, whose VTOL has crashed. Prophet leaves with Helena on another VTOL. At the U.S. <b>evacuation</b> <b>point,</b> {{one of the last}} VTOLs rescues Nomad from an unstoppable quadrupedal alien exosuit. Just as the exosuit is about to destroy the VTOL, Major Strickland draws its attention by firing at it using a mounted machine gun and the exosuit kills Strickland instead. As they leave the island, the pilot is killed and the engines are damaged. Nomad flies the crippled VTOL back to the USS Constitution (CVN-80) Carrier Strike Group while fighting off aliens along the way.|$|E

40|$|This project explores {{different}} {{means of}} temporary secondary evacuation {{that could be}} used for the wind platform the DolWin Beta during the towing from Haugesund to the German Bight. The platform is extraordinarily tall, 90 meters from top to bottom, and a secondary evacuation method for the personnel on board is needed if an accident would occur. Based on reports from earlier tow operations, design drawings, interviews and research from manufactures this report focuses three different evacuation methods were found to be most suitable for the DolWin Beta platform: an evacuation chute, rappelling and ladders. These methods are evaluated in relation to technical design, simplicity, safety, how well it could handle injured personnel and how people would react when using it. After evaluating the different temporary second line evacuations for the DolWin Beta the authors have concluded that rappelling is the most suitable system due to its capability of handling injured personnel, the flexibility of <b>evacuation</b> <b>points</b> and that personnel responsible for the evacuation will be provided...|$|R

[...] The fighting on the Peloponnese consisted of small-scale engagements with isolated groups of British troops who had been unable to reach the <b>evacuation</b> <b>point.</b> The attack came days too late to cut off the bulk of the British troops in Central Greece, but isolated the Australian 16th and 17th Brigades. By 30 April the evacuation of about 50,000 soldiers was completed, but was heavily contested by the German Luftwaffe, which sank at least 26 troop-laden ships.

Barriers included an overall lack of buy-in towards disaster preparedness, and how to quickly transport people with low mobility to one of the six <b>evacuation</b> <b>points</b> in the community. Closely related to the barriers, participants identified the need for someone willing to lead outreach efforts versus participate, and for the community to be better prepared for elders and children that cannot walk quickly.
