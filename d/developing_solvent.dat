40|$|CO 2 {{separation}} using reactive solvents {{is considered}} to be a technically viable option for capturing of CO 2 from flue gas streams. However, the cost of CO 2 capture using conventional solvents such as aqueous solutions of monoethanolamine (MEA) is prohibitively high. Nearly half of the total cost is due to operational costs, of which about 70 to 80 % can be contributed to the cost of regeneration of the solvent. In addition, the conventional solvents are rather corrosive and can be degraded by many of the contaminants present in the flue gas streams. Therefore, there is considerable incentive to <b>develop</b> <b>solvents</b> that require lower energy for regeneration and also induce less operational difficulties.

30|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} favorite and conventional methods for screening and detection of drug abuse (Shetab Boushehri et al. 2009). Simultaneous development of drugs and poisons on one TLC plate has made it a rapid method (Ahadi et al. 2011; Shetab Boushehri et al. 2009). Modern computer-controlled scanning instruments and automated sample application and development instruments permit accuracy and precision in quantification that are, in many cases, comparable with those obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). There is a wide range of layers and <b>developing</b> <b>solvents</b> (acidic, basic, completely aqueous, aqueous-organic). Solvents that interfere with HPLC UV detection can be used in TLC because the mobile phase can be removed from the plate before detection. Every sample is separated on a fresh layer, so that problems result from retaining and cross-contamination of samples and sorbent regeneration procedures are avoided. Low mobile-phase consumption results in reduced costs of solvent purchase and disposal. Because layers are normally disposable, sample preparation methods are less required, and complex, impure samples can be applied to the layer without concern for the interfering peaks and retained compounds that shorten the life of HPLC columns. Simultaneous sample cleanup and separation of target compounds are often achieved with TLC (Sherma 2003).|$|R
