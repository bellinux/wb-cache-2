5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{a story of a}} wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
25|$|The arts of Southeast Asia have {{affinity}} with {{the arts of}} other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands {{as well as the}} feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.|$|E
2500|$|Lullaby {{starts with}} Mr. Streator {{talking to the}} reader, narrating where he is today and why he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us the backstory that will give us {{perspective}} on his current situation. [...] "Still, this isn't a story about here and now. Me, the Sarge, the Flying Virgin. Helen Hoover Boyle. What I'm writing {{is the story of}} how we met. How we got here" [...]|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>is</b> the truth. What I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you I'd as soon {{say in the}} {{presence}} of the lady as here." ...|$|R

2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E

60|$|Admiral Harrington here <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{all that}} I have left untold. I {{am going to}} tell you all that I know, and then he will follow up with such rags and {{remnants}} as he can find, and tell you what he knows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything gone wrong? I thought I {{had made}} a hit. I have with your uncle, anyway. We parted on the friendliest terms.

60|$|He {{shifted from}} one foot to another, and looked as if he wished himself out of my way. At a later time of my life, I have {{observed}} that these are signs by which an honest man is apt to confess that he has told, or <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> a lie. As it was, I only noticed that he answered confusedly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather," [...] {{said little}} Alice, looking fearfully into his face, [...] "your voice {{sounds as though}} you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us {{something}} awful!" ...|$|R

60|$|The artfulness of this man! None knows so {{well as he}} how to pique {{the curiosity}} of the reader--and how to {{disappoint}} it. He raises the hope, here, that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> all about how one enters a classic wall in the usual mode of Southern manners; but does he? No; he smiles in his sleeve, and turns aside to other matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she said, [...] "you {{are safe}} up the stairs." [...] Tom {{opened his eyes}} very wide, and his mouth too; for he had not, as he thought, moved a single step. But, when he looked round him, {{there could be no}} doubt that he was safe up the backstairs, {{whatsoever}} they may be, which no man <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, for the plain reason that no man knows.|$|E

6000|$|... "There!" [...] said she, {{turning toward}} us. [...] "Here's a pretty kettle of fish! There's a two-horse sleigh outside, {{with a man}} driving, and a gentleman {{in the back seat}} who I am sure is Dr. Morris, and he has come all the way on this bitter cold morning to see the patient I sent for him to come to.

60|$|Next day {{he called}} the heroes together. He <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them the old tale, he says--How in Vitigis' time at Ravenna, 7000 Greeks had conquered and robbed of kingdom and liberty 200,000 rich and well-armed Goths. And {{now that they were}} raw levies, few, naked, wretched, they had conquered more than 20,000 of the enemy. And why? Because of old they had looked to {{everything}} rather than to justice; they had sinned against each other and the Romans. Therefore they must choose, and be just men henceforth, and have God with them, or unjust, and have God against them.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Roberta {{took off}} her hat, for {{there was no need}} of a hat on a shaded porch, and holding it by the ribbons, she let it gently slide down toward her feet. [...] "He is coming," [...] she said, {{speaking}} rather slowly, [...] "to take a walk with me, and I know very well that when we have reached some place where he is sure there is no one to hear him, he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that he loves me; that he did not intend to speak quite so soon, but that circumstances have made it impossible for him to restrain himself any longer, and he will ask me to be his wife." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. What is it you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, of course," [...] {{answered}} Shep. [...] "But er---it all fits in {{with what}} I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you about in the first place." ...|$|R
