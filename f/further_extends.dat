25|$|BLAT {{is one of}} {{multiple}} algorithms developed for the analysis and comparison of biological sequences such as DNA, RNA and proteins, with a primary goal of inferring homology in order to discover biological function of genomic sequences. It is not guaranteed to find the mathematically optimal alignment between two sequences like the classic Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithms do; rather, it first attempts to rapidly detect short sequences which {{are more likely to}} be homologous, and then it aligns and <b>further</b> <b>extends</b> the homologous regions. It is similar to the heuristic BLAST family of algorithms, but each tool has tried to deal with the problem of aligning biological sequences in a timely and efficient manner by attempting different algorithmic techniques.|$|E

Prior projects like Mono existed {{in a legal}} grey area because Microsoft's earlier grants applied only to the technology in [...] "covered specifications", including strictly the 4th editions each of ECMA-334 and ECMA-335. The new patent promise, however, places no ceiling on the specification version, and even extends to any [...]NET runtime technologies documented on MSDN {{that have not been}} formally specified by the ECMA group, if a project chooses to implement them. This allows Mono and other projects to maintain feature parity with modern [...]NET features that have been introduced since the 4th edition was published without being at risk of patent litigation over the implementation of those features. The new grant does maintain the restriction that any implementation must maintain minimum compliance with the mandatory parts of the CLI specification.|$|E

[Footnote 212: In {{an essay}} on [...] "The Duration of Life," [...] forming part of the {{translation}} of Dr. Weismann's papers already referred to, the author still <b>further</b> <b>extends</b> the sphere of natural selection by showing that the average duration of life in each species has been determined by it. A certain length of life is essential in order that the species may produce offspring sufficient to ensure its continuance under the most unfavourable conditions; and it is shown that the remarkable inequalities of longevity in different species and groups may be thus accounted for. Yet more, the occurrence {{of death in the}} higher organisms, in place of the continued survival of the unicellular organisms however much they may increase by subdivision, may be traced to the same great law of utility for the race and survival of the fittest. The whole essay is of exceeding interest, and will repay a careful perusal. A similar idea occurred to the present writer about twenty years back, and was briefly noted down at the time, but subsequently forgotten.] ...|$|E
