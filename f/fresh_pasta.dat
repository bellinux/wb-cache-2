25|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>pasta</b> {{is usually}} locally made with fresh {{ingredients}} {{unless it is}} destined to be shipped, in which case consideration {{is given to the}} spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, <b>fresh</b> <b>pasta</b> is usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or “00” low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook.

25|$|Also {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.

25|$|The {{dough is}} then {{ready to be}} shaped into {{different}} types of pasta. Depending {{on the type of}} pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time {{depending on the type of}} pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: <b>Fresh</b> <b>pasta</b> is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|E

25|$|Both {{dried and}} <b>fresh</b> <b>pasta</b> {{come in a}} number of shapes and varieties, with 310 {{specific}} forms known variably by over 1300 names having been documented. In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example, the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms of pasta include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed and specialty or decorative shapes. As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno in which the pasta incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked.|$|E
2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia <b>fresh</b> <b>pasta</b> can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. <b>Fresh</b> <b>pasta</b> for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>pastas</b> with Shiitake {{mushroom}} flour (MF) were produced. The MF {{was produced}} by drying the mushrooms at 40, 50, and 60 ᵒC. Proportions of 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % MF were used to prepare the <b>fresh</b> <b>pastas</b> (FP), with two types of wheat flour (regular (RWF) and 30 % semolina wheat flour (SWF)). Mushroom pastas were analysed before (FP) and after cooking (CP). FP presented moisture and water acidity lower than 35 % and 0. 95, respectively. The L* and b* colour parameters were similar for pasta produced with RWF and SWF, with the major differences for pastas with mushroom flours obtained at 40 ᵒC and with the increasing of MF. Thus, with increasing of MF and high drying temperatures, pastas were redder, darker and less yellow. The CP showed high colour similarities between them. Generally, the introduction of MF changes the texture of pastas. Internal and external firmness, and adhesiveness, decreased with increasing MF and for higher drying temperatures. CP presented similar tendencies, with low firmness, high adhesiveness and high stickiness. The soluble solids were determined in CP cooking water, and range between 5. 8 and 9. 0 %, without a consistent pattern, allowing classifying the pastas as high and medium quality. Sensorial analysis revealed that consumers preferred pastas produced with high content of MF with similar profiles for all the parameters tested, {{and the influence of}} the type of wheat flour was not important. It could be concluded that MP could be used to produce alternative foods, innovative and easy to cook. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
2500|$|Dried pasta {{can also}} be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually {{produced}} in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. Dried pasta is mainly shipped over to farther locations and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make dried pasta include semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavour and richness, but are not needed to make dried pasta. In contrast to <b>fresh</b> <b>pasta,</b> dried pasta needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. Dried pastas are best served in hearty dishes like ragu sauces, soups, and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the dried pasta will usually increase in size by double of its original proportion. Therefore, approximately [...] of dried pasta serves up to four people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Protein {{content and}} its effect on the quality of <b>fresh</b> <b>pastas,</b> {{obtained}} from dough prepared with different formulas: semolina, wheat flour, gluten, wheat bran and soybean proteins, were evaluated in this paper. Tests were carried out in the laboratory using raw materials from the same batch national origin. Raw materials were mixed in an auxiliary kneading machine with a 500 g-capacity. The dough was then stretched and cut manually into long strings of spaghettis of 2 mm- diameter. The following parameters were analysed in 7 different doughs: a) Protein content, b) Humidity, c) Solid content in the cooking water d) Sensorial analysis: colour, aroma, flavour and solidity. Results showed that the best dough samples, from a sensorial point of view, had the following composition: 1) “ 000 ”-flour: 85 % and gluten: 15 %, and 2) “ 000 ”-flour: 60 %, semolina: 30 % and gluten: 15 %. The highest percentage of proteins was determined in these types of dough. The soybean flour addition was not satisfactory, considering the characteristics of aroma and flavour. Neither was the wheat bran addition, since it altered the texture of the dough, not being appetizing for the consumer...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{three and}} a half million pounds of Atlantic Rock and Jonah crab, having a value of almost $ 1 don, are landed {{annually}} in Maine. These landings generate approximately 2. 5 million pounds of post-processing waste each year. The by-product consists mainly of shell, viscera, and unpicked meat. Mechanical separation of crustacean by-product can result in an additional 15 - 20 % food grade minced meat, which can be utilized to produce value-added products for human consumption. One such product that may be enhanced by crab mince is fiesh pasta. Americans are eating more pasta than ever before and eesh pasta consumption is very popular. The development of a crab mincecontaining seafood-flavored pasta would not only provide a gourmet flair and a more nutritionally balanced meal, but also utilize high quality crab meat that is typically discarded.
