5000|$|False {{self-employment}} is {{a situation}} in which somebody registered as self-employed, a freelancer, or a temp is de facto an employee carrying out a professional activity under the authority and subordination of another company. Such false self-employment is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions.

However, it is important to bear in mind that the size of the casual work phenomenon can be important and that the role of EPL in countries with sizeable casual work would be further overestimated. The effective coverage of employees computed by excluding casual workers would also be considerably more endogenous to the level of EPL, in contrast to the legal coverage, because recourse to casual work may be propelled by motivations to avoid complying with EPL. Similarly, new forms of employment, such as crowd-work through internet platforms (when classified as wage <b>employment),</b> <b>disguised</b> self-employment, ambiguous <b>employment</b> relationships, or other forms, may arise to avoid EPL and lead to a decrease in effective EPL coverage.|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} impact that Colombia’s 1993 health sector reform had on the {{enrollment}} of self-employed workers in mandatory social health insurance scheme, with a especial focus on the independent contractors. This group grew dramatically {{in the form of}} workers cooperatives between 1993 and 2003, becoming a source of self-employed evasion and a way to <b>disguised</b> <b>employment.</b> We use two national-level Living Standards Measurement Surveys conducted in Colombia in 1997 and 2003, and follow a methodology that corrects for sample selection, decomposing health insurance coverage variation into changes attributed to the reform and to the characteristics of independent contractors. We find that: (i) Between 1997 and 2003, enrollment increased in 28 percentage points reaching an insurance rate of 62 %, still below the reform goal of 80 %, (ii) enrollment of independent contractors in 1997 was only 35 % (compared to 50 %) after adjusting by the selection bias due to <b>disguised</b> <b>employment,</b> (ii) the new legislation and stringent monitoring implemented in 2003 to cope with evasion seem to be effective since the sample selection due to <b>disguised</b> <b>employment</b> was not statistically significant in 2003.

40|$|Work in the same-day courier {{sector is}} a {{precarious}} form of employment. Workers {{in this sector}} are also treated as self-employed and hired as independent contractors. The relationship with the firm for which they work, however, is hardly distinguishable from an employment relationship. Messengers are among {{a growing number of}} workers in Canada who can be labeled as disguised employees. To explore the phenomenon of <b>disguised</b> <b>employment,</b> I use a case study approach informed by critical political economic theory and a purposive approach to labour and employment law to examine work in the same-day courier sector in Toronto with a focus on a subpopulation of workers in this sector: bike messengers. I examine the causes and consequences of self-employment in the same-day courier sector, analyze messengers' work and argue that their employment status entails misclassification. In an increasingly market-mediated society we are witnessing a proliferation of unprotected work relationships with <b>disguised</b> <b>employment</b> being one manifestation of this development. Fortunately, some unions are trying to organize workers in <b>disguised</b> <b>employment</b> relationships. In this dissertation, I also examine an attempt by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to organize workers in Toronto's same-day courier sector. I explore the processes and implications of organizing disguised employees and examine how organizing these workers relates to and can inform the project of union renewal in Canada. Gaining employee status, however, is no guarantee of successful organizing. The same-day courier sector is highly competitive and is dominated by small, decentralized employers. Organizing in such a sector is a formidable task. Under the collective bargaining regime, unions have to organize workers workplace by workplace. However, this is proving to be ineffective in highly competitive sectors dominated by small employers, and organizing efforts will likely only result in limited success. As I argue, unions can develop innovative strategies and tactics to organize workers. However, with the many structural obstacles unions face, these strategies and tactics can often fall short of their goals. To facilitate unionization in the same-day courier sector, the collective bargaining regime needs to be overhauled to mandate, or at least promote, multi-employer bargaining...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} who {{is or is not}} in an {{employment}} relationship has become problematic in recent decades as a result of major changes in work organization {{as well as in the}} adequacy of legal regulation in adapting to such changes. In different parts of the world, there are increasing difficulties with establishing whether or not an employment relationship exists in situations where the respective rights and obligations of the parties concerned are not clear, where there has been an attempt to <b>disguise</b> the <b>employment</b> relationship, or where inadequacies or gaps exist in legal frameworks or in their interpretation or application. Vulnerable workers tend to suffer most in these situations. At the same time, social partners and labour administrators emphasize that globalization has increased the need for protection, in particular against the circumvention of national labour legislation by contractual and/or other legal arrangements. Accordingly, the employment relationship is coming under more and more scrutiny not only from labour lawyers, but also from workers, employers and the judiciary. Changes in the world of work are continuing to modify the 'traditional employment relationship'. These changes are altering both labour legislation and affecting the ways labour law is implemented. This book presents the complex relation of labour legislation to the employment relationship, reporting on the many terms, notions, definitions...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{fraudulent}} contracting {{of work is}} {{an important}} issue in many European countries. This report looks at these practices across the EU and shows how the issue is tackled in the 28 EU Member States (EU 28) and Norway. Applying juridical criteria, the study defines the fraudulent use of an employment or contractual relationship on the basis of two co-existing conditions, whereby: a specific employment or contractual arrangement is used to hire workers or to subcontract certain work activities; the factual circumstances of the specific employment or contractual relationship do not correspond to the legal, formal requirements for that specific form of contracting work, either directly through an employment relationship or indirectly through a subcontracting relationship. It is difficult to distinguish in practice between the four main forms of contracting work: ‘lawful’, ‘undeclared’, ‘fraudulent’ and ‘illicit’. In many instances, such arrangements are intended to give the impression they are legitimate forms of contracting since they use legal employment or contractual relationships. However, on closer inspection, the apparent contract <b>disguises</b> a different <b>employment</b> relationship or a different employer from the contractual one. This complexity helps to explain why, in some countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia and Malta), undeclared work rather than fraudulent use of contracting work is reported as the main issue, with violations in employment contracts tending to be mostly associated with irregular jobs. Given that the fraudulent contracting of work is particularly complex, this study focuses on a few specific contractual relationships and investigates whether there are indications that they have been abused, to what extent, and in what way. The report is based on information provided in national reports from Eurofound’s network of European correspondents across the EU 28 and Norway...|$|R
40|$|An {{inquiry into}} sham {{contracting}} {{conducted by the}} Australia Building and Construction Commission has once again highlighted the difficulty in determining which work relationships should be covered by labour laws. Recent judgments from the Federal Court, and in particular a landmark ruling by the UK Supreme Court, suggest a greater willingness to find that workers are in substance being hired as employees, {{even in the face}} of carefully drafted contracts that present them as independent contractors; but not all judges are prepared to place so strong an emphasis on the economic reality of a relationship. In this article, we identify the different meanings that the term ‘sham contracting’ can be given, and review evidence as the prevalence of <b>disguised</b> <b>employment.</b> We argue that despite the recent shifts in the way the common law tests for employment are being applied, there remains a compelling case for a statutory definition that would make it harder to disguise employees as contractors.

These topics are ones that have: (1) received relatively great attention in developing countries compared to developed economies (i. e., family enterprises, missing labor markets, geographical mobility, health/nutrition effects on productivity) because of their greater importance in developing countries; (2) been considered more extensively for developing than developed labor markets because the nature of institutions, behaviors and available data permit more extensive empirical examination of these topics (i. e., labor adjustments to shocks {{in the presence of}} imperfect markets, information problems in labor markets), and (3) been considered extensively for both developing and developed economies but with some different approaches and results for part of the developing country literature (e. g., determinants of and labor market returns to schooling).

40|$|This study {{challenges}} {{the use of}} the gross increase in female participation rate [...] prewar to postwar [...] as the sole indicator of changes in women's employment. It is hypothesized that the utilization of aggregate participation to measure progress in women's <b>employment</b> <b>disguises</b> significant variation in women's participation by industry and by occupation, during and after the war. The purpose of this dissertation, thus, is to clarify the impact of WWII on female employment. The method developed was a sytematic analysis of the wartime employment of women in terms of its growth and its industrial and occupational structures, 1940 to 1950 inclusive. Chapter II initiates the study by giving a brief summary of the background against which the increase in female employment occurred. The labor market during the defense period and early war years is described in terms of the rising demand for labor because of the drafting of men into the Armed Forces and the mounting production requirements. Then the three phases of the response to this demand is discussed: reemployment, overtime, and the new regard for women as a source of labor. Chapters III and IV investigate the nature of women's employment by industry and by occupation, and produce a more complete picture of female employment over the decade 1940 - 1950. It was shown that although the war exercised an immediate impact, causing certain compositional changes and determining certain trends in distribution, these effects were not evident {{by the end of the}} decade. In summary, the decade 1940 - 1950 was composed of two female employment trends. From 1940 to 1944, there were major aberrations in the structure of female labor with respect to aggregate participation rates, numbers, and industrial distribution. Women entered particularly the war manufacturing industries while prewar feminized industries such as personal services actually decreased in size and rank. The compositional change in the occupational structure during this period was derived largely from new female entrants to the labor force who entered primarily the Operative and Clerical occupations. Stability in the occupational structure, nevertheless, was evidenced in minimal shifting between occupations.... (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

Economic growth rises from 4, 90 percent in 2004 to S, 90 percent in 2007, but this growth is relatively low among anotherprovinces in Central Java andfollowed by interregion inequality. This case is fundamental in formulating interregional policy and its solution must be found. Further {{research is needed to}} examinefactors that determine economic growth in order to enhance economic growth. This study aims to examine the impact of agglomeration, investment, labor, and inequality in economic growth of Central Java from 2003 to 2006 Model in this study is based on Solow Neoclassical growth model which are capital and labor factor. Method used in this study is data panel withfixed effect model approach. To catch economic growth variation among regions that apply regional management such as Barlingmascakeb, Subosukawonosraten, anyl other regions outside Barlingmascakeb, and Subosukawonosraten, this study uses dummy areas. The econometric analyses shows that agglomeration and labor have significant relationship with economic growth.

The Ministry of Rural Development in India is an apex body to develop the rural sector implementing several developmental programs. Agriculture is state subject according to the subject distribution of the state and central in the constitution. A majority of the people living in rural areas is still deprived of the communication facilities. Rural development is a process of qualitative and quantitative changes to improve conditions in rural regions. Such a process needs to be an integrated programmed where all aspects of rural life should be taken into account. More than 80 % of the Indian population is still living in rural part of the India. Development is a process of liberating the individual and society with fullest utilization of physical as well as human resources. The Indian government's emphasis on small-scale enterprises is quite different from the Chinese emphasis on rural location and employment for local residents. For small-scale enterprises in India, geographical location does not really matter, while reorganization of rural settlement mostly in favor of small rural towns received a high priority in China. Local government played a most important role in the establishment and development of Township and Village Enterprises in China. In India Central Government policies and intervene promote rural industrialization have largely ignored the role of Panchayats.
