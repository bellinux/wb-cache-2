40|$|This {{video is}} a re-presentation of a {{generative}} audiovisual installation, the centre {{piece of the}} exhibition Exposure: Living in Extreme Environments created in collaboration with <b>geoarcheologist</b> Dr Paul Adderley (University of Stirling, Scotland). The broad theme is the co-evolutionary, mutually dependent relationship between human populations and their environment. Our work focuses on Adderley's scientific research undertaken in Greenland, looking at the historical record (revealed by excavations and soils analysis) of population behaviour over that last 1000 years. The soil itself is taken as an artefact of past human habitation, land use and cultural activity. Image work and data analysis obtained from processed soil samples are re-appropriated in this installation and presented alongside with location-specific and historically-referenced sound recordings. The chronology of the images and data structure the piece: data guide a generative system that selects images, sound materials and live audio and visual processing techniques. Implementation is in Max/MSP/Jitter. In this short experimental video, 1000 years of data are cycled once. This work was undertaken with support of the Research Councils UK...|$|E
40|$|The Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio {{performed}} archeological {{testing at}} the Pavo Real site (41 BX 52) between November 2006 and June 2007 for HNTB. The purpose of archeological testing {{was to determine}} the depth of construction fill and the presence, location and, if possible, condition, of any remnant archeological deposits. Proposed improvements along Loop 1604 include bridge bents that will be constructed east of Leon Creek and west of the IH- 10 /Loop 1604 interchange overpass. Impacts associated with proposed improvements will occur within the boundaries and in the immediate vicinity of 41 BX 52. Archeological testing consisted of coring, backhoe trenching and block excavations. Coring and backhoe trenching within the northern and southern medians indicated the presence of thick fill material of unknown depths in the western portion of the site and a decrease in fill and soils on the eastern segment. Suite II soils, that were assumed {{to be associated with the}} first occupation of the site, were identified during backhoe trenching, initiating block excavations. Block excavations were conducted within the area to be directly impacted by a bridge bent and basin in aims of dating Suite II soils. The excavation of two 2 -x- 2 -meter (m) blocks and two additional 1 -x- 1 -m units produced Early Archaic diagnostics. Paleoindian period materials were not encountered during archeological investigations of the site. Two samples collected from Block 2 excavations yielded single grain OSL ages of 18, 300 ± 920 years BP and 18, 200 ± 1, 030 years BP. Statistical analysis concluded that lithic debitage recovered from the Suite II deposits were significantly smaller than Suites III and IV specimens, supporting the conclusion that cultural material from Suite III could have worked their way down into the deposit accounting for the specimens present in Suite II. Moreover, OSL results suggested that Suite II deposits may have undergone post-depositional disturbance. Archeological testing of the site was conducted under Texas Antiquities permit No. 4092. The initial coring and trenching of the site was conducted under a TxDOT General Services Contract with Raymond P. Mauldin serving as the principal investigator. The subsequent testing was performed under a contract with HNTB with Steve Tomka serving as the principal investigator. Antonia L. Figueroa served as the project archeologist. Charles D. Frederick served as the project <b>geoarcheologist.</b> All artifacts and records collected during this project are curated at the Center for Archaeological Research according to Texas Historical Commission guidelines...|$|E
40|$|This archeological data {{recovery}} investigation in Roberts County {{in the northeastern}} panhandle of Texas was necessitated by the proposed widening of State Highway 70 (CSJ: 0490 - 04 - 037) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Amarillo District. This proposed highway rehabilitation program will directly impact a roughly 10 meter (m, 30 ft.) wide north-south section of prehistoric site 41 RB 112, the Long View site. This site consists of two horizontally distinct Plains Village period occupations shallowly buried along a linear interfluvial ridge between two small tributary creeks to the Canadian River in the midslope of this broad, dissected valley. This site was initially discovered by TxDOT archeologist, Dennis Price in June 2004 during an archeological inventory of the proposed 9. 7 kilometer (6 mile) section north of the Canadian River {{in response to the}} planned highway rehabilitation program. Based on Mr. Price’s discovery of multiple artifact classes in buried context he recommended this site be assessed for its eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places under criterion d and possible designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) per the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and other related legislation. Following the Texas Historical Commissions concurrence with that recommendation, TxDOT through the Environmental (ENV) Affairs Division, contracted to TRC Environmental Corporation (TRC) under an existing Scientific Services Contract No. 57 XXSA 006 and issued a Work Authorization to TRC of Austin to conduct the site eligibility assessment. During a site visit by TxDOT <b>geoarcheologist</b> James Abbott and TRC archeologist Mike Quigg in February 2005, the site boundaries were expanded to nearly 300 meters (m) along the proposed area of potential effect (APE). Investigative strategies were devised to assess the Long View site. In May 2005, TRC’s archeologists from Austin conducted archeological testing for a NRHP and SAL eligibility assessment investigation at 41 RB 112. The assessment along the 10 -m-wide by 300 -m-long APE was accomplished by hand-excavating 28 1 -by- 1 m units (totaling 16. 8 m 3), hand-excavating four narrow ca. 30 centimeter (cm) wide trenches (two in each area totaling nearly 32 linear meters), as well as cleaning and inspecting 28 m of existing road cut exposures. These investigations determined that cultural materials clustered at the northern and southern ends (Areas A and C respectively) of the site with nearly 120 m of noncultural bearing deposits (Area B) between the two concentrations. A 4 -m-wide mechanically bladed fireguard paralleled the existing fenceline throughout the length of the APE and disturbed much of the near surface materials in that zone. The opposite, eastern side of the highway was investigated through the excavation of six 50 -by- 50 cm shovel tests, surface, and road cut inspection. Based on the results from the hand-excavations and various collections conducted during the site assessment, it became apparent that the two ends (Areas A and C) of the Long View site in TxDOT’s proposed APE contained well-defined cultural components in the top 50 cmbs. Each end appeared to represent habitation remains from single occupation episodes with potential structures, restricted to a narrow time period of less than 100 years between uncalibrated 630 and 710 B. P. of the Plains Village period. Rodent and natural disturbances had vertically displaced some small cultural objects within the sandy deposits, but the restricted period of occupation to roughly a 100 year period reduces this impact. TRC recommended the site was eligible for listing on the National Register and as a State Landmark. The Texas Historical Commissions concurred with that recommendation, and subsequently the ENV Affairs Division of TxDOT, again contracted to TRC under an existing Scientific Services Contract No. 575 XXSA 008 and issued a Work Authorization to TRC Austin to perform the mitigation of the proposed impacts. Data recovery investigations were conducted during August through November 2006 along the western side of the existing highway. The previously identified northern-Area A and southern–Area C areas with high concentrations of cultural materials were targeted. These investigations began with a thorough geophysical survey that employed three noninvasive electrical detective instruments across Areas A and C anticipating to detect the locations of subsurface cultural features to target by hand-excavations. Some excavations targeted the detected anomalies, whereas others targeted previously identified features. In the end, hand-excavated blocks were completed in Areas A and C. The excavations totaled 128 m 2 in Area A and 93 m 2 in Area C for a grand total of 221 m 2 or 103. 4 m 3. In conjunction with the archeological excavations, geoarcheological investigations focused on defining the age and development of the natural Holocene sediments that contained the cultural materials. The geoarcheological assessment included detailed stratigraphic documentation of site and near site deposits, sediment texture characterization, soil thin sections, magnetic susceptibility, multiple chemical analyses (organic, calcium, and phosphorus). Detailed stratigraphic data was also collected at two rare pithouse structures to pursue construction and filling episodes. The excavations yielded significant and diverse cultural assemblages from the two occupations assigned Component A and C. Both components are attributed to the Plains Village period with two discrete occupations dating to uncalibrated 460 to 535 B. P. (cal A. D. 1398 to 1447) in Component A and 530 to 700 B. P. (cal A. D. 1280 to 1437) in Component C. The two assemblages are significant not only in their diversity and quality of materials but also in the information they yielded. This report represents one of the first complete documents to present the entire cultural assemblage from a single site for this time period and region. The total recovered assemblage includes 157 formal chipped and ground stone tools, 226 informal tools, 3, 414 pieces of lithic debitage, over 6, 400 faunal fragments (1. 4 kg), some 1, 541 ceramic sherds, 1, 790 burned rocks, at least 116 macrobotanical samples that includes 16 maize cobs, two human burials, and remains of a third, juvenile scattered along a previously bladed fireguard, 32 intact cultural features that include two rare pithouses, and other cultural debris related to these two campsites. The human remains and associated artifacts will be repatriated in accord with the requirements of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). A suite of 10 technical analyses directed at mostly the cultural assemblages included; use-wear, phytolith, diatom, petrography, macrobotanical, starch grain, instrumental neutron activation, bison bone isotopes, obsidian sourcing, radiocarbon and optical stimulated dating. This data was used to address 11 specific research questions concerning these Plains Village period occupations. Not only does the cultural debris contribute {{to our understanding of the}} time period but the geoarcheological information obtained explains the conditions and how the materials were preserved, and inform us concerning the past depositional environment in this immediate area. The combined information contributes to a significant understanding to a specific part of the Plains Village cultures in the Texas panhandle. Following the acceptance of the final report by the TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission these cultural materials and all the documentation from the combined investigations will be permanently curated at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. The curated materials will provide important data that can be researched by interested parties in the future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fluvial geomorphologists and stream restorationists often {{assume that}} pre-Columbian land use {{in parts of}} North America was {{relatively}} ineffective in accelerating slope erosion and floodplain sedimentation, and that erosion and sedimentation initiated by European settlement was sudden and substantial. Both of these beliefs, which under-lie concepts of natural streams and legacy sediment, are in conflict with recent reassess-ments by cultural geographers, anthropologists, <b>geoarcheologists,</b> and paleoecologists with regard to substantial environmental impacts of pre-Columbian American Indians. This review paper evaluates assumptions of pristine landscapes and European disruption from a geomorphic perspective, i. e., with regard to fluvial erosion and sedimentation rates. This view is {{a departure from the}} usual emphasis on ecological or cultural landscape impacts. Geoarcheologic and sedimentologic evidence indicates that the potential for geomorphic change with land-use practices utilized by European settlers was potentially very effec-tive in producing erosion and sedimentation in Anglo America. This can be explained by advanced technologies and economic incentives that increased the ability and motivation to rapidly clear land, plow deeply, mine, and exploit resources. A general lack of evidence of rapid sedimentation prior to the time of European contact implies that pre-Columbian agriculture was not highly disruptive geomorphically, although exceptions were likely in time and space, so this premise needs to be tested by careful study of pre-contact allu-vial sequences. Examples from northern California and the southeastern Piedmont support this interpretation by documenting geomorphically stable conditions followed by episodic fluvial sedimentation after colonization.
