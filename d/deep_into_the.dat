5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> realm of quantum physics, {{but it can}} be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 6th century AD Calakmul was {{assembling}} a far-reaching political alliance, activity that brought the city into conflict with the great city of Tikal. The influence of Calakmul extended <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Petén; king Tuun K'ab' Hix of Calakmul oversaw the enthronement of Aj Wosal to the rulership of Naranjo in 546. Another vassal of Tuun K'ab' Hix was taken captive by Yaxchilan {{on the banks of the}} Usumacinta River in 537.|$|E
5|$|Diagon Alley's {{flagship}} {{attraction is}} Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, 3-D motion-based steel roller coaster dark ride based around Gringotts Bank, the wizarding bank in Diagon Alley.

Unlike Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, this ride is hosted by Bill Weasley, played by Domhnall Gleeson, reprising his role from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of the {{intrinsic}} magnetic field on Venus, the solar wind penetrates relatively <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> genitals.|$|E

5|$|The one {{exception}} to the compactness of the quartet comes in the minuet. The minuet's first half is a standard 12 measures, but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flat-side keys.

5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{offensive}} {{drive of}} the second quarter began on an auspicious note as quarterback Sean Glennon completed a 16-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan. Following the play, a Boston College player committed a personal foul, which added 15yards {{to the end of}} the pass. Another long pass by Glennon, coupled with yet another Boston College penalty, put Virginia Tech <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> red zone, and the Hokies scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Morgan. With 8:15 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech narrowed Boston College's lead to just threepoints.|$|E
5|$|Following the Tech touchdown, Louisville {{attempted}} to answer with points {{of its own}} before halftime. After starting on his own 20-yard line, Hunter Cantwell completed two quick passes that resulted in 26yards. Two plays later, Michael Bush broke free for a 34-yard run, driving Louisville <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech side of the field. Despite having a first down at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line, Louisville was unable to gain any yards on three consecutive plays. Bush was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, and two Cantwell passes fell incomplete. Kicker Arthur Carmody came in to complete a 35-yard field goal, and with 2:16 remaining in the first half, Louisville led by a score of 17–10.|$|E

He {{returned}} to naval service in 1787 aboard HMS Bombay Castle and {{over the next four years}} moved between HMS Culloden and HMS Vengeance, all in the Channel Fleet. In 1792 Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in this position when the French Revolutionary War broke out a year later. Culloden was part of the Channel Fleet under Rotheram's old commander Lord Howe, and the ship was captained by Isaac Schomberg during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, in which Howe pursued a French fleet <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, bringing it to battle at the Glorious First of June.|$|E
