Soon after the war started, further research work on the ship was discontinued (after the war, the project was abandoned) and the shipyard concentrated on Admiralty work related to the war effort. To this end, 230 steel and wood vessels, corvettes, wooden minesweepers and air-sea rescues launches {{for the air force}} were built. During this period, the yard also repaired <b>existing</b> <b>crafts.</b> During a bombing of Dartmouth by Luftwaffe bombs on 18 September 1942, the Philip & Son shipyard was hit and 20 employees were killed. Two students of the Naval college were also killed. The bombs not only hit the shipyard at Noss but also the Dartmouth Harbour, sinking lighter aircraft in mid-air. The company managed to operate, however, even after the attack. The General Manager was awarded M.B.E., in appreciation of his dedicated efforts to start production within 48 hours after the bombing.

40|$|A {{study of}} fishing crafts was {{conducted}} in some coastal states of Nigeria to elucidate findings on the <b>existing</b> <b>crafts</b> as the baseline for further developments. Based on the technical designs, three types of fishing crafts were identified; planked, dug-out and half dug-out canoes. The planked canoes have the largest cubic number and dug-out canoes the least. At loadwater line, the ratio of freeboard to draft was 2 : 1 for planked canoes, indicating reserved buoyancy. Trim of planked canoe is by stern; the beam-length ratio for dug-out canoes showed high drag. Most of the sea-going canoes have U-shaped bottom hull profile capable of withstanding the rigours of surf landing and displayed good stability against longitudinal water wave. Gunwale and thwarts provided respectively the longitudinal and transverse strength of planked and half dug-out canoes. With its characteristics 'weight low down' construction, planked canoe represent the climax of small scale fishing crafts developments in Nigerian coastal waters. It's only draw back is durability. Further improvement in this canoe should be aimed at increasing the hull size and stiffness, water tightness of deck by coating, caulking, fastening, increasing level of motorization and installation of deck working equipments. Experimental design and use of fibre glass, aluminium and ferrocement hulls, together with improved planked canoe is highly advocate...|$|R

50|$|In late 1964, Saunders-Roe {{commenced}} {{design work}} on multiple hovercraft designs; {{in addition to}} the relatively huge SR.N4 and studies into a prospective 2,000 ton freighter, there was also interest in developing its existing smaller hovercraft range. In particular, the firm had observed customer demand for a model of the SR.N5 that would be capable of carrying a much greater payload; there was a view that the <b>existing</b> <b>craft</b> was uneconomic for what payload it could carry and that an expanded, or 'stretched', model would be able to rectify this. According to Saunders-Roe's own projections, an increase of the craft's payload by 110 per cent would only reduce performance by 10 per cent as the increased payload was in part offset by the expanded cushion area, which meant that cushion pressure would not need to be substantially increased instead.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930's AFL {{president}} William Green (president, 1924-1952) experimented with an industrial approach to organizing in the automobile and steel industries. [...] The AFL made forays into industrial unionism by chartering federal labor unions, which would organize across an industry and be chartered by the Federation, not through <b>existing</b> <b>craft</b> unions, guilds, or brotherhoods. As early as 1923, the AFL had chartered federal labor unions, including six news writer locals that had formerly {{been part of}} the International Typographical Union. However in the 1930's the AFL began chartering these federal labor unions as an industrial organizing strategy. The dues in these federal labor unions (FLUs) were kept intentionally low to make them more accessible to low paid industrial workers; however, these low dues later allowed the Internationals in the Federation to deny members of FLUs voting membership at conventions. In 1933, Green sent William Collins to Detroit to organize automobile workers into a federal labor union. [...] That same year workers at the Westinghouse plant in East Springfield MA, members of federal labor union 18476, struck for recognition. In 1933, the AFL received 1,205 applications for charters for federal labor unions, 1006 of which were granted. By 1934, the AFL had successfully organized 32,500 autoworkers using the federal labor union model. Most of the leadership of the craft union internationals that made up the federation, advocated for the FLU's to be absorbed into <b>existing</b> <b>craft</b> union internationals and for these internationals to have supremacy of jurisdiction. [...] At the 1933 AFL convention in Washington, DC John Frey of the Molders and Metal Trades pushed for craft union internationals to have jurisdictional supremacy over the FLU's; the Carpenters headed by William Hutchenson and the IBEW also pushed for FLU's to turn over their members to the authority of the craft internationals between 1933 and 1935. [...] In 1934, one hundred FLUs met separately and demanded that the AFL continue to issue charters to unions organizing on an industrial basis independent of the <b>existing</b> <b>craft</b> union internationals. [...] In 1935 the FLUs representing autoworkers and rubber workers both held conventions independent of the craft union internationals. [...] By the 1935 AFL convention, Green and the advocates of traditional craft unionism faced increasing dissension led by John L. Lewis of the coal miners, Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated, David Dubinsky of the Garment Workers, Charles Howard of the ITU, Thomas McMahon of the Textile Workers, and Max Zaritsky of the Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers, in addition {{to the members of the}} FLU's themselves. Lewis argued that the AFL was too heavily oriented toward traditional craftsmen, and was overlooking the opportunity to organize millions of semiskilled workers, especially those in industrial factories that made automobiles, rubber, glass and steel. In 1935 Lewis led the dissenting unions in forming a new Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO) within the AFL. Both the new CIO industrial unions, and the older AFL crafts unions grew rapidly after 1935. In 1936 union members enthusiastically supported Roosevelt's landslide reelection. Proposals for the creation of an independent labor party were rejected.|$|E

5000|$|Labor {{historian}} Philip S. Foner {{observed in}} 1997 that [...] "virtually every scholar" [...] {{who has studied}} the IWW considers it to be a type of syndicalist organization. Yet he likewise notes key differences. For example, while European syndicalists operate within mainstream unions, the IWW has always displayed an antagonism toward, and disdain for <b>existing</b> <b>craft</b> based trade unions in the United States. This has led the IWW to embrace the concept of dual unionism. When William Z. Foster offered the IWW an opportunity to begin a European syndicalist style program of [...] "boring from within" [...] the AFL, the IWW rejected it. Foner concludes, therefore, that the IWW did not inherit its philosophy of revolutionary industrial unionism from French Syndicalism. However, he does also note similarities. Foner believes that IWW members did learn about the organization's kinship with European syndicalist organizations through Wobbly publications, and thereby largely accepted the doctrines of syndicalism, especially after Bill Haywood brought back some ideas about syndicalist tactics from his 1910 visit to Europe.|$|E

The village was selected as a promising location for the project because of its proximity to Hội An (already a major tourist destination), which provided an existing tourist base, and its <b>existing</b> <b>craft</b> sector. A dual pedestrian-bicycle trail was established to lead visitors through the village to see the local woodworking shops, where {{they are able to}} observe craftsmen working and purchase their products. Concurrent with the development of infrastructure, a tourism service cooperative was established, as well as a skills training program for members and a marketing program which resulted in market linkages with several major hotels and tour operators operating in Hội An.

The success of the venture has led it to be considered a model case on which future sustainable tourism projects throughout Southeast Asia can be patterned.|$|E

It is a deliberate choice to keep the visual appearance of the probe that of a traditional crochet hook to indicate what materials and creations this tool does address.

Quantitative results identified the majority of firms as micro-enterprises with those firms exhibiting entrepreneurial flair achieving significant amounts of turnover, despite severe resource constraints. The main export markets were European Union countries and North America. Combining the qualitative and quantitative results enabled profiling of craft firm types.

40|$|In {{the coming}} decades the {{detection}} of Earth-like extrasolar planets, either apparently lifeless or exhibiting spectral signatures of life, will encourage design studies for craft to visit them.

This velocity is calculated to be below velocities previously projected for interstellar missions, suggesting that an active sterilization protocol prior to launch might be required. Given uncertainties in the surface conditions of a destination extrasolar planet, particularly at microscopic scales, the potential for unknown biochemistries and biologies elsewhere, or the possible inoculation of a lifeless planet that is habitable, then both lander and orbiter interstellar missions should be completely free of all viable organisms, necessitating a planetary protection approach applied to orbiters and landers bound for star systems with unknown local conditions for habitability.
