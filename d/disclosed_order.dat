40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{information}} {{content of the}} two types of limit orders on the Australian Stock Exchange ASX: undisclosed orders (ULOs) and limit orders. Given the large order quantity contained in ULOs, we attempt to examine the impact of ULO submissions, cancellations and executions on price changes and volatility over differing intervals within a day. Motivation is generated by the ASX decision to abolish the use of ULOs in favour of iceberg orders. Intraday analysis shows that the impact of both ULO and <b>disclosed</b> <b>order</b> submissions are no longer than one day. ULO buying/selling order submissions at the best bid/ask price increase/decrease returns and price volatility significantly more than disclosed orders. The cancellations of ULOs cause significantly larger price volatility than disclosed limit order cancellations. Compared with disclosed limit order submissions, there is an increase in liquidity from the significantly reduced spread upon DLO submissions.

40|$|Liquidity and {{transparency}} are nowadays key factors in competition between financial markets. Market liquidity means {{the ability for}} traders {{to buy or sell}} any amount of stocks immediately at a price very close to the current market price. Market transparency can be defined as the ability for traders to observe information about the trading process. Pretrade (Quote) transparency refers to the dissemination of the limit order book content. Posttrade (Trade) transparency refers to the public transmission of information on past trades. Today diffusion of information is improved by an increasing automation of the trading systems. However, the market transparency level {{lies at the heart of}} controversial debates. At first sight, a totally transparent structure would lead to a greater popularization of information. Indirectly, market liquidity and price e±ciency would be enhanced. However, no financial market appears to be fully transparent. Inversely, a lot of markets tend to maintain a certain opaqueness. The most often implemented means are the trades delayed reporting in quote-driven markets and the hidden orders in order-driven markets. In order-driven markets, orders submitted by traders are registered in an electronic limit order book according to their direction (buy or sell), their price (price priority) and their arrival time (time precedence). A trade occurs from the placement of an order satisfying the conditions of another order already in the book. Traders are told liquidity suppliers (demanders) when they submit limit (market) orders on the market. To be successful, orderdriven trading systems have to gather supply and demand of liquidity. Liquidity demanders submit their orders where they expect they will be filled. Hence markets have to expose liquidity offer to attract them. However, liquidity suppliers displaying their willingness to trade expose themselves to various risks. The order exposure risk is straight related to the market transparency level. Actually, some parasitic traders may infer the traders' motives or the securities values from the <b>disclosed</b> <b>order</b> flow (front-running). They also may try to benefit from implicit trading options (quote-matching) [Harris(1997) ]. Consequently, in order to incite traders to provide liquidity, order-driven trading systems have to propose facilities that help traders to control their order exposure risk. Most of financial markets permit traders to cancel and modify their orders at any time. Some systems, like NSC on Euronext, also allow them to use hidden orders. Traders submitting hidden orders show other market participants only a part of the total quantity they want to buy or sell. In this context, hidden orders seem to be a real trade-off between liquidity {{and transparency}}. They voluntarily allow markets to maintain opaqueness in order to avoid a flight of liquidity supply towards less transparent trading systems. Therefore, a lot of specific features are to be investigated beyond hidden order use, for both the market and the traders...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Features of the {{requirement}} to <b>disclose</b> <b>order</b> backlog {{raise questions about the}} usefulness of these disclosures in practice. Despite these concerns, I provide evidence that disclosing the dollar amount of order backlog in the 10 -K has several implications for firms in the manufacturing sector. On average, firms that <b>disclose</b> <b>order</b> backlog have significantly higher forward earnings response coefficients and greater investment efficiency. These effects, however, are concentrated amongst firms for which order backlog {{is expected to be a}} stronger signal of demand (i. e., firms that follow more of a make-to-order business model). Disclosers also have less persistent operating profitability when order backlog is a relatively more important signal of demand, suggesting that although order backlog can provide useful information for valuation and monitoring purposes, it can also influence competitors’ product market and investment decisions. The results should be of interest to regulators as they examine Regulation S-K disclosure requirements, and firms and standard setters as they prepare for greater forward-looking revenue disclosures under ASC 60...|$|R

We have uncovered a striking divergence between the DNA methylation profi les of SDH-defi cient GIST (n = 24) versus KIT tyrosine kinase pathway–mutated GIST (n = 39). Infi nium 450 K methylation array analysis of formalin-fi xed paraffi n-embedded tissues <b>disclosed</b> an <b>order</b> of mag-nitude greater genomic hypermethylation relative to SDH-defi cient GIST versus the KIT-mutant group (84. 9 K vs. 8. 4 K targets).

Comparison of SDH-mutant GIST with isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant glioma, another Krebs cycle–defective tumor type, revealed comparable measures of global hypo- and hypermethylation. These data expose a vital connection between succinate metabolism and genomic DNA methylation during tumorigenesis, and generally implicate the mitochondrial Krebs cycle in nuclear epigenomic maintenance.
