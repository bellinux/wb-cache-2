50|$|Stockport Town {{play their}} home matches at Stockport Sports Village, in Woodley, on a 3G Pitch (artificial turf). The stadium has a {{capacity}} of 2,384 spectators which includes 192 seats. In addition to the <b>first-team</b> <b>pitch,</b> the Stockport Sports Village Campus also accommodates 16 floodlit 3G pitches which are used by the local Charter Standard football teams {{and members of the}} public. The stadium was previously used by Stockport Sports before the club was liquidated in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{main stand}} on the <b>first-team</b> <b>pitch</b> cost Â£33,000 and took three years to complete. Minor {{modifications}} were made during the 1999 close season to comply with UCL regulations. In summer 2000 floodlights were erected following a successful fund raising appeal. These enable the club to comply with FA requirements for grounds at higher levels on the pyramid and also make Rangers eligible for cup competitions where floodlights are mandatory. In 2002 turnstiles were acquired from Wembley Stadium and these now form the centrepiece for a new ground entrance. The official opening was at the 2004 FA Cup-tie against Glapwell, when the crowd was swelled by a display at Outgang Road which featured the actual FA Cup itself. During summer 2005, the main stand was refurbished adding seats bought from Highfield Road, the former ground of Coventry City prior to their move to the Ricoh Arena.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{graduation}} from Dongsung High School, Yang {{was selected by}} the Kia Tigers in the 2nd round (1st pick, 9th overall) of the 2007 KBO Draft. He made his KBO debut on April 7, 2007 against the LG Twins at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in Seoul, coming from the bullpen, but allowed a solo home run in one inning pitched. He made his first start on April 12 against the Hyundai Unicorns and tossed 5.2 scoreless innings of four-hit ball. However, Yang struggled with his command and {{was never able to}} regain it to the level he had earlier in the season. At the end of May, Yang was eventually demoted to the reserver team of the Tigers. In August, the young left-hander came back to the Tigers <b>first-team</b> roster and <b>pitched</b> in relief of the Tigers' starters {{in the second half of}} the season. On September 29, 2007, Yang recorded his first professional win against the Hanwha Eagles in Daejeon, pitching five innings of two-hit, one-run ball as a starter. Yang finished his rookie season with a record of 1-2 and an ERA of 4.17 in 49.2 innings pitched, appearing in 31 games as a utility pitcher.|$|R
