40|$|AbstractIn this paper, further {{research}} is carried out to investigate the resistance encountered by an icebreaking vessel travelling through level <b>ice</b> and <b>channel</b> <b>ice</b> at low speed range. The present paper focuses on experimental and calculated ice resistances by some empirical formulas in both level <b>ice</b> and <b>channel</b> <b>ice.</b> In order to achieve the research, extra model tests {{have been done in}} an ice basin. Based on the measurements from model test, it is found that there exists a relationship between ice resistance, minimum ice load, maximum ice load and the standard deviation of ice load for head on operation in level ice. In addition, both level <b>ice</b> resistance and <b>channel</b> <b>ice</b> resistance are calculated and compared with model test results...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringSteven WarrenMedical device {{interoperability}} and re-configurability {{continue to}} be important areas of research toward the realization of verifiable medical systems that can be rapidly assembled {{to meet the needs}} of specific patients. This thesis addresses the modularized design of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump to be used within the context of the Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF), an open source framework under development by Kansas State University and the University of Pennsylvania that is informed by the Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) specification managed by the MD PnP program and its collaborators. The thesis illustrates how to set up the MDCF development environment with Eclipse so that a developer can create software for both a remote MDCF console and a local PCA pump, where <b>ICE</b> <b>channels</b> are used for message transmission. Software development on the MDCF console side includes the development of apps that communicate with a local PCA pump through <b>ICE</b> <b>channels</b> and (b) the development of a GUI that can be launched from an MDCF console to configure, control, and monitor a PCA pump. Software development on the PCA pump side includes the creation of (a) <b>ICE</b> <b>channels</b> that can communicate with an MDCF console and (b) multiple threads for corresponding UART ports that support a modularized design. Several hardware modules were implemented to demonstrate the modularized design approach: an alarm module, a patient button module, a pump module, and a control panel module. These modules employ BeagleBone, Arduino, and MSP 430 boards. Status information is displayed on an MDCF console GUI, a PCA pump GUI, and a local LCD screen. An enhanced PCA pump or general medical sub-system with more modules can be developed using a similar method by connecting individual modules to UART ports and then creating the corresponding threads to support device-console communication...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the design of ships {{strengthened}} for navigation in icy waters. The attention is focused, in particular, on the expedition yachts: innovative luxury vessels conceived for a service also in harsh climate regions. For such a special yacht the design must face the problems related to the navigation in brash <b>ice</b> <b>channels,</b> {{and for this reason}} the vessel must comply with an ice class regulation. The ice class rules of the Finnish and Swedish Maritime Administrations can be considered as the main reference in this field; indeed these regulations have been adopted by most of the IACS members since 1985. The design philosophy behind the ice class rules is analysed in relation to its main features, which are essentially based on both operative and safety aspects. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the parameters affecting the structural scantling and the propulsion power requirements. The ice class concepts have been applied for an expedition yacht 35 m long. Feasible structural solutions for the ice-strengthened hull are shown along with the verification of the powering needed for a safe navigation in ice...|$|R

50|$|The Hochablass (High Drain) dam on the north-flowing Lech river {{south of}} Augsburg {{dates back to}} 1647. It was most {{recently}} rebuilt in 1911-1912. The dam diverts river water into the Hauptstadtbach (Capital Creek) which branches into the many canals of the Augsburg Lech district as it flows through the town. In Medieval times, the canals were used for drinking water, water wheel operation, and sewage disposal. In 1875, in order to collect drinking water from the upstream end of the system, a water collection and filtration plant was built straddling a new bypass branch of Capital Creek, near the dam. (In 2007 it was decommissioned and converted into a waterworks museum and a small hydro power station.)
