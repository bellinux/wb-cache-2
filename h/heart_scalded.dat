He wants to marry a Frenchwoman on me, and to go away and be a {{foreigner}} and desert his mother and betray his country. It's mad he is with the roaring of the cannons and he killing the Germans and the Germans killing him, bad cess to them! My boy is taken from me and turned agen me; and who is {{to take care of}} me in my old age after all I've done for him, ochone! ochone! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't--" [...] he began, but got no farther, feeling weak {{in all his}} bones. She never reproached him or {{was angry}} with him. He was often cruelly ashamed. But still again his anger burst like a bubble surcharged; and still, {{when he saw her}} eager, silent, as it were, blind face, he felt he wanted to throw the pencil in it; and still, when he saw her hand {{trembling}} and her mouth parted with suffering, his <b>heart</b> was <b>scalded</b> with pain for her. And because of the intensity to which she roused him, he sought her.|$|R
60|$|He {{had to see}} {{her tears}} come, fall over her {{scarcely}} moving face, that only puckered sometimes, down on to her breast, that was so still, scarcely moving. And there was no noise, save now and again, when, with a strange, somnambulant movement, she took her handkerchief and wiped her face and blew her nose, and went on with the noiseless weeping. He knew that any offer of comfort from himself would be worse than useless, hateful to her, jangling her. She must cry. But it drove him insane. His <b>heart</b> was <b>scalded,</b> his brain hurt in his head, he went away, out of the house.|$|R
6000|$|Ino. Why does my <b>heart</b> misgive? & <b>scalding</b> tears, [...] That should but mourn, now prophecy her loss? [...] Oh, Proserpine! Where'er your luckless fate [...] Has hurried you,--to wastes of desart sand, [...] Or black Cymmerian cave, or dread Hell, [...] Yet Ino {{still will}} follow! Look where Eunoe [...] Comes, with down cast eyes and faltering steps, [...] I fear the worst;-- ...|$|R
60|$|In short, your {{suggestions}} {{have broken}} the <b>heart</b> of the <b>scald.</b> He doesn't agree with them all; and those he does agree with, the spirit indeed is willing, but the d----d flesh cannot, cannot, cannot, see its way to profit by. I think I'll lay it by for nine years, like Horace. I think the well of Castaly's run out. No more the Muses round my pillow haunt. I am fallen once more to the mere proser. God bless you.|$|R
5000|$|THE COW OF A WIDOW OF BREFFNY : In {{the ancient}} times a man {{the name of}} M'Gauran ruled in these parts. He was a cruel tyrant surely and prouder than the High King of Ireland or O'Rourke was a Prince in Breffny. He {{conceited}} for {{to build a house}} would stand to the end of time, a stronghold past the art of man to overthrow or the fury of the wind to batter down. He gave out that all the bullocks in his dominions were to be slaughtered and mortar wet with the blood of them. Evenly the cows were not spared at the latter end, the way a powerful lamentation went up from the poor of the world were looking on the lonesome fields. You that are young will be thinking the blackness of his spirit and the cruelty of his heart brought a curse on him to rot the flesh off his living bones. You will be expectant of the story of a king, and he walking the provinces of Ireland a skeleton and a warning to the eyes of man. But the aged and wise have understanding to know of the tribulation laid out for the good and the just, they putting their sorrows over them in this world where the evil have prosperity. The like will be enduring for a short space only, and a queer fate waits the wicked in the age-long hours of eternity. Proud is the tyrant and wealthy till they set him in the clay: humbled with fear is his spirit at the journey's end. There was a widow woman had her little dwelling convenient to where M'Gauran was building his castle. Gold she had none, nor evenly a coin was of silver, one cow only was her riches on the earth. (And surely them that had heart to molest her like would be robbing the dead of the raiment is with them in the grave.) Herself was more nor horrid lonesome the day she seen the creature driven from her by a man of the chiefs, he having a lengthy knife in his hand. At the fall of night a traveller came to the poor woman's cabin door. He was a bent, aged man with a sorrowful countenance on him, and the garments did cover him were rags. She invited him within, giving him the kindly welcome, and she set out what food was in the place for his refreshment. [...] "It is destroyed I am with a parching drouth is splitting my gullet," [...] says he, [...] "and I walking the mountainy ways since the screech of dawn. The sun was splitting the bushes at the noon of day, and the fury of it was eating into my skin. But no person took compassion on me at all." [...] With that the widow set a mug of milk before him, and it the last drop was in the countryside. He drank it down, middling speedy, and he held out the cup to be filled again. [...] " [...] 'Tis a <b>heart</b> <b>scald</b> surely," [...] says herself, 'that I be to refuse the request of a man is weary walking the territory of Ireland, since the rising sun brought light on his path. There is a king in these parts, stranger, and he has the cattle destroyed on the poor of the world, the way he will have a lasting mortar to his house." [...] 'Isn't yourself after giving me the loveliest mug of sweet milk ? [...] " [...] says he, like one was doubtful of the honesty of her words. [...] "The last drop was in this townland, stranger, and it is heart glad I am that it refreshed you. I had but the one cow only, the grandest milker in the land, and she was driven from me this day â€” up yonder to the masons are working with their shovels dripping red." [...] "I am thinking it is four strong walls in the pit of Hell are building for that chieftain's soul. Maybe it's red hot they'll be, and he imprisoned within them for a thousand years and more," [...] says the traveller. [...] "Let there be what masonry there will in the next world, the wealth of the people cements his castle there beyond. For the cow and the milk and the butter are the gold of the dwellers on the land," [...] says the widow. [...] "But let you be resting a while in this place: what haste is on you to depart?" [...] For she seen he was rising to be gone. He raised his hand in benediction, and the voice of him speaking was that sweet it charmed the birds off the bushes, the way they flew round him in the darkening night. [...] "May the blessing of the King of Heaven be upon you. May He send you a cow will never run dry, and you milking her at all seasons of the year to the day of your departure from the world." [...] With that the place was bare of his presence. He was gone the like of a spirit has power to travel the land unseen. At the morning of the day following the poor woman stood at her cottage door, facing out to the mountains are a long journey from that place. Didn't she see a great wonder: A piece fell clean from the hillside and from it came a cow, white as the driven snow, she travelling faster nor the wind. The widow seen all as clear as we do be regarding the rising of the sun in the Eastern sky. What- ever power was laid on her eyes the distance was no obstruction to her vision that day. But {{it was not until the}} creature came and stood by herself that she bethought her of the benediction of the traveller, and the cow would never run dry. That was the beast had the great renown on her: people came from every art and part to be looking on her. The milk she gave was richer nor the best of cream, and the butter off it was the best in Ireland. The day the widow died, a young child seen the white cow travelling away to the mountains. And no man beheld her more, nor evenly heard tell of the like. But the Gap of Glan confronts us to this day, and that is where the creature rose to the light of the world.|$|R
6000|$|Dear friend, sit down, {{the tale}} {{is long and}} sad [...] And in my faintings, I presume, your love [...] Will more comply than help. A Lord I had, [...] And have, of whom some grounds, which may improve, [...] I hold for two lives, and both lives in me. [...] To him I brought a dish of fruit one day, [...] And in the middle placed my heart. But he [...] (I sigh to say) [...] Look'd on a servant, who did know his eye, [...] Better than you know me, or (which is one) [...] Than I myself. The servant instantly, [...] Quitting the fruit, seiz'd on my heart alone, [...] And threw it in a font, wherein did fall [...] A stream of blood, which issued from the side [...] Of a great rock: I well {{remember}} all, [...] And have good cause: there it was dipt and dyed, [...] And wash'd, and wrung: the very wringing yet [...] Enforceth tears. [...] "Your heart was foul, I fear." [...] Indeed 'tis true. I did and do commit [...] Many a fault, more than my lease will bear; [...] Yet still ask'd pardon, and was not denied. [...] But you shall hear. After my heart was well, [...] And clean and fair, as I one eventide [...] (I sigh to tell) [...] Walk'd by myself abroad, I saw a large [...] And spacious furnace flaming, and thereon [...] A boiling caldron, round about whose verge [...] Was in great letters set AFFLICTION. [...] The greatness shew'd the owner. So I went [...] To fetch a sacrifice out of my fold, [...] Thinking with that, which I did thus present, [...] To warm his love, which, I did fear, grew cold. [...] But as my heart did tender it, the man [...] Who was to take it from me, slipt his hand, [...] And threw my <b>heart</b> into the <b>scalding</b> pan; [...] My heart that brought it (do you understand?) [...] The offerer's heart. [...] "Your heart was hard, I fear." [...] Indeed 'tis true. I found a callous matter [...] Began to spread and to expatiate there: [...] But with a richer drug than scalding water [...] I bath'd it often, ev'n with holy blood, [...] Which at a board, while many drank bare wine, [...] A friend did steal into my cup for good, [...] Ev'n taken inwardly, and most divine [...] To supple hardnesses. But at the length [...] Out of the caldron getting, soon I fled [...] Unto my house, where to repair the strength [...] Which I had lost, I hasted to my bed: [...] But when I thought to sleep out all these faults, [...] (I sigh to speak) [...] I found that some had stuff'd the bed with thoughts, [...] I would say thorns. Dear, could my heart not break, [...] When with my pleasures ev'n my rest was gone? [...] Full well I understood who had been there: [...] For I had given the key to none but one: [...] It must be he. [...] "Your heart was dull, I fear." [...] Indeed a slack and sleepy state of mind [...] Did oft possess me; so that when I pray'd, [...] Though my lips went, my heart did stay behind. [...] But all my scores were by another paid, [...] Who took my guilt upon him. [...] "Truly, Friend, [...] "For aught I hear, your Master shews to you [...] "More favour than you wot of. Mark the end. [...] "The font did only what was old renew [...] "The caldron suppled what was grown too hard: [...] "The thorns did quicken what was grown too dull: [...] "All did but strive to mend what you had marr'd. [...] "Wherefore be cheer'd, and praise him to the full [...] "Each day, each hour, each moment of the week [...] "Who fain would have you be new, tender quick." ...|$|R
