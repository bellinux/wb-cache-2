50|$|<b>Faujasite</b> is synthesized, as {{are other}} zeolites, from alumina {{sources such as}} sodium {{aluminate}} and silica sources such as sodium silicate. Other alumosilicates such as kaolin are used as well. The ingredients are dissolved in a basic environment such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and crystallized at 70 to 300 °C (usually at 100 °C). After crystallization the <b>faujasite</b> is in its sodium form and must be ion exchanged with ammonium to improve stability. The ammonium ion is removed later by calcination which renders the zeolite in its acid form. Depending on the silica-to-alumina ratio of their framework, synthetic <b>faujasite</b> zeolites are divided into X and Y zeolites. In X zeolites that ratio is between 2 and 3, while in Y zeolites it is 3 or higher. The negative charges of the framework are balanced by the positive charges of cations in non-framework positions. Such zeolites have ion-exchange, catalytic and adsorptive properties. The stability of the zeolite increases with the silica-to-alumina ratio of the framework. It is also affected by the type and amount of cations located in non-framework positions. For catalytic cracking, the Y zeolite is often used in a rare earth-hydrogen exchanged form.|$|E

40|$|An {{archetype}} {{of a green}} and sustainable strategy for the catalytic upgrading of both anilines and bio-based derivatives including glycerol acetals, p-coumaryl-like alcohols, and lactones can be devised {{by the use of}} dimethyl carbonate (DMC).

Also, selective transesterifications of DMC with glycerol acetals and lactones can be achieved under thermal or catalytic conditions. The mechanism of such reactions has been formulated based on the steric requisites and the amphoteric nature of <b>faujasites,</b> the combined effect of the temperature and base catalysts, and the ambident electrophilic reactivity of DMC. Overall, methylations and methoxycarbonylations mediated by DMC are not only more selective but far safer than conventional procedures involving noxious phosgene and methyl halides or dimethyl sulfate...|$|R

Three different Si/Al ratios have been considered in order to represent the Na-LSX (Si/Al = 1), Na-X (Si/Al = 1. 4), and Na-Y (Si/Al = 2. 0) <b>faujasites</b> that have the same framework topology but different basic properties. For each system, the most representative Al repartitions among the framework tetrahedral sites have been taken into account and their related preferred Ni 2 + configurations have been established. Upon decrease of the Al content, the Ni 2 + coordination changes from a perfect octahedral environment with Ni 2 + located in the center of the hexagonal prisms (Ni/Na-LSX) to five 4 -fold and four 3 -fold coordinations in Na-X and Na-Y <b>faujasites,</b> respectively. The preferred locations, inside the hexagonal prism, are those where Ni 2 + can bind the highest number (highest coordination) of basic framework oxygen atoms even though the related Ni-O distances simultaneously increase. All configurations are associated to a significant distortion of the hexagonal prism as compared to the host Na-faujasite cluster which illustrates the zeolite flexibility. While 4 -fold coordinated nickel weakly interacts with the framework Y-faujasite, it induces a stronger framework distortion.

40|$|International audienceReliable {{experimental}} IR {{and theoretical}} approaches, both investigating CO adsorption on NaY <b>faujasites,</b> are supporting that CO capture occurs through {{the completion of}} the vacant coordination of Na+ cations located in the accessible SII sites. As a result, carbonyl adsorbed species are formed by the capture of one, two or three CO molecules and are experimentally discernable by their respective IR positions that are down-shifted by an average 11 - 12 cm− 1 value for each captured CO molecule. DFT analysis is proposed for comparison and reproduces well the observed experimental shift of the νCO positions of the different polycarbonyls of interest. In addition, the effect of Si or Al composition surrounding the SII Na+ cation is investigated and results suggest that polycarbonyls that are formed might be in connection with the acidic strength of the cationic sites. This combined study completes and improves the understanding of the complex issue of CO adsorption at 80 K widely used as a model to explain how physical adsorption takes place in NaY <b>faujasites</b> working as an efficient industrial adsorbent in gas separation or gas purification processes...|$|R
40|$|At 140 ◦C, in the {{presence}} of alkali metal exchanged <b>faujasites,</b> preferably NaY, as catalysts, glycerine carbonate (GlyC) is an efficient and green alkylating agent of primary aromatic amines (p-XC 6 H 4 NH 2, X = H, OMe, OH, Cl) : the reaction takes place with a high conversion (~ 90 %) and a good selectivity (80 – 90 %) for the formation of N-(2, 3 -dihydroxy) propyl anilines (p-XC 6 H 4 NHCH 2 CH(OH) CH 2 OH). The alkylation process does not proceed through an exclusive nucleophilic substitution of anilines at the C 5 position of GlyC. Evidence proves that a dehydrative condensation of anilines with GlyC produces intermediate species, and both transesterification and hydrolysis reactions are involved to obtain the final N-alkyl derivatives. A mechanism is proposed accordingly. Experiments show that <b>faujasites</b> are recyclable catalysts on condition that they are exposed to a mild thermal activation (70 ◦C, 18 mbar) prior to their re-use. Otherwise, if zeolites are calcined (400 ◦C, air), both the catalyst activity and the reaction selectivity drop. Isolated yields (60 – 65 %) of N-(2, 3 -dihydroxy) propyl anilines are somewhat limited by the difficult separation of the unreacted GlyC and of the by-product glycerine. Nonetheless, the overall efficiency of the method is comparable to that of alternative routes based on highly toxic reagents (glycidol and aryl halides) ...|$|R
