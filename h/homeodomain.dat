40|$|The DNA binding {{specificities}} of the <b>homeodomains</b> {{contained in}} thyroid transcription factor 1 and Antennapedia have been compared. The two <b>homeodomains</b> recognize different DNA sequences, despite the similar amino acid sequences of their recognition helix. Mutations {{that make the}} recognition helix of thyroid transcription factor 1 {{identical to the one}} contained in Antennapedia have no effects on the binding specificity of thyroid transcription factor 1. The exchange of other segments between these two <b>homeodomains</b> allows the identification of the regions responsible for the observed DNA binding specificities.

40|$|Background: Homology-based {{modeling}} and global optimization of energy are two complementary approaches to prediction of protein structures. A {{combination of the}} two approaches is proposed in which a novel component is added to the energy and forces similarity between homologous proteins. Results: The combination was tested for two families: pancreatic hormones and <b>homeodomains.</b> The simulated lowest-energy structure of the pancreatic hormones is a reasonable approximation to the native fold. The lowest-energy structure of the <b>homeodomains</b> has 80 % of the native contacts, but the helices are not packed correctly. The fourth lowest energy structure of the <b>homeodomains</b> has the correct helix packing (RMS 5. 4 Å and 82 % of the correct contacts). Optimizations of a single protein of the family yield considerably worse structures. Conclusions: Use of coupled homologous proteins in the search for the native fold is more successful than the folding of a single protein in the family...|$|R

2500|$|Retinoic acid via the {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} influences {{the process of}} cell differentiation, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover {{the same amount of}} space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different <b>homeodomain</b> transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. [...] Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.|$|E

40|$|The maize ZmHox 2 a gene encodes two <b>homeodomains</b> which {{originated}} by a 699 bp duplication {{within an}} ancestral precursor. The sequences {{of the two}} ZmHox 2 a <b>homeodomains</b> are highly diverged in the N-terminal arm, while residues in the helical part have mostly been conserved. We show here that both ZmHox 2 a <b>homeodomains</b> are functional DNA-binding motifs but exhibit different target site specificities. CASTing experiments reveal a TCCT motif recognized by HD 1 but a GATC tetranucleotide as the recognition sequence of HD 2. Mutation of the central nucleotides in both tetranucleotide core motifs abolishes DNA binding. A domain swap experiment indicates that target site specificity is achieved in a combinatorial manner by {{the contributions of the}} diverged N-terminal arms together with the slightly different recognition helices. Computer modelling suggests that K 47 and H 54 in the recognition helices preferentially contact the bases at the 3 '-terminus of the tetranucleotide target sequences...|$|R
40|$|The Bar {{mutation}} B of Drosophila melanogaster and optic morphology mutation Om(1 D) of Drosophila ananassae {{result in}} suppression of ommatidium differentiation at the anterior {{portion of the}} eye. Examinations was made to determine the genes responsible for these mutations. Both loci were found to share in common {{a different type of}} homeobox gene, which we call "BarH 1. " Polyptides encoded by D. melanogaster and D. ananassae BarH 1 genes consist of 543 and 604 amino acids, respectively, with <b>homeodomains</b> identical in sequence except for one amino acid substitution. A unique feature of these <b>homeodomains</b> is that the phenylalanine residue in helix 3, conserved in all metazoan <b>homeodomains</b> so far examined, is replaced by a tyrosine residue. By Northern blotting, considerably more BarH 1 RNA was detected in the Bar mutant than in wild type. P element-mediated transformation showed Bar-like eye malformation to be induced by transient overexpression of the BarH 1 gene in the late third-instar larvae. Somatic recombination analysis indicated normal gene functions of the Bar region, including the BarH 1 gene, to be required for normal eye morphogenesis...|$|R

50|$|Homeoprotein {{transcription}} factors typically {{switch on}} cascades of other genes. The <b>homeodomain</b> binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. However, {{the specificity of}} a single <b>homeodomain</b> protein is usually not enough to recognize only its desired target genes. Most of the time, <b>homeodomain</b> proteins act in the promoter region of their target genes as complexes with other transcription factors.

40|$|SummaryThe {{recognition}} of specific DNA-binding sites by transcription factors {{is a critical}} yet poorly understood step in the control of gene expression. Members of the Hox family of transcription factors bind DNA by making nearly identical major groove contacts via the recognition helices of their <b>homeodomains.</b> In vivo specificity, however, often depends on extended and unstructured regions that link Hox <b>homeodomains</b> to a DNA-bound cofactor, Extradenticle (Exd). Using a combination of structure determination, computational analysis, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that Hox proteins recognize specific Hox-Exd binding sites via residues located in these extended regions that insert into the minor groove but only when presented with the correct DNA sequence. Our results suggest that these residues, which are conserved in a paralog-specific manner, confer specificity by recognizing a sequence-dependent DNA structure instead of directly reading a specific DNA sequence...|$|R

40|$|The {{homeobox}} genes encode {{a family}} of DNA-binding regulatory proteins whose function and genomic organization make them an important model system {{for the study of}} development and differentiation. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved regions of Antennapediaclass <b>homeodomains</b> were designed to detect and identify homeobox sequences in populations of DNA or RNA by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here we present a survey of sequences detected by PCR using an initial set of primers (HoxA and HoxB) based on an early nucleotide consensus for vertebrate Antennapedia-class <b>homeodomains.</b> Several novel sequences are reported from both mouse genomic DNA and RNA from the developing mouse telencephalon. Forebrain-derived clones are similar to the chicken CHox 7, Drosophila H 2. 0, and mouse Hlx genes. PCR also proved to be a rapid method for identifying homeobox sequences from diverse metazoan species. Cloning of three Antennapedia-related sequences from cnidarians provides evidence of ancient roles for homeobox genes early in metazoan evolution...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} of 10 new human homeobox sequences. Altogether, we have isolated and sequenced 30 human homeoboxes clustered in 4 chromosomal regions called HOX loci. HOX 1 includes 8 homeoboxes in 90 kb of DNA on chromosome 7. HOX 2 includes 9 homeoboxes in 180 kb on chromosome 17. HOX 3 contains at least 7 homeoboxes in 160 kb on chromosome 12. Finally, HOX 4 includes 6 homeoboxes in 70 kb on chromosome 2. <b>Homeodomains</b> obtained from the conceptual translation of the isolated homeoboxes {{can be attributed to}} 13 homology groups {{on the basis of their}} primary peptide sequence. Moreover, it is possible to align the 4 HOX loci so that corresponding <b>homeodomains</b> in all loci share the maximal sequence identity. The complex of these observations supports and extends an evolutionary hypothesis concerning the origin of mammalian and fly homeobox gene complexes.

40|$|Motivation: Recognition of {{specific}} DNA sequences {{is a central}} mechanism by which transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression. Many TF binding preferences, however, are unknown or poorly characterized, {{in part due to}} the difficulty associated with determining their specificity experimentally, and an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms governing sequence specificity. New techniques that estimate the affinity of TFs to all possible k-mers provide a new opportunity to study DNA-protein interaction mechanisms, and may facilitate inference of binding preferences for members of a given TF family when such information is available for other family members. Results: We employed a new data set consisting of the relative preferences of mouse <b>homeodomains</b> for all 8 -base DNA sequences in order to ask how well we can predict the binding profiles of <b>homeodomains</b> when given only their protein sequences. We evaluated a panel of standard statistical inference techniques, as well as variations of the protein features considered. Nearest-neighbour among functionally-important residues emerged among the most effective methods. Our results underscore the complexity of TF-DNA recognition, and suggest a rational approach for future analyses of TF families. ...|$|R
40|$|The DNA-binding {{domain of}} the c-myb {{protooncogene}} product consists of three imperfect tandem repeats of 51 or 52 amino acids, each of which contains three conserved tryptophans, spaced 18 or 19 amino acids apart. The structure of the third repeat, which is essential for sequence-specific DNA binding, has been determined by NMR with distance geometry calculation. It includes three well-defined helices (residues 149 - 162, 166 - 172, and 178 - 187) maintained by a hydrophobic core that includes the three conserved tryptophans, together with two histidines. Helices 2 and 3 form a structure related to but distinct from a canonical helix-turn-helix motif. In particular, the turn between these helices is one amino acid longer than the corresponding turn in bacterial repressors and <b>homeodomains</b> and contains a proline residue. In addition, {{the architecture of the}} three helices is different from those of <b>homeodomains</b> and DNA-binding domains of bacterial repressors.

The four class 2 genes share 55 to 58 % identical residues with kn 1, although the conservation within the class is greater than 87 %. Expression patterns were analyzed by RNA gel blot analysis. Class 1 genes were highly expressed in meristem-enriched tissues, such as the vegetative meristem and ear primordia. Expression was not detectable in leaves. The class 2 genes were expressed in all tissues, although one was abundantly expressed in roots. The genes were mapped using recombinant inbred populations.

50|$|The mature IRX1 protein has 480 {{amino acid}} residues, with a {{molecular}} mass of 49,600 Daltons and an isoelectric point of 5.7. A BLAST search revealed that IRX1 contains two highly conserved domains: a <b>homeodomain</b> and a characteristic IRO motif of unknown function. The <b>homeodomain</b> {{belongs to the}} TALE (three amino acid loop extension) class of homeodomains, and {{is characterized by the}} addition of three extra amino acids {{between the first and second}} helix of three alpha helices that comprise the domain. The presence of this well characterized <b>homeodomain</b> strongly suggests that IRX1 acts as a transcription factor. This is further supported by the predicted localization of IRX1 to the nucleus. The IRO motif is a region downstream of the <b>homeodomain</b> that is found only in members of the Iroquois-class <b>homeodomain</b> proteins, though its function is poorly understood. However, its similarity to an internal region of the Notch receptor protein suggests that it may be involved with protein-protein interaction.
