Data derived from a large-scale ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis programme in high producing dairy cows. Over a 3 -year period (2004 - 2007), a very low incidence (0. 5 %: 15 of 3094) of anomalous pregnancies was recorded. The results revealed that the following anomalies were detected on days 35 - 41 of gestation in cows carrying singletons with one single corpus luteum: embryo death in eight cows (0. 3 %); and embryo in the uterine horn contralateral to the corpus luteum in seven cows (0. 2 %). All these animals suffered pregnancy loss during the early <b>foetal</b> <b>period.</b> In cows carrying dead embryos, no signs of conceptus degeneration were observed on pregnancy diagnosis. Amnion size (approximately 25 mm diameter) and uterine horn fluid contents were estimated {{to be similar to}} those of the normal pregnant cows in this period. In the contralateral gestations, live embryos were observed in all ultrasound checks before pregnancy loss. Uterine fluid contents increased in the two cows in which gestation continued for more than a week. In the cases of embryo death but not in those of contralateral gestation, a drop in PAG- 1 levels was noted prior to pregnancy loss. Two cows carrying dead embryos increased with time allantoic fluid contents. The PAG- 1 values increased with time in one cow bearing a dead embryo (from 2. 31 to 6. 79 ng/ml) and in two of the contralateral gestations (from 1. 66 to 2. 33 ng/ml and from 0. 39 to 6. 79 ng/ml, respectively).

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS), {{caused by}} the presence of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (HC 21), is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation with an incidence of approximately 1 / 700 live births. The sequence of the human chromosome 21 provided evidence for the presence of approximately 220 genes. An important challenge is now to understand how three normal copies of these genes are associated with the various DS phenotypes (mental retardation, congenital heart disease, early onset Alzheimers disease and an increased risk of leukemia). To define where HC 21 genes exert their function and identify their possible role in the DS phenotype we have decided to perform a systematic analysis of the expression profile of their murine homologues. We collected 150 murine cDNA clones from several sources. To obtain a high resolution expression pattern several complementary methods were combined: (i) RT-PCR on a mouse cDNA panel of 12 adult tissues and 4 developmental stages; (ii) wholemount in situ hybridisation of E 9. 5 and E 10. 5 embryos and (iii) section in situhybridisation of E 14. 5 embryos and of P 7 brains. This set of whole embryos and sections corresponds to mid and late embryonic and <b>foetal</b> human <b>periods,</b> when most of the major organs and body regions are organised. Genes showing an interesting and/or restricted expression pattern were analysed further on appropriate sections at more developmental timepoints. 87 % of the tested genes showed a clear expression pattern during murine development. In 37 % of the cases expression was ubiquitous while 50 % of the cDNAs showed a differential expression pattern in the embryonal tissues.

Currently, approximately 100 genes have already been tested some of which display a pattern of expression relevant to the congenital heart disease and to the mental retardation observed in DS.

40|$|Background The {{increased}} {{occurrence of}} obstetric complications (OCs) {{in patients with}} schizophrenia suggests that alterations in neurodevelopment may be of importance to the aetiology of the illness. Abnormal cortical folding may reflect subtle deviation from normal neurodevelopment during the <b>foetal</b> or neonatal <b>period.</b> In the present study, we hypothesized that OCs would be related to cortical folding abnormalities in schizophrenia patients corresponding to areas where patients with schizophrenia display altered cortical folding when compared with healthy controls. Method In total, 54 schizophrenia patients and 54 healthy control subjects underwent clinical examination and magnetic resonance image scanning on a 1. 5 T scanner. Information on OCs was collected from original birth records. An automated algorithm was used to calculate a three-dimensional local gyrification index (lGI) at numerous points across the cortical mantle. Results In both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, {{an increasing number of}} OCs was significantly related to lower lGI in the left pars triangularis (p< 0. 0005) in Broca's area. For five other anatomical cortical parcellations in the left hemisphere, a similar trend was demonstrated. No significant relationships between OCs and lGI were found in the right hemisphere and there were no significant case-control differences in lGI. Conclusions The reduced cortical folding in the left pars triangularis, associated with OCs in both patients and control subjects suggests that the cortical effect of OCs is caused by factors shared by schizophrenia patients and healthy controls rather than factors related to schizophrenia alon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} recent studies suggest the effects of several growth factors as well as genetic factors on the {{development}} and differentiation of the testes and excretory ducts. One {{of the most important}} growth factors affecting the development and differentiation of the above-mentioned organs may be epidermal growth factor (EGF). Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of EGF on the development of the testes and excretory ducts of male rats by determining the immunolocalization of EGF receptors in these organs during <b>foetal</b> and postnatal <b>periods.</b> To do this, testicular and excretory duct tissue samples from prenatals of 13, 16 and 18 days, neonates, 10 -day-olds and adults were obtained and processed for light microscopy for immunohistochemical examination. APAAP immunohistochemical staining was applied to 5 - 7 mm thick paraffin sections. While there was a strong immunoreactivity for EGFR in coelomic epithelium and a relatively weaker immunostaining in the mesonephric duct on prenatal day 13, differentiated testes and Wolffian ducts demonstrated strong EGFR immunoreactivity on pre-natal day 16. Interstitial Leydig cells of the testes and Wolffian ducts showed strong immunostaining on prenatal day 18. This strong EGFR immunoreactivity was maintained during the postnatal period and remained positive in the adult epididymis, which differen-tiated from the proximal part of the Wolffian duct.

The Swedish Medical Birth Register {{was linked to the}} Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Perinatal data for singleton children who were prescribed anti-asthmatic medication (n = 61 256) were compared with corresponding data for all singleton children born in Sweden from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2003 and surviving to 1 July 2005 (n = 1 338 319). Mantel-Haenszel's odds ratios were calculated after adjustment for various known confounders. Being the first-born child, maternal age above 44 yr, involuntary childlessness for more than 1 yr, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal diabetes mellitus of any kind, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, and instrumental vaginal delivery were all associated with an increased prescription of anti-asthmatic medication during childhood. Preterm birth, low birth weight, being small for gestational age, respiratory problems, mechanical ventilation, and sepsis and/or pneumonia were also associated with increased drug prescriptions. Neonatal phototherapy and/or icterus were risk determinants for children who developed asthma before the age of 12. After controlling for confounders, the odds ratio for phototherapy and/or icterus remained at 1. 30 (95 % confidence interval 1. 16 - 1. 47).

40|$|The brain {{undergoes}} rapid {{structural and}} functional changes during gestation {{and in the}} first two years of life. But brain development also continues throughout childhood and adolescence with cognitive abilities getting improved. Threats to the vulnerable Central Nervous System can have long-lasting effects throughout the <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>periods</b> and beyond infancy, on all aspects of development. This thesis investigates the long-term associations of prenatal tobacco exposure, as well as the long-term associations of breastfeeding with brain and cognitive development of adolescents. Further, it investigates the short-term effects of omega- 3 supplementation on brain and cognition of school-aged children. These will be examined in order to identify solutions for optimal development, both at brain and cognitive level, for the new generation. The first study is entirely based on maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy association with cognitive development of adolescents. This study found no differences on cognitive development of exposed and non-exposed adolescents when maternal education was held constant in the two groups. The two subsequently studies examined long-term associations of breastfeeding duration with brain and cognition of adolescents. These studies found that breastfeeding duration was positively linked to intelligence and brain structures, such as caudate nucleus, which is vulnerable to environmental influences during critical periods of brain development. Lastly, the omega- 3 supplementation study found no differences between active and placebo group on cognition but found associations between omega- 3 fatty acids and brain microstructure thus hypothesizing that higher intake of ω- 3 fatty acids can alter concentrations of specific ω- 6 fatty acids thus influencing membrane fluidity. As such, our findings suggest that in order to obtain optimal brain and cognitive development, we do not only need to discard toxins or employ nutrients during critical periods of rapid brain development but also take into account other environmental and genetic factors that play vital role in children‘s development.

40|$|Neonatal tumours occur every 12, 500 - 27, 500 {{live births}} and {{comprise}} 2 % of childhood malignancies, {{but there is}} little clarity as to their real prevalence, sites of origin and pathological nature as reported series vary. As an entity, neonatal tumours provide a unique window of opportunity to study tumours in which minimal environmental interference has occurred. The majority of tumours present with a mass at birth (e. g., teratomas, neuroblastomas, mesoblastic nephroma, fibromatosis), which are not infrequently identified on antenatal ultrasound. Histologically, teratoma and neuroblastoma remain the two main tumour types encountered with soft tissue sarcoma, renal tumours, CNS tumours and leukaemia being the next most common tumour types identified. Malignant tumours are uncommon in the neonatal period per se and benign tumours may have malignant potential. A particular problem exists in clinical classification, as histological features of malignancy do not always correlate with clinical behaviour. Benign tumours may also be life threatening because of their size and location. Other tumours may demonstrate local invasiveness, but no metastatic potential, and tumours that are clearly malignant may demonstrate unpredictable or uncertain behaviour. Screening programmes have brought more tumours to light, but do not appear to affect the overall prognosis. They may provide clues to the stage at which tumours develop in foetu. The aetiology of cancer in children is multifactorial and includes both genetic and environmental factors. The association between congenital abnormalities and tumours is well established (15 % of neonatal tumours). Genetic defects are highly likely in neonatal tumours and include those with a high risk of malignancy (e. g., retinoblastoma), but also genetically determined syndromes with an increased risk of malignancy and complex genetic rearrangements. Tumours are mostly genetically related at a cellular level and factors influencing cellular maturation or apoptosis within the developing foetus may continue to operate in the neonatal period. Cytogenetics of neonatal neoplasms appear to differ from neoplasms in older children, thus possibly explaining some of the observed differences in clinical behaviour. Certain constitutional chromosome anomalies, however, specifically favour tumuors occurring in the <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>period.</b> In support of this hypothesis, certain cytogenetic anomalies appear to be specific to neonates, and a number of examples are explored. Other environmental associations include ionizing radiation, drugs taken during pregnancy, infections, tumours in the mother and environmental exposure. Revie...|$|R

[Methods]: Rabbit pups were exposed to high temperatures during gestation and lactation.

40|$|Years after years, the {{accumulation}} of results permits us to better. understand the development of human food preferences during the. lifespan. The <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>periods</b> appear to be very important. in this process. Neonates are attracted to volatile compounds. being present in the amniotic environment (Marlier et al., 1997). Women who consumed garlic, alcohol, anise, or carrot flavour in. late pregnancy produce offsprings that manifest positive responses. towards these odorants, for durations ranging from hours, days to. months (Hepper, 1995; Faas et al., 2000; Schaal et al., 2000; Mennella. et al., 2001). After birth, the exposition to an artificial odorant. (camomile) spread on the breast at each breastfeeding episode starting. from birth induces a preferential orientation of 3 - 4 day-olds. newborns for it. Further, the preference for the camomile, in comparison. to another artificial odorant, stays stable during at least two. years (Delaunay-El Allam et al., 2006). As a re´sume´, these results {{could lead to the}} idea that all odorants. inevitably become attractive upon positive exposition, e. g. in the. context of feeding. However, recent results show that the hedonic. evaluation of some compounds seems not to change substantially. with experience. Recently, application of GC-Olfactory analyses of the volatile. compounds of the key fluids of the young human_ environments. show that amniotic fluid (AF) contains AND and human milk. (HM) AND and But A. Further, AND is present in AF and. HM at a higher concentration than the newborns_ capacities would. require to detect it. Now, in spite of a long familiarization to AND. during foetal life and a regular associations of AND and But A with. breastfeeding, these two compounds are persistently highly negatively. evaluated. Comparing the responses of newborns and adults. in reaction to saturated solutions of androstenone (AND) or butanoic. acid (But A), it appears that these compounds remain mainly. negatively evaluated between these two periods of life. The frequency. of negative reactions to AND is lower in adults than in newborns. (42. 3 % vs. 74 %; Chi 2 test; p< 0. 05). However, this decrease. appears to be low with regard to the exposition time of foetus. and newborns to this compound. More surprising, the frequency. of negative reactions to But A increases between newborns and. adults (62. 5 % vs. 100 %; Chi 2 test; p< 0. 01). So, contrary to Engen who maintained that ‘‘odor preferences are. absent at birth and acquired with age’’ (1982), the present studies. about the newborns_ reactions teach us that some preferences seem. not possible to be acquired. So, some odorants seem to be unconditionally. offensive. Delaunay-El Allam (2006) Infant Behav Dev, 29 : 308 – 21. Engen (1982) The perception of odours, p. 130. Faas (2000) Alcohol, 22 : 7 – 17.

40|$|MSc (Biokinetics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Regular {{physical}} activity during pregnancy provides both maternal and infant health benefits. The complexity of measuring {{physical activity}} during pregnancy hampers {{the determination of}} the optimal dose of habitual physical activity for pregnant women and has led to broad physical activity guidelines for pregnant women. Subjectively-determined physical activity levels by means of questionnaires may have contributed to these broad guidelines. However the ActiHeart®, a dual heart rate monitor and accelerometer, is an accurate and reliable measurement tool to determine physical activity levels during pregnancy. Maternal physical activity tends to decrease during pregnancy and may lead to various health risks, including excessive weight gain, risk for gestational diabetes, lower back pain and adverse foetal outcomes. Determining the influence of physical activity on foetal growth is confounded by various variables, therefore objectively-measured habitual physical activity is essential. This study aims to objectively determine habitual physical activity patterns of pregnant women and the relationship between habitual physical activity and foetal growth parameters. In a longitudinal, observational, cohort study design, 60 pregnant women were measured at four stages in their pregnancy: the first trimester (9 – 12 weeks), second trimester (20 – 22 weeks), third trimester (28 – 32 weeks) and three months postpartum. Demographic information was collected by means of a questionnaire specifically compiled for this study, followed by anthropometric measurements (height and weight). Assessment of the participants resting blood pressure, heart rate (Microlife® Semi-Automatic blood pressure and heart rate monitor) and metabolic rate (FitmateTM, Cosmed) was obtained. Thereafter, a step-test was performed for individualised calibration of the ActiHeart® device for assessment of habitual physical activity patterns over a 7 -day <b>period.</b> <b>Foetal</b> growth parameters that included birth weight (kg), birth length (cm), abdominal circumference (cm) and head circumference (cm), were collected from medical records and from the mother post-partum. Habitual physical activity, presented as average Activity Energy Expenditure (AEE), physical Activity Level (PAL), activity counts and minutes spent in activity, declined from the first to the third trimester of pregnancy. The AEE during the first trimester averaged 803 ± 34 kCal/day and declined statistically significant to 592 ± 383 kCal/day in the third trimester. Minutes spent per week doing moderate activity declined from 103 ± 83 min/week in the first trimester to 55 ± 66 min/week in the third trimester. Average pregnancy AEE indicated a non-significant negative relationship with all foetal growth measurements - birth weight (r = - 0. 39, p = 0. 45), birth length (r = - 0. 16, p = 0. 77), Ponderal Index (r = - 0. 34, p = 0. 51) - and a non-significant positive relationship with head circumference at birth (r = 0. 14, p = 0. 79). In conclusion, the objectively-determined, habitual physical activity levels of the participants did not meet the stated guidelines for pregnant women. During the progression of pregnancy, the activity levels declined significantly at the third trimester. The habitual activity levels indicate no effect on the foetal growth parameters. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate whether pups exposed to aqueous extract of HS during the <b>foetal</b> <b>period</b> and during early postnatal period would have a comparable growth with control pups in accordance with the "predictive adaptive response" hypothesis. Three groups of pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used for this study. Group C had tap water while groups A and B had 0. 6 g/ 100 ml and 1. 8 g/ 100 ml HS extract respectively to drink throughout pregnancy and through 20 days postpartum. All groups had normal rat chow ad libitum. Dam weights were recorded daily throughout pregnancy and through 20 days postpartum while pup weights were recorded at birth, 10 days, 14 days and 20 days postpartum. Results of the present study show no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the growth of pups at 10, 14 and 20 days postpartum in all groups except for group B pups whose growth was lower (p< 0. 05) at 20 days postpartum. We conclude that prenatal and early postnatal exposure to an aqueous extract of Hibiscus Sabdariffa does not appear to affect early postnatal growth in Sprague-Dawley rats...|$|E
40|$|The human foetus lives {{its life}} {{protected}} from the outside world. The sense of sight is limited only the brightest rays of sunshine reach the uterus. Also, the maternal tissues protect the foetus from outside tactile experiences. The medical view of foetal development is focussed {{on the development of}} the lungs and other organs that need to maturate enough so that the individual can survive after birth. Traditionally, very little was known about the cognitive development and the role of learning during the <b>foetal</b> <b>period.</b> Pregnant women have always felt that the foetus is a reactive and communicative person already before birth. Women have experienced, for example, the startle reflex of the foetus in the case of a sudden loud sound. Family members have also reported playing a game with the foetus: they have pushed the foot of the foetus through the maternal tissues and felt that the foetus is pushing back. These acts of communication are also supported by scientific evidence. New research on foetal learning, mostly focusing on audition and olfaction/taste, has shown that the foetus is capable of learning and that some reflexive behaviour of the foetus allows simpl...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} testicular cancer {{has been reported}} from several western countries during the last decades. According to current hypothesis testicular cancer is initiated during the <b>foetal</b> <b>period</b> and exposure to endocrine disruptors such as some persistent organic pollutants has been of concern. We have previously reported the results for concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (pp'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlordanes in 58 cases with testicular cancer, 61 age-matched controls and 44 case mothers and 45 control mothers. In that report, significant increase of odds ratio (OR) was found for sum of PCBs, HCB, trans- and cis-nonachlordane in case mothers. These data have now been further analysed for 37 congeners of PCBs. No {{significant differences were found}} among cases and controls. However, case mothers had significantly increased concentrations of a number of PCB congeners. A priori decided grouping of PCBs yielded for oestrogenic PCBs OR = 2. 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 95 - 6. 0, enzyme-inducing PCBsOR = 2. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 6. 5 and toxic equivalents (TEQ) yielded OR = 3. 3, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 8. 4. These data further elucidate the role of foetal exposure to different PCB congeners in the aetiology of testicular cancer...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{structures}} {{involved in}} the development of auditory function and consequently in language acquisition are directed by genetic code, but the expression of individual genes may be altered by exposure to environmental factors, which if favorable, orient it in the proper direction, leading its development towards normality, if unfavorable, they deviate it from its physiological course. Early sensorial experience during the <b>foetal</b> <b>period</b> (i. e. intrauterine noise floor, sounds coming from the outside and attenuated by the uterine filter, particularly mother’s voice) and modifications induced by it at the cochlear level represent the first example of programming in one of the earliest critical periods in development of the auditory system. This review will examine the factors that influence the developmental programming of auditory learning from the womb to the infancy. In particular it focuses on the following points: •	 the prenatal auditory experience and the plastic phenomena presumably induced by it in the auditory system from the basilar membrane to the cortex; •	 the involvement of these phenomena on language acquisition and on the perception of language communicative intention after birth; •	 the consequences of auditory deprivation in critical periods of auditory development (i. e. premature interruption of foetal life) ...|$|E
40|$|Scientific Congenital caudal {{vertebral}} malformations in the alpaca (Lama pacos) JL VAUGHANab, RA LONSDALEa, G JACKSONc and DP RYANd trauma (in utero and postparturient), neoplasia, metabolic disturbances {{and other}} toxic, parasitic and infectious causes. 2, 6, 7 The cause of caudal vertebral anomalies and renal fusion in Japanese Brown cattle {{has not been}} identified, but five of the 10 recorded cases were related by a common sire. 8 Congenital vertebral malformation may be correlated with failure in notochord, somite or neural tube formation. 9, 10 Segmentation failures produce block (fused) vertebrae, causing scoliosis, lordosis, kyphosis, and shortening of the spine. Hemivertebrae have been related to failure of notochord forma-tion in the early <b>foetal</b> <b>period.</b> 8, 11 Failure of part of vertebral body formation can result in wedge or butterfly vertebrae. A wedge-shaped hemivertebra may result embryologically from improper vascularisation and subsequent incomplete ossifica-tion of the dorsal or ventral portion of the vertebral body. 12 This study describes congenital caudal vertebral malforma-tions in a male alpaca (macho) and eight of his offspring. One other of his offspring was within normal limits. An unrelated case of cervical vertebral malformation in a 2 -month-old female alpaca (hembra) is also described. Scoliosis and kyphosis in alpacas have also been observed by the authors but are not documented here...|$|E
40|$|Finger {{prints are}} {{considered}} {{as the best}} tool of identification. Finger print evidence {{is by far the}} most effective and reliable evidence in the court of law. Two major aspects which prove the efficiency of finger prints are, the ridges formed during the <b>foetal</b> <b>period</b> do not change their course of alignment throughout the life of an individual until the skin is decomposed andthe other one is two finger prints of either a same individual or two different individuals are never alike, they differ in their patterns and ridge characteristics. Due to its effectiveness or we can say its potential fingerprints are considered as conclusive evidence in the court of law. Present study is an attempt to analyze and correlate fingerprint patterns with gender and population differences. We have carried a study with 300 individuals among which 150 were Nepali and 150 were Non-Nepali (mostly Indian origin) belonging to different age groups. This study was carried out in Nepal and India. All the 10 fingerprint patterns were divided into Loops, Whorls and Arches. Results show thatLoops are most commonly found fingerprint patterns and Arches are least common. There are significant group variations in fingerprint patteren(rt. hand) between nepali and non Nepali the differences is slightly significant. Group variation for left hand prints between Nepali & Non-Nepali are also highly significant. Group variation for both hands between Nepali & Non-Nepali are also highly significant...|$|E
