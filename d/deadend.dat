40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{computing}} a policy for fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning problems.

The use of state relevance allows our policy to be exponentially more succinct in representing a solution to a FOND problem for some domains. Through the introduction of new techniques for avoiding <b>deadends</b> and determining sufficient validity conditions, PRP has the potential to compute a policy up to several orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We also find dramatic improvements over the state of the art in online replanning when we treat suitable probabilistic domains as FOND domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Rather {{than making}} the simplistic {{assumption}} that research is always passive and merely adapts to change, {{the reality of}} media research today {{is that there is}} an extreme interdependency between media and research. To illustrate this, I will talk about four different media environments and the evolution of research within those environments. These environments are: the domestic print market, the international print market, the domestic television market, and, finally, the domestic measurement of the World Wide Web. The conclusion is that if our industry, and we ourselves as researchers, constantly think of research as adapting, we will miss the opportunity to guide our industry away from evolutionary <b>deadends.</b> If, on the other hand, we think of our industry as a complex system, where nothing comes first, there is the opportunity for the development of radically different and potentially efficient marketing systems in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|Conflict {{resolution}} in planning {{is the process}} of constraining a plan to remove harmful interactions that threaten its correctness. It has been a major contributing factor to the complexity of classical planning systems. Traditional planning methods have dealt with the problem of conflict {{resolution in}} a local and incremental manner, by considering and resolving conflicts individually. This paper presents a theory of conflict resolution that supports a global consideration of conflicts. The theory enables one to formally represent, reason about and resolve conflicts using an extended framework of constraint satisfaction. The computational advantage of the theory stems from its ability to remove inconsistencies early in a search process, to detect <b>deadends</b> with low computational overhead, to remove redundancies in a search space, and to guide the search by providing an intelligent order in which to resolve conflicts.

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of research in}} the field of automated planning focuses on the synthesis of plans for problems that are solv-able.

We will focus on classical plan-ning problems, as methods for determining whether or not unplannability can have wider applications for classical plan-ning problems (e. g., recognizing and avoiding <b>deadends</b> in the state space) as well as solving planning problems with uncertainty (e. g., identifying when a deterministic approx-imation of the problem is unsolvable). The unplannability track follows similar contests in other fields; for example, the UNSAT track for the field of Boolean Satisfiability. In a sim-ilar vein, we hope that the introduction of an unplannability track will foster new innovation for techniques dedicated to identifying planning problems that cannot be solved...|$|R

The key contributions of this protocol are independence of real location information by relying on relative positions of neighboring nodes, short virtual paths because successors and predecessors are in their vicinity, and high scalability because only information about direct neighbors is needed for routing.
