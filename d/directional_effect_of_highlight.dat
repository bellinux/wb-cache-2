40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> management earnings forecasts {{on the cost}} of equity capital. We find that forecasters of bad news experience {{a significant increase in the}} cost of equity capital in the month after their disclosure. Conversely, the cost of equity capital for good news forecasters does not change significantly in the same period. We also indicate that the magnitude of changes in the cost of capital for good news forecasters is significantly lower than that for bad news forecasters and non-forecasters, which suggests that investors may view good news forecasts less credible. Finally, we show that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the subsequent earnings announcement {{on the cost of}} equity capital is preempted by the management forecasts for bad news firms, and that the combined <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the management earnings forecasts and the earnings announcement are not significant for both good news and bad news forecasters. Our paper contributes to the literature by adding evidence on <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> voluntary disclosures and on long-term economic consequences of management earnings forecasts. ...|$|R

The analysis shows that earthquake slip has a significant level of correlation with temporal source parameters such as rupture velocity, peak slip rate, and slip duration (rise time). We also show that many interesting features of earthquake source characteristics, such as <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> earthquake rupture, can be captured by this type of spatial coherence analysis.

40|$|International audienceRats {{were exposed}} to a 3 -wk regimen of chronic normobaric hypoxia, with or without {{almitrine}} treatment. Chronic hypoxia led to a significant rise in the right ventricular mass and lengthened the action potential duration (APD) in right ventricle and in nonhypertrophied left ventricle. Hypertrophy and APD lengthening were significantly enhanced by almitrine. The classical acute hypoxia-induced shortening in APD was much larger in hypoxia-adapted hearts. In these hearts, almitrine treatment almost completely prevented such shortening, while the acute hypoxia-induced decrease in cardiac contraction was similar with or without almitrine. It is concluded that APD lengthening during chronic hypoxia can occur independently of ventricular hypertrophy. The similar <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> almitrine and chronic hypoxia on APD support the hypothesis of an energy-linked phenomenon.

We focus on long thin cavities immersed in dipole magnets and find, for appropriately chosen cavity lengths, an O(1) modulation of the signal with the cavity orientation with respect the momentum distribution of the relic axion background predicted by the isothermal sphere model for the galactic dark matter halo. This effect can be exploited to design directional axion dark matter detectors, providing an unmistakable signature of the extraterrestrial origin of a possible positive detection. Moreover, the precise shape of the modulation may give information of the galactic halo distribution and, for specific halo models, give extra sensitivity for higher axion masses.

Beyond perspectives proposed in past studies, we offer a new account {{based on a}} social identity perspective and propose that workplace ostracism decreases citizenship behavior by undermining employees’ identification with the organization.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we compared the <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> two stimulators (Magstim 200 and Magstim Super Rapid). First, stimulating visual cortex and facial nerve with occipital mid-line TMS, we found that, for a particular coil orientation, these two stimulators affected a particular neural structure in opposite hemispheres and that, to affect a particular neural structure in a particular hemisphere, these two stimulators required opposite coil orientations. Second, stimulating a membrane-simulating circuit, we found that, for a particular coil orientation, these two stimulators resulted in a peak induced current of the same polarity but in a peak induced charge accumulation of opposite polarity. We suggest that the critical parameter in TMS is the amplitude of the induced charge accumulation rather than the amplitude of the induced current.

40|$|The PhD {{study focused}} on two topics. The first topic was energy {{dissipation}} in wave propagation. The wave dissipation {{can be caused by}} physical and/or numerical phenomena, such as the free surface treatment, physical viscosity and artificial viscosity due to discretization of the momentum equations. Among these the free surface treatment is an important factor, and its effect on wave dissipation was studied extensively. The Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, which is responsible for displacement of the free surface, was improved to a great extent, and a significant reduction in wave dissipation is obtained. The second topic of this work was to design a generating and absorbing boundary condition (GABC) which can account for dispersive and <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> free surface water waves.

There is {{a large body of}} research on risk and protective factors associated with child maltreatment. However, there is a significant gap in the literature on family functioning after children are reunified with their families. The current study proposed a conceptual model of family functioning based on a socioecological perspective.

Many mothers continued to struggle with substance use months after reunification, indicating the need for long-term interventions and continued assessment of family well-being. The current study provides data to support changes in public policy and practice which would emphasize continuing long-term service provision.

Here, using the longest experiment to date (542 days), we investigate how the interactive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> warming and ocean acidification affect the growth, behaviour and associated levels of ecosystem functioning (nutrient release) for a functionally important non-calcifying intertidal polychaete (Alitta virens) under seasonally changing conditions. We find that the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> warming, ocean acidification and their interactions are not detectable in the short term, but manifest over time through changes in growth, bioturbation and bioirrigation behaviour that, in turn, affect nutrient generation. These changes are intimately linked to species responses to seasonal variations in environmental conditions (temperature and photoperiod) that, depending upon timing, can either exacerbate or buffer the long-term <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> climatic forcing.

For migratory birds, factors that regulate population abundance could come from effects experienced on breeding areas, wintering grounds, or during migration. We compiled survey data for Pacific and Atlantic subspecies of dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica and C. a. hudsonica) from range-wide Christmas bird counts (1975 – 2010), and investigated the influences on this population index of density-dependence, falcon numbers, a set of seasonal environmental conditions during breeding, migration and non-breeding periods, and large-scale meteorological measures. For both sub-species, numbers fluctuated irregularly, varying threefold over the survey period, with no long-term upward or downward trend. Based on Royama’s general model framework, the change in numbers between successive years for both sub-species was negatively affected by the total count {{in the previous year}} (i. e., negative density-dependence) and by the eastward component of storm movement during fall migration, with slower motion associated with higher population growth. The remaining environmental factors differed between the sub-species (snowmelt date on the Pacific, temperature on the Atlantic) or acted in opposite directions (soil moisture). The <b>directional</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> each of these factors are consistent with the biology of dunlin, and together they explain 67. 4 (72. 9 %) of the variation in the rate of change of Pacific (Atlantic) dunlin annual counts.

The analysis investigates the accounting adjustments applied to net income and shareholders’ equity as included in the Form 20 -F reconciliation reported by Italian firms to the Security Exchange Commission (SEC). The methodology first introduced by Gray (1980) is adapted to recognize a multi-period dimension of the accounting choice. In particular, by focussing on the timing of such adjustments – that is their attitude to reverse or become permanent over time – we develop hypotheses based on the interaction of three factors: clean vs dirty-surplus accounting, recurring vs non-recurring operations, long-term vs short-term assets and liabilities. The results are consistent with our general thesis that the level of conservatism is fundamentally measured by the prevailing <b>directional</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> permanent accounting adjustments. Such adjustments arise and intensify when the accounting differences relate to long-term assets and liabilities that are recurring. Amongst them those stemming from the violation of the clean surplus relation are the most controversial for they generate an opposite permanent effect in the measurement of both net assets and earnings...|$|R
