5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the uneven bars final, in which Britain's Beth Tweddle placed 4th, was called into {{question}} after documents were found that seemed to say that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin were only 14, and therefore under the age required to compete, {{at the time of}} the games. An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> 2nd, giving her a silver medal. After a five-and-a-half-week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing {{more than one}} character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing {{the day and night}} cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E

25|$|Abram's {{most visible}} changes, begun in 1876, {{were the two}} front window gables, adding a Picturesque aspect to the house, and an update to the front entranceway and the {{accompanying}} hall, although it is uncertain from the house today exactly what changes were made. The porch roof may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> its flat hipped style, more consistent with tastes of the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Australia were {{eliminated}} by Canada from the Hong Kong Sevens in controversial circumstances. Australia and Canada finished {{level in the}} first pool. Both sides had scored {{the same number of}} tries and goals and Australia was eliminated on the toss of a coin. Since then the rules <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> allow for extra time when teams finish level, and the first team to score eliminates the other side.|$|E

25|$|Restoration {{of the old}} monasteries in Ladakh, {{including}} the Thiksey Monastery, is being {{carried out by the}} Archaeological Survey of India, {{at the request of the}} concerned Monastery administration. This, however, has not been without its controversy. It is said that the traditional mud and stone courtyards <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> granite, which has marred the brightness of the place. Similarly, the restored right wing of the monastery involving construction of new kitchen, the dining hall for the monks by replacing the old traditional central courtyard has caused dissonance to the entire old edifice of the monastery. As a result, a balance to the restoration and renovation works has been sought to retain the old order in consonance with the new works.|$|E
500|$|Around the [...] {{exterior}} {{walls of}} the Oval (also known as The Wall Project) are large sized prints of works by artists who paint in different medium, such as oil and watercolor. These prints have {{been placed on the}} exterior the walls since around 1985 and display abstract works, cultural and nature inspired scenes. Over time, some of the works which have been displayed <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> accommodate either a new artist or a new piece of art.|$|E
500|$|Loyalsock Trail, often {{abbreviated}} LT, is {{a rugged}} [...] hiking trail {{that stretches from}} near Loyalsockville, in Lycoming County on Pennsylvania Route 87 to north of Laporte in Sullivan County, just off U.S. Route 220. This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily {{within the boundaries of}} Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail was originally blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow [...] "LT". Recently, the trail markers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> a yellow disc with a red [...] "LT".|$|E

500|$|Some syllables (written Chinese characters) {{have special}} pronunciations in Peking opera. This {{is due to}} the {{collaboration}} with regional forms and kunqu that occurred during the development of Peking opera. For example, 你, meaning [...] "you", may be pronounced li, {{as it is in the}} Anhui dialect, rather than the Standard Chinese ni. 我, meaning [...] "I" [...] and pronounced wo in Standard Chinese, becomes ngo, as it is pronounced in the dialect of Suzhou. In addition to pronunciation differences that are due to the influence of regional forms, the readings of some characters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> promote ease of performance or vocal variety. For example, zhi, chi, shi, and ri sounds do not carry well and are difficult to sustain, because they are produced far back in the mouth. Therefore, they are performed with an additional i sound, as in zhii.|$|E
500|$|Band leader Sascha Konietzko first {{mentioned}} {{a new album}} that would feature [...] "a slew of guest musicians" [...] in March 2010. [...] Former collaborator Bill Rieflin returned to help with WTF?!, and Koichi Fukuda also added guitar work. William Wilson, who had previously performed vocals on [...] "Day of Light", and Free Dominguez, of the group Kidneythieves, were brought in as guest vocalists for one song apiece. [...] In an interview in September 2010, Konietzko said the new album would be named Zilch. [...] A remixed version of [...] "Rebels in Control" [...] was made available on the band's website in December 2010 as a show of support for Wikileaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange, and was streamed more than 75,000 times in two days. [...] The name of the forthcoming album was also revealed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> WTF?! around the same time.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{addresses}} for the Bestwood estates {{were also}} originally suffixed 'Bulwell', ward and local area boundaries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> instead link the entire 'Greater Bestwood' area with Basford and Sherwood. The old [...] "seven fields" [...] between Bulwell and Bestwood {{have now been}} largely developed, but the historic links between the areas remains constant.

2500|$|There {{are some}} minor {{attempts}} to revive maka dai dai shogi in Japan, {{with a few}} rule changes. This revived form {{of the game is}} called maka dai shogi. The SZ and SSZ description of the furious fiend (lion + lion dog) is followed. The kirin and phoenix promote to the lion and queen, as in chu shogi. Promotion becomes mandatory on capture, but capturing a Deva or dark spirit does not result in promotion to teaching king or Buddhist spirit respectively. Only capturing the promoted forms of these pieces has that result. The blind bear's move is changed to FsW (one square in any direction but directly forward or backward), and the free bear no longer has the ability to make the forward diagonal jump (becoming simply BsR). The [...] "free" [...] pieces resulting from promotion <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> [...] "ski-sliders" [...] (skipping the first two squares before sliding, similar to the picket in Tamerlane chess), and many of the limited-range pieces <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> cannon-like hoppers that jump to the furthest square in their range, capturing any enemy pieces they leap over. The donkey loses its vertical stepping move and the knight has become a forward-only alfil. Many other minor changes are present: for example, the angry boar is now frlW and the old rat is fWbF.|$|E

2500|$|A high {{proportion}} of roads in Singapore are dual carriageways with central reservations; examples include Clementi Road, Commonwealth Avenue and Holland Road. [...] Often there might be railings erected on the central reservation to prevent pedestrians from dashing across the road. [...] These usually have traffic lights along the way but flyovers and road tunnels (or 'underpasses') can be built to minimise the use of traffic lights; for example, at the Holland Road-Farrer Road-Queensway junction there are three levels of roads. [...] Before the 1980s roundabouts were popular but since then many <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> traffic-light controlled junctions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, Cauty developed Operation Magic Kingdom, a series of images showing US forces in Iraq wearing masks of lovable and friendly Disney characters, adopting the UK’s [...] "winning hearts and minds" [...] tactics {{in a bid to}} gain the confidence of the Iraqi people. In Operation Magic Kingdom [...] "the rules of engagement <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> include [...] "try and be more fun" [...] before firing." [...] The images were launched at the Bayswater Road Sunday Art Exhibition, bombed onto billboards and flyposted across London, as well as being released by The Aquarium as limited edition prints and stamps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{programme}} {{acknowledged the}} Kennel Club's attempts {{to fix the}} health issues, {{in the form of}} the Accredited Breeder Scheme, and funding for DNA tests, but said neither solved the issue of inbreeding. It also acknowledged that Chairman Ronnie Irving had spoken out about exaggerated traits in some breeds. Some breeds standards, such as the Bulldog's, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> temper the exaggerations. Instead of a [...] "massive head," [...] the new breed standard calls for a [...] "large head." [...] The Kennel Club has also added health and welfare issues to the curriculum for judges. But the programme warned that all that would come to naught if breeders continued to deny the need for change, or interpret breed standards any way they like.|$|E
