5|$|In 1914, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, Robey {{appeared}} in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning a}} {{democratic}} mandate in the 2004 election, {{it was thought}} that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005.

25|$|At {{various times}} {{there have been}} {{concerns}} about concentration of newspaper ownership, notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the Davey Committee on combines and the Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers respectively, and most recently when Conrad Black's Hollinger acquired the Southam newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased {{by a variety of}} new ownership groups such as Osprey Media, increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.|$|E

However, due to customer feedback, the Class 153 was re-introduced from 15 March until mid June, when the Parry People Mover finally entered full service.

In 2017, the club made significant on-field and administrative changes, creating a senior women's football team and senior women's netball team in the AFL Women's and National Netball League respectively, as well as revealing a new club logo for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.|$|E

Reforming medical journals including The Lancet for 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points.

Nonetheless, the share of the film market for German films in this period and into the 1950s remained relatively large, taking up some 40 percent of the total market. American films took up around 30 percent of the market despite having around twice as many films in distribution as the German industry in the same time frame.|$|E

Subsequent issues were monthly best sellers and represented IDW's highest-selling property. Journalists in the comic industry noted that with the older fans likely buying comics for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, along with child fans purchasing comic books for the first time, the success of the My Little Pony comic could aid the ailing industry.
