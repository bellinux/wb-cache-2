5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{so glad to}} see you!" [...] he exclaimed, {{for want}} of {{something}} better; and <b>he</b> blushed--he <b>felt</b> foolish, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> false--as <b>he</b> said it.|$|R
60|$|Chester nodded. For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> as <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> when <b>he</b> left the {{provision}} store in Montrose. But {{he would not}} let Clemantiny see him cry. Somehow, {{he would not have}} minded Miss Salome.|$|R
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses. When she was a yearling, she was sold by her owner, although he had not really planned on selling her. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had to because one of his employees had told a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E
5|$|Greg Rucka and Michael Lark had {{previously}} collaborated on the comic series Gotham Central for DC Comics between 2002 and 2004 and various small projects for Marvel Comics {{in the years}} following.

5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E

50|$|Turnbull {{was offered}} a knighthood for his railway {{building}} in India, but declined it as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> did not have sufficient money to live to the standard <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> was needed (<b>he</b> later regretted declining the knighthood, if only because it reduced his later earning power).|$|R
5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} male lead was the longest, {{and a series of}} auditions attracted several celebrities. Giddens chose first-time actor Ko Chen-tung because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> showed great improvement in his acting skills in each successive audition. Giddens liked his attitude, having seen Ko Chen-tung hiding in a corner, frantically studying the script just before his audition.|$|E
5|$|Dionne Warwick first {{performed}} (but never recorded) {{the song}} in February 1983 on a TV special {{as a tribute to}} many performers, including Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley, John Belushi, Cass Elliot, John Lennon, Bobby Darin, Minnie Riperton, Sam Cooke, Harry Chapin, Buddy Holly, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Croce, Bobby Van and Karen Carpenter who had died days earlier.

5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J. Simpson for the role, but Cameron {{did not feel that}} Simpson would be believable as a killer.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 Keynes had {{the option}} to enter Parliament as an {{independent}} MP with the University of Cambridge seat. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of Magdalene College had obtained agreement {{that none of the}} major parties would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi–Soviet pact on 23 August 1939, the RAF mobilised. Cunningham had been test-flying the airliner de Havilland Dragon. Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing tension in Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at this juncture. The RAF had trained him and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> could be of far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E
5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was the best villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios {{wanted to give the}} role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E

5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was mischaracterized, and {{that it did not}} represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life {{in a way that would}} help others find courage.|$|E

Sheeran made a live PA to perform the song during Rudimental's set at Glastonbury on 27 June 2014.|$|R
5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe also declined the offer as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> did not deserve to hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to these feelings, Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker T to contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would be allowed in the match. Joe defeated Booker T at the event to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa. He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue to him in the campaign. He also made a statement on why <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
