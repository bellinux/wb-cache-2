5000|$|Clippers: Clippers for the {{production}} of portioned sausages are used in conjunction with vacuum fillers. The filling product is taken from the vacuum filler and through a <b>filling</b> <b>pipe</b> connected to the clipper and an appropriate sausage casing brake, where it is portioned into appropriate casings. The portion is then sealed by the clipper with the aid of metal clips. Sometimes, loops for hanging the portions are also attached simultaneously. Strings of sausages as well as individual portions can be produced.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions for the pump is to accurately measure the amount of fuel pumped. Flow measurement is almost always done by a 4 stroke piston meter connected to an electronic encoder. In older gas pumps, the meter is physically coupled to reeled numerical displays (moving wheels or cylinders with numbers on the side), while newer pumps turn the meter's movement into electrical pulses using a rotary encoder. In the U.S. flow speed is limited to 10 gallons per minute for cars and 40 gallons per minute for trucks. This flow rate is based on the diameter of the vehicle's fuel <b>filling</b> <b>pipe,</b> which limits flow to these amounts.|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{electromagnetic}} flowmeter; flow measurement; partially <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> Abstract: This paper designs {{the electromagnetic}} flowmeter in partially <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> (EMF-PF), which sensor sets four electrodes. One pair of the electrodes {{is set on}} the pipe bottom as the signal injection electrodes that inject the AC pulses used to determine liquid fill height. One pair of long-arc electrodes is set on the pipe wall as the measurement electrodes. The measurement electrodes alternate duties, sensing both the flow and fill height signals. Both the flow and fill height raw signals are disposed in different time period by the same signal processing channels. Experiment result shows that the designed EMF-PF can achieve the flow measurement in partially <b>filled</b> <b>pipes,</b> and the measurement accuracy of this EMF-PF meets the actual requirements...|$|R

50|$|The tank is {{internally}} braced, {{and also}} wind braced externally. Unlike the water tank retained at Grandchester station, the Murphy's Creek tank features a high flow water delivery system utilising a water jib or crane. An electric pump {{is used to}} reticulate water into the tank being supplied from mains power. A swing jib is situated on the north tank face adjacent to the mainline, and is used to deliver water through a gravity-fed pipe-work system into a corresponding filling hole on the tender water tank of a steam locomotive. A canvas hose is used to direct {{the flow of water}} into the tender tank. The jib is operated manually by a locomotive fireman standing on the tender tank, swinging the jib to a position 90 degrees {{from the face of the}} tank and controlling the flow of water from the jib via a valve and float system actuated on the <b>filling</b> <b>pipe.</b> An inspection ladder is situated on the east face of the tank enabling access to the tank for maintenance purposes. A fluorescent light is also affixed to the tank headstocks to illuminate the area at night.|$|E

50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel vapors displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the <b>fill</b> <b>pipe</b> seal in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel tank <b>fill</b> <b>pipe.</b> That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that <b>fill</b> <b>pipe,</b> during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure relief pipe.|$|R

40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} in <b>pipes</b> <b>filled</b> with metal foams were studied numerically. In this study,the two-equation model based on LNTE (Local Non-Thermal equilibrium) was employed as energy equations,furthermore the flow models extended by Brinkman and Brinkman-Forchheimer were employed as momentum equations respectively,and {{a comparison between}} these two models was made and analysed. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} velocity profiles under two models are different,but their temperature profiles are almost the same as each other,consequently,there are barely differences between the Nu numbers under two models. According to numerical results,the Nu number of metal-foam <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> is of the order of magnitude of 102 ～ 103,which is much bigger than that of bare pipes and conventional heat exchangers. The metal-foam <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> exhibit excellent heat transfer performance,however high pressure drop is produced at the same time. By using the program for heat transfer calculation of metal foam that is developed by us,someone can make optimization of heat transfer and pressure drop in practical applications...|$|R

40|$|Main {{objective}} of horizontal driling {{is to place}} a drain-hole for a long distance within the pay zone to enhance productivity or injectivity. In drilling horizontal wells, more serious problems appear than in drilling vertical wells. These problems are: poor hole cleaning, excessive torque and drag, hole <b>filling,</b> <b>pipe</b> stucking, wellbore instability, loss of circulation, formation damage, poor cement job, and difficulties at logging jobs. From that reason, successful drilling and production of horizontal well depends largely on the fluid used during drilling and completion phases. Several new fluids, that fulfill {{some or all of}} required properties (hole cleaning, cutting suspension, good lubrication, and relative low formation damage), are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} of pressurization transient by a rigid-column {{method is}} studied {{based on previous}} laboratory testing. Of course, such a method {{is not able to}} simulate the experimental intense pressure oscillations; however, it is considerably simpler than other feasible methods and more easily implementable within drainage network models. Starting from this operative point of view, the paper aims at recognizing “what” and “how much” of the transient can be simulated by a rigid-column method. Actually, better results were obtained than it was expected. The model proves to be successful in simulation of the <b>filling</b> <b>pipe</b> stage as well as the stabilization stage of flow to the final steady values, during which it reproduces rather well the “mean” surge (i. e. the surge filtered out of the oscillations). This means that, in order to study floods in urban drainage networks, oscillation simulation is not necessary, whereas it is necessary in stability analysis of sewers. Comparison between the simulated and experimental pressure diagrams allows one better to recognize the different stages of the total phenomenon as well as the influence of some geometric and hydraulic parameters. Simulation of the intense oscillations and investigation of their true nature will be tackled in further papers...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} different numerical models to simulate flow in storm sewers has raised several {{questions on the}} applicability of these models in the simulation of extreme inflow conditions. These issues include accurate modeling and prediction of bores, flow regime transition into pressurized flow {{and the possibility of}} air pocket entrapment and the subsequent effect on the system. With regards to bore description, the issue {{is not limited to the}} choice of equations for the problem solution, but includes the selection of numerical schemes that will ensure the correct bore propagation speed. It will be shown that the selection of the variables used to solve the mass and momentum equations has an impact in the solution of discontinuous flows. It will also be seen that numerical models without shock-capturing capabilities have limited ability to model flow discontinuities. Flow regime transition models can be divided into shock-fitting or shock-capturing approaches, each group of approaches with particular strengths and limitations. Due to the popularity of Preissmann slot-based models, including the soon-to-be released SWMM 5, a more detailed discussion on the issues of this approach is provided. Some new model improvements to shock-capturing approaches are presented, including a new conceptual model for simulating sewer surcharging referred to as the Decoupled Pressure Approach. 442 Current Issues in Modeling Extreme Inflows Finally, some of the current challenges in the incorporation of the air phase in the computation of the rapid <b>filling</b> <b>pipe</b> problem are considered. These challenges include the limitations of the one-dimensional framework, difficulties of dealing with boundary conditions for the air phase and the possibility of incorporating the air phase in either a two-phase flow or a sub-model framework. 19. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstracts. In {{order to}} study dynamic {{characteristics}} of fluid <b>filled</b> <b>pipe</b> under hydraulic excitation force generated actively {{by a new}} developed vibration exciter, at first mathematical model of pulsating fluid was established and a computer code based on the method of characteristics (MOC) was developed. Then the excitation force calculated by MOC was forced upon the corresponding nodes of finite element of pipe, meanwhile, the nodes of fluid by MOC were assured to coincide {{with that of the}} pipe by the method of finite element (FEM). Finally, using Newmark’s method, the dynamic response at every cross section of pipe was solved. The numerical simulations show that a simple harmonic motion arises at every cross section of the pipe. The lateral vibration amplitude of every node along the pipe increases as the rising system pressure. So, this work is expected to provide some theoretical and exploratory basis for studying two dimensional vibration characteristics of fluid <b>filled</b> <b>pipe...</b>|$|R
