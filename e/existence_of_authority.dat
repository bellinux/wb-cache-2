50|$|In 1905, Tikhomirov {{authored}} his largest work, the four-volume On Monarchist Statehood, which {{quickly became}} the ideological basis for the Russian monarchist movement. In it he asserted the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> as a fundamental regulatory force in society. The type of authority - democratic, aristocratic, or monarchic - is rooted to the moral and psychological state of the society. Tikhomirov wrote:If a powerful moral ideal exists in a society, an ideal calling all to voluntary obedience to, and service of, one another, then it brings about monarchy because {{the existence of this}} ideal negates the need for physical force (democracy) or the rule of an elite (aristocracy). All that is necessary is the continual expression of this moral ideal. The most capable vehicle for this expression is one individual placed in a position of complete independence from all external political forces.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{distributed}} knowledge is increasingly often invoked {{in discussions of}} economic organization. In particular, the claim that authority is inefficient {{as a means of}} coordination in the context of distributed knowledge has become widespread. However, very little analysis has been dedicated to the relation between economic organization and distributed knowledge. In this paper, we concentrate on the role of authority as a coordination mechanism under conditions of distributed knowledge, and also briefly discuss other issues of economic organization. We clarify the meanings of authority and distributed knowledge, and criticize the above claim by arguing that authority may be a superior mechanism of coordination under distributed knowledge. We also discuss how distributed knowledge influences the boundaries of firms. Our arguments rely on insights in problem-solving and on ideas from organizational economics. Distributed knowledge, <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> problem-solving, the boundaries of the firm...|$|E
40|$|Why do {{historical}} figures sometimes become {{the object of}} religious worship? Here, we propose that, above a certain group-size threshold, maintaining {{a belief in the}} continued <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> figures after their death preserves group coordination efficiency. That is, we argue that coordination activities in larger groups become more effective when they center on symbolic (although formerly real) bearers of authority; for smaller groups, we claim the opposite occurs. Our argument is pursued by way of a collective action model that makes anthropologically plausible assumptions about human sociality. One key finding is the existence of a group-size threshold that marks {{the difference between the two}} different collective action regimes, one with and one without the presence of a deified historical figure. Another is that, in larger groups, priest-like castes naturally emerge as a consequence of the benefits of personally identifying with the deified agent...|$|E

40|$|Gnomic {{formulae}} {{are one of}} the {{instances in}} which doxa is expressed. They have a number of specific implications – such as the belief in the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> in the possibility of gaining and phrasing universal truths – which make them particularly interesting for an analysis of texts which came to being {{in the context of an}} artistic creed that questions such presuppositions. This article takes a closer look at the presence and functioning of such formulae in three texts from around 1900 by liberal Flemish writers that have been associated with naturalism: Madeleine by Virginie Loveling, ‘Het populierken op den heuvel’ by Herman Teirlinck and ‘Op het kleine gehucht’ by Cyriel Buysse. The analysis of the gnomic formulae in these three cases uncovers different interpretations of notions such as fate, authority and insight and allows for a more nuanced view on the literature of this period. This approach thus seems to be a promising one for a far broader research...|$|E

40|$|Economic Organization in the Knowledge Economy Many writers {{argue that}} {{economic}} organization will be strongly transformed {{in the emerging}} knowledge economy. Thus, authority relations will wither, or at least undergo significant changes; legal and ownership-based definitions of the boundaries of firms will become irrelevant; {{and there will be}} very few or no constraints on the set of feasible combinations of coordination mechanisms, as manifested in the increasing proliferation of “new organizational forms. ” The increased importance of specialist knowledge and the strategic imperative of rapidly adjusting to constantly changing contingencies mean that firms lose power over employees and that knowledge-based networks that cut across the boundaries of firms become as, or more, important as intra-firm relations. The present paper critically deals with these claims, beginning from the basic idea that they may be analyzed as turning on the implications for the Coasian firm of the Hayekian notion that the distributed and subjective character of economically relevant knowledge is a strongly binding constraint on the use of planned coordination. Based on organizational economics, it is argued that efficiency reasons for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> under Hayekian distributed knowledge may be given; that the increasing importance of knowledge assets does not render legal and ownership-based notions of the boundaries of the firm irrelevant; and that coordination mechanisms will also cluster in certain, predictable combinations in the emerging knowledge economy. 1 I...|$|E

Meanwhile the legal problem happened in elimination of corruption is the failure of harmonization between the attorney and Commission of Corruption Elimination by reason of the stagnant process of coordination among the Attorney and Commission of Corruption Elimination, as well as caused by the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> of the Commission of Corruption Elimination to take over the authority of investigation or pursuit conducted by the attorney.

For answering this question, the author conducted research by using normative research method, i. e. a research focus point lied on the legal regulation and existing norms in society whose results is social fact. By the authority owned by Commission of Corruption Elimination to take over the investigation or pursuit from the hand of attorney has not been maximally used.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to revive}} the 19 th-century thinker Max Stirner’s thought through a critical reexamination of his mistaken legacy as a ‘political’ thinker. The reading of Stirner that I present is one of an ontological thinker, spurred on as much—if not more—by the contents of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit {{as it is the}} radical roots that Hegel unintentionally planted. In the first chapter, the role of language in Stirner’s thought is examined, and the problems to which his conception of language seem to give rise are addressed. The second chapter looks at Stirner’s purportedly ‘anarchistic’ politics and finds the ‘anarchist’ reading of Stirner misguided. Rather than being a ‘political’ anarchist, it is argued that we ought to understand Stirner as advocating a sort of ‘ontological’ anarchism in which the very <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> is questioned. In the third chapter, I look at the political ramifications of Stirner’s ontology as well as the critique of liberalism contained within it, and argue that the politics implicit in his philosophy shares more in common with the tradition of political realism than it does anarchism. The fourth chapter is dedicated to an examination of Stirner’s anti-humanism, which is concluded to be much different than the ‘anti-humanisms’ associated with other, more famous thinkers, such as Foucault and Heidegger. In the fifth and final chapter, I provide an answer to the question(s) of how, if, and to what extent Friedrich Nietzsche was influenced by Stirner. It is concluded that the complete lack of evidence that Nietzsche ever read Stirner is proof enough to dismiss accusations of plagiarism on Nietzsche’s part, thus emphasizing the originality and singularity of both thinkers...|$|E

Those are to know the implementation of PERATUN judge decision and the hindering factors in implementing PERATUN judge decision. This research uses sociological juridical method, based on the primary and secondary data sources with literature study and field study, That is interview and documentation of files related to the implementation of PERATUN judge decision and its hindering factors, as data collecting technique, to analyzed qualitative descriptively later. The research results find that the implementation procedure of PERATUN judge decision in State Administration Court (PTUN) of Surabaya is still refers to Law number 5 year 1986. While, in its implementation during 2007 is found that there are 65 decisions, which have had law power, with 55 decisions has been implemented and 10 decisions has not been implemented yet by the accused. The conclusion is that part of the implementation procedures of PERATUN judge decision of PTUN Surabaya is still referring to section 116 Law No. 5 year 1986. It is caused by there is no further regulation yet from Law No. 9 year 2004. That PTUN have no autonomous authority to control the implementation of decisions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} establish whether {{the presence or}} activities of a partner or partners in South Africa creates (or is at risk of creating) a permanent establishment for that partner, the partnership or the co-partners in South Africa. At the outset, the major legal and fiscal consequences of a partnership under South African law are investigated. The unique legal and fiscal treatment of a partnership as a mere aggregate of persons that is treated as fiscally transparent under South African law is relevant to determine the potential application of double taxation agreements to partnerships or their partners. Once {{the terms of a}} double taxation agreement are found to apply in the circumstances, the creation of a permanent establishment in terms thereof becomes relevant. The different types of partnerships and partners under South African partnership law are set out and their differentiating characteristics analysed in an effort to identify whether the activities or presence of certain partners are more at risk of giving rise to a permanent establishment than others. In a commercial context, the important distinction is drawn between ordinary and extraordinary partners as very different commercial consequences attach to these partners. In particular, whereas ordinary partners automatically derive an implied authority or mutual mandate to manage the business of the partnership as agents of their co-partners by virtue of the partnership agreement, extraordinary partners are excluded from the mutual mandate. The implied authority amongst partners becomes particularly relevant when considering one of the alternative tests for creating a permanent establishment that appear in the prevalent model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context, in terms of which the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> is one of the required elements {{for the creation of a}} permanent establishment. The special rules surrounding the source of partnership income is investigated as a means of establishing jurisdiction to tax under South African domestic source rules. The impact of legislation on the South African source rules pertaining to partnerships as developed under the common law is critically analysed and the relevance of source rules in the permanent establishment context is evaluated. It is submitted that it is premature to consider the rules surrounding the creation of a permanent establishment under the terms of a double taxation agreement before it is established that the relevant contracting state has the requisite jurisdiction to tax and furthermore that the terms of that double taxation agreement apply to the matter at hand. Finally, the relevant articles of the model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context are discussed with specific focus on the unique attributes of a partnership that may impact on the creation of a permanent establishment for the partner or partners by virtue of the presence or activities of a partner or the partners in South Africa. The risk of creating a permanent establishment by virtue of the presence or activities of an ordinary partner in South Africa is contrasted with that of an extraordinary partner. It is concluded that the activities or presence of ordinary partners (as opposed to extraordinary partners) are particularly at risk of creating a permanent establishment in South Africa, although it is acknowledged that certain requirements will have to be met on the facts of each case before a permanent establishment will be found to exist...|$|E
