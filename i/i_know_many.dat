500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just {{for it to be}} out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>many</b> friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E

She was {{described}} as down to earth despite her status as a diva. On behalf of all Australians I would like to extend my condolences to her husband Richard and son Adam and their extended family at this difficult time. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>many</b> Australians will be reflecting on her life's work today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Repin's contemporaries often {{commented on}} his special ability of {{capturing}} peasant {{life in his}} works. In an 1876 letter to Stasov, Kramskoi wrote: [...] "Repin is capable of depicting the Russian peasant exactly as he is. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>many</b> artists who have painted peasants, some of them very well, {{but none of them}} ever came close to what Repin does." [...] Leo Tolstoy later stated that Repin [...] "depicts the life of the people much better than any other Russian artist." [...] He was praised for his ability to reproduce human life with powerful and vivid force.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same way <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>many</b> other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|While her {{predecessor}} {{and mentor}} Peter Deutsch was [...] "among the most hawkish congressional Democrats on Middle East issues", Wasserman Schultz, {{who took over}} his seat for Florida's 20th district, [...] "a heavily Jewish swath of Broward County", has taken a more centrist approach. During 2005 she spoke in approval of President George W. Bush's proposals to give financial aid to the Palestinian Authority in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said [...] "We {{want to continue to}} focus on making sure that... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [...] first four years, {{there was a lack of}} leadership coming from the administration. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>many</b> people in the Jewish community were happy with the president's position on Israel, but the way I thought, there was an absence of leadership. ... So I'm glad to see there's a little more engagement and involvement from the administration." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Robert Craft, Stravinsky {{remained}} a confirmed monarchist {{throughout his life}} and loathed the Bolsheviks from the very beginning. In 1930, he remarked, [...] "I don't believe that anyone venerates Mussolini more than I ... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>many</b> exalted personages, and my artist's mind does not shrink from political and social issues. Well, after having seen so many events and so many more or less representative men, I have an overpowering urge to render homage to your Duce. He is the saviour of Italy and – let us hope – Europe". Later, after a private audience with Mussolini, he added, [...] "Unless my ears deceive me, the voice of Rome {{is the voice of}} Il Duce. I told him that I felt like a fascist myself... In spite of being extremely busy, Mussolini did me the great honour of conversing with me for three-quarters of an hour. We talked about music, art and politics". When the Nazis placed Stravinsky's works on the list of [...] "Entartete Musik", he lodged a formal appeal to establish his Russian genealogy and declared, [...] "I loathe all communism, Marxism, the execrable Soviet monster, and also all liberalism, democratism, atheism, etc." [...] Towards the end of his life, at Craft's behest, Stravinsky made a return visit to his native country and composed a cantata in Hebrew, travelling to Israel for its performance.|$|E
