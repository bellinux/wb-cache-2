30|$|From the 42 studies under investigation, 10 used {{cattle manure}} {{featuring}} <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>contents</b> from 1.1 up to 15  %. Three studies used both pig and cattle manure. One study {{relied on a}} synthetic matrix–water mixture—including volatile fatty acids, glucose, and starch—to approximate properties of liquid manure [14]. Within the remaining 28 studies, pig manure with <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>contents</b> from 2 up to 22  % was used. Comparing the results is complicated due to the differing <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>contents.</b> Kreuzig [35] emphasizes substance-specific interactions with the different pig or cattle manure matrices. He further mentions that the dry substance content of manure {{can be one of}} the most relevant factors affecting the transformation of VMPs and biocides. In a study on the stability of tylosin A in manure, Loke et al. [44] could not clarify whether the decrease in the concentration of this compound is caused by sorption or abiotic or biotic chemical degradation. Similarly, Shi et al. [62] could not explain whether the rapid disappearance of the investigated antibiotics tetracycline and sulfamethoxydiazine could be due to their adsorption onto solid materials or degradation by microorganisms. In another study, Loke et al. [45] stated that very low free concentrations of oxytetracycline and metabolites in an anaerobic degradation experiment are due to the high amounts of substances being bound to particles in the manure matrix rather than to the degradation to unknown compounds.|$|R

5000|$|According to a {{study from}} the Czech Republic, injecting {{nitrogen}} into the soil leads for a higher <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> of the plant. [...] <b>Dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> is important because the nutrients found in plants {{are found in the}} ‘dry’ section, not the water that is also in the plant. CULTAN fertilization, like all forms of injection fertilization, allows for a more precise application and a more uniform distribution of the fertilizer. These methods allow the spread of nitrogen regardless of the condition of the field (wet, muddy) and reduce soil compaction caused by tractors moving along the field. Soil compaction can eventually lead to erosion. Labor is also significantly reduced when compared to convention, surface fertilization.|$|E

5000|$|Teeth play a {{vital role}} in an animal’s survival; they are used for eating, {{grooming}} and defense. Each tooth is made up of a crown, which is above the gum line and covered in enamel, and roots that anchor the tooth to the alveolar bone. Beneath the enamel, there are collagen fibres and inorganic hydroxyapatite which together form dentin. Hydroxyapatite is the storage form of calcium found in the bone. Blood calcium concentration are kept within a narrow range. If deficient, calcium will be mobilized from the bone to compensate imbalances. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus is essential to bone and teeth health; if there is excessive phosphorus within a diet, it can result in resorption and reduction of the alveolar bone [...] as shown in Henrikson’s studies when dogs were fed a low calcium, high phosphorus diet. Vitamin D also plays a major role in calcium absorption and bone health because it helps to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiencies affect calcium homeostasis which in turn negatively impacts parts of the teeth including the gingivae, periodontal ligaments and the alveolar bone leading to degeneration of the teeth and jaw. According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) recommendations based on <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content,</b> the maximum amount of calcium within a diet is 1.8% and the phosphorus content within a diet cannot exceed 1.6%.
