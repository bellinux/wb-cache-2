40|$|Abstract [...] The {{effects of}} moisture, oxygen and acidity upon the ageing of Kraft and {{thermally}} upgraded (‘Insuldur’) papers {{have been studied}} in detail. The results for Kraft {{are consistent with the}} kinetic model and parameters proposed earlier by Emsley et al., and with the principle that moisture promotes acid-hydrolysis by causing carboxylic acids to dissociate. Moisture is released during the ageing of Kraft, and hence its ageing is auto-acceleratory. In contrast, Insuldur consumed moisture under the same conditions, it aged more slowly, and its ageing was less accelerated by added moisture. 2 -Furaldehyde (2 FAL), which is a dehydration product of pentosans and hence an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> production, is also re-leased from Kraft during ageing, but not from Insuldur. Acids are, however, produced from both types of paper. Theoretical explana-tions for these findings are proposed, and their practical implica-tions for transformer maintenance are discussed...|$|E

High resolution mapping of vegetation cover is essential to model the distribution of populations and improve the management of breeding habitats.

These two methods produced consistent output maps, but they also provided more information about vegetation structure, and possibly trophic resources. In spite of the apprent uniformity of meadows, our data show that birds do not settle randomly along the moisture and vegetation gradients. Overall birds tend to avoid the driest vegetation classes, i. e. the highest grounds. Thus, vegetation maps based on remote sensing could be valuable tools to study habitat selection and niche partition in grassland bird communities.

The biomisation method was applied to reconstruct potential biomes and forest successional stages. Mean annual precipitation, mean annual potential evapotranspiration and an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> availability were reconstructed using modern analogues and an artificial neural network technique. The results show a dense forested environment around Lake Barombi Mbo of mixed evergreen/semi-deciduous type during the most humid phases (highest precipitation and lowest evapotranspiration), but with a more pronounced semi-deciduous type from ca. 6500 cal yr BP to the present day, related to increased seasonality. This forest displays a mature character until ca. 2800 cal yr BP, then becomes of secondary type during the last millennium, probably due to increased human activity. Two episodes of forest fragmentation are shown, which are synchronous with the lowest reconstructed precipitation and highest potential evapotranspiration values. The first of these occurs during the LGM, and the second one from ca. 3000 to ca. 1200 cal yr BP, mainly linked to high precipitation seasonality. Savanna were, however, never extensive within the Barombi Mbo basin, existing instead inside the forest in form of savanna patches. The climate reconstructions at Lake Barombi Mbo suggest that the artificial neural networks technique would be more reliable in this region, although the annual precipitation values are likely under-estimated through the whole sequence...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} the most {{frequently}} reported vector borne disease in the United States, and it is endemic to Rhode Island. The high incidence of tick-borne disease in this region results from intense peridomestic human exposure to the vector Ixodes scapularis (a. k. a. blacklegged tick). An increasing {{number of studies have}} indicated that Ixodid tick distributions are determined primarily by climate and vegetation, more so than by host-related factors. Environmental conditions {{play an important role in}} the survival of I. scapularis since both water stress and, to a lesser extent, temperature are substantial factors regulating off-host mortality. Increased knowledge about the influence of climatic conditions on the spatial and temporal I. scapularis abundance and activity of I. scapularis may enable development of an advanced Lyme disease risk warning system, as well as promote use of tick bite prevention measures. ^ We investigated the hypothesis that the duration of a threshold level of atmospheric moisture directly affects tick activity and survival. To test our hypothesis, a three-pronged approach was implemented, where we: (1) determined if temporal measurements of atmospheric moisture content were correlated with observed levels of tick activity and survival; (2) evaluated if relatively fine-scale measures of atmospheric moisture are required to provide near-real time estimates of RH in tick habitat and predictions of tick activity; and (3) assessed if a multi-sensor approach could be used to relate remotely-sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to atmospheric moisture conditions affecting tick survival. A two-year field study was established to validate prior laboratory findings of a relative humidity (RH) threshold for nymphal blacklegged tick activity and survival. A network of RH loggers was established among three study areas distributed across a latitudinal gradient for the state of Rhode Island. A hierarchical sampling design was used, scaling from ground measurements of nymphal tick abundance to a remotely sensed <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> availability (Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index). TVDI values, derived from MODIS data, were used to characterize land surface conditions in tick habitat and to determine if limited moisture availability caused a decline in nymphal tick activity and possible mortality as a result of desiccation. Negative binomial regression identified TVDI as a significant predictor of tick abundance during the summer of 2010 (coefficient = - 2. 481, SE = 0. 768, P = 0. 0012), but not 2009 (coefficient = 0. 332, SE = 0. 975, P = 0. 7333). Consistent with the literature, the study demonstrated limited success when moisture was not a limiting factor. ^ Ground measurements of both RH and nymphal tick abundance within each study plot, identified two significant moisture parameters across both years: average RH recorded 14 days prior to sampling (AvgRH 14, 2009 : P = 0. 0160; 2010 : P = 0. 0006) and cumulative hours sub-RH threshold recorded seven days prior to sampling (CumHrsSub 7 day, 2009 : P = 0. 0003; 2010 : P = 0. 0112). These two variables were consistent across both study years, despite dramatically different weather patterns. A retrospective analysis, examining 14 years (1997 to 2010) of nymphal blacklegged tick abundance data against the total number of tick-adverse humidity events (TAHEs) (3 ̆e 8 h) recorded in the month of June successfully predicted total nymphal tick abundance recorded during that same summer (coefficient = - 69. 57, SE = 27. 66, P = 3 ̆c 0. 027). Years characterized by a greater number of TAHEs in June generally resulted in below average annual nymphal blacklegged tick abundance. Additionally, since tick samples were collected at each study site twice (early season = round one; late season = round two), a significant and positive relationship (coefficient = 0. 0344, SE = 0. 015, P = 0. 040) was identified between the ratio of nymphs collected in round one vs. round two and TAHEs (3 ̆e 8 h) recorded in June (largely round one), suggesting that TAHEs were an indicator of tick mortality and could be used to predict exposure risk during the same year. Collectively, results from these studies suggest that readily available relative humidity data could be used to predict seasonal trends in Lyme disease risk and could be used as the framework for tick-borne disease risk forecasts. ...|$|E

For higher resolution analysis, I used the Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI), which references daily estimated soil and ground cover moistures at a local level and is commonly used in fire management in the US Southeast (Keetch and Byram 1968, Roncoli et al. 2006). In order to assess the relationship between relative moisture availability and unauthorized firesetting for each sample unit, I modeled the linear regressions between (1) monthly PDSI and the number of unauthorized fires per month by year and, (2) daily KBDI normalized by fire season specific distributions and the frequency of fire occurrence for each score. Lastly, I examined changes in the relationship between KBDI and unauthorized fire using a 4 yr moving window for the distribution of KBDI values for fires occurring during peak fire season.|$|R

40|$|Changing {{frequencies}} of extreme weather events and shifting fire seasons call for enhanced capability to forecast {{where and when}} forested landscapes switch from a nonflammable (i. e., wet fuel) state to the highly flammable (i. e., dry fuel) state required for catastrophic forest fires. Current forest fire danger indices used in Europe, North America, and Australia rate potential fire behavior by combining numerical <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>moisture</b> content, potential rate of fire spread, and fire intensity. These numerical rating systems lack the physical basis required to reliably quantify forest flammability outside the environ- ments of their development or under novel climate conditions. Here, we argue that exceedance of critical forest flammability thresholds {{is a prerequisite for}} major forest fires and therefore early warning systems should be based on a reliable prediction <b>of</b> fuel <b>moisture</b> content plus a regionally calibrated model of how forest fire activity responds to variation in fuel moisture content. We demonstrate the potential of this approach through a case study in Portugal.

40|$|The paper {{forms the}} first part of an {{introduction}} to possible impacts of climate change on daily streamflow and extremes in the Province of Ontario, Canada. In this study, both conceptual and statistical streamflow simulation modeling theories were collectively applied to simulate daily streamflow volumes. Based on conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling principle, the predictors were selected to take into account several physical factors that affect streamflow, such as (1) current and previous quantities of rainfall over the watershed, (2) an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> pre-storm <b>moisture</b> conditions, (3) an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> pre-storm evapotranspiration capacities, and (4) a seasonal factor representing seasonal variation of streamflow volume. These rainfall-runoff conceptual factors were applied to an autocorrelation correction regression procedure to develop a daily streamflow simulation model {{for each of the four}} selected river basins. The streamflow simulation models were validated using a leave-one-year-out cross-validation scheme. The simulation models identified that the explanatory predictors are consistent with the physical processes typically associated with high-streamflow events. Daily streamflow simulation models show that there are significant correlations between daily streamflow observations and model validations, with model R 2 s of 0. 68 - 0. 71, 0. 61 - 0. 62, 0. 71 - 0. 74, and 0. 95 for Grand, Humber, Upper Thames, and Rideau River Basins, respectively. The major reason for the model performance varying across the basins might be that rainfall-runoff response time and physical characteristics differ significantly among the selected river basins.

PDSI projections incorporating both precipitation and PET changes from the GCMs vary regionally, with robust cross-model drying in western North America, Central America, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the Amazon and robust wetting occurring in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and east Africa. These regional changes largely reflect the spatially heterogeneous response of precipitation in the models, although drying in the PDSI fields extends beyond the regions of reduced precipitation. This expansion of drought areas is attributed to globally widespread increases in PET, caused by increases in surface net radiation and the vapor pressure deficit. Increased PET not only intensifies drying in areas where precipitation is already reduced, it also drives areas into drought that would otherwise experience little drying or even wetting from precipitation trends alone.

The dry matter losses, during 4 - 16 minutes cooking of spaghetti, were positively correlated with the distance for maximum cutting force and with the cutting work. The correlation coefficients were 0. 85 and 0. 51, re-spectively. The highest values of the cutting force and the cutting work characterised pasta cooked in the time immediately preceding the minimum cooking time. The application of cooking times longer than the minimum caused a decrease in the firmness of the pasta but the changes were relatively slight. This shows a high resistance to overcooking of all tested spaghetti...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{functions}} of radar backscatter coefficients {{have been proposed}} as <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and vegetation, such as the radar vegetation index, i. e., RVI, and the soil saturation index, i. e., m(s). These <b>indices</b> are ratios <b>of</b> noisy and potentially miscalibrated radar measurements and are therefore particularly susceptible to estimation errors. In this study, we consider uncertainty in satellite estimates of RVI and m(s) arising from two radar error sources: noise and miscalibration. We derive expressions for the variance and bias in estimates of RVI and m(s) due to noise. We also derive expressions for the sensitivity of RVI and m(s) to calibration errors. We use one year (September 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012) of Aquarius scatterometer observations at three polarizations (sigma(HH), sigma(VV), and sigma(HV)) to map predicted error estimates globally, using parameters relevant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active and Passive satellite mission. We find that RVI is particularly vulnerable to errors in the calibration offset term over lightly vegetated regions, resulting in overestimates of RVI in some arid regions. m(s) is most sensitive to calibration errors over regions where the dynamic range of the backscatter coefficient is small, including deserts and forests. Noise induces biases in both indices, but they are negligible in both cases; however, it also induces variance, which is large for highly vegetated regions (for RVI) and areas with low dynamic range in backscatter values (for m(s)). We find that, with appropriate temporal and spatial averaging, noise errors in both indices {{can be reduced to}} acceptable levels. Areas sensitive to calibration errors will require masking.

40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{construct}} a simple, highly aggregated model, driven by easily available data sets, that accurately predicted terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP; carboxylation plus oxygenation) in diverse environments and ecosystems. Our starting point was a fine-scale, multilayer model of half-hourly canopy processes that has been parametrized for Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Over varied growing season conditions, this fine-scale model predicted hourly carbon and latent energy fluxes that were in good agreement with data from eddy covariance studies. Using an heuristic process, we derived a simple aggregated set of equations operating on cumulative or average values of the most sensitive driving variables (leaf area index, mean foliar N concentration, canopy height, average daily temperature and temperature range, atmospheric transmittance, latitude, day of year, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture).</b> We calibrated the aggregated model to provide estimates of GPP {{similar to those of}} the fine-scale model across a wide range of these driving variables. Our calibration across this broad range of conditions captured 96 % of fine-scale model behavior, but was computationally many orders of magnitude faster. We then tested the assumptions we had made in generating the aggregated model by applying it in different ecosystems. Using the same parameter values derived for Harvard Forest, the aggregated model made sound predictions of GPP for wet-sedge tundra in the Arctic under a variety of experimental manipulations, and also for a range of forest types across the OTTER (Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research) transect in Oregon, running from coastal Sitka spruce to high-plateau mountain juniper...|$|R
40|$|The mineralogy, {{texture and}} wave {{velocity}} {{characteristics of a}} range of sandstones were studied to aid the understanding and prediction of geotechnical properties. From a consider-ation of volumetric strain variations it is apparent that the weaker ocks display a behaviour markedly different from the stronger ocks. In the weaker rocks, the elastic range is limited to very low stress levels. The sensitivity of the strength and volumetric strain to sample moisture content has also been evaluated and shown to be an important variable in rock deformability behaviour; a decrease in moisture content tends to suppress the onset of dilatancy and microcracking, leading to an increase in peak strength. Microscopic haracteristics, in particular in the areas of grain contact and cementation, were successfully used to explain the strength and deformability behaviour of a wide range <b>of</b> sandstones. Practical <b>index</b> parameters for assessing the strength and deformability of sandstones are outlined.

40|$|We {{developed}} an irrigation mapping methodology {{that relies on}} remotely sensed inputs from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, globally extensive ancillary sources of gridded climate and agricultural data and on an advanced image classification algorithm. In the first step, we used climate-based <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>moisture</b> status and a map of cultivated lands to provide potential, first-cut at global irrigation. To detect actual irrigation, in the second step, we used spatiotemporal and spectral signatures from MODIS remotely sensed data. In particular, we explored three types of irrigation-related indices: i) Annual – where we exploited the difference in annual greenness variability between irrigated and non-irrigated crops and related this difference to precipitation availability; ii) Spectral – where we exploited a vegetation index (Green Ratio Index) that is sensitive to chlorophyll content; and iii) Inter-annual – where we explored the differences in inter-annual changes in vegetation greenness associated with precipitation between irrigated and non-irrigated crops. In the third step, we combined our potential irrigation dataset, remotely sensed indices, and training examples within a supervised classification tool based on a non-parametric decision-tree algorithm to make a binary (i. e. irrigated vs. non-irrigated) irrigated agriculture map. A test of irrigation mapping procedure in a pilot study over the continental US produced a high spatial resolution (1 km) map of irrigated areas with better than 80 percent map accuracy and expected spatial patterns such as a strong east-west divide with most irrigated areas concentrated on the arid west along dry lowland valleys. Future improvements of the method will include estimation of sub-pixel presence of irrigation using remotely-sensed skin temperature measurements...|$|R
