5|$|The chapter also {{covers the}} {{influence}} of drug reps, how ghostwriters are employed by the <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> to write papers for academics to publish, how independent the academic journals really are, how the <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> finance doctors' continuing education, and how patients' groups are often funded by industry.|$|R
5|$|There {{have also}} been cases of {{available}} treatment being withheld during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the <b>drug</b> <b>company</b> Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that {{was known to be}} effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 children died, divided almost equally between the two groups. The families taking part in the trial were apparently not told that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next-door building.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one <b>drug</b> <b>company.</b> Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E

The drugs involved were Paxil, Wellbutrin, Advair, Lamictal, and Zofran for off-label, non-covered uses.

25|$|Studies {{show that}} doctors can be {{influenced}} by <b>drug</b> <b>company</b> inducements, including gifts and food. Industry-sponsored Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs influence prescribing patterns. Many patients surveyed in one study agreed that physician gifts from drug companies influence prescribing practices. A growing movement among physicians is attempting to diminish the influence of pharmaceutical industry marketing upon medical practice, as evidenced by Stanford University's ban on drug company-sponsored lunches and gifts. Other academic institutions that have banned pharmaceutical industry-sponsored gifts and food include the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, {{after his}} sister Pauline was born, Pauling's parents {{decided to move}} out of Portland, to find more {{affordable}} and spacious living quarters than their one-room apartment. Lucy stayed with her husband's parents in Lake Oswego until Herman brought the family to Salem, where he worked briefly as a traveling salesman for the Skidmore <b>Drug</b> <b>Company.</b> Within a year of Lucile's birth in 1904, Herman Pauling moved his family to Oswego, where he opened his own drugstore. He moved his family to Condon, Oregon in 1905. By 1906, Herman Pauling was suffering from recurrent abdominal pain. He died of a perforated ulcer on June 11, 1910, leaving Lucy to care for Linus, Lucile and Pauline.|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} {{ties between}} doctors and <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> {{have come under}} intense scrutiny in recent years. Some commentators [...] such as Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine [...] argue that the mission of doctors is fundamentally different to the mission of <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> and that the ties between them should be completely cut. "Drug companies are investor owned businesses with a responsibility to maximise profits for their shareholders," says Angell. "That {{is quite different from}} the mission of the medical profession, which is to provide the best care possible for patients. " Other commentators have argued that clinicians and <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> do have some shared goals in aiming to maximize human health. In this debate, Emma D'Arcy, co-founder of a social networking site that facilitates interactions between doctors and <b>drug</b> <b>companies,</b> argues that it would be valuable to the public if we could establish "authentic alliances" between these professionals. But journalist Ray Moynihan argues that such alliances are prone to the corrupting influence of pharmaceutical industry money, and that disentanglement is a healthier alternative...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>companies</b> marketed their <b>drugs</b> at {{different}} prices {{depending on the}} target consumers. [...] In the United States many people accessed healthcare through private insurers which they paid through their employers, and in this system, the market could pay extremely high drug prices. In wealthy countries with nationalized healthcare, like Canada, Western Europe, and Japan, the <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> charged mid-range prices according to the market norms. In developing countries the prices were lowest.|$|R
