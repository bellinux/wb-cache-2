40|$|Temporin L (TL, 13 -residues long) is a frog-skin peptide with a {{wide and}} potent {{spectrum}} of antimicrobial activity, but with a toxic effect on mammalian cells at its microbicidal concentration. Previous studies indicated [Pro 3]TL as an analog with a slightly lower hemolytic activity than the native TL. Here, a systematic replacement of single residues within the alpha-helix domain of Pro 3 TL (Lys 7 to Leu 13) with D aminoacids, known as helix breakers, has been carried out. Structure-activity relationship studies, by means of CD/NMR spectroscopy analysis and antimicrobial/hemolytic assays have been performed leading {{to a better understanding}} on the structural elements that are responsible for the cell selectivity of TL. Most importantly, we have found how a single L-to <b>D</b> <b>aminoacid</b> substitution can preserve the strong anti-candida activity of [Pro 3]TL, making it completely harmless towards human cells...|$|E
