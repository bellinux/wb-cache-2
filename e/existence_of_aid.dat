40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} a phenomenon that has become particularly apparent {{since the end of}} the 1980 's and the end of the cold war. During this period there has been not only an increase in intrastate conflict but also a change in international approaches to dealing with it and its aftermath. While many may be familiar with the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> agencies of various types that make attending to the fallout of these conflicts a central part of their business, it would appear that fewer recognise the increasing role that various military establishments are playing in aspects of relief delivery and reconstruction for which they receive aid donor funding. It has been suggested elsewhere that given the expansion of this role, the military may be seen as a development agent and that as such members of the development community could possibly engage with them more. This thesis investigates one aspect of the role of the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) in East Timor as a case of a military organisation engaged in a major peace operation that has seen it involved in not only security activities normally associated with the military, but also a range of activities, including some that civilian aid agencies working in the same area have also been engaged in...|$|E

40|$|This case {{arose from}} a {{decision}} of the Italian authorities to extend an existing regional aid scheme – a social security concession for the south of Italy - to the cities of Chioggia and Venice in the north, which fell outside the designated regional aid areas approved {{on the basis of}} Article 107 (3) (a). This measure was not notified to the Commission in advance and, following an investigative procedure, the Commission reached a decision requiring the recovery of aid except insofar as it had been paid either to SMEs, to firms located in designated assisted areas, concerned the employment of ‘hard-to-place’ employees or to specified municipal companies. The recovery decision was contested before the General Court. The Commission claimed that the applicants lacked standing, but this was rejected by the Court which found that belonging to a closed class of actual beneficiaries of an aid scheme affected by the obligation to repay aid was sufficient to differentiate them from all other persons. On substance, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the measures were compensation for additional costs arising from their location in the Venice lagoon (not State aid), that the Commission had failed to account of the situation of undertakings other than selected municipal companies, and that the Commission had infringed Article 107 (3) (c) in relation to regional aid. The substantive claims were rejected by the General Court. The applicants also challenged the legality of the recovery order, arguing that the measure was a mere extension in time and territory of a measure dating back to the 1970 s. This was not accepted by the General Court which accordingly dismissed the actions. The applicants appealed the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice. For its part, the Commission, by cross appeal, sought the annulment of the General Court’s judgment insofar as it declared the applicants’ actions admissible. The Court of Justice upheld the General Court’s ruling on the standing of the applicants, though it found that the General Court had erred in law in finding that it was not for the national authorities to verify in each individual case whether the conditions for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> were met. The Court of Justice dismissed the main appeals of the applicants against the judgment of the General Court and confirmed the order for the recovery of the unlawful aid...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop the}} theory for the Adiabatic Raman Photoassociation (ARPA) of ultracold atoms to form ultracold {{molecules}} {{in the presence}} of scattering resonances. Based on a computational method in which we replace the continuum with a discrete set of "effective modes", we show that the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> resonances greatly <b>aids</b> in the formation of deeply bound molecular states. We illustrate our general theory by computationally studying the formation of ^ 85 Rb_ 2 molecules from pairs of colliding ultracold ^ 85 Rb atoms. The single-event transfer yield is shown to have a near-unity value for wide resonances, while the ensemble-averaged transfer yield is shown to be higher for narrow resonances. The ARPA yields are compared with that of (the experimentally measured) "Feshbach molecule" magneto-association. Our findings suggest that an experimental investigation of ARPA at sub-μK temperatures is warranted. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{relationship}} between EU (European Union) state aid law and compliance with intra-EU investment arbitration awards. The first section investigates the problem of compliance with intra-EU awards in general and argues that the doctrine of imputability allows to rule out the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> illegal state <b>aid.</b> The second section addresses the case of an arbitral award mandating the re-installment of illegal state aid: only under such specific circumstances, compliance with the award constitutes a violation of Article 107 TFEU. The consequences on the regime of circulation of awards are scrutinized: as for non-ICSID awards, the article advocates a restrictive interpretation of Article V(2) (b) of the New York Convention. As for ICSID awards, it is argued that the Commission should refrain from requiring Member States to violate Article 54 of the Washington Convention, in light of the analogies between the case at hand and GATT 1947...|$|R

This paper addresses the issue of multiple thresholds characterizing the aid/growth relationship. Using a semiparametric econometric method we do find that aid become effective only above a critical level but also become detrimental to growth for higher value <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> flows. We also investigate how the quality of economic policies and vulnerability modifies the level of those two thresholds.

40|$|Purpose This {{research}} takes Nigeria and {{the healthcare}} prevention sector {{as a case}} study to describe {{the manner in which the}} non-profit sector is presently dealing with the challenge of communicating in a multilingual/multicultural environment. The intention is to identify the linguistic factors that affect the design of healthcare prevention interventions, indicate language strategies that are being used and potentially single out opportunities for improvement. Design/Methodology/Approach Two data sets were employed: the main one representing phone interviews with Communication for Development practitioners in the healthcare domain in Nigeria and a secondary one including online testimonials from the Here I Am campaign conducted by the Global Fund. The data collected was analysed following the Critical Discourse Analysis three-level framework. In addition to this, the micro level stage incorporated Grounded Theory Method to elicit thematic relations, and Semiotic Analysis and Discursive Analysis to determine the stance of the speakers. Findings Participants to this research perceived language and culture as two entwined concepts. Communication in the community’s local language was said to enhance message acceptance. The thematic analysis revealed that the strategy to be used, mainly translation or a combination of community interpreting and cultural mediation, depends largely on the level of literacy of the community. Of the proposed language strategies, training of bilingual individuals and a combination of community interpreting and cultural mediation appeared to be the two pivotal modes of interlingual message transposition. Pictorials are used in extreme situations. Despite the dissimilarity of the two data sets used in this research, the discursive analysis suggested the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aid</b> beneficiaries/non-profit staff binary. The way <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> beneficiaries and individuals working at grassroots level exhibited traits of dependency on other players (in this case donors and non-profit staff). Similarly, the discursive analysis of the interviews put forward that the non-profit staff interviewed tended to distinguish between themselves and Others (in this case, the aid beneficiaries). This research found furthermore that translation and interpreting activities within the non-profit sphere are not always undertaken according to strict professional ethics and praxis...|$|R

40|$|International {{headlines}} {{have been}} consumed with {{the proliferation of}} international tax havens and “sweetheart deals” given to multinational companies with the hopes that they would invest in a given country. In response to such concerns, the E. U. Commission has issued a spate of decisions in which it concludes that certain taxation rulings given by State Members to international corporations constitute illegal state aid. These decisions have both befuddled and outraged various parties in the international community, including states and multinational corporations, who claim that the Commission is acting both unilaterally and without precedent. This Comment surveys the applicable case law and analyzes in detail the rationale behind the Commission’s decisions in order to uncover some of the fundamental principles driving the E. U. ’s executive body. This Comment reaches a number of conclusions. One, “selectivity” and “advantage” applied by the Commission in determining the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> is a purposeful conflation by the Commission rather than a brash departure from earlier precedent. The Commission’s rulings also reveal the importance of both the reference system and the use of treaties in purposefully framing any tax rulings that a multinational may receive. Finally, the use of generalized and individualized schemes will have vastly different consequences, given that these two groups of measures are analyzed very differently by the Commission. Case law will also reveal significant flaws in the Commission’s decisions, including the fact that the Commission has applied these terms inconsistently. Additionally, the Commission retains significant power to rule arguendo that a measure has the potential to distort competition and affect intra-state trade. The preceding considerations are important, as they ultimately affect the ex ante planning considerations of the multinationals and states involved. In the era of higher, more rigorous tax scrutiny, multinational corporations and Member States must be more purposeful and vigilant in planning...|$|R
