This is because SERS enhances the intensity of the Raman scattered signal from an analyte by orders of 106 or more. This dissertation deals with the different aspects involved in the application of SERS for biosensing. It discusses initial studies performed using traditional chemically reduced silver colloidal nanoparticles for the SERS detection of a myriad of proteins and nucleic acids. It examines ways to circumvent the inherent aggregation problems associated with colloidal nanoparticles that frequently lead to poor data reproducibility. The different methods examined to create robust SERS substrates include the creation of thermally evaporated silver island films on microscope glass slides, using the technique of Nanosphere Lithography (NSL) to create hexagonally close packed periodic particle arrays of silver nanoparticles on glass substrates as well as the use of optically tunable <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshell</b> films on glass substrates. The three different types of SERS surfaces are characterized using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, Electron Microscopy (EM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) as well as SERS using the model Raman active molecule trans- 1, 2 -bis(4 -pyridyl) ethylene (BPE).

Here, we designed a nanoparticle complex structure that consists of a plasmonically active hollow <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshell</b> core surrounded by photoluminescent quantum nanocrystals (QNs) in the form of PbS encapsulated by a silica layer. There are three main design variables including HGN synthesis and optical tuning, formation of the silica layer on the hollow <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshell</b> surface, and fabrication and photoluminescence tuning of PbS quantum nanocrystals. The hollow gold nanoshells were deliberately designed to function in the optical regimes that maximize tissue transmissivity (800 nm) and minimize tissue absorption (1100 nm). Secondly, several chemical ligands were tested such as (3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane and mercaptoundecanoic acid for controlled growth of the silica layer.

Previous {{studies showed that}} passive delivery of <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshells</b> through intravenous administration resulted in limited tumor accumulation, which represents a major challenge for this therapy. In this report, the impact of direct intratumoral administration on the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the nanoshells was systematically investigated. Methods: The <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshells</b> were labeled with the radionuclide, copper- 64 (64 Cu). Intratumoral infusion of 64 Cu-nanoshells and two controls, ie, 64 Cu-DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazaciclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid) and 64 Cu-DOTA-PEG (polyethylene glycol), as well as intravenous injection of 64 Cu-nanoshells were performed in nude rats, each with a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma xenograft. The pharmacokinetics was determined by radioactive counting of serial blood samples collected from the rats at different time points post-injection. Using positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging, the in vivo distribution of 64 Cu-nanoshells and the controls was monitored at various time points after injection. Organ biodistribution in the rats at 46 hours was analyzed by radioactive counting and compare...|$|R

The degree of Raman enhancement for these thermosensitive SERS nanotags was controlled by plasmonic tuning of {{the properties of the}} HGNs...|$|R
40|$|Exposed to {{spectral}} {{and uniform}} light, a one-dimensional, conducting and radiatively participating medium due to embedded absorbing and scattering <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshells</b> is solved. P 1 Approximation method {{is used to}} solve the radiative transfer equation and finite difference explicit method is used to find the temperature distribution having both boundaries subjected to convection. The host medium was transparent to spectral radiation and the temperature distribution is obtained when {{the temperature of the}} irradiated boundary reaches the desired temperature such that any temperature in the medium does not exceed the melting temperature of the host medium. Variation of the concentration and configuration of <b>gold</b> <b>nanoshells</b> are found to change the radiative transfer spectrum that leads to an alteration in the local heat generation spectrum and the desired temperature distribution...|$|R
