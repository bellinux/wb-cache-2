5|$|During the <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the 1830s, Irish and German {{immigration}} to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, {{the writings of}} Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many Irish were motivated by the Irish potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848. Other Irish settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression had a {{comparatively}} mild effect on Argentina, {{the unemployment rate}} never went above 10%, and the country largely recovered by 1935. However, the Depression permanently halted its <b>economic</b> <b>expansion.</b> Actually, much like other developing countries, the economy was already in a downturn beginning in 1927, a result of declining prices.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} capital to feed rapid <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> also saw Birmingham grow into a major {{financial}} centre with extensive international connections.

By 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the dot-com}} boom, stable {{monetary}} policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> in the short term.|$|E
5|$|At home, the U.S. {{experienced}} sustained <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> and a {{rapid growth}} of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments. In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country. The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination. Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution.|$|E
40|$|Three {{studies suggest}} that {{business}} cycle fluctuations trigger distinct motivational orientations that selectively affect economic judgment and decision making. Economic contractions induce avoidance motivation and affect negative economic sentiment, but leave approach motivation and positive economic sentiment unaffected. In contrast, <b>economic</b> <b>expansions</b> induce approach motivation and positive economic sentiment, but do not affect avoidance motivation or negative economic sentiment (study 1). Moreover, economic contractions induce risk aversion for negative outcomes, but not for positive outcomes, while <b>economic</b> <b>expansions</b> instigate risk seeking for positive outcomes, but not for negative outcomes (study 2). A time-series study based on consumer spending over eight decades mirrors {{the findings of the}} experimental studies: The consumption of products associated with avoiding negative outcomes increases during economic contractions, but not during expansions. In contrast, the consumption of products associated with achieving positive outcomes increases in expansions, but is unaffected by contractions (study 3). © 2011 Elsevier Inc. ...|$|R
50|$|Monetarists {{emphasize}} {{a steady}} {{growth rate of}} money and use monetary policy to control inflation by increasing interest rates and slowing {{the rise in the}} money supply. Keynesians emphasize reducing aggregate demand during <b>economic</b> <b>expansions</b> and increasing demand during recessions to keep inflation stable. Control of aggregate demand can be achieved using both monetary policy and fiscal policy (increased taxation or reduced government spending to reduce demand).|$|R
40|$|Background In Western {{countries}} mortality dropped {{throughout the}} 20 th century, but {{over and above}} the long-term falling trend, the death rate has oscillated over time. It has been postulated that these short-term oscillations may be related to changes in the economy. Methods To ascertain if these short-term oscillations are related to fluctuations in the economy, age-adjusted total mortality and mortality for specific population groups, ages and causes of death were transformed into rate of change or percentage deviation from trend, and were correlated and regressed on indicators of the US economy during the 20 th century, transformed in the same way. Results Statistically and demographically significant results show that the decline of total mortality and mortality for different groups, ages and causes accelerated during recessions and was reduced or even reversed during periods of economic expansion—with the exception of suicides which increase during recessions. In recent decades these effects are stronger for women and non-whites. Conclusions <b>Economic</b> <b>expansions</b> are associated with increasing mortality. Suggested pathways to explain this deceleration or even reversal of the secular decline in mortality during <b>economic</b> <b>expansions</b> include both material and psychosocial effects of the <b>economic</b> upturns: <b>expansion</b> of traffic and industrial activity directly raising injury-related mortality, decreased immunity levels (owing to rising stress and reduction of sleep time, social interaction and social support), and increased consumption of tobacco, alcohol and saturated fats...|$|R
5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major <b>economic</b> <b>expansion,</b> mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. Among these were the distraction it provided from German re-militarisation; the prevention of the spread of communism to Western Europe; {{the creation of a}} state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France; and the possibilities for <b>economic</b> <b>expansion.</b> Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by Germany; despite prolonging the Civil War, it would help to distract the other western powers from Hitler's ambitions in central Europe. The offensive on Vizcaya, a mining and industrial centre, would help fuel German industry. On 27 June 1937, Hitler (in a speech at Wurzburg) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.|$|E

5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836.

During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets {{played a central role in}} medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war of}} independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and the Dos de Mayo Hospital. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870. The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further urban growth was expected. However, the export-led <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest.|$|E
5|$|At the Union of 1707 England {{had about}} five times the {{population}} of Scotland, and about 36 times as much wealth, however, Scotland began to experience the beginnings of <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> that would begin {{to allow it to}} close this gap. Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life of}} their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E
50|$|One {{alternative}} {{theory is}} that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle: the net expansion of credit (increase in private credit, equivalently debt, as a percentage of GDP) yields <b>economic</b> <b>expansions,</b> while the net contraction causes recessions, and if it persists, depressions. In particular, the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions, and this theory places finance and banks {{at the center of the}} business cycle.|$|R

30|$|In contrast, Bilginsoy (2003) {{provides}} {{evidence for}} the US {{which suggests that the}} number of apprentices is higher during a downturn.

5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for {{national}} health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D.

Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid).
