They released TVXQ's fifth Korean album <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> Down (2011), topping album charts in most major Asian markets upon release. Their first two Japanese albums as a duo, Tone (2011) and Time (2013), solidified {{their success in}} Japan as it forged TVXQ's {{reputation as one of}} the top-touring artists in the country. Their eighth Japanese album With (2014) made TVXQ the first and only foreign music act in Japan to have four number-one albums in a row.|$|E

He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside {{on his first day}} in charge to say [...] "I'll let you manage the reserves, so long as you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> down, do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said [...] "one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close".|$|E

500|$|Routine decrees (ferman) or {{titles of}} {{privilege}} (berat) {{were written by}} a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal (tughra). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame. The note would emphasize a particular part of his edict, urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called Hatt-ı Hümayunla Müveşşeh Ferman (ferman decorated with a hatt-ı hümayun) or Unvanına Hatt-ı Hümayun (hatt-ı hümayun to the title). The note might use a clichéd phrase like [...] "to be done as required" [...] (mûcebince amel oluna) or, [...] "my command is to carried out as required {{and no one is}} to interfere with its execution" [...] (emrim mûcebince amel oluna, kimseye müdahale etmeyeler). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, in order to encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as [...] "if you want to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> carry out this order as required" [...] (Başın gerek ise mûcebiyle amel oluna).|$|E
2500|$|Yunho and Changmin {{released}} TVXQ's comeback Korean album <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> Down on January 5, 2011.

[...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> on straight."

2500|$|As a ruler and politician, Padmé is {{distrustful of}} bureaucracy, opposed to corruption, and {{attached}} to the ideals of democracy {{and the rule of}} law.

[...] According to Mainon and Ursini, [...] "she tried to preach compromise and reason, [...] the disarray within the ... led her to doubt the senate's effectiveness."

2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Kevin Hoskins {{said that}} the band [...] "continues to rock stages year after year. I feel like I say that with every release, which is {{impressive}} since they've been around {{for almost two decades}} now. So, what's one to expect from 'O God Help Us All?'

Though it may not carry the lyrical depth or stellar musical creativity of other acts, it can <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> bobbing all day long." [...] Hoskins wrote that [...] "In the end, this is what Disciple is known for. Is it going to be played all over Christian rock stations? Absolutely.

2500|$|While {{promoting}} <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> Down, Yunho and Changmin {{spoke up}} for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ. According to Yunho, JYJ had [...] "exceedingly deep conflicts" [...] with their agency and the members had irreconcilable differences about their career. Changmin added that the team had worked so hard {{to the point where they}} felt like they could finally [...] "harvest the fruits of [...] labor", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, [...] "The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems to talk about my own story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} Selman states for writing this book is because [...] "you <b>keep</b> banging <b>your</b> <b>head</b> against the wall, {{eventually}} a door will open, sure enough... you just can't give up on things." [...] Selman received death threats throughout the case and afterwards, which he calls [...] "very unnerving" [...] he stated his confusion with the question [...] "What ever happened to the commandment, 'Do Not Kill' ... these people don't follow their own tenets." ...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{because of}} Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and {{his focus on}} nature and cosmology, he was not {{accepted}} or understood by most of his colleagues. [...] "You," [...] a friend told him, [...] "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life {{is never going to}} be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don’t stay in the hole where God supposedly put you.

5000|$|Automatic weapons, {{especially}} belt-fed, crew-served machine guns, {{can be used}} {{to deliver}} a high volume of fire at enemy positions. A history of German military doctrine states that [...] "...laying down saturation fire small arms will <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> enemy's <b>head</b> down while allowing you {{to get on with the}} approach to the objective. During the Vietnam War, AC-130 aircraft incorporated side-firing 20 mm Gatling-style cannons which allowed them to provide area-saturation fire as the aircraft circled over a target. Another use of saturation fire in the Vietnam War was with [...] "guntrucks" [...] in convoys. These [...] "2-ton cargo vehicles" [...] with [...] "two M-60 machine gunners" [...] would [...] "... provide a rapid, retaliatory saturation fire within the critical first 3 minutes of an enemy attack an ambush of the convoy".|$|R
2500|$|However, {{not all of}} Dorgon's {{policies}} were equally popular nor easily implemented. The controversial July 1645 edict (the [...] "haircutting order") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: [...] "To keep the hair, you lose the head; To <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> you cut the hair." [...] To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that [...] "a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, {{are not to be}} damaged." [...] Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it {{in the form of a}} top-knot. [...] The order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of Han Chinese. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly a living person left in this city. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han Chinese Qing army led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐), who had been ordered to [...] "fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords," [...] massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. The queue was the only aspect of Manchu culture which the Qing forced on the common Han population. The Qing required people serving as officials to wear Manchu clothing, but allowed non-official Han civilians to continue wearing Hanfu (Han clothing).|$|E
