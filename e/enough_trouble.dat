500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show Picket Fences, which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of Picket Fences, and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of Picket Fences. Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of Picket Fences. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having <b>enough</b> <b>trouble</b> on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The Picket Fences episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to Picket Fences has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the Picket Fences episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson. Ladner, British Columbia served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in Cloverdale, with the local employees being used for the butchering and cleaning up scenes.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{initially}} makes progress, and earns a small {{profit from}} his rabbit farm. In the long run, getting water proves a problem, and dragging {{it all the}} way from the distant spring becomes a backbreaking experience. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but is met only with vague excuses. Then, when the rain does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. Jean loudly berates God, whom he thinks has already given him <b>enough</b> <b>trouble</b> by deforming him. Later, the dusty winds of the sirocco also arrive, bringing the farm to near-catastrophe. Jean is undeterred, and decides to dig a well. At this point Ugolin sees it fitting to try and convince Jean that his project is hopeless, and that he might be better off selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. Jean has no intention of leaving though, but wants to use the value of the property to take up a mortgage of half that sum. Ugolin is not happy, but Papet again sees opportunity: he will himself grant the mortgage; that way he will either earn the interest, or drive Jean away for good. From the money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock and falls into the cavity. At first the injuries seem minor, but it turns out his spine is fractured and when the doctor arrives he declares Jean dead. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he's crying. [...] "It is not me who's crying," [...] he responds, [...] "it's my eyes".|$|E
2500|$|Unusually for {{the time}} Maddock sported a full beard. As {{a result of this}} he quickly became known around the Cooper {{establishment}} as [...] "The Beard", while to Charles Cooper he would always be [...] "Whiskers". His mercurial temperament and volatile temper sometimes grated against his employers' nerves. Once, when a potential new recruit arrived for a job interview, Charles Cooper asked his secretary whether he had a beard. On being told that he did, Cooper told her to [...] "Send 'im home. I've got <b>enough</b> <b>trouble</b> with the one I've got!".|$|E

[...] "I believe things can always be found out, if only you take <b>trouble</b> <b>enough.</b> And <b>trouble</b> means money;--does it not? We wouldn't mind how many {{thousand}} pounds it cost; would we, Marie?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{band was}} accused by a California {{religious}} group {{and later the}} Parents Music Resource Center of backmasking Satanic messages in their anti-cocaine anthem, [...] "Snowblind". James Young has denied this charge during his introduction for [...] "Snowblind" [...] when played live. Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the In the Studio with Redbeard program [...] "we had <b>enough</b> <b>trouble</b> to make the music sound right forward." [...] Also, James Young quotes, [...] "If {{we were going to}} put something Satanic in our songs, we would have put it so it was in the song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The home {{side were}} {{still able to}} call on the bowlers of Don Bradman's Great 1948 Team; the hostile pace of Ray Lindwall (23.03) and Keith Miller (22.97), the left-arm swing and left arm spin of Bill Johnston (23.91), the {{flighted}} off-spinners of Ian Johnson and the mystery spin of Jack Iverson. Ray Lindwall was regarded as the finest fast bowler after the war, with a perfectly controlled action; [...] "he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps - until {{the last couple of}} strides of his approach, when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride...when he releases the ball, his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round-arm". He had had a mixed tour of South Africa in 1949-50, failing to take a wicket in the first three South African innings and being dropped for the last Test, his form suffering from groin strain, fibrositis and a stomach disorder. This led to speculation that at 29 the fast bowler's career might soon be over as [...] "his pace was not what it was by any means, and his arm is much lower...his action is more laboured and his body does not follow through". Lindwall returned to the team and would bowl for Australia throughout the 1950s, though Lindsay Hassett tended to underuse him in the series, the opposite of Bradman who overbowled him. Keith Miller was the [...] "glamour boy" [...] of the Australian team [...] "his batting was a joy to behold, his fast bowling can be both fascinating to watch and deadly in effect, while his fielding in the slips and in the covers is feline in its anticipation and soundness". There was [...] a national outcry when he was not picked for the South Africa tour, both as the mercurial all rounder didn't want to bowl (his back had in injured when a night-fighter pilot in the Second World War), not helped by his well-known antipathy with the new Test selector Don Bradman, but was later flown out as a replacement. [...] "Big Bill" [...] Johnston was a powerful left-arm swing bowler who would be Australia's best wicket-taker in the series despite the fame of Lindwall and Miller. Like Miller he could bowl spin, but instead of mixing his bowling he saved his slow left arm spinners for when the opposition were caught on a sticky wicket. Ian Johnson was an off-spinner, a rarity in Australian cricket which tended to prefer leg-spinners. He was not a big turner of the ball, and one of the slowest bowlers in cricket, but he used flight to deceive the batsmen and tied down one end while the fast bowlers rested. To these veterans could be added the extraordinary mystery spin of Jack Iverson, who had found that he could use his long middle finger to turn the ball either way when whiling away the hours in the New Guinea campaign. Although never more than an occasional Grade cricketer before the war Iverson perfected his art and was chosen to play for his native Victoria in 1949-50, but {{was on the verge of}} quitting cricket when the England team arrived. He was 35 and his ailing father needed him to take over the family business, but stayed at the helm against his doctor's advice so that Iverson could play for Australia. He took 3/85 for Victoria vs the tourists and though he only dismissed three tailenders he caused the batsmen <b>enough</b> <b>trouble</b> to be picked for the Test team and the First Test at Brisbane was the first Test match he ever saw. His greatest day came in the Third Test at Sydney when he took 6/27 in Australia's innings victory. He retired at the end of the season even though he had [...] "the world's best batsmen at his mercy, if he could spare the time".|$|E

500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have <b>enough</b> <b>troubles</b> at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|R

The horse plunged forward, and, with the jolt, she was fawning on Marmaduke's arm again, saying, [...] "Dont be brutal to me any more, Bob. I cant bear it. I have <b>enough</b> <b>trouble</b> without your turning on me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His letter implies it," [...] {{he agreed}} and then pulled himself up. Gerald was clever {{and no doubt}} meant to divert his thoughts. [...] "After all, this doesn't matter," [...] he went on. [...] "I'll pay these bills, {{but if you get}} into debt at Woolwich, you had better not come home.
