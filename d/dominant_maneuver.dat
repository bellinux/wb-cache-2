40|$|Thesis: The MV- 22 's {{enhanced}} capabilities {{will allow}} the Marine Corps to achieve a greater operational distinction by enabling a timely response that is critical to our warfighting capabilities. The MV- 22 will support key concepts, precision engagement and <b>dominant</b> <b>maneuver,</b> outlined in Joint Vision 2010 while providing the Marine Corps unique latitude in force projection. Background: The most significant advantage offered by the MV- 22 is to rapidly self-deploy worldwide and arrive ready to fight. This will provide Marines the ability to quickly respond to crisis situations while reducing the impact on valuable strategic lift sorties. The Osprey's ability to fly significant distances enables Marines to respond rapidly to those situations that require immediate reinforcement or build-up of combat power. The Osprey provides unique latitude with its capability to self-deploy and greater versatility in employing military force. Two mission areas that are suitable to the Osprey's design are aerial refuel/tanker support and command and control (C 2). Increasing the MV- 22 's role within the Marine Corps provides a single asset that can perform multiple missions. The enhanced capabilities of the MV- 22 will exten...|$|E
50|$|The {{shock and}} awe battle tactics adopted by the American {{military}} - overwhelming power, battlefield awareness, <b>dominant</b> <b>maneuvers,</b> and spectacular displays of force - are employed because they {{are believed to be}} the best way to win a war quickly and decisively, reducing casualties on both sides. However, if the only people doing the shooting are American, then a high percentage of total casualties are bound to be the result of friendly fire, blunting the effectiveness of the {{shock and awe}} tactic. It is probably the fact that friendly fire has proven to be the only fundamental weakness of the tactics that has caused the American military to take significant steps to overturn a blasé attitude to friendly fire and assess ways to eliminate it.|$|R
40|$|The Battle Command Battle Laboratory is the U. S. Army’s {{test bed}} for {{advanced}} networking and telecommunications experimentation. Over {{the past two}} years the lab has conducted a series of experiments focused on the Army’s conceptual Future Force network. These experiments were designed to integrate a myriad of network-related study issues into a technical analysis of future network concepts. The results of these experiments provide the analytical underpinnings supporting the viability of transitioning the conceptual design of the Army’s Future Force into an actual warfighting entity. The Army’s Future Force is designed to be a faster, lighter, but more lethal force than today’s force. The Future Force will use information superiority as its premier combat enabler. Information superiority coupled with an ultra-reliable networked Battle Command and Control (C 2) system will ensure that separate units fight as one. This connectivity and orchestration are performed within a network-centric environment. The Army’s view of Network Centric Warfare can be described as the orchestration of integrated successes of its core operational concepts (<b>dominant</b> <b>maneuver,</b> precision engagement, focused/just-in-time logistics, space-to-mud telecommunications, and full dimensional protection), which are all dependent upon information superiority...|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is clear}} that {{information}} has a far-reaching effect, quantifying or measuring that effect is far from well understood. Such an understanding is important to the Army, particularly at time when it is spending a considerable amount of its scarce investment capital on establishing information age links across its forces (the so-called digitization of the Army). As it transforms itself, the Army needs information-age analytic tools to help it make the best choices possible. Chief among the analytic tools required are: (1) an acceptable quantifiable measure of valuable information, that is, information that adds to the commander’s knowledge of the combat situation he faces, and (2) measures of effectiveness (MOEs) that reflect the effects of knowledge on military outcomes. In this paper, we suggest a probability model of knowledge using information entropy to measure the amount of uncertainty in the commander’s current knowledge of the battlespace, his current situation awareness. The knowledge metric developed is also used to explain relative information superiority and a way of thinking quantitatively about information dominance. Finally, we illustrate the use of the metric with a new measure of non-linear <b>dominant</b> <b>maneuver</b> that incorporates knowledge and speed to assess {{the degree to which a}} friendly unit controls a battlespace...|$|E
40|$|Joint Vision 2010 {{introduces}} the emerging operational concepts of <b>Dominant</b> <b>Maneuver.</b> Precision Engagement, Focused Logistics, and Full Dimensional Protection enabled by Information Superiority. Information Superiority is gained through operational architectures that closely couple {{the capabilities of}} sensors, C 2, and shooters. This architecture of future warfare {{can be characterized as}} Network Centric Warfare. The Navy's response to adapt and develop new operational concepts in support of Network Centric Warfare is Information Technology for the Twenty First Century (IT- 21). IT- 21 is a reprioritization of existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C 4 I) programs of record focused on accelerating the transition to a personal computer (PC) based tactical and support warfighting network. Battle Labs exist Service wide to aid in this growth process. Battle labs are focused organizations created to explore new technology, concepts, doctrine, or tactics, techniques and procedures to improve the efficiency and combat power of the forces. The Systems Technology Battle Lab was established to inject an academic viewpoint into experiments and research sponsored by the MBC and Commander, Third Fleet (COMTHIRDFLT). Currently, the documentation on the systems installed and how they work together to provide a centralized forum for experimentation and research is inadequate. The purpose of this thesis is to provide the STBL user with a guide describing the capabilities of the STBL and an example of its utilization in an integrated form. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Third Annual Acquisition Research SymposiumThe {{following}} {{article is}} taken as {{an excerpt from the}} proceedings of the annual Acquisition Research Program. This annual event showcases the research projects funded through the Acquisition Research Program at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School. Featuring keynote speakers, plenary panels, multiple panel sessions, a student research poster show and social events, the Annual Acquisition Research Symposium offers a candid environment where high-ranking Department of Defense (DoD) officials, industry officials, accomplished faculty and military students are encouraged to collaborate on finding applicable solutions to the challenges facing acquisition policies and processes within the DoD today. By jointly and publicly questioning the norms of industry and academia, the resulting research benefits from myriad perspectives and collaborations which can identify better solutions and practices in acquisition, contract, financial, logistics and program management. For further information regarding the Acquisition Research Program, electronic copies of additional research, or to learn more about becoming a sponsor, please visit our program website at: www. acquisitionresearch. org. For further information on or to register for the next Acquisition Research Symposium during the third week of May, please visit our conference website at: www. researchsymposium. org.;To implement the capabilities conceptualized in Joint Vision 2020, complex, secure networks of weapon systems, intelligence platforms, and command and control mechanisms must be seamlessly integrated and maintained over time. Accurate and timely information will enable Joint Vision 2020 key tenets: <b>Dominant</b> <b>Maneuver,</b> Precision Engagement, Focused Logistics, and Full Dimensional Protection. These networks are central warfighting platforms in the information age. As these capabilities are developed over time in an evolutionary manner, interoperability on the Net-Centric Warfare (NCW) networks is essential, and both hardware and software systems must be designed in an Open-systems Architecture (OA) fashion to accommodate the vast number of changes anticipated. Professional Program Management will be needed to successfully develop these key warfighting platforms. Materiel Developers will need to recognize the relatively immature nature of the software engineering domains and actively compensate for this immaturity. System software performance capabilities must be much more detailed than typical hardware-centric systems, as the current state of software engineering disciplines is unlikely to satisfy implied, yet critical performance requirements. Essential OA performance characteristics including Maintainability, Upgradability, Interfaces/Interoperability, Reliability, Safety and Security (MUIRSS) must be fully analyzed and clearly communicated to the software developer to ensure the DoD obtains the flexibility and longevity desired from NCW systems...|$|E
