5000|$|In 1994 {{it began}} its International Baccalaureate program which {{continues}} to this day, and in 1995 undertook a campaign to amend its name, although a strategic focus group decided to keep the name [...] "comprehensive" [...] to reflect both {{the wide variety of}} programs and services offered and the commitment to meeting all student needs. In 2001 it celebrated its 30th anniversary and honoured four teachers for their long standing and exceptional <b>educational</b> service and <b>dedication</b> to the school.|$|R
40|$|Teaching, I find, is {{a disease}} of the most {{insidious}} character; once exposed to it, recovery is virtually impossible. Although time is fast working its corrective, I have actually spent more {{of my life in}} this occupation than in any other; that is my choicest memory and my proudest boast. Even now, I succumb regularly to the virus, and, like an old fire-horse, return for periods of law teaching in vacation time or other judicial breathing spells. Today in fact I would have been teaching a first-year law class at Yale had I not deemed your claims presently paramount. Thus when your invitation gave me the privilege of being a participant in a milestone of <b>educational</b> progress, the <b>dedication</b> of a fine new hall of learning, I could not fail to respond. And this occasion was for me all the more compelling, since it meant a dream come true for my old and cherished friend Paul Andrews, for years the heart and center of this School, as well as a new point of departure and opportunity for my brilliant former pupil, Dean Kharas, and his able faculty. To be here to share with you the joys of the occasion is alone adequate pleasure and recompense; but you have added to it all by your overflowing generosity in making me one of you, as indeed a fellow alumnus, as I have claimed in my opening remarks. This honor, which I can deserve only as representative of a court of rich traditions in this state and circuit, I accept humbly and gratefully in the spirit in which it is given and I thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart...|$|R
40|$|The {{attitudes of}} farmers in {{relation}} to the importance of different people as information and opinion sources (InfS) for different phases of the decision-making process were studied in 91 Costa Rican dairy farmers. The InfS studied were: Family members, Other farmers, Technical advisors, Farm staff and Commercial agents, while the phases were: Problem detection, Seeking for problem solutions, Seeking for new practices and Seeking for opinion. A Multidimensional Preference Analysis (MDPREF) was used to obtain a two-dimensional map of preference of the farmers. A factor analysis was used to define new variables representing the farmers' predilection towards the InfS. A canonical correlation analysis was performed to find-out simple and canonical correlation between farmers'/farms' characteristics and the InfS preferences. Informational profiles in the population were defined through a Cluster Analysis. The MDPREF suggests that Family members and Technical advisors were the most preferred InfS. However their relative importance changed throughout the phases. Farm staff were rated in third place and their role became more important in the ‘Problem detection’ phase. Other farmers and Commercial agents were, in general, the less preferred information sources. The former became slightly more important in the ‘Seeking for new practices’ phase. The canonical correlation analysis found three low-medium correlations between the farmers'/farms' characteristics and the InfS factors. These correlations showed that the farmers' age, <b>educational</b> level and <b>dedication</b> and the farms' characteristics of area, herd size and distance to population centres had significant influence on the preference of the farmers towards different information sources. The cluster analysis found nine groups of similar farmers according to their preferences towards informational sources. Some implications mainly for extension activities are also stated and discussed. The importance of different informational sources slightly change throughout the decision-making steps, the family and farm staff being the most preferred information sources...|$|R
40|$|Philip Hubbard 2 ̆ 7 s {{life story}} begins in 1921 in Macon, a county {{seat in the}} Bible Belt of north central Missouri, whose history as a former slave state {{permeated}} the culture of his childhood. When he was four his mother moved her family 140 miles north to Des Moines {{in search of the}} greater educational opportunity that Iowa offered African American students. In this recounting of the effects of that journey on the rest of his life, Phil Hubbard merges his private and public life and career into an affectionate, powerful, and important story. Hubbard graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in electrical engineering in 1946; by 1954 he had received his Ph. D. in hydraulics. The College of Engineering extended a warm academic welcome, but nonacademic matters were totally different: Hubbard was ineligible for the housing and other amenities offered to white students. Intelligent, patient, keenly aware of discrimination yet willing to work from within the university system, he advanced from student to teacher to administrator, retiring in 1991 after decades of leadership in the classroom and the conference room. Hubbard 2 ̆ 7 s major accomplishments included policies that focused on human rights; these policies transformed the makeup of students, faculty, and staff by seeking to eliminate discrimination based on race, religion, or other nonacademic factors and by substituting affirmative action for the traditional old-boy methods of selecting faculty and administrators. At the same time that he was advancing the cause of human rights and cultural diversity in education, his family was growing and thriving, and his descriptions of home life reveal one source of his strength and inspiration. The decades that Hubbard covers were vital {{in the evolution of the}} nation and its <b>educational</b> institutions. His <b>dedication</b> to the agenda of public higher education has always been matched by his sensitivity to the negative effects of discrimination and his gentle perseverance toward his goals of inclusion, acceptance, and fairness. His vivid personal and institutional story will prove valuable at this critical juncture in America 2 ̆ 7 s racial history. [URL]...|$|R
