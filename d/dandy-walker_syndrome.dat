40|$|Clinical history - A 4 -year-old boy, born prematurely at 29 weeks (twin pregnancy), with periventricular leukomalacia and {{epilepsy}} underwent brain MRI. Neurological examination showed severe developmental retardation with axial hypotonia, spastic tetraparesis and convergent strabismus. Imaging findings - Cranial MRI revealed typical {{aspects of}} partial rhombencephalosynapsis with vermian hypoplasia, midline fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres and transversely oriented folia and fissures. There was also mild dilatation and dysmorphism of the ventricular system, the septum pellucidum was absent, the hippocampi were malrotated and had vertical orientation and additional finding of associated periventricular cystic leukomalacia. Discussion - Rhombencephalosynapsis (RS) {{is a rare}} congenital defect of the cerebellum classically characterised by vermian agenesis or hypogenesis, fusion of the hemispheres, and closely apposed or fused dentate nuclei. It is now considered to result from an absence of division of the cerebellar hemispheres, following an insult between the 28 th and 44 th day of gestation (i. e., before {{the formation of the}} vermis). Other features have also been described such as fusion of the thalami and cerebral peduncles, malrotated hippocampi, corpus callosum agenesis, hypoplastic chiasm, absence of the septum pellucidum, ventriculomegaly, agenesis of the posterior lobe of the pituitary and cortical malformations. Musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, urinary tract, and respiratory abnormalities have been reported. Typical symptoms consist of swallowing difficulties, delayed motor acquisitions, muscular hypotonia, spastic quadriparesis, cerebellar signs including dysarthria, gait ataxia, abnormal eye movements, and seizures and hydrocephalus. The major MRI signs consist of fused cerebellar hemispheres, with absent or hypoplastic vermis, narrow diamond-shaped fourth ventricle and fused dentate nuclei. In a minority of cases, partial RS has been identified by MRI, demonstrating the presence of the nodulus and the anterior vermis and absence of part of the posterior vermis with only partial fusion of the hemispheres in the inferior part. Other cerebellar malformations involving vermian agenesis or hypoplasia include the <b>Dandy–Walker</b> continuum, Joubert <b>syndrome,</b> tectocerebellar dysraphy or pontocerebellar hypoplasias, and are now easily distinguished from RS by both brain MRI and morphology...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ocular {{motor apraxia}} (OMA) in {{childhood}} is a poorly understood condition involving {{a failure of}} horizontal saccades. OMA {{is thought to be}} rare but the literature indicates wide clinical associations. OMA is often identified by abnormal head movements, but failure of reflexive quick phases has been reported in all but a few patients. The extent of this oculomotor disorder was examined in a large group of children with diverse clinical backgrounds. METHODS: The degree of quick phase failure during horizontal vestibular and optokinetic nystagmus was measured using DC electro-oculography and video in 74 affected children, aged 17 days to 14 years. RESULTS: All children showed an intermittent failure of nystagmic quick phases, except for total failure in one case. Other visuomotor abnormalities were common including saccadic hypometria (85 %), low gain smooth pursuit (70 %), neurological nystagmus (28 %), strabismus (22 %), and vertical abnormalities (11 %). Non-ocular abnormalities were common including infantile hypotonia (61 %), motor delay (77 %), and speech delay (87 %). There was a wide range of clinical associations including agenesis of the corpus callosum, Joubert <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Dandy-Walker</b> malformation, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, vermis hypoplasia, porencephalic cyst, megalocephaly, Krabbe leucodystrophy, Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease, infantile Gaucher disease, GM 1 gangliosidosis, infantile Refsum's disease, propionic acidaemia, ataxia telangiectasia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, vermis astrocytoma, vermis cyst, carotid fibromuscular hypoplasia, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and microphthalmos. Perinatal and postnatal problems were found in 15 % including perinatal hypoxia, meningitis, periventricular leucomalacia, athetoid cerebral palsy, perinatal septicaemia and anaemia, herpes encephalitis, and epilepsy. Only 27 % were idiopathic. CONCLUSION: Quick phase failure is a constant feature of OMA, whereas abnormal head movements were detected in only about half, depending on the underlying diagnosis. This oculomotor sign is better described as an intermittent saccade failure rather than as a true apraxia. It indicates central nervous system involvement, has wide clinical associations, {{but it is not a}} diagnosis...|$|R

5000|$|Until recently, {{the medical}} {{literature}} did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that are now being found to be related.

50|$|<b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>syndrome</b> (DWS) {{is a rare}} {{group of}} {{congenital}} human brain malformations. There are three subtypes which affect multiple organs to varying degrees, but the fundamental abnormalities involve the cerebellum which controls muscle coordination. The adjacent fourth ventricle is often affected, which can alter the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, increase intracranial pressure, and lead to multiple other brain function problems. The degree of disability varies but is typically lifelong. Treatment may involve physical therapy, special education, or surgical placement of a cerebral shunt. It is named for Walter Dandy and Arthur Earl Walker. In the majority of individuals with Dandy-Walker malformation, signs and symptoms caused by abnormal brain development are present at birth or develop within {{the first year of}} life. Some children have a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) that may cause increased head size (macrocephaly). Up to half of affected individuals have intellectual disability that ranges from mild to severe, and those with normal intelligence may have learning disabilities. Children with Dandy-Walker malformation often have delayed development, particularly a delay in motor skills such as crawling, walking, and coordinating movements. People with Dandy-Walker malformation may experience muscle stiffness and partial paralysis of the lower limbs (spastic paraplegia), and they may also have seizures. While rare, hearing and vision problems can be features of this condition.|$|E

Abstract <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a congenital defect of a central nervous system characterized by a hindered flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the outflow holes of ventricle IV. Symptoms of the disease can develop slowly since the early childhood and will result in developing both hydrocephalus and anomalies related to the structure of the cerebellum.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDandy–Walker {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disorder characterised by complete or partial agenesis of the vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle and an enlarged posterior fossa. The precise aetiology is unknown, {{although there have been}} reports of associations with risk factors like maternal virus infections (rubella, toxoplasma, and cytomegalovirus) and alcohol consumption. The reported incidence varies between one per 2500 births to one per 100, 000 births. This huge difference {{may be due to the}} limited published case series, as most of the available data are sporadic case reports or series. MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of medical records of neonates with <b>Dandy–Walker</b> <b>syndrome</b> admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital between January 2001 and December 2010. ResultsEight infants with <b>Dandy–Walker</b> <b>syndrome</b> were admitted during the study period, giving an overall incidence of 1 / 400 live births. The female-to-male ratio was 1. 7 : 1 (one infant had ambiguous gender but was later found to be male). The mean gestational age was 39. 0 weeks (range, 36 – 40 weeks), and the mean birth weight was 2716 g (range, 1965 – 3335  g). The syndrome was diagnosed in half the infants prenatally. All infants had associated hydrocephalus, and five had other neurological anomalies; extra-cranial anomalies were seen in 50 % of infants. All infants survived to discharge.

40|$|<b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (DWS) is an intrauterine {{developmental}} anomaly, {{which consists}} of 4 - 12 % of all infants having hydrocephalus its prevalence is 1 / 30000 in all live births [1, 2]. Cranio-facial anomalies such as cleft lip and palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism, together with cardiac and renal anomalies, limb anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly, etc.) and vertebral anomalies can all be detected in patients with DWS. They may have to undergo a single operation or a series of operations during their childhood period, related to these anomalies. Additionally, these patients may present with features of a difficult airway, together with neurological disorders such as increased intracranial pressure and brain stem dysfunction.

We report a 23 -year-old woman who presented mild limitation of the ocular movements with progressive palpebral ptosis, which changed in intensity during the day. The investigation showed negative anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody, repetitive nerve stimulation and “Tensilon test”, but the brain magnetic resonance image reveals DWS with hydrocephalus associated with calosal dysgenesis. The characteristic of disease, clinical manifes-tations and pathologic features, specially the clinical evaluation of ocular abnormalities in suspicion of DWS, including the MG in differential diagnosis are discussed.
