50|$|The <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Miescher</b> Award is Switzerland's {{highest honor}} for up-and-coming {{biochemical}} researchers. The award is granted every {{year by the}} Swiss Society for Biochemistry to the best scientific contribution in this field.

25|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Miescher</b> in 1869. Its molecular structure was identified by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Rosalind Franklin.|$|R
25|$|Genetic code is cracked. DNA was {{discovered}} by <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Miescher</b> in 1868, recognized as the bearer of genetic information in 1943 and revealed as a double helix by Rosalind Franklin in 1952. This leads to radical revision of the higher taxonomy of the Insecta.|$|R

2500|$|The {{organism}} {{was first}} recognised in a mouse by Miescher in 1843. His findings were not recognised as a protist initially and the literature {{referred to the}} structures he described as [...] "Miescher's Tubules". Incidentally Miescher's son — Johann <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Miescher</b> — discovered DNA. Similar structures were found in pig muscle in 1865 but these remained unnamed until 1899 when the name Sarcocystis meischeriana was proposed to identify them.|$|R
