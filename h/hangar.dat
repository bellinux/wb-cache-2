5|$|<b>Hangar</b> 2 is {{a double}} Type T2 <b>hangar,</b> erected in the 1970s. It {{occupies}} {{the site of a}} T2 <b>hangar</b> erected in the 1950s. It accommodates the flyable aircraft of Duxford's private aviation companies, such as The Fighter Collection, and allows visitors to see aircraft undergoing maintenance or restoration.|$|E
5|$|At the Singapore Airshow in February 2016, Airbus Group {{presented}} Air-Cobot {{and its use}} in {{its vision}} of the <b>hangar</b> of the future. The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed <b>hangar</b> where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the <b>hangar,</b> cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, {{such as the one}} of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, such as the one of the Aircam project, carry out more detailed inspections.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hangar</b> 5, the westernmost {{original}} <b>hangar,</b> houses Duxford's aircraft conservation workshops. Open to the public, the <b>hangar</b> allows {{visitors to}} see museum staff and volunteers {{at work on}} a variety of conservation tasks. Notable projects include a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter acquired from an American owner in 'jungle recovery' condition, and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 now on display in AirSpace. Duxford is a partner with the British Aviation Preservation Council in the National Aviation Heritage Skills Initiative, which has been funded since 2005 by the Heritage Lottery Fund and aims to provide training to volunteers supporting aviation heritage projects.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was equipped}} with one aircraft repair shed and three double bay general service sheds, although these had been demolished by 1937. It had two Belfast <b>hangars,</b> three C Type <b>hangars,</b> three Bellman <b>hangars</b> and ten Blister <b>hangars.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{construction}} of <b>hangars</b> 3,4,8 and 9, to an Australianised RAF Type A 1917 design, were begun by contractor TH Dennis, but in April construction work ceased and the <b>hangars</b> were relocated to Charleville. This situation changed quickly, and the <b>hangars</b> were relocated back to Eagle Farm from circa November 1942, to eventually double {{the length of}} <b>hangars</b> 1 and 2, and create <b>hangars</b> 3 and 3A (work was still being carried out in January 1944).|$|R
50|$|Just {{outside the}} town lie the Cardington airship <b>hangars.</b> The <b>hangars</b> {{have been used to}} shoot scenes for movies such as Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and Inception. The <b>hangars</b> {{can be seen from the}} Bedford Bypass.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch <b>Hangar.</b> At the time, {{it was the largest}} monolithic arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of the <b>hangar</b> was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary {{investigators}} into the crash of Flight 2511. The wreckage of the DC-6 {{was taken to a}} <b>hangar</b> at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington <b>hangar.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{of early}} 2009, four naval <b>hangars</b> still survive in use for non-aviation purposes, and {{were used by}} the Merseyside Transport Trust, from the late 1970s until January 2012, when the charity moved to new {{premises}} within the industrial estate. The four <b>hangars</b> now stand empty and unused. These four <b>hangars</b> include 'Pentad' type <b>hangars,</b> and are located on {{the western edge of}} the old airfield.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the operational construction, Dreux had three large 37000 sq ft. transport size <b>hangars,</b> and two fighter size <b>hangars</b> that were 31000 sq ft. each. The larger <b>hangars</b> provided the space and necessary shops to accommodate two C-119 [...] "Flying Boxcar" [...] cargo planes for periodic inspections. These <b>hangars</b> could also accommodate two C-130 aircraft. Warehouse storage at Dreux consisted of four million cubic feet serviced by two railroad sidings.|$|R
5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's <b>hangar</b> at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the <b>hangar,</b> which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the <b>hangar</b> would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, <b>hangar</b> in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted {{at the rear of the}} <b>hangar</b> to hoist the seaplanes in and out of the water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to many {{facilities}} that {{were a part of}} the base, or were nearby. Caribou Air Force Station was the weapons storage area that operated separately from Loring until it was absorbed in 1961. Caswell Air Force Station operated to the east, but had a unit associated with Loring before it became fully operational. On-base facilities included the Alert Area, which operated as a separate facility within Loring, due to crews being constantly stationed on alert. The Double Cantilever <b>Hangar</b> was the largest <b>hangar</b> at the facility, with the capacity to hold six parked B-52s, or five B-36s.|$|E
500|$|The runway was resurfaced in 1955 in {{anticipation}} of the arrival of the B-52 Stratofortress in 1956. Eighteen additional [...] "nose-dock" [...] <b>hangars</b> (<b>hangars</b> which could contain the nose and wings of the aircraft, allowing for maintenance to the cockpit area by the crew, without the need to use the larger <b>hangars)</b> were built in 1956 to the northwest of the runway, near the main parking area, along with parking areas and taxiways for these <b>hangars.</b>|$|R
25|$|Three <b>hangars</b> were {{originally}} constructed, {{and these were}} supplemented by two additional <b>hangars</b> constructed {{on the other side}} of the main A1079 road.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{remarkable}} <b>hangars</b> on the airfield, {{constructed in}} 1947. Looking more like silos, {{they are in}} fact round <b>hangars</b> made of concrete.|$|R
5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new <b>hangar</b> decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the <b>hangar</b> decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's <b>hangar</b> and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed <b>hangar.</b> On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider <b>hangar</b> design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the <b>hangar.</b> On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier USS Ticonderoga delivered the Apollo 16 Command Module to the North Island Naval Air Station, near San Diego, California, on Friday, May 5, 1972. On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment {{being used to}} empty the residual toxic reaction control system fuel in the Command Module tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station <b>hangar.</b> Forty-six people {{were sent to the}} hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him. A hole was blown in the <b>hangar</b> roof 250 feet above; about 40 windows in the <b>hangar</b> were shattered. The Command Module suffered a three-inch gash in one panel.|$|E
50|$|The {{plan called}} for several new bases, with a major {{development}} at Ohakea, which would be home to 30 Wellington bombers on order for the RNZAF. Two large <b>hangars</b> (now <b>hangars</b> 2 and 3) were authorised to house the aircraft, to be designed by the Department of Public Works chief design engineer Charles Turner. Turner decided to build the <b>hangars</b> as monolithic reinforced concrete structures because structural steel {{could not be obtained}} in sufficient quantities without delays, while concrete and reinforcing steel could be delivered immediately. The same limitation forced Turner to adopt concrete doors. The arched <b>hangars</b> spanned 61 metres, with a height of 18 metres. The expense of the steel centering was spread across four <b>hangars,</b> as another two similar structures were ordered for RNZAF Base Auckland.The two Ohakea <b>hangars</b> were completed in 1939, {{at a cost of about}} £76,750 each.|$|R
50|$|For {{a period}} of time the old station {{operated}} as the Vulcan Industrial Airport. Although the runways still exist, the aerodrome has seen many aircraft since the war. Six of the original seven <b>hangars</b> remain standing. The remaining <b>hangars</b> are used for storage and for private industrial purposes.Three of the building owners are working to restore their <b>hangars.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1989, he {{advocated}} {{for the preservation}} of Rockcliffe Airport <b>hangars.</b> Earlier in his career he had designed <b>hangars</b> for Canada's air force, and for Trans-Canada Air Lines.|$|R
5|$|Aircraft could undergo maintenance, {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - {{either in the}} <b>hangar</b> or on the deck. Some components and could be repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.|$|E
5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a <b>hangar</b> at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination <b>hangar.</b> Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E
5|$|By 1918 the two {{surviving}} Invincibles {{carried a}} Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on flying-off ramps fitted {{on top of}} 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Each platform had a canvas <b>hangar</b> to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.|$|E

It is expected that the lounge works will be done by end of March 2008. The transformation plans also calls for a construction of two 42 meters by 47 meters maintenance, repair and overhaul <b>hangars</b> and ten 36-meter by 36-meter parking <b>hangars.</b> The construction of the MRO <b>hangars</b> will complete by end of 2008 while two of the ten parking <b>hangars</b> will complete by end of 2009.|$|R
50|$|The {{coming of}} the {{armistice}} on 11 November 1918 ended the formal training program at the school. By then facilities included 10 Cathedral <b>hangars,</b> 17 steel <b>hangars,</b> 4 Bressenau <b>hangars</b> and 18 single-plane canvas <b>hangars.</b> Aircraft included 9 Caudrons, 10 Niewports, 12 Salmsons, 43 Breguets, 47 De Haviland 4s, 25 Sopwiths, and 4 Spad XIIIs. A support station of 50 buildings, schools, barracks, and other buildings had been erected. Students in training were given opportunity to complete their training, but no new students were accepted. All student training was completed by 31 December.|$|R
