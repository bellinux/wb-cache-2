25|$|Easements {{are most}} often created by express {{language}} in binding documents. Parties generally grant an easement to another, or reserve an <b>easement</b> <b>for</b> themselves. Under most circumstances {{having a conversation with}} another party is not sufficient. Courts have also recognized creation of easements in other ways.|$|R
5000|$|Equitable {{easements}} {{have the}} same basic requirements as easements at law concerning their subject matter. Easements are recognised as arising in equity {{in at least three}} circumstances. The first is where section 1(2)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, requiring an easement to be [...] "absolute in possession or a term of years absolute", renders an easement incapable of existing as an interest at law. This includes <b>easements</b> <b>for</b> periods of uncertain duration, such as those ending when a particular event happens (the passing of planning permission over one of the tenements, for example). More controversially this category also includes <b>easements</b> <b>for</b> life, similarly incapable of existing at law. Although the topic has not arisen in the courts since at least 1925, it is difficult to show that as <b>easement</b> <b>for</b> life accommodated the dominant tenement, since it is inherently personal in nature. Rights purporting to be <b>easements</b> <b>for</b> life would, if they were rejected as easements, be licences instead and take effect through contract. The second category involves those cases where an specifically enforceable contract to create an easement has taken effect but the easement has not been granted. Here, the regular principles of equity will operate to bring about an easement, since [...] "equity regards as done those things which ought to be done". The third category is where the grantor holds only an equitable interest himself. The most common occasion where this will happen is where an easement is created by operation of a testamentary disposition. Where there is a will, legal title vests in the executors of the estate until transferred to the deceased's personal representatives, but any devised interests operate at equity from the time of disposition.|$|R
