In order to determine <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> parameters, satellite observations by radar and lidar instruments will be combined with in situ measurements of the cloud-capped marine boundary layer.

These albedos are then combined with measured albedo data to solve for the monthly and zonally averaged <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> The measured albedo data were obtained from the wide field of view channels of the Nimbus 6 Earth Radiation Budget experiment, and consequently the <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> results are representative of the local sampling times.

In this work, a subset of AMSR-E and AMSR- 2 Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) data set retrieved from the archive of the Institute of Environmental Physics (IEP) of the University of Bremen, is investigated in order to assess the variability and a possible significant trend of sea ice area over the East Greenland Sea during the period 2003 – 2013. The target area goes, approximately, from 60 to 85 N and from 45 W to 20 E. The analysis sho ws that the strong decline of Arctic sea-ice extent in the last 10 years is not observed in the Greenland Sea, suggesting that large reductions have occurred in the Canadian and Russian Arctic. Similar preliminary investigations over West Greenland Sea and Bering Sea are being carried out. Besides, for approximately the same period and target area, ATOVS tropospheric humidity and temperature fields and AVHRR <b>fractional</b> <b>clouds</b> <b>cover</b> (CFC) datasets have been collected from the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM-SAF), to perform and analyze the correlation with sea ice area.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the three <b>cloud</b> products <b>cloud</b> <b>fractional</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>cloud</b> type and cloud top height, derived from NOAA AVHRR data and produced by the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility, has been evaluated in detail over the Arctic region for four months in 2007 using CALIPSO-CALIOP observations. The evaluation was based on 142 selected NOAA/Metop overpasses allowing almost 400 000 individual matchups between AVHRR pixels and CALIOP measurements distributed approximately equally over the studied months (June, July, August and December 2007). Results suggest that estimations of cloud amounts are very accurate during the polar summer season while a substantial loss of detected clouds occurs in the polar winter. Evaluation results for cloud type and cloud top products point at specific problems related {{to the existence of}} near isothermal conditions in the lower troposphere in the polar summer and the use of reference vertical temperature profiles from Numerical Weather Prediction model analyses. The latter are currently not detailed enough in describing true conditions relevant on the pixel scale. This concerns especially the description of near-surface temperature inversions which are often too weak leading to large errors in interpreted cloud top heights...|$|R

This assumption is examined using a partly cloudy pixel retrieval scheme, which allows for <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> within the 1 -km pixels. Cloud flags attached to 250 -m MODIS imagery data were aggregated to 1 -km resolution to compare with <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> retrieved using the partly cloudy pixel scheme. For regions containing only single-layered, low-level marine stratocumulus, the <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> derived from the 250 -m flags was substantially greater than that obtained with the partly cloudy pixel retrievals. When 1 -km visible reflectances and 11 -µm radiances were interpreted according to the pixel-scale cloud cover fraction, the interpretations obtained with the partly cloudy pixel retrieval scheme were those expected based on radiative transfer theory. Those obtained from the 250 -m flags, however, suggested that many of the 1 -km pixels that were identified as overcast were only partially cloud covered.

40|$|The {{results of}} a new {{multispectral}} infrared retrieval scheme for obtaining <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and 11 micrometer emissivity {{with those of the}} spatial coherence method which obtains <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> assuming that the clouds are opaque at infrared wavelengths. Both methods are applied to 4 -km NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer global area coverage data for 250 -km-scale regions containing single-layered marine stratocumulus off the coast of South America. The average 11 micrometer emissivity for low level clouds is found to be between 0. 70 and 0. 85. The low emissivity is evidently due to the thinning of clouds at their edges. Semitransparent cloud edges evidently make up {{a substantial portion of the}} area covered by such clouds. This result indicates that cloud cover obtained using the spatial coherence method is underestimated by 0. 1 to 0. 2, as has been claimed in a previous study. The <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> for the ensemble of 250 -km-scale regions studied here increased slightly from 0. 60 for daytime observations to 0. 63 for nighttime observations. The 11 micrometer emissivity also increased slightly, but about half of the increase was related to the increase in cloud cover and a decrease in the relative area covered by cloud edge material. Presumably, the other half was due to an increase in cloud liquid water. Cloud height showed no significant change. The average effective droplet radius increased from 9. 3 micrometers for daytime observations to 10. 2 micrometers at night...|$|E
40|$|In {{this case}} study we compare <b>cloud</b> <b>fractional</b> <b>cover</b> {{measured}} by radiometers on polar satellites (AVHRR) and on one geostationary satellite (SEVIRI) to ground-based manual (SYNOP) and automated observations by a cloud camera (Hemispherical Sky Imager, HSI). These observations took place in Hannover, Germany, and in Lauder, New Zealand, over time frames of 3 and 2 months, respectively. Daily mean comparisons between satellite derivations and the ground-based HSI found the deviation to be 6 ± 14 % for AVHRR and 8 ± 16 % for SEVIRI, which can be considered satisfactory. AVHRR's instantaneous differences are smaller (2 ± 22 %) than instantaneous SEVIRI cloud fraction estimates (8 ± 29 %) when compared to HSI due to resolution and scenery effect issues. All spaceborne observations show a very good skill in detecting completely overcast skies (<b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> ≥ 6 oktas) with probabilities between 92 and 94 % and false alarm rates between 21 and 29 % for AVHRR and SEVIRI in Hannover, Germany. In {{the case of a}} clear sky (<b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> lower than 3 oktas) we find good skill with detection probabilities between 72 and 76 %. We find poor skill, however, whenever broken clouds occur (probability of detection is 32 % for AVHRR and 12 % for SEVIRI in Hannover, Germany). In order to better understand these discrepancies we analyze the influence of algorithm features on the satellite-based data. We find that the differences between SEVIRI and HSI <b>cloud</b> <b>fractional</b> <b>cover</b> (CFC) decrease (from a bias of 8 to almost 0 %) with decreasing number of spatially averaged pixels and decreasing index which determines the cloud coverage in each "cloud-contaminated" pixel of the binary map. We conclude that window size and index need to be adjusted in order to improve instantaneous SEVIRI and AVHRR estimates. Due to its automated operation and its spatial, temporal and spectral resolution, we recommend as well that more automated ground-based instruments in the form of cloud cameras should be installed as they cover larger areas of the sky than other automated ground-based instruments. These cameras could be an essential supplement to SYNOP observation as they cover the same spectral wavelengths as the human eye...|$|R

A marked influence of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> on UV irradiance is evident, but negligible for <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> coverage below 3 octas. The ratio of UV irradiance to the total solar irradiance increases with <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> especially for <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> greater than 4 octas, highlighting the different effects of cloud on total solar irradiance and UV irradiance. In {{order to determine the}} effect of cloud on UV irradiance, we considered a cloud modification factor, defined as the ratio between the UV measurements and the corresponding clear sky UV irradiance that would be expected for the same time period and atmospheric conditions. It is shown that the effect of cloud for UV wavelengths is less than that for the whole solar spectrum and less than that for the visible part of the spectrum. On the other hand, the small influence of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> for intermediate cloudiness was accompanied by low variability and variability increases with increasing <b>cloud</b> <b>cover...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer 4 -km {{data were}} {{collected}} over the northeast Atlantic for May-August, 1995 - 1999. Aerosol optical depth was retrieved in cloud-free pixels. In pixels containing clouds from only single-layered, low-level systems, a retrieval scheme that accounts for partly-cloudy pixels was used to retrieve: cloud optical depth, droplet effective radius, cloud altitude, pixel-scale <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> liquid water path and column droplet concentration. Mean aerosol optical depths from 1 ° x 1 ° latitude-longitude regions were associated with mean cloud properties in the same region for the same satellite overpass. Results were composited for 5 ° latitude-longitude regions. As aerosol optical depth increased, droplet radius decreased and column droplet number concentration and cloud optical depth increased, consistent with the aerosol indirect effect. In many regions, liquid water path decreased as aerosol optical depth increased, contrary to the trends expected for drizzle suppression. The simultaneous increase in aerosol and cloud optical depths with increasing <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> might be mistaken for the aerosol indirect effect. The five-year data set was sorted into clean and polluted cases. Clouds in clean air had larger droplets and smaller cloud optical depths than clouds in polluted air, consistent with the aerosol indirect effect. Liquid water path increased as <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> increased but no difference was found between clouds in clean and polluted air. Influences other than changes in aerosol burden may be controlling changes in liquid water. Observed changes in aerosol and cloud properties were used to estimate the aerosol indirect radiative forcing. Aerosol indirect forcing for overcast conditions was 1. 4 - 2. 2 {{times larger than the}} aerosol direct radiative forcing for cloud-free conditions. To simulate threshold retrievals, which do not account for partial cloud cover in partly-cloudy pixels, radiances in pixels that had a <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> greater than 0. 20 were used to recalculate cloud properties assuming the pixel was overcast. The decrease in droplet radii and increase in cloud optical depths for a given change in aerosol optical depth were larger using threshold retrievals than when using partly-cloudy retrievals. Threshold retrievals lead to a significant overestimation of the aerosol indirect radiative forcing...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple way}} to {{diagnose}} <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> in general circulation models is to relate it to the simulated relative humidity, and allowing for <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> above a “critical relative humidity” of less than 100 %. In the formulation chosen here, this is equivalent to assuming a uniform “top-hat” distribution of subgrid-scale total water content with a variance related to saturation. Critical relative humidity has frequently been treated as a “tunable” constant, yet it is an observable. Here, this parameter, and its spatial distribution, is examined from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) satellite retrievals, and {{from a combination of}} relative humidity from the ECMWF Re-Analyses (ERA-Interim) and cloud fraction obtained from CALIPSO lidar satellite data. These observational data are used to evaluate results from different simulations with the ECHAM general circulation model (GCM).

The forecast quality of two sets of hindcasts, Baseline- 1 -LR and Baseline- 0, which use differing initialisations, is assessed. Basic evaluation focuses on multi-year ensemble mean fields and cloud-type histograms utilizing satellite simulator output. Additionally, ensemble evaluation employing analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis rank histograms (ARH) and a deterministic correlation score is performed. Satellite simulator output is available for {{a subset of the}} full hindcast ensembles only. Therefore, the raw model <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> is complementary used. The new Baseline- 1 -LR hindcasts are closer to satellite data with respect to the simulated tropical/subtropical mean <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> pattern than the reference hindcasts (Baseline- 0) emphasizing improvements of the new MiKlip initialisation procedure. A slightly overestimated occurrence rate of optically thick cloud-types is analysed for different experiments including hindcasts and simulations using realistic sea surface boundaries according to the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). By contrast, the evaluation of cirrus and cirrostratus clouds is complicated by observational based uncertainties.

This assumption is examined using a partly cloudy pixel retrieval scheme, which allows for <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> within the 1 -km pixels. Cloud flags attached to 250 -m MODIS imagery data were aggregated to 1 -km resolution to compare with <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> retrieved using the partly cloudy pixel scheme. For regions containing only single-layered, low-level marine stratocumulus, the <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> derived from the 250 -m flags was substantially greater than that obtained with the partly cloudy pixel retrievals. When 1 -km visible reflectances and 11 -μm radiances were interpreted according to the pixel-scale cloud cover fraction, the interpretations obtained with the partly cloudy pixel retrieval scheme were those expected based on radiative transfer theory. Those obtained from the 250 -m flags, however, suggested that many of the 1 -km pixels that were identified as overcast were only partially cloud covered. These findings were confirmed using 500 -m MODIS imagery to identify pixels that were overcast by marine stratocumulus. Based on the spatial uniformity of 1. 6 - and 2. 1 -μm reflectances for overcast and cloud-free pixels, reflectances at these wavelengths were used to distinguish between overcast and partly cloudy 500 -m pixels. The 250 -m cloud flags obtained from the MOD 06 cloud product, however, identified many of the partly cloudy pixels as overcast. The overcast assumption made by the MOD 06 cloud product also leads to biases in cloud properties such as cloud optical depth and droplet effective radius. Comparisons of cloud layer temperature, optical depth, and droplet effective radius derived from 2. 1 -μm reflectances show that overcast results agree with what is expected from cloud parcel models. Pixels with partial cloud cover, however, underestimate optical depth and overestimate droplet effective radius and the biases produce trends that counter expectations based on cloud parcel models. These biases become more evident as cloud cover within a pixel decreases...|$|E

40|$|Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 4 -km data {{collected}} over the northeastern Atlantic {{off the coast}} of the Iberian Peninsula for May to August 1995 were used to investigate the feasibility of empirically deriving estimates of the aerosol indirect radiative forcing. A retrieval scheme was used to derive cloud visible optical depth, droplet effective radius, cloud layer altitude, and pixel-scale <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> A two-channel aerosol retrieval scheme was used to determine aerosol optical depth in cloud-free pixels. Mean aerosol optical depths derived from the cloud-free pixels in 1 º x 1 º latitude-longitude regions on a given satellite overpass were associated with mean cloud properties derived from the cloudy pixels in the same region for the same satellite overpass. The analysis was restricted to 1 º regions that contained only singlelayered, low-level cloud systems. Because aerosol and cloud properties are highly variable, results for the 4 -month period were composited into 5 º x 5 º latitude-longitude regions and averaged to obtain reliable trends in the cloud properties as functions of aerosol burden. Consistent with expectations for the aerosol indirect effect, in some 5 º regions, droplet effective radii decreased, and cloud visible optical depths increased as aerosol optical depths increased. The hypothesis that drizzle is suppressed in polluted clouds predicts that liquid water path should increase as aerosol burden increases. In three of the thirteen 5 º regions studied, the liquid water path increased as aerosol optical depth increased, but in none of the regions was the increase in cloud liquid water statistically significant. In the remaining regions, cloud liquid water remained constant or even decreased with increasing aerosol optical depth. In many of the 5 º regions, the retrieved aerosol optical depth increased as the percentage of cloudy pixels increased. Consistent with expectations from adiabatic cloud parcel models, droplet effective radius, cloud optical depth, and cloud liquid water path also increased as <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> increased. The simultaneous increase in retrieved aerosol and cloud optical depths with increasing <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> might have been due to the aerosol indirect effect, but it might also have resulted from processes that affect both the cloud and aerosol properties as cloud cover changes. The dependence on <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> suggests that some of the trends between aerosol optical depth and the cloud properties cannot be solely attributed to the effects of the aerosols. For comparison with previous studies, the simultaneous changes in aerosol and cloud properties were used to estimate the daily average aerosol indirect forcing for overcast conditions in the summertime northeastern Atlantic.

40|$|Remote sensing can {{potentially}} provide information useful in improving pollution transport modelling in agricultural catchments. Realisation of this potential {{will depend on}} the availability of the raw data, development of information extraction techniques, and the impact of the assimilation of the derived information into models. High spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery of a farm near Hereford, UK is analysed. A technique is described to automatically identify the soil and vegetation endmembers within a field, enabling vegetation fractional cover estimation. The aerially-acquired laser altimetry is used to produce digital elevation models of the site. At the subfield scale the hypothesis that higher resolution topography will make a substantial difference to contaminant transport is tested using the AGricultural Non-Point Source (AGNPS) model. Slope aspect and direction information are extracted from the topography at different resolutions to study the effects on soil erosion, deposition, runoff and nutrient losses. Field-scale models are often used to model drainage water, nitrate and runoff/sediment loss, but the demanding input data requirements make scaling up to catchment level difficult. By determining the input range of spatial variables gathered from EO data, and comparing the response of models to the range of variation measured, the critical model inputs can be identified. Response surfaces to variation in these inputs constrain uncertainty in model predictions and are presented. Although optical earth observation analysis can provide <b>fractional</b> vegetation <b>cover,</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and semi-random weather patterns can hinder data acquisition in Northern Europe.

Aerosol effect on decreasing <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> in China appear not to be supported by this analysis and therefore, further study on this issue is required...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{activity}} is to help students better understand percent <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and to take more accurate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> observations. Working in pairs or small groups, students use construction paper to simulate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> They estimate the percentage of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> represented by torn pieces of paper on a contrasting background and assign a <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> classification to the simulations created by their classmates. Intended outcomes are that students will understand the difficulties of visually estimating the percentage of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and gain experience estimating <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> evaluating the accuracy of estimates, and using fractions and percentages.

40|$|A {{computer}} automated {{data acquisition}} system for atmospheric emittance, and global solar, downwelled diffuse solar, and direct solar irradiances is discussed. Hourly-integrated global solar and atmospheric emitted radiances were measured continuously from February 1981 and hourly-integrated diffuse solar and direct solar irradiances were measured continuously from October 1981. One-minute integrated data are available {{for each of these}} components from February 1982. The results of the correlation of global insolation with <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> for the first year's data set. A February data set, composed of one-minute integrated global insolation and direct solar irradiance, cloud cover fractions, meteorological data from nearby weather stations, and GOES East satellite radiometric data, was collected to test the theoretical model of satellite radiometric data correlation and develop the cloud dependence for the local measurement site...|$|E
40|$|It {{is nearly}} universally {{assumed that the}} {{relationship}} between <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and radiant exitance is linear. There seems to be, however, little quantitative justification for this assumption, and recent work appears to cast considerable doubt even on this assumption. The reported investigation reinforces this doubt. It is found that the radiation field over three-dimensional broken clouds may differ markedly from that over two-dimensional fields. Including the thickness of the clouds appears to be equivalent to increasing the cloud cover. Broken clouds with finite thicknesses are found to be more effective at influencing radiation than are infinitely thin clouds of finite optical depth. Attention is given to the effect of the geometric arrangement of cloud fields. It is pointed out that this arrangement can cause substantial deviations from the often used linear relationship...|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{retrieval}} of cloud properties appropriate for trace gas retrieval from sun-normalized UV/VIS backscatter spectra obtained from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on-board ERS- 2. A data fusion technique is applied to calculate the <b>fractional</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> of GOME footprints from GOME’s Polarization Measurement Devices (PMDs). Furthermore, cloudtop albedo and cloud-top height are retrieved simultaneously from GOME measurements around the oxygen A-band by a neural network approach. We compare the operationally derived GOME results with corresponding results from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) radiometer on-board the first EUMET-SAT METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG- 1) geostationary spacecraft. Finally we present the latest development of the GOME cloud retrieval algorithms, including the initial results obtained with GOME- 2 /MetOp {{in the framework of}} EUMETSAT’s Satellite Application Facilit...|$|E

According to the invention, the following successive steps are performed in each control phase: a) observing the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> above the solar tracker (1); b) comparing the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> observed with <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> models stored in a database, each <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> model being associated with an orientation set point value for the solar tracker; c) matching the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> observed with a <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> model; and d) controlling {{the orientation of the}} solar tracker by applying the orientation set point value to the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> model selected in step c).

40|$|Using daily {{measurement}} {{of day and}} night infrared and incoming and absorbed solar radiation obtained from a TIROS satellite {{over a period of}} approximately 45 months, and integrated over 2. 5 degree latitude-longitude grids, the proportion of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> over each grid each day was derived for the entire period. For each of four three-month periods, estimates a and b of the two parameters of the best-fit beta distribution were obtained for each grid location. The (a,b) plane was divided into a number of regions. All the geographical locations whose (a,b) estimates were in the same region in the (a,b) plane were said to have the same <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> type for that season. For each season, the world was thus divided into separate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> types. Using estimates of mean <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> for each season, the world was again divided into separate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> types. The process was repeated for standard deviations. Thus for each season, three separate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> models were obtained using the criteria of shape of frequency distribution, mean <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> and variability of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> The <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> statistics were derived from once-a-day, near-local-noon satellite radiation measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversial}} {{connection between}} cosmic rays, solar activity, and <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> is investigated using a climatological reconstructed reanalysis product: the North American Regional Reanalysis which provides high-resolution, low, mid-level, high, and total <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> data over a Lambert conformal conic projection permitting land/ocean discrimination. Pearson’s product-moment regional correlations were obtained between monthly <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> data and solar variability indicators, cosmic ray neutron monitors, several climatological indices, including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and between cloud layers. Regions of the mid-latitude oceans exhibited {{a positive correlation}} with cosmic ray flux. Additionally, this maritime low <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> exhibits the only failed correlation significance with other altitudes. The cross correlation reveals that <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> is positively correlated everywhere but for ocean low <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> supporting the unique response of the marine layer. The results of this investigation suggest that {{with the assumption that}} solar forcing does impact <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> measurements of solar activity exhibits a slightly higher correlation than GCRs. The only instance where GCRs exhibit a positive regional correlation with <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> is for maritime low clouds.
