5|$|In 68 AD,, Nero's {{successor}} Galba, despite public feeling, rewarded Halotus with a procuratorship. Galba {{ordered an}} edict relating to Tigellinus, another servant who had possibly been involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Claudius and whose death was also being called for among the Romans, rebuking {{the public for}} their harshness and outrage.|$|E

5|$|Bo was {{considered}} a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012. His political fortunes {{came to an abrupt}} end following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu.

He initially worked in the party's insurance service, and transferred in July 1933 {{to the office of}} Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, where he served as chief of staff.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals had {{played a role in the}} killing of Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E
5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} was made {{necessary to support}} regular police forces in their fight against <b>the</b> organized crime <b>in</b> Sicily, primarily targeting the Cosa Nostra and Stidda Crime syndicates, after the tragic series of event that bloodied Sicily {{until the beginning of}} the nineties, culminating on May 23, 1992, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> <b>of</b> Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and their police body guards, and on 19 July 1992 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> <b>of</b> Judge Paolo Borsellino and his police body guards.|$|R

5|$|Halotus died {{close to}} the end of the century, his public {{reputation}} somewhat restored after his rise in stature and wealth. His date of death is not mentioned by ancient historians of the time, such as Tacitus or Suetonius, who were also some of the main recorders of the events around Claudius' death and the political trauma that followed. Whether Halotus was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Claudius and to what extent remains an unresolved point, as do many other aspects related to Claudius' passing.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), particularly his wife Mindy (Jaime Ray Newman) and her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|James was {{the only}} son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Both Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of Henry VII of England through Margaret Tudor, the older sister of Henry VIII. Mary's rule over Scotland was insecure, {{and she and her}} husband, being Roman Catholics, faced a {{rebellion}} by Protestant noblemen. During Mary's and Darnley's difficult marriage, Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's private secretary, David Rizzio, just three months before James's birth.|$|E

5|$|Local officials, the Selbstschutz, and the Hilfspolizei (Auxiliary Police) {{played a}} key role in {{rounding}} up and massacring Jewish Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. These groups helped the Einsatzgruppen and other killing units to quickly identify Jews. The Hilfspolizei, consisting of auxiliary police organised by the Germans and recruited from former Latvian Army and police officers, ex-Aizsargi, members of the Pērkonkrusts, and university students, assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Latvia's Jewish citizens. Similar units were created elsewhere, and provided much of the manpower for the Holocaust in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' predecessor, Caracalla, {{was murdered}} by a disaffected soldier during a {{campaign}} against Parthia on 8 April 217. Macrinus himself {{may have had a}} hand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla. Within days of Caracalla's death, Macrinus was proclaimed emperor {{with the support of the}} army. At the time of his accession he inherited all of the problems that Caracalla had left for Rome—war against Parthia, threats from Armenia and Dacia, and extensive fiscal expenditures. Macrinus successfully concluded a peace with Parthia, but it came at considerable cost to Rome. Finally, his policies to reduce monetary expenditures only stoked discontent within the military.|$|E
5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as {{an expert on the}} American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> NYPD officer Ralph Dols.|$|E

5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Meredith Kercher.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 24 May 1984, Buendía left his office in Mexico City and was walking to his car when a man shot him from behind several times, killing him on the scene. For over five years, the murder case remained unsolved and with several irregularities, including the loss of evidence. In 1989, {{several members of the}} extinct Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's top police force, were arrested for their involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Buendía. The murder case was closed after the perpetrators were arrested, but several journalists doubt the probe's results and believe that the masterminds behind Buendía's murder were never arrested.|$|E
