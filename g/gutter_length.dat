40|$|A Semi-Automatic Building Extraction system {{using two}} or more {{digitized}} overlapping aerial images has been enhanced by increased automation for the measurement of saddle-back-roof buildings, hip-roof buildings and boxes. All newly developed modules have been incorporated in the object oriented design of the system. The new methods consist of a ground-point and roof-top matching tool and a robust determination of shape parameters, like e. g. <b>gutter</b> <b>length</b> and width. The current performance of building extraction is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. We examine the increased efficiency using the automated tools, the success rate of individual modules and the overall success rate {{using a combination of}} methods. A methodology for quantitative comparison is tested on footprints of buildings from classical stereo measurements and from semi-automatic measurements. A qualitative comparison in 3 D of multiple measurements of complete buildings is performed on three different datasets. 1 [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout Europe, roof {{areas are}} {{commonly}} drained using a conventional gutter and downspout system. These are usually large in volume {{and have the}} capacity to discharge rainwater at high rates of flow. There is now increased awareness of syphonic roof drainage systems. Historically, the definitive method for the design of gutters within the United Kingdom is BS 6367 : 1983 British Code of Practice for the Drainage of Roofs and Paved Areas. This publication clearly sets out the theoretical model to predict the hydraulic performance of a gutter. In 2000, this Code was superseded by BS EN 12056 - 3 which, shares a common theoretical basis and method of derivation as BS 6367 : 1983. These codes do not specifically address syphonic systems and currently there are no design criteria for such systems. Hence, there is an urgent need for {{a better understanding of the}} hydraulic performance of syphonic systems. This is particularly relevant to systems that are installed in gutters that drain large industrial and commercial buildings. The work reported in the thesis describes a series of experimental investigations that were carried out to improve knowledge and understanding of the way in which syphonic systems perform. Initially the study concentrated on the construction of a full-scale experimental system to test the hydraulic performance of syphonic system outlets located within a 600 mm wide gutter. Tests were completed with single (primary) outlets and primary outlets in combination with independent overflow outlets (secondary outlets). The outlets were positioned at a number of different locations along the length of the gutter and combinations of both primary and secondary outlets were tested. The thesis has concluded that the performance of syphonic rainwater systems is much more complex than conventional roof drainage systems. Specific findings of the study are: • The application of existing theoretical models for the design of conventional rainwater drainage systems should not be transferred to syphonic systems. An additional factor of safety is required within the existing theoretical model. - 11 - • The position of the outlet in the gutter has a significant influence on the depth profile along the <b>gutter</b> <b>length.</b> Outlets located near to the gutter end resulted in an increase in the depth profile of the outlet. • When an independent overflow system (secondary system) was used in conjunction with a number of primary outlets within a common gutter, it was found that the overflow system, dominated the flow profile within the gutter. • A method, based on dispersion of solutes, was developed to determine the actual flow rate through each outlet of a syphonic system. It was shown that the flow rate through each outlet of the system was not the same and that the water level in the gutter was redistributed along the <b>gutter</b> <b>length.</b> This implies that the negative pressure created in syphonic systems is not a limiting factor. These findings have important design implications. • A methodology to calculate the influence on water depth in any gutter and for any outlet position has been established and is recommended as a basis for the improved design of a syphonic system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale experimental {{investigation into the}} effects of box gutter geometry on the open channel flow conditions above siphonic roofwater outlets. In particular, the effects of channel width (300, 400, 480 and 600 mm) and length (14. 86 and 32. 00 m) were investigated through measurements of flow rate, water depth and longitudinal velocity in the box gutter. The experimental results showed that for the same outlet flow rate, the depth {{of water in the}} gutter varied by up to 211 % for the two different <b>gutter</b> <b>lengths</b> tested. Generally, the greatest water depths for the different flow rates were recorded in the 400 -mm wide gutter and the lowest water depths were recorded in the 300 -mm wide gutter. It was also found that the maximum flow rate through the single 110 -mm diameter outlet varied depending on the width of the gutter. Practical application: The depth of water in the open channel box gutters above the outlets of siphonic drainage systems is an important design variable and it is imperative to be able to accurately estimate these water depths during all phases of operation to reduce flood damage risk. This research study has found that for the same flow rate, varying the <b>length</b> of <b>gutter</b> on either side of a siphonic outlet strongly influences the depth of water along the gutter and above the outlet. The results suggest that there may be an optimum <b>gutter</b> width and <b>length</b> for which different siphonic outlets may perform more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRoofing {{materials}} are {{considered as a}} major source of urban runoff contamination. Today, {{in the context of the}} European Water Directive (2000 / 60 CE), an accurate evaluation of contaminant flows from roofs is thus required at the city scale, and therefore the development of assessment tools is needed. However, at the city scale, the important diversity of roofing materials represents a difficult task for the quantification. In fact, the most restrictive step when estimating contaminant flows for large-scale territories is the estimation of the roofing materials surfaces area, for which no direct data exists. This study focuses on describing the method to evaluate <b>gutter</b> and valley <b>lengths</b> at the city scale. The proposed approach relies uses a statistical framework. The city was divided into homogenous urban areas. Then, a stratified random sampling technique was employed. The reliability of the methodology has been proved for three different urban areas (drained by sewer system) with known roofing materials distribution and known <b>gutter</b> and valley <b>lengths.</b> The obtained results show that a sample representing R= 4 % of the urban area leads to an absolute error less than 2 % for <b>gutter</b> and valley <b>length</b> values...|$|R
5000|$|The former Burns Philp {{building}} is a large timber-framed structure elevated on masonry and timber stumps and clad in vertically fixed corrugated iron sheeting.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} study was to examine experimentally the effects of upstream temperature, velocity, <b>gutter</b> blockage, tailpipe <b>length,</b> and main and pilot fuel flows, on the form of combustion instability encountered in aircraft reheat systems which is sometimes referred to as 'buzz'. Tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure for upstream temperatures of between 200 and 500 °C, and upstream velocities ranging from 140 to 200 ft/sec. Three values of stabilizer blockage were employed, namely 25, 30 and 35 %. The tailpipe length was varied between 9 and 45 inches. Auto-correlation techniques were used in the frequency analysis of the buzz waveforms. It was found that a certain minimum tailpipe length is necessary in order to produce buzz which is then strengthened as the tailpipe length is increased. Buzz also becomes more pronounced with an increase in gas velocity but stabilizer blockage appears to have no discernible effect … [cont. ]...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Gutters can be {{described}} as the loss of continuous apposition between {{the main body of the}} endograft, the chimney stent graft, and the aortic wall. Gutters have been associated with increased risk of type IA endoleaks and are considered to be the Achilles' heel of chimney endovascular aneurysm repair (ch-EVAR). However, there is no classification yet to classify and quantify gutter types after ch-EVAR. Methods: Different gutter types can be distinguished by their morphologic appearance in two- and three-dimensional views and reconstructed slices perpendicular to the center lumen line. Results: Three main categories are defined by (1) the most proximal beginning of the <b>gutter,</b> (2) the <b>length</b> of <b>gutter</b> alongside the endograft, and (3) its distal end. Type A gutters originate at the proximal fabric of an endograft, type B gutters originate as loss of apposition of the chimney stent graft in the branch vessel, and type C gutters start below the fabric of the endograft. To determine eventual changes of gutter size during follow-up computed tomography angiograms (CTAs), measurements may be performed with dedicated software on the follow-up CTA scan to assess the extent of gutters over the aortic circumference, ranging from 0 ° to 360 ° of freedom, together with the maximum gap between the endograft material and the aortic wall as it appears on reconstructed axial CTA scan slices. Conclusions: The proposed gutter classification enables a uniform nomenclature in the current ch-EVAR literature and a more accurate risk assessment of gutter-associated endoleaks. Moreover, it allows monitoring of eventual progression of gutter size during follow-up...|$|R
