25|$|The {{effect of}} {{leverage}} is {{also reflected in}} the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put or call depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the underlying index. The impact of leverage ratio can also be observed from the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E

The author estimates a model that integrates the findings of previous theoretical and empirical research. The author finds that <b>implied.</b> <b>volatilities</b> are significantly positively related to forecasts of market return volatility and to recent realizations of stock and market volatilities.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relation between dollar-real exchange rate <b>volatility</b> <b>implied</b> in option prices and subsequent realized volatility. It investigates whether <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> contain information about volatility over the remaining life of the option that is not present in past returns. Using Generalized Method of Movements [GMM] estimation consistent with telescoping observations evidence suggests that <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> give superior forecasts of realized volatility if compared with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity [GARCH] (p, q) and moving average predictors. Besides, econometric models do not add significant information to that contained in <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|In a way, such a {{calibration}} {{is quite}} {{analogous to the}} “practitioners Black–Scholes approach” (An and Suo 2009) to option pricing: although practitioners know that the assumptions of the Black–Scholes model do not hold, they, nonetheless, use the model by estimating the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> from traded options data and calculating prices for non-traded, but similar options and other derivatives with these <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities.</b>|$|R
25|$|This section {{outlines}} moneyness measures {{from simple}} but less useful to more complex but more useful.

25|$|This {{corresponds}} to the asset following geometric Brownian motion with drift r, the risk-free rate, and diffusion σ, the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility.</b> Drift is the mean, with the corresponding median (50th percentile) being rminus&σ2/2, which {{is the reason for}} the correction factor.

25|$|Since {{the market}} crash of 1987, {{it has been}} {{observed}} that market <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> for options of lower strike prices are typically higher than for higher strike prices, suggesting that volatility is stochastic, varying both for time and for the price level of the underlying security. Stochastic volatility models have been developed including one developed by S.L. Heston. One principal advantage of the Heston model is that it can be solved in closed-form, while other stochastic volatility models require complex numerical methods.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} a framework to model the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> of S&P 500 index options and estimate the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> of stock prices using stochastic processes. In this paper, three models are established to estimate whether the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> are constant during the whole life of options. We mainly concentrate on the Black-Scholes and Dumas’ option models and make the empirical comparisons. By observing the daily-recorded data of S&P 500 index, we study the volatility model and volatility surface. Results from numerical experiments show that the stochastic volatilities are determined by moneyness rather than constant. Our research is of vital importance, especially for forecasting stock market shocks and crises, as one of the applications...|$|R
25|$|While moneyness is a {{function}} of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies. Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful in option pricing and understanding the Black–Scholes formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; this is useful in constructing an <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> surface, or more simply plotting a volatility smile.|$|E
2500|$|... where S is {{the spot}} {{price of the}} underlying, K is the strike price, τ {{is the time to}} expiry, r is the risk-free rate, and σ is the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility.</b> The forward price F can be {{computed}} from the spot price S and the risk-free rate r. All of these are observables except for the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility,</b> which can computed from the observable price using the Black–Scholes formula.|$|E
2500|$|Intuitively speaking, moneyness {{and time}} to expiry form a {{two-dimensional}} coordinate system for valuing options (either in currency (dollar) value or in <b>implied</b> <b>volatility),</b> and changing from spot (or forward, or strike) to moneyness is a change of variables. Thus a moneyness function is a function M with input the spot price (or forward, or strike) and output a real number, which is called the moneyness. The condition of being a change of variables is that this function is monotone (either increasing for all inputs, or decreasing for all inputs), and the function can depend on the other parameters of the Black–Scholes model, notably time to expiry, interest rates, and <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> (concretely the ATM <b>implied</b> <b>volatility),</b> yielding a function: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper tests {{whether the}} true smile in <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> is flat. The smile in {{observed}} Black-Scholes <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> {{has often been}} attributed to deficiencies in the B-S model, such as the assumption of constant volatility, which cause the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> calculated using the B-S formula to differ from the true volatilities. If such deficiencies are the sole cause, then if the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> were calculated correctly (i. e., using the true though possibly unknown model), the smile should disappear or become flat. Using stock index options data, we test and reject {{the hypothesis that the}} true smile in stock index option prices is flat. If the true smile is flat, then a trading strategy in which one buys options {{at the bottom of the}} incorrect Black-Scholes smile and sells options at the top(s) should not be profitable even on a pre-transaction-cost basis. However, we find that such a delta-gamma neutral strategy yields substantial pre-transaction-cost profits. Moreover, the profits are large when the B-S model predicts large profits and small when small profits are predicted. Our results indicate that while part of the observed Black-Scholes smile appears due to deficiencies in the Black-Scholes model, a substantial part reflects a smile in the true <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities.</b> We argue that the true smile persists despite these substantial pretransaction-cos...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{efficiency}} of Australian options markets using {{a version of the}} Black-Scholes model. Under the joint null hypothesis that the pricing model is valid, and that forecasts are efficient, the <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> calculated from observed option prices should be efficient predictors of squared changes in the prices of the underlying instruments. This hypothesis is tested using weekly data on prices of Australian financial futures options, and over-the-counter currency options. The results indicate significant forecasting biases for each of the contracts studied. In each case, <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> appear to overpredict changes in the true volatility of underlying prices. Although these conclusions are conditional on the validity of the pricing model used to calculate <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities,</b> our evidence suggests that biases in the Black-Scholes formula are unlikely to explain fully the apparent forecast biases. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> contains information that would enable prediction of spot volatility {{for a wide range}} of financial assets. Lead-lag analysis based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform has been proposed as one method for identifying and extracting that predictive information. Unfortunately this approach can fail to identify periodic components that are not proportional to an increasing dyadic scale. We propose a multiscale analysis of the Eurodollar realized volatility and at-the-money (ATM) <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities.</b> After filtering the long memory components we produce a decomposition of cross-correlation by using wavelet packet methods. A threshold cost functional based on asymptotic confidence intervals was used along with the best basis algorithm in order to select an adaptive frequency partition of the sample cross-correlation. We found substantial evidence that Eurodollar <b>implied</b> <b>volatilities</b> contain predictive information about realized volatilities. Moreover, in our analysis the new technique outperforms the lead-lag analysis based on the nondecimated Discrete Wavelet Transform. Therefore we contend that the proposed technique will improve detection of predictive information and recommend further testing in a range of applied contexts.

2500|$|This measure {{does not}} account for the {{volatility}} σ of the underlying asset. Unlike previous inputs, volatility is not directly observable from market data, but must instead be computed in some model, primarily using ATM <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> in the Black–Scholes model. Dispersion is proportional to volatility, so standardizing by volatility yields: ...|$|E
2500|$|This rough {{classification}} can {{be quantified}} by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money {{or out of the}} money with respect to the strike – or conversely how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset. This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface: the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike, ...|$|E
50|$|Thus, the net {{volatility}} calculated above is, in fact, the <b>implied</b> <b>volatility</b> of this synthetic forward option.
