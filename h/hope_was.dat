5|$|Hope {{continued}} {{in command of}} small ships for several years, pausing in 1792 to marry his distant cousin, Lady Anne Hope Johnstone. The couple would have two daughters and four sons before Anne's death in 1818. In 1794, <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> in command of HMS Incendiary, a fireship of the Channel Fleet attached to Lord Howe's force sent to engage the French. In March, <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> given his step to post captain, taking command of the ship of the line HMS Bellerophon, the flagship of Admiral Thomas Pasley.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{from his}} long convalescence, <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> again {{requested}} by Duncan and commanded his flagship HMS Kent {{for the next}} three years. In 1799, the Kent was Duncan's flagship in supporting the Anglo-Russian invasion of the Batavian Republic, with Hope being present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in Texel to the Royal Navy. Sent to Britain with the dispatches proclaiming the surrender, <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> lauded by both the British and Russian courts, King George III presenting him with £500 and Tsar Paul I making him a Commander of the Order of St John.|$|E
5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It {{consisted}} of a stadium opened in 1896; the <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> to provide additional entertainment for visitors to the tower in the winter months. The capacity of the grounds varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached that figure.|$|E
40|$|Hope {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all individuals’ lives both today and in the future. While <b>hope</b> and hopelessness <b>are</b> important concepts and the subjects of much theorizing in psychology, theology, philosophy, political science, nursing, as well as in literature and the arts, it is absent from economics. This silence on <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> notable since <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally at the centre of choice, especially intertemporal choice, which is at the centre of economic analysis. To place hope at the centre of intertemporal choice, it is important to clearly define what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> and what it <b>is</b> not. What <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not <b>is</b> constant. <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> not optimism; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not unfounded dreams divorced from reality; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not irrational. I distil what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> from its characterization in a number of different disciplines. A comparison of characterizations identifies a number of commonalities and common definitions. Using the derived set of definitions, I incorporate hope into economic analysis, consider what implications hope has for the modelling of choice and for economic behaviour, and discuss whether <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> implicitly imbedded in or has been abandoned, to our eternal cost, by economics.

5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} with the fleet to England after the battle, where the wounded Pasley left the ship. Bellerophon was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for repairs, and then resumed her patrols in the Western Approaches with the Channel Fleet. Captain <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> superseded in late November, and on 1 December 1794 Bellerophon received a new commander, Captain James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun.|$|E
5|$|Good Hope, {{named after}} the British colony on the Cape of Good <b>Hope,</b> <b>was</b> laid down on 11 September 1899 {{with the name of}} Africa by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at their Govan shipyard. She was renamed Good Hope on 2 October and {{launched}} on 21 February 1901. She arrived in Portsmouth to be completed and armed in late December 1901. In 1906 she became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet and was the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when she visited South Africa two years later. Good <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> placed in reserve in 1913.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, {{at the end}} of the Peace of Amiens, Hope briefly took {{command of}} HMS Atlas, but it soon became clear that his health was failing and he could no longer {{maintain}} an active naval career. Retiring from the navy on half-pay, <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> an invalid from 1804 until 1807, when a return to health permitted him to take a post as a Lord of the Admiralty. Hope changed positions several times in this role, but he held onto the position for twenty years as a political favourite, a status maintained by being almost totally politically inactive. In 1812, <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> advanced to rear-admiral and in January 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on the reorganisation of the order, and was invested later in the year.|$|E

5|$|The LCS {{attempted}} passive deception {{as part of}} Hardboiled. Agents canvassed Norwegian refugees {{for information}} about Stavanger and for possible interpreters.

5|$|When war was {{declared}} in August 1914, Good <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> ordered {{to reinforce the}} 4th Cruiser Squadron and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock. Cradock moved the available ships of his squadron later that month to the coast of South America to search for German commerce raiders. He was then ordered further south to the Strait of Magellan to block any attempt of the German East Asia Squadron to penetrate into the South Atlantic. He found the German squadron on 1 November {{off the coast of}} Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock's force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock's two armoured cruisers in the Battle of Coronel. Good <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> lost with all hands.|$|E

5|$|A second movie, titled Terry, {{focused on}} the Marathon of <b>Hope,</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox {{when he was a}} child, directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind, which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series.|$|E
5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit Hope at the smaller Grosvenor Gallery. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a retrospective exhibition of Watts's work and he felt an attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> given the prime spot in the exhibition, in {{the centre of the}} gallery's longest wall.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> {{an oyster}} sloop that was {{completed}} in 1948. It {{is believed to be}} the last sail-powered oystering vessel built on the Long Island Sound. <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> 56 ft long, including the bowsprit, and 42 ft at the waterline. Its beam is 15 ft, and it draws 4 ft with the centerboard up. <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> gaff rigged, 'V'-bottomed and has an 850 lb centerboard. Hope's shallow draft facilitated shoal water work.|$|R
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that <b>Hope</b> <b>was</b> a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> gone for those still down there.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the lived experience {{of hope for}} domestic violence support workers. A hermeneutic-phenomenological approach was used to collect and analyze the experiences of six professional women, ages 37 through 69. Four themes, each with sub-themes, emerged from the findings. One theme, <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> Visceral, reveals the phenomenology of hope as experienced through bodily sensations, reactions, and emotions. A second theme, <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> Contextual, describes how experiences of <b>hope</b> <b>are</b> enhanced by personal perspectives and social environments. A third theme, <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> Mutual, reveals how interactions with other people inspire a sense of hope. A fourth theme, <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> a Journey, illustrates how hope evolved {{over the years to}} reveal new understandings {{of what it means to}} live hopefully. The findings are discussed in relation to the current literature. Implications for counselling, counsellor education, service provider organizations, and suggestions for future research are presented.
