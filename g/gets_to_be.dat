25|$|And also, {{thus it is}} {{that the}} fictitious troubadour Manrico can gain his rags-to-riches background, having risen from the obscurity of a Biscayan gypsy camp to become Urgel's chief general, a knight and a master swordsman in his own right, good enough to defeat Di Luna himself in a {{personal}} duel, or win a knightly tournament: only to lose it again on the military battlefield, where the odds are perpetually against him, and he is damned as an outlaw even before the opera begins, for no deed of his own but because his master is the rebel. And yet he <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a heroic, popular outlaw, who might just escape with his life in return for a vow of future loyalty, if put on trial in front of the Prince himself: a chance that Luna does not want to risk, given that his rivalry with Manrico is personal as well as political. Hence the challenge to the duel over the personal rivalry, instead of calling the guards and making the arrest political, in Act 1: and hence also the decision to execute without trial in Act 4 even though Luna knows he is abusing his position. Leonora and Azucena are, of course, as fictitious as Manrico, as is the story's conceit that the former Count of Luna had not one but two sons.|$|E

500|$|Ginga Legend Weed was {{featured}} on Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga segment on Anime News Network. He praised the series for its story and {{took note of}} the [...] "flavor" [...] of having a combination of physically realistic dogs, [...] "shōnen tropes", the dogs' knowledge of the human world (such as job occupations and dog breeds), and dog behavior involving honor, loyalty, honorifics, and auras. However, Thompson noted that the [...] "noble melodrama sometimes <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a little much", and felt that several characters, {{with the exception of}} Weed, began [...] "to blur together" [...] due to the difficulty of drawing a very large cast of dogs. Additionally, he commented that the fights weren't visually [...] "exciting", as dogs are [...] "lacking prehensile arms". Overall, Thompson felt that the series was unique, stating that [...] "no one else [...] making manga quite like this." [...] In a later installment of House of 1000 Manga, Thompson expressed his preference for Takahashi's original work, Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin, stating that it felt [...] "more exciting and natural" [...] than its [...] "stiffer and more pompous" [...] sequel.|$|E

500|$|As an actress, Fey has {{developed}} a reputation for portraying [...] "the hilarious, self-deprecating unmarried career woman" [...] in most of her films to-date. The Boston Globes Janice Paige defended her limited filmography by writing that, unlike most film actors, Fey remains [...] "realistic about her range as a leading lady and says she’s been deliberate about only taking on parts for which she actually seems suited." [...] Fey explained that she approaches each role asking herself, [...] "Would I be plausible in this role, in this job?" [...] However, her role as Kate Ellis in 2015's Sisters provided Fey {{with an opportunity to}} stray from playing the type-A female characters for which she has become known. The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott wrote, [...] "We’re used to seeing Ms. Fey ... as an anxious overthinker using her caustic sarcasm as a weapon against both her own insecurities and the flakes and train wrecks who surround her. This time, she <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the train wreck." [...] In 30 Rock, Fey's comedic acting was heavily influenced by both physical and improvisational comedy while, as a writer, her [...] "carefully written scripts" [...] were often quirky and character-driven.|$|E

Upon their return home, Marge feels upset that Homer <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the [...] "fun dad", while she is stuck doing unexciting things with the children. Next Saturday, she decides to take Bart and Lisa to an [...] "X-Games" [...] convention, thinking it will be something fun. However, when they arrive, they are disappointed {{to find out that}} it is a Christian event, and the actual name of the convention is [...] "† Games". The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia, where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food. Although initially averse to the exotic food, Marge is reminded that she wants to be a fun mom and therefore asks for the most authentic dish on the menu for her and her children. All three of them enjoy the food. At the restaurant, Marge, Bart, and Lisa bump into a group of foodies, who encourage them to start their own food blog, [...] "The Three Mouthketeers". The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and writing about it. This leaves Homer feeling left out and sad.|$|E
500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flawed, she <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes you be a better actor, just by being there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, that we found simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, there was a moment, a fraction of a second, when we changed the body with the actor." ...|$|E

On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bit of a fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in {{as a part of the}} ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter.

500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging {{for people who have}} grown up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There might be one song that <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> big on the radio, but they're not albums that people... play a lot. This is one that I gather from talking to people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really getting into the album now. McGuinness believed that the conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any decline in U2's popularity.|$|E

Her efforts are successful and life returns to the clean lake. She even has leftover cash afterwards, so she embezzles $600 to purchase a purse, much to Brian's disappointment. Peter has also succumbed to the perks of being the mayor's husband: he has rerouted the town's electrical system and caused rolling blackouts to bring late comedian Jim Varney back from the dead (he does nothing but talk, playing his character Ernest, [...] and repeatedly refer to [...] "Vern".) He then remembers he actually wanted John Belushi and takes Varney outside to shoot him, only for Varney to end up taking the gun from him and Peter running away from him warning Brian. [...] Later, Lois is tempted to buy a $4,300 fur coat, and Bob Grossbeard, president of the local oil company, offers to buy it for her if she will allow him to dump his oil runoff in the lake. Lois reluctantly accepts his offer, but as the opening of the new runoff pipe begins, Lois realizes the error of her ways and closes the valve to the pipe and resigns her position as mayor, stating that she was consumed by money and power, which led her to become the very same things she set out to destroy. Lois then allows West to have his job as mayor back, but a random bystander points out that neither Lois nor Mayor West has any jurisdiction to do so, and that the city has to have a whole new election to decide who <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the mayor of Quahog. This prompts West to pull out a gun and shoot him, as well as two others whom he believes objected.|$|E

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E

On the other hand, though, this is a game that does enough differently or better than most of its PS2 predecessors that it's still well deserving of your consideration." ...|$|E
