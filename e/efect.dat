40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} visual working memory (VWM) contents had a guiding <b>efect</b> on selective attention, and once participants realized that the distractors shared the same information with VWM contents in the search task, they would strategically inhibit the potential distractors with VWM contents. However, previous behavioral studies could not reveal the way how distractors with VWM contents are inhibited strategically. By employing the eye-tracking technique and a dual-task paradigm, we manipulated the probability of memory items occurring as distractors to explore this issue. Consistent with previous behavioral studies, the results showed that the inhibitory <b>efect</b> occurred only in the high-probability condition, while the guiding <b>efect</b> emerged in the low-probability condition. More importantly, the eye-movement results indicated that in the high-probability condition, once few (even one) distractors with VWM contents were captured at frst, all the remaining distractors with VWM contents would be rejected as a whole. However, in the low-probability condition, attention could be captured by the majority of distractors with VWM contents. These results suggested that the guiding <b>efect</b> of VWM contents on attention is involuntary in the early stage of visual search. After the completion of this involuntary stage, the guiding <b>efect</b> of task-irrelevant VWM contents on attention could be strategically controlled...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePatients with visceral metastases (VM: lung and/or liver metastases) are {{generally}} regarded as being less responsive to hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy often becomes the default treatment. This paper reports a subgroup analysis from <b>EFECT</b> (The Evaluation of Faslodex versus Exemestane Clinical Trial) examining the efficacy of fulvestrant and exemestane in patients with or without VM. <b>EFECT</b> is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, Phase III trial in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing or recurring after prior non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy. Overall, approximately 57 % of patients in <b>EFECT</b> had visceral involvement. Fulvestrant and exemestane demonstrated clinical benefit in 29. 1 % and 27. 2 % of patients with VM, respectively.

40|$|We {{present a}} formal {{treatment}} of contracting {{in the face}} of ambiguity. The central idea is that boundedly rational individuals will not always interpret the same situation in the same way. More specifically, even with well defined contracts, the precise actions to be taken by each party to the contract might be disputable. Taking this potential for dispute into account, we analyze the <b>efects</b> of ambiguity on contracting. We find that risk averse agents will engage in ambiguous contracts for risk sharing reasons. In addition to the risk sharing motivations for contracting in the presence of ambiguity, we find that agents may contract {{in order to reduce the}} downside <b>efects</b> of non-cooperative opportunism arising from ambiguity...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of pro-social behaviors and social interacton skills {{is a major}} focus of research on children’s development. Here, we consider one important feature of human social interactons, interpersonal movement synchrony, and explore its <b>efects</b> on pro-sociality among young children. Coordinated movements are a crucial part of mother–infant interactons, with important social <b>efects</b> extending well into childhood. Musical interactons are also known to facilitate bonding between infants and caretakers and pro-sociality among peers. We specifcally examine the pro-social effects of interpersonal movement synchrony in a naturalistc peer-play context among 4 - to 6 -year-old children. We assessed the amount of helping behavior between pairs of children following an actvity that they performed synchronously or nonsynchronously. Children who engaged in synchronous play, as compared with nonsynchronous play, showed signifcantly more subsequent spontaneous helping behavior. Further, more mutual smiling and eye contact were observed in the synchronous conditon and amounts of mutual smiling and eye contact during the movement task correlated with amount of helping behavior observed. Neither measure mediated the conditon-wise <b>efects</b> on helping, however. These results are discussed in terms of their contributon to existng literature and their broader implicatons for the development of pro-sociality and coordinated movements in early childhood...|$|R

40|$|<b>EFECT</b> is a {{generalised}} {{methodological framework}} {{for evaluating the}} impacts resulting from transportation projects with a specific orientation to environmental impacts. The innovative aspect of the methodological framework is the combination of Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) with Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) methods {{to come up with}} an overall assessment of transport initiatives' impacts over different geographical regions and time periods. Thus, it addresses both spatial and time impacts of transportation networks for all modes. The framework comprises four steps: structuring, weighting? rating, and exploring. Uncertainty is explicitly treated in the framework through fuzzy sets or, indirectly, through sensitivity testing. <b>EFECT,</b> using an additive function combining MCA and CBA methods, provides simplicity and intuitive understanding of results. This allows the use of either a core approach with a basic set of criteria and weights, or the application of a more detailed evaluation. when needed.
