5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
5|$|Like other soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} toxic. Contact with acid {{should be}} avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> The caesium ion (Cs+) and caesium chloride {{are generally not}} considered toxic.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> solutions.|$|E
500|$|Water readily {{reacts with}} yttrium and its {{compounds}} to form [...] Concentrated nitric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.|$|R
50|$|TiB2 is {{resistant}} to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1100 °C, and to hydrochloric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids,</b> but reacts with alkalis, nitric acid and sulfuric acid.|$|R
50|$|Fluorapatite {{crystallizes}} in a {{hexagonal crystal}} system. It is often combined as a solid solution with hydroxylapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH or Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) in biological matrices. Chlorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3Cl) is another related structure. Industrially, the mineral {{is an important}} source of both phosphoric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Transition {{and heavy}} metal {{fluoroborates}} are {{produced in the}} same manner as other fluoroborate salts; the respective metal salts are added to reacted boric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids.</b> Tin, lead, copper, and nickel fluoroborates are prepared through electrolysis of these metals in a solution containing HBF4.|$|R

50|$|For acid-resistant {{building}} facades, such as brick, acids {{are typically}} used. These include mixtures of phosphoric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> {{as well as}} surfactants. For acid-sensitive facades such as concrete, strongly alkaline cleaners are used such as sodium hydroxide and thickeners. Both types of cleaners require a rinsing and often special case since the solutions are aggressive toward skin.|$|R
5|$|In many ways, Niobium {{is similar}} to {{tantalum}} and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with fluorine at room temperature; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200°C; and with nitrogen at 400°C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200°C. It resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Niobium is attacked by <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> and hot sulfuric acid, and hot {{alkaline}} solutions {{also cause}} tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
25|$|Formic acid {{is unique}} among the {{carboxylic}} acids {{in its ability}} to participate in addition reactions with alkenes. Formic acids and alkenes readily react to form formate esters. In the presence of certain acids, including sulfuric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids,</b> however, a variant of the Koch reaction occurs instead, and formic acid adds to the alkene to produce a larger carboxylic acid.|$|R
5000|$|Oil {{companies}} such as Occidental Petroleum are using acidizing to stimulate production in Monterey wells, and other companies are experimenting with proprietary mixes of hydrochloric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids.</b> [...] "There's {{a lot of discussion}} around the Monterey Shale that it doesn't require fracking, that acidizing will be enough to open up the rock," [...] said Chris Faulkner, chief executive officer of Breitling Oil and Gas.|$|R
50|$|Bulk WS2 forms {{dark gray}} {{hexagonal}} crystals with a layered structure. Like the closely related MoS2, it exhibits properties of a dry lubricant. It is chemically fairly inert but is {{attacked by a}} mixture of nitric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids.</b> When heated in oxygen-containing atmosphere, WS2 converts to tungsten trioxide. When heated in absence of oxygen, WS2 does not melt but decomposes to tungsten and sulfur, but only at 1250 °C.|$|R
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus {{understand}} the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid,</b> with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
40|$|This study {{highlights}} the impurities formation in Electropolishing bath (mixture of sulfuric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids)</b> when aluminum is chosen as cathode material. Such impurities could partially explain the performance disparities observed on electro polished niobium RF cavities. These products might be aluminum derivatives, sulfur S and hydrogen sulfide H 2 S. Furthermore, parameters such as temperature, acid concentrations are also {{taken into account}} with or without applied voltage...|$|R

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{human presence}} in space will require self-sustaining systems {{capable of producing}} oxygen and potable water from extraterrestrial sources. Oxygen can be extracted from lunar regolith, and water contaminated with hydrochloric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> is produced as an intermediate in this process. We investigated the ability of Nafion proton exchange membranes to remove hydrochloric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> from water. The effect of membrane thickness, product stream flow rate, and acid solution temperature and concentration on water flux, acid rejection, and water and acid activity were studied. The conditions that maximized water transport and acid rejection while minimizing resource usage were determined by calculating a figure of merit. Water permeation is highest at high solution temperature and product stream flow rate across thin membranes, while chloride and fluoride permeation are lowest at low acid solution temperature and concentration across thin membranes. The figure of merit varies depending on the starting acid concentration; at low concentration, the figure of merit is highest across a thin membrane, while at high concentration, the figure of merit is highest at low solution temperature. In all cases, the figure of merit increases with increasing product stream flow rate...|$|R
5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid,</b> Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid,</b> which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. <b>Hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E

30|$|Gdanski (1985), Thomas et al. (2001) and Gomaa et al. (2013) applied retarded mud acids {{during the}} main acid stage, which are {{supposed}} to decrease the reaction rate between acids and minerals. Three retarded <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> (RHF acids) based on boric acid (H 3 BO 3), aluminum chloride (AlCl 3) and phosphonic acid were tested. However, these methods also posed similar problems at high temperatures. For example, when RHF acid was applied: some minerals form precipitates that were not formed when normal mud acid was used. For example, Thomas et al. (2001) investigated the formation of potassium tetrafluoroboron (KBF 4) precipitate when the fluoboric acid reacted with feldspar. Fluoboric acid has been produced when boric acid reacts with HF acid, presented in Eq.  4 and 5, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectrometry and high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the determination of 70 elements in coal were studied. Four microwave- assisted digestion procedures with different dissolution mixtures (nitric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids,</b> aqua regia and hydrogen peroxide), lithium metaborate fusion with and without previous sample ashing as well as direct sampling by laser ablation (LA) have been tested. Examples of spectral interferences are given and different correction procedures are discussed. Detection limits in the low ng g- 1 range were obtained {{for most of the}} elements investigated by using high-purity reagents and by taking special care to prevent sample contamination during preparation. The precision was assessed from replicate analysis (including sample preparation) of coal samples and was found to be, as average values far all elements, 4 - 5 % RSD and 10 - 15 % RSD for procedures including sample digestion and LA sampling, respectively. The accuracy of the overall analytical procedures was estimated by analysis of certified reference materials and of a coal sample obtained from the Interlab Trace round robin test. Among the dissolution mixtures tested, the {{combination of}} nitric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> with hydrogen peroxide provide the best agreement with certified, recommended, literature-compiled or consensus values, though fusion is necessary to obtain quantitative recoveries for Si, Cr, Hf, W, Zr, Y. In general, results obtained by LA fall within ± 20 % of those obtained after digestion...|$|R
5|$|More complex {{protactinium}} fluorides {{are also}} known such as Pa2F9 and ternary fluorides {{of the types}} MPaF6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH4), M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH4) and M3PaF8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF6 formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF5. These compounds {{can be obtained by}} evaporating a <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid</b> solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K+, Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+. A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb or NH4).|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid,</b> sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides {{are known}} for the metal {{oxidation}} states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa2O5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500°C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO2.25. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100°C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.|$|E
40|$|Hydrochloric and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids</b> are absorbed {{within the}} water ice lattice at mole {{fractions}} maximizing below 0. 00001 and 0. 0001 {{in a variety}} of solid impurity studies. The absorption mechanism may be substitutional or interstitial, leading in either case to a weak permeation of stratospheric ices by the acids at equilibrium. Impurities could also inhabit grain boundaries, and the acid content of atmospheric ice crystals will then depend on details of their surface and internal microstructures. Limited evidence indicates similar properties for the absorption of HNO 3. Water ice lattices saturated with acid cannot be a significant local reservoir for HCl in the polar stratosphere...|$|R

In support of the CEBAF Upgrade project and as part of a longer-term R and D program, we have investigated the properties of several electrolyte recipes. A particularly promising one consists of a mixture of lactic, sulfuric, and <b>hydrofluoric</b> <b>acids.</b> Initial tests reveal that smooth Nb surfaces can be achieved with no observable grain boundaries under optical microscope.
