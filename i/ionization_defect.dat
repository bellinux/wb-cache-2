40|$|The present problem {{arises from}} a {{consideration}} {{of some of the}} experimental and theoretical results which were obtained previously, some of which will now be briefly mentioned. Fission fragment mass distributions which were derived from data obtained from double ionization chambers using argon plus carbon dioxide gases disagree with those obtained by means of radiochemical analysis of the fission products. Fission fragment velocity distributions which were also derived from double ionization chamber data disagree with those obtained from a direct measurement of velocities. Further, these double ionization chamber measurements of the total kinetic energy of fission give lower values than those estimated from calorimetric measurements. These disagreements are explained by assuming the W (average energy per ion pair) values of fission fragments stopped in an ionization chamber gas are of the order of 5 percent larger than those for alpha particles which were used as the basis to calculate fission energies. On the basis that fission fragments lost greater percentages of initial energy through elastic collisions and that recoil argon gas atoms had reduced ionization efficiencies, a theoretical calculation in terms of an <b>ionization</b> <b>defect</b> appeared to justify this viewpoint. The <b>ionization</b> <b>defect.</b> is thought to arise from energy transfer through elastic collisions and hence should be a function of the atomic mass of the gas...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} fundamental {{physical processes}} which {{take place at}} the surface region of a target during and after the interaction with ultra-short laser pulses. The general goal is to bring together different phenomena and discuss the non-equilibrium nature of the interaction of femtosecond laser pulses (τp < 100 fs) with various materials, in particular dielectrics and semiconductors. Different experiments, using various techniques, are designed to explore the basic mechanisms of laser <b>ionization,</b> <b>defect</b> creation, electron-lattice energetic transfer, charged particles desorption, optical breakdown, phase transformations and surface morphological changes. Such processes are shown to depend strongly on the laser intensity. Thus, they are analyzed for intensities over four orders of magnitude (1011 - 1014 W/cm 2), around the surface optical breakdown (damage) threshold intensity. First, experimental studies using time-of-flight mass spectrometry indicate that non-resonant intense ultra-short laser pulses can efficiently ionize a dielectric (semiconducting) material leading to emission of electrons as well as charged particles, i. e...|$|E
40|$|The Monte Carlo {{method is}} a well {{established}} approach for the statistical solution of the Boltz-mann transport equation in semiconductors [l, 21. As device dimensions are reduced, {{it is important to}} account for hot electron effects, responsible for overshoot phenomena and reliability problems like breakdown due to impact <b>ionization,</b> <b>defect</b> generation, and injection into gate oxides. In some cases, hot electron effects {{can be used in a}} controlled fashion to generate useful device functions, as is the case of floating gate memories. Reliable models for the simulation of advanced MOS struc-tures must include the complete details of the bandstructure and accurate models for scattering rates at high energies, as well as a self-consistent treatment in order to evaluate appropriately the space-dependent carrier distribution function. Applications of full-bandstructure Monte Carlo approaches to realistic geometric structures have become feasibile only very recently, thanks to the advances in supercomputers and high end workstations. An example is the simulator DAMOCLES [3, 4] developed at IBM, Yorktown Heights. The ongoing goal of our work is to develop a hierarchy of models, where the features of the band structure in the high energy range can be introduced with increasing complexity, so that full device investigation may be practical.

40|$|The carrier {{transport}} in SrS:Ce,Mn,Cl EL-devices was investigated {{by analyzing the}} behavior of photo-generated electron-hole-pairs in an electric field. The low field transport of electrons and holes obeys Ohm's law, and the high field transport is characterized by polar scattering on optical phonons leading to the saturation of the carrier drift velocity. Around the EL threshold field a huge increase of electron current occurs due to electron multiplication. A multiplication factor of 34 * 104 cm- 1 was found for fields around the threshold using a simple model.

40|$|International audienceLaser-induced {{electronic}} excitation, absorption {{and relaxation}} {{are the key}} issues in ultra-short laser interactions with dielectric materials. To numerically analyze these processes, several approaches are typically used. First, several detailed non-equilibrium models {{are based on a}} system of the detailed kinetic Boltzmann equations. Then, Fokker-Planck equations are also used. Finally, much more simplified rate equations are typically used in engineering modelling [1, 2]. These models require additional sub-models to account for photo-ionization, electron-impact <b>ionization,</b> <b>defect</b> formation, recombination and other relaxation processes. In these sub-models, many parameters are rather unknown and are calculated based on additional considerations. One of such parameters is electron collision frequency [1 - 3], which was found to be crucial in determination of laser absorption and hence of laser damage. Boltzmann-based calculations are performed including all possible collisional processes. As a result, electron energy distributions are obtained allowing a better analysis of ultra-short laser interactions. The results reveal an effect of the laser-field on collision frequencies resulting in smaller free-carriers absorption than the one predicted by commonly used rate-equation models. Both electron-electron and electron-phonon relaxation are then examined, and the mean energy density of the electron sub-system is investigated as a function of laser fluence and pulse duration. Because efficient bond breaking requires energy, these calculations provide the required thresholds [4]. The dependency of the calculated damage threshold on laser pulse duration is compared with the available experimental data. The developed model is useful for many laser applications including high precision in laser treatment, laser-assisted atomic probe analysis, and for the development of new powerful laser systems.

It has been shown that there exists an intrinsic luminescence band in the ultraviolet spectral range 260 – 270 nm due to the luminescence of self-trapped excitons. It has been found that the kinetic characteristics of this band depend on the density of the exciting synchrotron radiation. A number of luminescence bands have been observed in the long-wavelength range due to the presence of defects in the crystal structure of borates.

The TDH data reveals four acceptor levels (having ionization energies of 7 meV, 32 meV, 89 meV and 123 meV) in the as-grown undoped GaSb samples. The 32 meV and the 89 meV levels {{were attributed to}} the GaSb defect and the VGa-related defect. The Ga Sb defect {{was found to be}} the important acceptor responsible for the p-type nature of the present undoped GaSb samples because of its abundance and its low <b>ionization</b> energy. This <b>defect</b> was thermally stable after the 500 °C annealing. Similar to the non-irradiated samples, the 777 meV and the 800 meV PL signals were also observed in the electron irradiated undoped GaSb samples. The decrease of the two peaks' intensities with respect to the electron irradiation dosage reveals the introduction of a non-radiative defect during the electron irradiation process, which competes with the transition responsible for the 777 meV and the 800 meV PL peaks. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} of gallium (Ga) grading on Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) solar cell performance are demonstrated by comparing with ungraded CIGS cells. Using drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) and admittance spectroscopy (AS) analyses, we show {{the influence of}} Ga grading on the spatial variation of deep defects, free-carrier densities in the CIGS absorber, {{and their impact on}} the cell’s open-circuit voltage Voc. The parameter most constraining the cell’s Voc is found to be the deep-defect density close to the space charge region (SCR). In ungraded devices, high deep-defect concentrations (4. 2 × 1016 cm– 3) were observed near the SCR, offering a source for Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, reducing the cell’s Voc. In graded devices, the deep-defect densities near the SCR decreased by one order of magnitude (2. 5 × 1015 cm– 3) for back surface graded devices, and almost two orders of magnitude (8. 6 × 1014 cm– 3) for double surface graded devices, enhancing the cell’s Voc. In compositionally graded devices, the free-carrier density in the absorber’s bulk decreased in tandem with the ratio of gallium to gallium plus indium ratio GGI = Ga/(Ga + In), increasing the activation energy, hindering the <b>ionization</b> of the <b>defect</b> states at room temperature and enhancing their role as recombination centers within the energy band...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} great appeal of {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) semiconductors for electronics and optoelectronics, to achieve required charge carrier concentrations {{by means of}} chemical doping remains a challenge, due to large <b>defect</b> <b>ionization</b> energies (IEs). Here by decomposing the defect IEs into the neutral single-electron defect level, the structural relaxation energy gain, and the electronic relaxation energy cost, we propose a conceptual picture that the large defect IEs are caused by two effects of reduced dimensionality. While the quantum confinement effect (QCE) makes the neutral single-electron point defect levels deep, the reduced screening effect (RE) leads to high energy cost for the electronic relaxation. The first-principles calculations for monolayer, few-layer, and bulk black phosphorus (BP), MoS 2, and ReS 2 with strong, medium, and weak interlayer interactions, respectively, as examples, do demonstrate the general trend. Based on the gained insight into defect behaviors, strategies can be envisaged for reducing defect IEs and improving charge carrier doping. Using BP monolayer either embedded into dielectric continuum or encapsulated between two h-BN layers, as practical examples, we demonstrate the feasibility of increasing the screening to reduce the defect IEs and boost carrier concentration. Our analysis is expected to help achieving effective carrier doping and thus to open ways towards more extensive applications of 2 D semiconductors. Comment: 29 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The solidus {{lines of}} PbTe {{have not been}} {{accurately}} predicted. Large uncertainties about the intrinsic carrier concentration, n i, the state of <b>ionization</b> of native <b>defects,</b> z, and the equilibrium constant of native defects, k s, of lead telluride at elevated temperature still exists. This research study was carried out to measure the electrical conductivity and Hall coefficient from which these intrinsic parameters (n i, z, k s) at high temperatures can be determined. Hence, a more accurate prediction of the solidus lines of PbTe and {{a better understanding of}} its electrical behavior at elevated temperature can be achieved. Using a direct current magnet field with a direct current passing through a p-type PbTe single crystal, grown using the Bridgman method, the electrical conductivity and Hall coefficient were measured directly from room temperature to 923 ∘K. The Hall coefficient was also measured at specific elevated temperatures (873 ∘K) while controlling the partial pressure of tellurium. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the intrinsic carrier concentration, n i, measured directly at 873 ∘K, 893 ∘K, and 923 ∘K was observed to increase with increasing temperature, but scatter only slightly when the tellurium partial pressure was widely varied. This agrees with the assumption that intrinsic carrier concentration is independent of composition, but strongly dependent on temperature. The equilibrium constant of native defects, k s, was determined to be 1 × 10 + 17 cm- 3 at 873 ∘K. At elevated temperature, 873 ∘K, the native defects of PbTe were found to be doubly-ionized, z = 2. Therefore two intrinsic adjustable parameters become known, this can result in more accurate values of net carrier concentration on the solidus line while fitting is conducted.

40|$|While {{hydrogenated}} {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si:H) solar cells have been studied extensively for the previous four decades, the low performance of the devices is still not well understood. The poor efficiency (below 10 %, even in research-scale devices) {{is believed to be}} mainly due to the low hole mobility of the bulk material, but there is {{little is known about the}} physical phenomena responsible for this deficient mobility. This work explores the atomic structures causing the inefficient hole transport in a-Si:H, as well as a novel rout toward improvement. First, a large ensemble of computational a-Si:H structures (216 Si atoms, with ~ 10 % H) is created, representing over 600, 000 atoms. This ensemble is analyzed using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and statistical correlations are made between discovered defective atomic structures and strong hole trapping. It is observed that a self-trapping defect arising from a reversible atomic rearrangement in the presence of a hole is most strongly correlated with deep trapping, followed by floating bonds, or over-coordinated silicon defects. Dangling bonds, or under-coordinated silicon defects, despite their traditional indictment for the responsibility of trapping in the literature, are found not to correlate with strong hole traps. Experimental films are produced using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), in p-i-n solar cell device configurations. By varying the chamber pressure, a set of devices with widely ranging properties are produced, varying hydrogen content and bonding configuration, stress, and density. These devices are then characterized using time-of-flight (ToF) photocurrent-transient measurements, allowing the direct measurement of hole transport though the intrinsic layer, and thereby the calculation of the material hole mobility. It is found that the peak mobility occurs at both intermediate (compressive) stress and hydrogen contents, with rapid linear declines in mobility as this maximum is deviated from (with respect to film stress). The computational ensemble of a-Si:H is then extended to include the experimentally-observed variables of stress and hydrogen concentration. A second ensemble of lower hydrogen content (~ 5 %) is created, and both hydrogen contents are relaxed at three differing stress states (- 1, 0 and + 1 GPa), extending the full simulation to approximately 2 million atoms across over 8 thousand structures. It is found that the modification of the stress and hydrogen content of computational samples correlates to shifting regimes of defect prevalence - increased hydrogen content and increasing compressive stress are both correlated with increased floating bond concentration. Low absolute values of stress correspond to increased <b>ionization</b> displacement <b>defects.</b> High tensile stress is observed to increase strong hole traps, without substantial increases in any of the previously explored defects, which is attributed to lattice expansion allowing further hole delocalization around trapping structures which would be otherwise less favorable due to the high kinetic penalty of strong wavefunction confinement. These relationships are then correlated to the aforementioned experimental results, and further experimentally vetted, where possible. Finally, as the observed shifting nature of defects in a-Si:H makes the further improvement of the bulk material untenable, methods are explored for utilizing the beneficial properties of the material (namely the strong bulk absorption and robust surface states) to achieve improved hole extraction (or effective mobility) from devices. Specifically, nanohole structured {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} (nha-Si:H) devices are created as a proof-of-concept, showing up to 50 % increases in efficiency over equivalent planar devices, for low-performing materials. by Eric C.

40|$|The {{material}} of the ZnO-based varistor (MOV) consists primarily of ZnO which {{is mixed with}} small amounts of other metal oxides, among these being oxides of Bi, Sb, Mn, Co, Ni and Cr. The resulting microstructure of the fired mixture consists of ZnO grains, formed during liquid phase sintering, which are surrounded by a discontinuous intergranular phase; the intergranular phase being made up primarily of the addivites to ZnO. Electrically, MoV 2 ̆ 7 s {{have been found to}} exhibit 1. symmetrical and nonlinear current-voltage characteristics which show a reversible Zener-type breakdown, 2. low voltage room temperature resistivities in the range 10 (2 ̆ 79) - 10 (2 ̆ 712) ohm-cm, 3. activation energies for low voltage leakage conduction in the range 0. 3 - 0. 8 eV, 4. dielectric constants which are anomalously large compared to homogeneous metal oxides, and 5. AC resistances showing large dispersions with frequency. In contrast, crystalline or highly sintered pure ZnO 1. is ohmic (n-type), 2. has a room temperature resistivity of 1 ohm-cm. 3. possesses an activation energy for conduction of 0. 05 eV which is attributed to <b>ionization</b> of point <b>defects,</b> and 4. has a relative dielectric constant of 8. 5 which is representative of ZnO lattice and electronic polarization. The anomalous behavior of the varistor is attributed to insulating potential barriers of width t existing in the grain boundary regions between relatively conductive grains of diameter d. The nonohmic behavior is determined by the response of these barriers to an applied voltage, while the activation energy for conduction is determined by the barrier height. The large MOV dielectric constant is determined by the geometric capacitance, or insulating width, of the grain boundary which, when incorporated into the equivalent circuit for the total microstructure, enhances the dielectric constant of the single grain boundary by a factor d/t. The following varistor electrical properties were observed experimentally: (1) low voltage DC current-voltage characteristic, (2) high current pulsed current-voltage characteristic, (3) small signal admittance in the frequency range 0. 1 Hz to 100 MHz, (4) admittance-bias voltage response at 1 MHz, and (5) the instability to bias of the leakage currents. The experimental parameters varied were temperature, composition and type of post-sinter heat-treatment. The results of each experimental technique were best described by a model of back-to-back depletion layers existing at the ZnO/ZnO grain interface. The depletion layers form barriers to conduction which determine the magnitude and temperature dependence of the varistor leakage currents. The reversible current breakdown occurs vial tunneling through these barriers. Under AC conditions ionized donors in the depletion region act as trapping centers for free carriers in the grain, and thus determmine the dependence of varistor impedance on frequency and temperature. It was determined from experimental techniques (2), (3) and (5), above, that the depletion layer donor density is derived from the oxide additives to ZnO. The post-sintering heat-treatments were found 1. to change the forms of the leakage and breakdown regions of the I-V curve, 2. to change the dependence of capacitance on bias, and 3. to produce a more uniform electrical response among varistors...|$|R
