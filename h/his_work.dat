5|$|Etty was {{prolific}} and commercially successful {{throughout the}} 1840s, {{but the quality}} of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major retrospective exhibition. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant <b>his</b> <b>work</b> later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty's inclusion in Tate Britain's landmark Exposed: The Victorian Nude exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his The Sirens and Ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which <b>his</b> <b>work</b> had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, there began a {{very intense}} debate on <b>his</b> <b>works</b> that would {{continue}} after his death.

The influence of William Faulkner is evident in all of <b>his</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R
