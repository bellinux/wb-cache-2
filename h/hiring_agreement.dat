5000|$|A <b>hiring</b> <b>agreement</b> in 1846 between Barbour and {{his eldest}} brother Edmund Pendleton Barbour {{serves as a}} {{historically}} significant source for the safety of, hiring of, and caring for slaves. The agreement did not list a price for a slave's services but included the standard food and clothing clause along with an additional clause stating that [...] "the boy Edwin {{not be allowed to}} cross the Libertyville millpond or the watercourse when it is high." ...|$|E

50|$|The U.S. {{government}} employs over 8,000 Master Labor Contract (MLC)/Indirect <b>Hire</b> <b>Agreement</b> (IHA) {{workers on}} Okinawa (per the Labor Management Organization) not including Okinawan contract workers.|$|R
50|$|Part II {{contains}} definitions {{for many}} types of agreements covered by the Act. There are three main types of agreement; regulated consumer credit <b>agreements,</b> regulated consumer <b>hire</b> <b>agreements</b> and partially regulated agreements.|$|R
5000|$|Debt {{counselling}} is {{the giving}} of advice to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts under consumer credit or consumer <b>hire</b> <b>agreements.</b> This covers any debt counsellor, regardless of {{if it is}} free legal advice; {{as a result the}} Citizens Advice Bureau, for example, is considered a debt counsellor, although its advisers are covered by a group license. Debt collectors are covered by similar provisions, and are defined as anybody who takes steps to [...] "procure payment of debts due" [...] under consumer credit <b>agreements</b> and consumer <b>hire</b> <b>agreements.</b> Those who [...] "purchase" [...] debts and attempt to collect on them are covered by this definition.|$|R
5000|$|However {{normally}} {{employers will}} wish {{to recover the}} cost of the equipment from the employee under a <b>hire</b> <b>agreement.</b> The employee can still makes the tax savings because the hire payments can be made from their gross salary via a salary sacrifice scheme.|$|R
50|$|Unless {{employers}} {{apply for}} FCA regulation, cycle to work <b>hire</b> <b>agreements</b> should {{not include any}} reference to being regulated under the Consumer Credit Act. The inclusion of such a statement may expose employers to consumer protection claims as the document may {{be considered to be}} misleading.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hire</b> {{purchase}} <b>agreement,</b> {{also known}} as an instalment sale, allows the purchase {{price to be paid}} in instalments after delivery of the hired property. Ownership remains with the seller until the hirer has paid the last hire instalment. The seller’s tacit hypothec is triggered by the sequestration of the hirer. The seller has a secured claim to the outstanding instalments due in terms of the <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement.</b> The seller’s hypothec under a <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement</b> secures the seller’s claim to outstanding instalments, so that the seller has a preferential claim.|$|R
50|$|Once their {{application}} has been accepted, the customer uses all, or part, of their allowance {{to pay for}} their vehicle for the period of the contract <b>hire</b> <b>agreement.</b> Over 450 models of car are currently available to lease with no advance payment - larger or more expensive models may entail this additional cost.|$|R
5000|$|Brookes Associates Finance Limited {{was in the}} {{business}} of providing equipment under <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreements.</b> In 1992 Royal Trust Bank (called RTB in the judgment) extended finance to the company, and took a deed of charge under which the company purported to charge the benefit of certain <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreements</b> deposited with RTB. Those deeds of charge required all sums paid to the company under the <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement</b> to be deposited into a specified bank account which the company was required to open with RTB. No such bank account was ever opened, and the company deposited the sums received under those contracts into an account with National Westminster Bank, which it was free to draw upon.|$|R
50|$|In other words, mutual {{agreement}} that a {{work is a}} work for hire is not enough. Any agreement not meeting {{all of the above}} criteria is not a valid work for <b>hire</b> <b>agreement</b> and all rights to the work will remain with the creator. Further, courts have held that the agreement must be negotiated, though not signed, before the work begins. Retroactive work for hire is not permitted.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, a work for <b>hire</b> <b>agreement</b> is less {{desirable}} for creators than a Copyright transfer agreement. Under work for hire, the commissioning party owns all rights {{from the very}} start even if the contract is breached, whereas under a transfer of rights, the creator can hold back the rights until all terms of the contract are fulfilled. Holding back the rights can be a forceful tool when it is necessary to compel a commissioning party to fulfill its obligations.|$|R
50|$|The rogue {{then sold}} {{the car to}} Mr Norman Hudson. Under section 27 of the Hire Purchase Act 1964, a non-trade buyer of a car who buys in good faith from a hirer under a <b>hire</b> {{purchase}} <b>agreement</b> becomes the owner and so Mr Hudson {{would have been the}} owner if the <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement</b> were valid. Shogun Finance argued that it was not, on the basis that there was a mistake as to identity. The rogue could not be found; it therefore claimed against Mr Hudson for conversion.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to run schemes in-house or purchase ready-made Salary Sacrifice and <b>Hire</b> <b>agreements</b> online. These save costs added by Cycle to Work scheme administrator services and allow the company to make a purchase direct from any supplier (employees' local bike shop) as a cash purchase. (Some Cycle to Work scheme vouchers are only for on items at full RRP and exclude sale items, {{resulting in a total}} purchase cost greater than the market value. However, one of the largest cycle to work providers will honour all sale prices.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{contracted}} writers, some {{staff writers}} operate as employees for their respective publishers. Under {{the terms of}} these work for <b>hire</b> <b>agreements,</b> the compositions created are fully owned by the publisher. Because the recapture provision of the United States Copyright Act of 1976 {{does not apply to}} [...] "works made for hire," [...] the rights to a song created under an employment contract cannot be [...] "recaptured" [...] by the writer after 35 years. In Nashville, young writers are often strongly encouraged to avoid these types of contracts.|$|R
50|$|The Consumer Credit Act {{provided}} {{guidelines for}} the court in determining whether a credit bargain is extortionate and extends the courts jurisdiction in this area to cover all credit agreements. If the court does believe the bargain was extortionate, it can re-open the agreement and examine the terms of it. If they decide it is indeed extortionate, they can set aside the remaining money owed, order the creditor to give money to the debtor, alter {{the terms of the}} agreement or order the return of any security. This only covers consumer credit <b>agreements,</b> not <b>hire</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the Act was passed, it gave {{protection}} to all goods {{subject to a}} <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement,</b> but it was amended in 1999 to limit its {{protection to}} only the purchase of consumer goods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hire</b> {{purchases}} <b>agreement</b> {{are commonly}} known as H.P agreement in Malaysia and it is used by financial institutions in Malaysia to fund the purchase of consumer goods, vehicles and other business equipment and industrial machinery.|$|R
50|$|Things {{then went}} {{from bad to}} worse, with another {{instalment}} being missed, and the creditor tried to enforce the new forbearance agreement, which was far more beneficial to the creditor than the previous <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|Part V {{contains}} several provisions {{relating to}} the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These {{are similar to those}} found in the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, but cover all consumer credit and consumer <b>hire</b> <b>agreements</b> rather than the hire-purchase and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at common law; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|... "Security" [...] {{is defined}} by the Act to mean any form of mortgage, bond, indemnity, {{guarantee}} or other right provided by the debtor as [...] "security" [...] to the consumer credit or hire-purchase agreement being conducted with the creditor. This covers both [...] "real" [...] securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given {{at the request of the}} debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original <b>hire</b> <b>agreement.</b> This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{agreements}} are defined in Section 17 {{of the act}} as regulated consumer credit agreements where the credit does not exceed £30 and regulated consumer <b>hire</b> <b>agreements</b> which do not require the hirer {{to pay more than}} £30 in fees. This does not include hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, which do not qualify regardless of the size of credit, secure transactions and transactions where the parties have attempted to break up a transaction into multiple smaller ones worth under £30 to avoid regulation. [...] Small {{agreements are}} exempt from almost all of Part V of the act, although they remain controlled by Part IV.|$|R
5000|$|People {{who create}} {{intellectual}} property under a {{work for hire}} situation (according to the publishers' or other customers' specifications) are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "independent contractors" [...] or other similar terms. Creators give up their rights to their works in a [...] "works made for hire" [...] situation, a category of intellectual property defined in U.S. copyright law [...] - [...] Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USC §101). The protection of the intellectual property rights that give the creator of the work are considered to have been sold into a work for <b>hire</b> <b>agreement.</b> of employees, however in a contractual rather than employment relationship.|$|R
50|$|The only common-law tacit hypothec {{recognised}} in South Africa {{is that of}} the lessor of immovable property. The other hypothecs are statutory, {{the most}} important being the tacit hypothec of the seller under a <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Items {{which do}} not belong to the debtor; for example items that are subject to a <b>hire</b> {{purchase}} <b>agreement,</b> leased or rented from a third party. Goods that are joint owned by the debtor can be seized.|$|R
40|$|Community-based {{regionalism}} (CBR) is {{the attempt}} by community-based organizations (CBOs) to reorient regional policies to benefit disadvantaged communities. Advocates of CBR have mostly called not for regional governments but for collaborative regional governance processes. This {{article examines the}} efforts of (CBOs) to form regional governance processes that target jobs from federally funded transportation projects to disadvantaged communities. Transportation policy has long been dominated by a policy monopoly centered on state departments of transportation and their highway engineers. By balancing conflict and collaboration, entrepreneurial CBOs {{have been able to}} penetrate this policy monopoly and negotiate successful local <b>hiring</b> <b>agreements</b> using collaborative regional governance processes. We conclude that success will be limited, however, without supportive federal and state policies...|$|R
50|$|The {{records of}} the Mercury Theatre are now held at Auckland Libraries. Some archival {{material}} was deposited with the Library in 1988 and the collection was greatly expanded after the company's closure. By necessity the rescue operation was swift. Liquidators allowed the small team, led by librarian Theresa Graham, less than twenty-four hours to retrieve the Mercury's voluminous records from the France Street premises. Filling about 500 boxes, the Mercury Theatre archive includes administration files, invoices, production accounts, front-of-house reports and statistics, costume <b>hire</b> <b>agreements,</b> press clippings, photographs, audio recordings, films and videos, scripts, musical scores, production plans, programmes and posters. It is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in theatrical organisation or {{in the history of}} the performing arts in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Wolfson was a {{brilliant}} financier and this was central to his early success. Later he backed James Goldsmith. He also underwrote the <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreements</b> of washing machine entrepreneur John Bloom at Rolls Razor but withdrew financial support in 1964, leading to the company's voluntary liquidation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{regulated}} consumer <b>hire</b> <b>agreement</b> {{is defined}} as an agreement between two bodies, one of whom (the hirer) is an individual, and the other of whom, (the owner) is a person, by which goods are loaned to the hirer for use without an option to purchase. The agreement must be [...] "capable of subsisting" [...] for longer than three months, not require the hirer to make payments of more than £5,000 total and not be an [...] "exempt agreement". [...] "Goods" [...] are defined as chattels personal, with [...] "capable of subsisting" [...] simply meaning that the agreement does not restrict the time limit of use to less than three months. The agreement {{does not have to}} exceed three months, but the option to do so must be given by one party.|$|R
2500|$|The {{definition}} of book debts includes [...] "debts {{which in the}} {{ordinary course of business}} would be entered in a well-kept trade book", future debts and future rents under a <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement.</b> [...] Bills of exchange also fall within the {{definition of}} book debts, but a bank balance does not.|$|R
50|$|Problems arose {{however in}} 1979, when Mr Mullaly sold {{the company to}} another company owned by Mr Cooper, after his lawyer advised him that these {{agreements}} were illegal, as under the Hire Purchase and Credit Sales Stabilisation Regulations 1957, <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreements</b> are illegal {{if they have a}} deposit of less than 60%.|$|R
50|$|A rogue went to {{a dealer}} to buy a Mitsubishi Shogun on hire purchase. The rogue told them that his name was Mr Patel and {{produced}} Mr Patel’s driving licence. The dealer communicated with Shogun Finance, which did a credit check on Mr Patel. Finding no problems, Shogun Finance authorized the <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement</b> and the rogue drove away.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} came to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1963, it picketed local employers who didn't hire blacks. Demonstrations were organized at Lucky supermarket and Mel's Drive-In to get them to sign <b>hiring</b> <b>agreements.</b> Success here was followed by unsuccessful negotiations with San Francisco's most elegant hotels and several automobile dealers. Freeman was one of 167 demonstrators arrested at the Sheraton-Palace Hotel http://www.sfpalace.com/History in March 1964, and one of 226 arrested at the Cadillac agency in April. She was acquitted in her first trial and convicted in her second, resulting in a fifteen-day jail sentence. Her second trial kept her from attending the 1964 Freedom Summer project in Mississippi. After it ended she hitchhiked [...] to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in August in Atlantic City, New Jersey to support the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's petition to be seated in place of the all-white regular Mississippi delegation.|$|R
5000|$|Bridge v Campbell Discount Co. Ltd. 1962 AC 600 [...] - [...] A {{customer}} {{bought a}} car under a <b>hire</b> purchase <b>agreement,</b> paid the initial and first payments and then cancelled the agreement. The company tried to recover large sums {{specified in the}} contract for cancelling the agreement, but the court decided these were excessive and constituted a penalty, making them unenforceable.|$|R
