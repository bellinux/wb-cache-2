40|$|Abstract — Tree shape {{statistics}} quantify {{some aspect}} of the shape of a phylogenetic tree. They are commonly used to compare reconstructed trees to evolutionary models and to find evidence of tree reconstruction bias. Historically, to find a useful tree shape statistic, formulas are invented by hand and then evaluated for utility. This article presents the first method which is capable of optimizing over a class of tree shape statistics, called Binary Recursive Tree Shape Statistics (BRTSS). After defining the BRTSS class, a set of algebraic expressions is defined which can be used in the recursions. The tree shape statistics definable using these expressions in the BRTSS is very general, and includes many of the statistics with which phylogenetic researchers are already familiar. We then present a practical genetic algorithm which is capable of performing optimization over BRTSS given any objective function. The chapter concludes with <b>a</b> <b>successfu...</b>|$|R
40|$|Checkpointing and {{recovery}} {{is a technique}} for saving process state during normal execution and restoring the saved state after a failure {{to reduce the amount}} of lost work. One of its important capabilities is to save and restore the state of user files of the process. This paper presents an approach called Modification Operation Buffering to support this capability. MOB approach buffers all the modification operations after a checkpoint until the next one, making all the operations between two checkpoints atomic as a whole. By choosing a suitable size dynamically for memory buffer, and by hiding the latency of flushing the buffer, the MOB approach achieves an overhead lower than other approaches. 1.

40|$|A new {{viewpoint}} for {{the gauge}} hierarchy problem is proposed: compactification {{at a large}} scale, 1 /R, leads to a low energy effective theory with supersymmetry softly broken {{at a much lower}} scale, α/R. The hierarchy is induced by an extremely small angle α which appears in the orbifold compactification boundary conditions. The same orbifold boundary conditions break Peccei-Quinn symmetry, leading to a new solution to the µ problem. Explicit 5 d theories are constructed with gauge groups SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) and SU(5), with matter in the bulk or on the brane, which lead to the (next-to) minimal supersymmetric standard model below the compactification scale. In all cases the soft supersymmetry-breaking and µ parameters originate from bulk kinetic energy terms, and Data from precision electroweak experiments, which includes evidence in favor of a light Higgs boson, have made weak scale supersymmetry the leading candidate for a theory beyond the standard model. Weak scale supersymmetry provides a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, a radiative electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism with a light Higgs boson, and <b>a</b> <b>successfu...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Noninvasive positive-pressure {{ventilation}} (NPPV) {{has been}} shown to be a means of reducing the need for endotracheal intubation, which when effective reduces the complication rate and improves outcome. Because paralysis and sedation are not needed and because the patient is not necessarily dependent upon a machine for respiration, ventilation outside the intensive care unit (ICU) is an option. A number of studies have shown that NPPV for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be effective in the non-ICU environment, though usually in patients with less severe exacerbations. However, there have been no direct comparisons of the application of NPPV in different locations. The likelihood of success of the technique is an important factor in deciding where NPPV should be performed. Ready access to invasive ventilation is important when NPPV is not indicated from the outset or fails after an initial trial. In acute exacerbations of COPD, NPPV is less likely to be successful the more severe the exacerbation, as measured by the severity of acidosis. Good tolerance of NPPV, which translates into an improvement in pH and a fall in respiratory rate, predicts <b>a</b> <b>successfu...</b>|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} modern {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) is dependent on the unprecedented increase in information relating to our natural, economic and social environment, and for Ghana and Africa to be in tune with the current trends in ICT, spatial information and methods to acquire them should be our priority. GNSS is therefore the obvious choice. This technology has an enormous potential to contribute to the management of environment, natural disasters, provide food security, emergency response, improve the efficiency in surveying and mapping. Land, water and air navigation will undergo a dramatic improvement with the application of GNSS. This is just to mention a few of the expected benefits. This paper focuses on the benefits to be derived by Ghana as a developing country and Africa in general from the introduction of a functional Multipurpose Global Navigation Satellite System. It specifically highlights the needed basic infrastructure for setting up a Continuously Operating reference System and the need for acquiring the necessary infrastructure to utilize the European Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), EGNOS.

40|$|The innate immune {{response}} constitutes {{the first line}} of defense against infections. Pattern recognition receptors recognize pathogen structures and trigger intracellular signaling pathways leading to cytokine and chemokine expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are emerging as an important regulator of some of these pathways. ROS directly interact with signaling components or induce other post-translational modifications such as S-glutathionylation, thereby altering target function. Applying live microscopy, we have demonstrated that herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection induces early production of ROS that are required for the activation of NF-kB and IRF- 3 pathways and the production of type I IFNs and ISGs. All the known receptors involved in the recognition of HSV were shown to be dependent on the cellular redox levels for successful signaling. In addition, we provide biochemical evidence suggesting S-glutathionylation of TRAF family proteins to be important. In particular, by performing mutational studies we show that S-glutathionylation of a conserved cysteine residue of TRAF 3 and TRAF 6 is important for ROS-dependent activation of innate immune pathways. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that ROS are essential for effective activation of signaling pathways leading to <b>a</b> <b>successfu...</b>|$|R

40|$|Uptake {{of foreign}} mobile genetic {{elements}} is often detrimental and {{can result in}} cell death. For protection against invasion, prokaryotes have developed several defence mechanisms, which take effect at all stages of infection; {{an example is the}} recently discovered CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) –Cas (CRISPR-associated) immune system. This defence system directly degrades invading genetic material and is present in almost all archaea and many bacteria. Current data indicate a large variety of mechanistic molecular approaches. Although almost all archaea carry this defence weapon, only a few archaeal systems have been fully characterized. In the present paper, we summarize the prerequisites for the detection and degradation of invaders in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. H. volcanii encodes a subtype I-B CRISPR–Cas system and the defence can be triggered by a plasmid-based invader. Six different target-interferencemotifs are recognized by the Haloferax defence and a 9 -nt non-contiguous seed sequence is essential. The repeat sequence has the potential to fold into a minimal stem–loop structure, which is conserved in haloarchaea and might be recognized by the Cas 6 endoribonuclease during the processing of CRISPR loci into mature crRNA (CRISPR RNA). Individual crRNA species were present in very different concentrations according to an RNA-Seq analysis and many were unable to trigger <b>a</b> <b>successfu...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent reports {{indicate}} that a subgroup of tumor cells named cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells (TICs) are responsible for tumor initiation, growth and drug resistance. This subgroup of tumor cells has self-renewal capacity and could differentiate into heterogeneous tumor cell populations through asymmetric proliferation. The idea of CSC provides informative insights into tumor initiation, metastasis and treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms of CSCs regulating tumor behaviors are unclear due to the complex cancer system. To study the functions of CSCs in the complex tumor system, a few mathematical modeling studies have been proposed. Whereas, the effect of microenvironment (mE) factors, the behaviors of CSCs, progenitor tumor cells (PCs) and differentiated tumor cells (TCs), {{and the impact of}} CSC fraction and signaling heterogeneity, are not adequately explored yet. Methods: In this study, a novel 3 D multi-scale mathematical modeling is proposed to investigate the behaviors of CSCsin tumor progressions. The model integrates CSCs, PCs, and TCs together with a few essential mE factors. With this model, we simulated and investigated the tumor development and drug response under different CSC content and heterogeneity. Results: The simulation results shown that the fraction of CSCs plays a critical role in driving the tumor progression and drug resistance.
