40|$|Motor {{insurance}} {{is the most}} important insurance line in Italy, accounting for about 60. 4 per cent of <b>direct</b> non-life <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> and for 22. 3 per cent of total insurance premiums in 2002. Its nature as compulsory insurance, its inﬂuence on the inﬂation rate, together with the growing role played by biological damage reimbursements and by fraud, have opened a deep and sometimes harsh debate, both in the political and technical arenas, on the measures to be adopted in order to get tariff levels under control, to increase efﬁciency and to promote competition. The main question addressed by our paper is if and how, over the period 1982 – 2000, deregulation measures inﬂuenced the structure of the supply side of the market and the efﬁciency and productivity of the companies operating in the Italian motor business. In particular, we focus our attention on three main aspects: 1) the effects of deregulation on the dynamics of insurers (at an aggregate level, i. e. the total number of insurers in the motor insurance market from 1982 to 2000 and the entry-exit process); 2) the effects of deregulation on the rate of growth of insurance activity (as measured by premiums by line of business, in particular the motor <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> compared with non-life and life business); 3) the effects of deregulation on the efﬁciency and productivity of a sample of Italian motor insurers. Techniques used include Loess, to show the existence of trends in time series, and efﬁciency analysis methods, in particular Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist analysis. DEA has been widely used in recent years to estimate efﬁciency in a variety of industries and national markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{a virtual}} {{organization}} <b>directed</b> on the <b>insurance</b> <b>business,</b> the estimations {{of the risk}} process and of the ruin probability are important concerns: for researchers, at the theoretical level, and {{for the management of}} the company, as these influence the insurer strategy. We consider the evolution {{over an extended period of}} time of the insurer surplus process. In this paper, we present some methods for the estimation of the ruin probability and for the evaluation of a reserve fund. We discuss the ruin probability with respect to: the parameters of the individual claim distribution, the load factor of premiums and the intensity parameter of the number of claims process. We analyze the model in which the premiums are computed according to the mean value principle. Also, we attempt the case when the initial capital is proportional to the expected value of the individual claim. We give numerical illustration. Key Words: virtual organization, ruin probability, risk process, adjustment coefficient...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, the <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business</b> Law {{has been}} in {{operation}} in order to regulate the <b>insurance</b> <b>business.</b> This law became effective in 1900 and since then it {{has been in}} force up to present partially ammended several times and throughly ammended in 1929. After the War, the revision of the law has became necessary to meet the new phases of situations, however because of the various reasons, it has not been realized. The <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business</b> Law admits the two forms of the company, namely, joint-stock company and mutual company, to run the <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> and no other form of company nor an underwriter is allowed to operate the <b>business.</b> The <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business</b> Law controls only the life and casuality insurances, i. e. fire, marine, transportation, automobile and other miscellaneous <b>insurances.</b> Accordingly, the <b>business</b> which has no literary meaning of insurance but has the same purpose of insurance are not controlled by the Law as long as they don't use the name of insurance. Thus, in Japan, there are many forms of <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> which are not controlled by the <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business</b> Law and frequently the cooperative associations conduct miscellaneous businesses for the industrial or economic purpose, in addition to the mutual aid business. The associations which operate <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> are the Agricultural Cooperative Association, the Agricultural Mutual Aid Association under the Agricultural Indemnity Law, Fishery Cooperative Association, the Small Industries Cooperative Association, the Fire Insurance Mutual Aid Association, the Consumers Cooperative Association and other optional associations. These organizations operate the same <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> as listed in the <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business</b> Law. Beside the aforementioned associations, there are also several kinds of mutual aid associations in the area of social insurance, for example, the Government Employees Mutual Aid Association the Public Corporation Employees Mutual Aid Association, and the Private Schools Teachers Mutual Aid Association operate the Health Insurance and Employees Pension Insurance. In addition to the <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> of the cooperative associations which, the author believes, should be classified as <b>business</b> <b>insurance,</b> industrial insurance and social insurance, according to the method commonly used, there is an insurance by the cooperative associations against-damage-of the public property, that is the building and car which is almost similar to the fire insurance under the <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business</b> Law. The associations which operate these kinds of cooperative <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> for the public property damage are classified as the following three national organizations such as 1) Prefectural Associations, 2) City Associations and 3) Town and Village Associations. These associations were officially organized under the Local Autonomy Law which was. revised in 1948 and which admits the Cooperative <b>Insurance</b> <b>Business.</b> The rate of the premium of these cooperative insurances is about half of that of insurance company and are continuously lowered tby a sliding scale. Nevertheless, the operating cost of the insurance business,for the public property by local governments through their national associotion is low and each year made the considerable amount of surplus. With these surplus, the associations installed the fire service arrangements and fire prevention equipments for the area and built the large center in Tokyo. These <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> made inroads into, the business of the fire insurance companies and become more powerful competitors year after year. This article has been prepared by the author to show the development of the special form of <b>insurance</b> <b>business,</b> the legal structure of the <b>insurance</b> <b>business,</b> analysis of the operation and future trends of the <b>insurance</b> <b>business</b> for the public, property by the cooperative associations...|$|R
