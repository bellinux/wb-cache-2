He has translated Don McLean, Procol Harum, King Crimson, Neil Young, David Bowie and several other artists in Finnish.

50|$|One {{of three}} estates within the Sauternes commune that was rated second {{growth in the}} Classification of 1855, {{situated}} on a favourable ridge location, Château d'Arche is named for the Comte d'Arche, owner of the estate from 1733 to 1789. Under Comte d'Arche the estate held a high reputation, and its placement in the 1855 classification's second tier <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the divisions of the estate that followed the French Revolution, and the subsequent drop in quality from {{the level of the}} 1780s.|$|E

50|$|Ferrogedrite is {{identified}} optically by its distinct cleavage and twinning with angles wider (650 and 1330) than its counterparts, its dark-green to brown rims. and minor matrix. The hardness of ferrogedrite registers between 5.5-5.6 on the Mohs hardness scale and will scratch a knife blade and leaves a gray white streak on a ceramic plate. Ferrogedrite in its fibrous state, {{along with other}} amphiboles <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> medium-grade conditions.

5000|$|In {{a system}} with two or more {{dimension}}s, such as the pictured disk, each dimension is given a mode number. Using polar coordinates, we have a radial coordinate and an angular coordinate. If one measured from the center outward along the radial coordinate one would encounter a full wave, so the mode number in the radial direction is 2. The other direction is trickier, because {{only half of the}} disk <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the antisymmetric (also called skew-symmetry) nature of a disk's vibration in the angular direction. Thus, measuring 180° along the angular direction you would encounter a half wave, so the mode number in the angular direction is 1. So the mode number of the system is 2-1 or 1-2, depending on which coordinate is considered the [...] "first" [...] and which is considered the [...] "second" [...] coordinate (so it is important to always indicate which mode number matches with each coordinate direction).|$|E
50|$|The {{calculation}} of the carbon footprint becomes detailed when considering secondary factors. Secondary factors involve the home’s occupant lifestyle such as diet, foods are consumed (example organic vs. non organic), frequency of yearly air travel, commuting mileage to and from work, school, etc., use of public transportation, and number, type, and use of private vehicles. Secondary factors also include fashion or type of clothes purchased and worn, frequency of recycling, recreational activities and use of financial and other services throughout a given year. The frequency of airline flights in a year <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the amount of fuel consumption and other energy usage and emissions generated by one flight. A person that travels frequently may have a significantly bigger carbon footprint than someone who flies once {{a year for a}} vacation. The emissions for an individual flight are calculated by using the greater circle method. First, the distance between airports is determined. Then calculations are completed to account for indirect distances and by an emissions factor in relation to the type of flight (international or a short flight, and what class seating the person is in). Another contributing factor to a person’s carbon footprint is their personal vehicle which includes the type of car driven, the efficiency or miles per gallon (MPG) rating, and the amount of miles driven each year. The frequency of public transportation used by an individual, miles traveled on public transportation and the type of public transportation used such as bus, train, or subway contributes to their carbon footprint as well. Other factors, as trivial as they might seem, are included in the {{calculation of}} a person’s carbon foot print to include things such as the type of diet. A vegetarian compared to a person that eats a lot of red meat will have a lower carbon footprint. All factors being the same except diet, a vegetarian secondary carbon footprint averages three metric tonnes of CO2, one tonne less than the individual who consumes meat. Other factors include the purchase of local and /or organically grown produce vs. imported items, the latest clothes fashions vs. more conventional purchases, buying individually packaged products vs. buying in bulk, recycling activities, and the types of recreation such as carbon-free activities like hiking and cycling or carbon-intensive activities like skydiving or boating.|$|E
