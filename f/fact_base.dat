40|$|Inevitably, {{it becomes}} more and more {{important}} to verify that the systems surrounding us have certain properties. This is indeed unavoidable for safety-critical systems such as power plants and intensive-care units. We refer to the term system in a broad sense: it may be man-made (e. g. a computer system) or natural (e. g. a patient in an intensive-care unit). Whereas in Model Checking it is assumed that one has complete knowledge about the functioning of the system, we consider an open-world scenario and assume that we can only observe the behaviour of the actual running system by sensors. Such an abstract sensor could sense e. g. the blood pressure of a patient or the air traffic observed by radar. Then the observed data are preprocessed appropriately and stored in a <b>fact</b> <b>base.</b> Based on the data available in the <b>fact</b> <b>base,</b> situation-awareness tools are supposed to help the user to detect certain situations that require intervention by an expert. Such situations could be that the heart-rate of a patient is rather high while the blood pressure is low, or that a collision of two aeroplanes is about to happen. Moreover, the information in the <b>fact</b> <b>base</b> can be used by monitors to verify that the system has certain properties. It is not realistic, however, to assume that the sensors always yield a complete description of {{the current state of the}} observed system. Thus, it makes sense to assume that information that is not present in the <b>fact</b> <b>base</b> is unknown rather than false. Moreover, very often one has some knowledge about the functioning of the system. This background knowledge can be used to draw conclusions about the possible future behaviour of the system. Employing description logics (DLs) is one way to deal with these requirements. In this thesis, we tackle the sketched problem in three different contexts: (i) runtime verification using a temporalised DL, (ii) temporalised query entailment, and (iii) verification in DL-based action formalisms...|$|E

40|$|Using {{the general}} {{concept of a}} {{knowledge}} system proposed in [Wag 94] we show how Belnap's system of epistemic states [Bel 77] can be extended by adding a second negation {{in the style of}} Negation-as-Failure. We call the resulting nonmonotonic system with two kinds of negation Disjunctive <b>Fact</b> <b>Bases.</b> While Belnap's system is the basis for defining standard 4 -, 3 -, and 2 valued logic, Disjunctive <b>Fact</b> <b>Bases</b> capture the nonmonotonic reasoning based on minimal, resp. paraminimal models. In order to relate both kinds of negation to the law of the excluded middle and to classical logic we formalize Korner's distinction between exact and inexact predicates [Kor 66]. In the system of Disjunctive <b>Fact</b> <b>Bases,</b> it is possible to simplify the representation of exact predicates (and reduce the complexity created by them) by means of an appropriate form of the Closed-World Assumption (CWA). Thus, we finally distinguish between three kinds of predicates: inexact predicates, exact predicates subject to the [...] ...|$|R
