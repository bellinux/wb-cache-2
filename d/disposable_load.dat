The design amasses awards from the Good Housekeeping Institute and was the first cylinder vacuum on the market to be credited with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval among other organisations. By using the same capacity large dust bag as the X1 Automatic upright, this feature allowed buyers to independently choose between an upright vacuum or a more compact cylinder vacuum.

50|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Macchi M.17 racer the M.19 first flew in August 1920. It was {{designed}} to meet a new Schneider Trophy rule that each competitor should carry 300 kg (660 lb) of <b>disposable</b> <b>load.</b> It was a single-seat biplane flying boat with a 490 kW (650 hp) Fiat A.14 engine strut-mounted above the upper wing, driving a four-blade propeller in tractor configuration. Early test flights showed a torque reaction from the powerful engine and the hull and rudder had to be redesigned. This resulted in the M.19 missing the 1920 Schneider race. The following year the weight rule was relaxed. In the 1921 race, the M.19 competed against two M.7s, but the M.19 had to be withdrawn after the 12th lap with a fractured crankshaft which ruptured a fuel line, causing the aircraft to catch fire.|$|E

40|$|Naturally derived hydrogels are {{frequently}} employed for biomedical applications {{because of their}} properties similar to the extracellular matrix of the natural tissues. Alginates {{are probably the most}} extensively studied and characterized hydrogels for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine fields. The gelation reaction of alginate is produced when cations such Ca 2 + diffuse into solution and interact with specific segments of the polymer chains. In the present work polymeric fibers were produced by wet spinning, exploiting the ionotropic gelation of alginate. The method consists in immersing the needle of a <b>disposable</b> syringe <b>loaded</b> with the alginate aqueous solution, into a calcium chloride cross-linking solution. To obtain the optimum hydrogel formulation, several aspects were considered such as concentration of both alginate and calcium chloride. Different processing parameters were considered to determine the best conditions required to achieve the most adequate response in terms of mechanical stability of the produced systems. Morphology, size and shape of the produced fibers were observed by light microscopy and the mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile tests. In vitro weight loss tests were carried out to evaluate the water content of the fibers. The release properties of the fibers were tested, using albumin as model molecule, in order to evaluate the use of the fibers for the production of bioactive scaffolds. Cell encapsulation experiments were performed to assess the viability of cells incorporated into the developed hydrogel fibers and to optimize the encapsulation conditions. Fiber meshes were prepared and cell culture tests were performed to investigate the ability of the produced systems to support cell adhesion and proliferation...|$|R

40|$|Waste is {{produced}} in large quantities in cattle feedlots, {{and this is a}} potential environmental pollutant. Recycling of feedlot waste as livestock feed has been investigated extensively as one means of lowering the <b>disposable</b> waste <b>load.</b> Refeeding fresh manure will only partially alleviate waste disposal problems. In one study, only about one-half of the manure collected daily could be refed, and the remainder was discarded. Currently, there is increased interest {{in the development of a}} microbial process for recycling and utilizing feedlot wastes. Commercial digestors are in operation. In some of these systems, the potential exists for capturing methane as a product of fermentation and recovering a biomass product which has potential feed value. Because of high capital costs associated with the equipment, labor, etc., necessary for the fermentation process, preliminary economic analyses indicate that, for the fermentation system to be profitable at moderate feedlot sizes, the operation must show a reasonable return for the feeding value of the fermentor effluent biomass. Based on its nutrient content (particularly total nitrogen, amino acids, and some essential minerals), fermentor effluent should be a good dietary supplement for ruminant livestock. Thermophilic (high temperature) anaerobic fermentation of livestock manures has several advantages that make it attractive for more detailed investigation. Thermophilic fermentation has the potential for higher methane production rates, and minimizes the potential for disease transmission compared with mesophilic (ambient temperature) systems. In addition, fermentation systems have the potential of improving the nutritive value of the nitrogen present in the waste. Data in this paper describe the chemical composition of the cattle wastes and different fractions of effluent obtained from the anaerobic fermentor and the in vitro digestibility of these fractions. In vivo experiments in cattle were also used to evaluate the potential feed value of the fermentor biomass using short-term (21 to 35 day) digestion and metabolism studies...|$|R

40|$|The manipulation, trapping, {{detection}} and counting of cells in biological fluids is {{of critical importance}} to the areas of disease diagnosis, drug delivery and genomic applications in biomedical research. In recent times, this research has focussed on utilising the superior metering, separation, routing, mixing and incubation capabilities of centrifugal microfluidic “Lab on a Disk” (LOAD) technologies to tackle the challenge of handling numerous types of cells, proteins, genes and their reagents simultaneously. Furthermore, integrated optical detection systems are being developed in parallel to the aforementioned microfluidic technologies, to facilitate the accurate and inexpensive detection, imaging and counting of cells. This thesis describes a number of novel centrifugal microfluidic approaches towards the separation, capture and detection of white blood cells from whole blood. Firstly, a thorough review of the state-of-the art research {{in the areas of}} centrifugo-microfluidic cell handling and detection is outlined. Secondly, a series of physical size filtration and microcontact printing approaches for the capture and detection of biomimetic particles are described.

40|$|Scientists, both {{academic}} and industrial, develop two main types of drugs: 1) small molecule drugs, {{which are usually}} chemically synthesized and are taken orally and 2) large molecule, biotherapeutic, or protein-based drugs, which are often synthesized via ribosome transcription in bacteria cells and are injected. Historically, the majority of drug development, revenue, and products has come from small molecule drugs. However, recently biotherapeutic drugs have become more common due to their increased potency and specificity (the ability to chemically bond to the targeted protein of interest). Researchers now estimate {{that as much as}} 50 % of current drug development activities (pre-market approval) are focused on these protein-based drugs. There are several well-documented steps necessary {{in the development of a}} new large molecule drug. One critical element during the end of the biotherapeutic drug discovery phase and the beginning of the manufacturing phase is known as preformulation or formulation development. During this stage scientists systematically test the effects of adding various excipients (non-protein additives added to enhance the protein stability, solubility, activity of the drug, etc.) to the potential large molecule drug. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a common technique used to perform these formulation studies. In a classic DSC experiment, a protein is heated from 20 - 80 °C and the heat absorbed while the protein unfolds is measured. Many researchers prefer the use of a DSC instrument because of its label-free nature, meaning that no fluorescent or radio-labeled tag is necessary to perform the measurement. The heat absorbed during the unfolding event(s) is directly measured. However, current commercial DSC instruments suffer from high protein consumption (especially when compared to other labeled techniques), low sensitivity, and slow throughput. The aim of this thesis is to address two of the three areas mentioned above: high protein consumption and slow throughput. Since many formulation development studies are performed at therapeutic or high protein concentrations, one can reduce the experimental cell volume and thereby reduce the amount of protein material consumed. However, since there is less sample, less heat is produced. While in the literature there are several heat transfer models that describe how a DSC instrument literature there are several heat transfer models that describe how a DSC instrument functions, there are surprisingly few heat transfer models that detail how ambient temperature disturbances impact the thermal measurement. To better describe this behavior, a simplified state-space thermal model was created to predict the disturbance rejection of a custom DSC instrument. This model was verified experimentally using linear stochastic system identification techniques. To reduce sample throughput, the prototype calorimeter cell was made from disposable materials. Because the majority of protein systems are thermodynamically irreversible, at elevated temperatures the protein solution often aggregates and needs to be cleaned before a subsequent experiment can be run. This cleaning process constitutes a significant portion of the overall time to run an experiment. This thesis documents a fully functional DSC instrument that, while not completely disposable, has been designed, built, and tested with disposable microfluidic materials. Future work would then solve the technical hurdles of repeatably <b>loading</b> <b>disposable</b> microfluidic cells into the DSC instrument. by Scott Jacob McEuen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Thrombocytopenia is {{a common}} {{laboratory}} finding in cats, but {{there are only a}} few clinical reports about feline thrombocytopenia. As a result of the relatively large feline platelet size (11 - 18 fl) and the tendency for clumping automated platelet counts are frequently inaccurate (too low, so called pseudothrombocytopenia). The purpose of our prospective study (January 1999 -June 2000) was to determine the relationship between the manual and the automated platelet count. All thrombocytopenic cats, which were presented at the Clinic for Small Animals, Berlin, had a complete examination in order to find the cause of the thrombocytopenia. For the first time platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) in cats were detected by flow cytometry. Further on the buccal mucosa bleeding time of 35 cats was determined and evaluated. Comparison of automatic and manual platelet counting The platelet counting was performed manually (Thrombo Plus®, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht) and automatically (Cell-Dyn 3500, Abbott, Wiesbaden) in 217 feline blood samples within 30 minutes after blood taking. The average platelet count was 139, 527 /µl (range 1, 000  858, 000 /µl) in the automatical count and 177, 251 /µl (range 6, 000  970, 000 /µl) in the manual count. In 161 samples the automatic counter demonstrated the blood samples to be thrombocytopenic. However, the manual counting proved in 39 of these samples that the automatic counting had given false low results and in further 47 cases the automatic counts were too high. We observed a correlation of only r = 0. 789 for manual and automatic platelet counts, which means, that reliable platelet counts in cats can only be achieved manually. Diagnoses of 63 thrombocytopenic cats The diagnoses of 63 thrombocytopenic cats (range 10, 000  179, 000 /µl, median [M]: 83, 000) were based on history, signalment, the complete blood cell count, serum biochemical screening, serology, the results of radiography and ultrasonography as well as further examinations (for example cytology, histopathology). Platelet-bound antibodies were determined in 42 of these cats. 17 (Tc/µl: 16, 000  179, 000, M: 57, 000) of these 63 cats suffered from viral infections such as FIP (7), FeLV (3), FIV (4) and feline rhinitis with secondary bacterial infection (3). 22 cats had either an aseptic inflammation (Tc/µl: 15, 000  178, 000, M: 84, 000) (fat necrosis [4], traumata [4], pancreatitis [2], FLUTD [2], (cholangio) -hepatitis [2], nasal polyp [1] and gastritis with ulcer [1],) or a bacterial infection (Tc/µl: 37, 000  168, 000, M: 85, 000) (pneumonia [2], urolithiasis with obstruction and cystitis [1], pyelonephritis [1], abscess [1], pyometra [1]). Ten (Tc/µl: 22, 000  178, 000, M: 88, 000) of 63 cats had neoplasia (lymphoma [6], leukemia [2], fibrosarcoma of the kidney [1] and hemangiosarcoma [1]). Three of 63 cats with thrombocytopenia suffered from bone marrow diseases (megakaryocytic and/or erythroid aplasia resp. -hypoplasia) and the platelets ranged from 34, 000  168, 000 /µl (M: 115, 000). Three cats were diagnosed with immune-mediated diseases (immune-hemolytic anaemia [IHA], primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia [pIMT], Evans´ syndrome) (Tc/µl: 10, 000  83, 000, M: 46, 000). Four (Tc/µl: 18, 500  175, 000, M: 149, 500) of 63 cats suffered from a variety of diseases (renal failure [1], hyperthyroidism with cardiomyopathy [1], hepatopathy [2]). The thrombocytopenia (Tc/µl: 76, 000  162, 000, M: 109, 000) was a random finding in hemograms of four cats at a routine check up. Spontaneous bleeding (i. e. bleeding of the gums [4], petechiation [4], epistaxis [1], retinal and scleral hemorrhage [1] resp. abdominal hemorrhage [1]) was observed in only 7 (Tc/µl: 10, 000  57, 000, M: 34, 000) of 63 thrombocytopenic cats (with diagnosis of FIV [3], pIMT, Evans´ syndrome, leukemia and megakaryocytic and erythroid aplasia). Detection of platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) This study evaluated the presence of antibodies on the platelet-membrane in a direct assay by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, New Jersey USA) in cats. First of all feline platelets were determined by using monoclonal antibodies (goat-anti-mouse). With polyclonal antibodies (goat-anti-cat with a specifity against heavy chains on cat IgG) were detected those platelets, which carried antibodies. All of the 47 healthy cats had a negative test result. 19 of 42 thrombocytopenic cats (Tc/µl: 6, 000  179, 000, &# 63426;: 59, 947) had a positive PBA test result. 17 of these 19 cats had a secondary IMT. The underlying diseases were: fat necrosis (4), FIP (3), FeLV- (2) / FIV- (2) infection, lymphoma (2), leukemia (2), hepatitis (1), pyelonephritis (1) and hyperthyroidism with cardiomyopathy (1). No underlying disease was discovered in two cats: one cat had an Evans´ syndrome and the other pIMT. In 23 cats with thrombocytopenia (Tc/µl: 15, 000  206, 000, &# 63426;: 89, 108) the PBA test results were negative including cats with FIP (4), with lymphoma (3), FIV (2), pancreatitis (2), cholangiohepatitis (1) and hepatitis (1). Several diseases such as FeLV-infection, IMHA, erythroid and megakaryocytic aplasia, pneumonia, leukemia, nasal polyp, abscess, FLUTD with obstruction, ulcerative gastritis and peritoneopericardial hernia only occurred once. Similar to humans and dogs, this study suggested that an immune-mediated destruction of platelets could play an important role in the pathogenesis of feline thrombocytopenia. Primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia seems to be less common or it is difficult to diagnose, maybe because spontaneous bleeding is rare in cats. Buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT) A <b>disposable</b> spring <b>loaded</b> blade, that made a standardised cut of 3 mm length and 0. 5 mm depth, was used to measure the BMBT. Altogether the BMBT was determined in 35 anesthetized cats at the oral mucosa surfaces of the upper lip. The mean ± 2 standard deviation of 15 healthy cats was 55. 3 ± 43. 2 sec (range 30  105 sec). Seven thrombocytopenic cats had a marked mean prolongation in BMBT (BMBT 45  300 sec), while the BMBT (< 5  120 sec) of 13 cats with various diseases without thrombocytopenia was similar to the mean for healthy cats...|$|R
