[...] "Lost Boys and Golden Girls" [...] is [...] "Steinman's {{interpretation}} {{of the story of}} Peter Pan." [...] The composer says that Peter Pan has [...] "always been about my favorite story and I've always looked at it from the perspective that it's a great rock and roll myth because it's about—when you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> it—it's about a gang of lost boys who never grow up, {{who are going to be}} young forever and that's about as perfect an image for rock'n'roll as I can think of." ...|$|E

This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again at the cash register as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a business transfer tax. [...] But they are all consumption taxes.|$|E

5000|$|Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{gave the}} album a mixed review, writing [...] "At its best, WK’s {{music is a}} {{refreshing}} blast of skanky air on the current stale music scene, but at its worst, it’s disappointingly monotonous, unoriginal, and very, very dumb." [...] Evan Chakroff of Stylus Magazine called it a [...] "worthless piece of rock-product, 35 minutes of glossy, overproduced tripe", but concluded that [...] "once these songs have pounded their way into your head, you can’t help but pay attention" [...] and [...] "if this is a joke, it's a brilliant one."

Ramondi then <b>gets</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> business, telling Sam Pascal that times are {{changing}} and he should bring his business in {{under the umbrella of}} Osris. Sam gets angry at this, saying he doesn’t need to procure “protection” from Osiris and that Ramondi’s offer is a joke and “bullshit”. Sam storms out. Out in the casino Randall has run afoul of 2 of Ramondi’s men, including the hulking Cam (Judo and Sumo wrestler Seiji Sakaguchi). They nearly come to blows until Ramondi calls off his goons.|$|R
5000|$|In JamBase, Dennis Cook wrote, [...] "7 Walkers... is {{the most}} organic, {{original}} music {{to come out of}} the core Grateful Dead alumni since the passing of Jerry Garcia. It's worth <b>getting</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> brass tacks since 7 Walkers goes for the creative jugular in such a lusty, exuberant manner. With richly imaginative lyrics penned by Dead scribe Robert Hunter... Even on paper this quartet is lethal, but that's nothing compared to the roiling energy when they come together in the flesh. With their collective pedigree, there's an enormous pool of possibilities and their self-titled debut reflects all their swirling undercurrents and coalesces into fascinating new shapes, fresh colors forming on the surface of things as dark, interesting eddies move below. Put another way, there's something powerful and primal and beautiful going on in the music of 7 Walkers." ...|$|R

In Cadd's 2010 autobiography, he said (of Somers) [...] "making that album, he was undoubtedly the hardest working person I'd ever been with in the studio" [...] adding [...] "It was a truly fun project.

5000|$|Andy Webb from [...] "The Movie Scene" [...] {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, stating: [...] "What this all boils <b>down</b> <b>to</b> is that [...] "The Rats" [...] is some old {{fashioned}} horror fun which plays on people's own fears of rats. Of course if you think rats are cute and adorable then this isn't {{going to work and}} you might even be offended at the portrayal of rats or the ridiculous climax. But if you do have a fear of the fury rodents this movie is not one to watch before you go to sleep." [...] Rod Lott from [...] "Flick Attack", wrote: [...] "Come up with a cliché, and sooner or later, The Rats <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> it, <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ever-predictable it-ain’t-really-over final shot.

[...] Florita A. from [...] "Hell Horror", scored the film 4 out of 10, writing: [...] "The Rats was made simple, and that was not an ideal thing as the movie flopped although it was a TV movie. I like the idea of rats playing on someone’s fear, but it came <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the film not being executed in the right manner to send frights across to its audience amongst other things." ...|$|R

60|$|What are the {{distinctive}} merits of these speeches and letters? There is less humour in them than {{his reputation as}} a humorist would have led us to expect. They are serious, grave, practical. We feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of the subject, or {{to use it as a}} way of displaying his cleverness. He is trying to <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the very foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are. In this respect he sometimes reminds us of Bismarck's speeches, which, in their rude, broken, forth-darting way, always go straight to their destined aim; always hit the nail on the head. So too, in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts, Lincoln's bear a sort of likeness to Cromwell's speeches, though Cromwell has far less power of utterance, and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain, true and weighty to himself. This difficulty makes the great Protector, though we can usually see what he is driving at, frequently confused and obscure. Lincoln, however, is always clear. Simplicity, directness and breadth are the notes of his thought. Aptness, clearness, and again, simplicity, are the notes of his diction. The American speakers of his generation, like most of those of the preceding generation, but unlike those of that earlier generation to which Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Marshall and Madison belonged, were generally infected by a floridity which made them a by-word in Europe. Even men of brilliant talent, such as Edward Everett, were by no means free from this straining after effect by highly-coloured phrases and theatrical effects. Such faults have to-day virtually vanished from the United States, largely from a change in public taste, to which perhaps the example set by Lincoln himself may have contributed. In the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant, especially in the West and South, where taste was less polished than in the older States. That Lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of his independence as well as of his greatness. There is no superfluous ornament in his orations, nothing tawdry, nothing otiose. For the most part, he addresses the reason of his hearers, and credits them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them. When he does appeal to emotion, he does it quietly, perhaps even solemnly. The note struck is always a high note. The impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of language, but from the sincerity of his own convictions. Sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speaker's feeling, and when the time comes for the feeling to be directly expressed, it glows not with fitful flashes, but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul.|$|E
