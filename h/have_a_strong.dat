5|$|During {{the early}} stages, the Anuradhapura Kingdom did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> regular army {{except for a}} small body of soldiers. These were {{assigned}} for guarding the capital and the royal palace. The King {{had the right to}} demand an able bodied son for military service from every family in his kingdom. In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry. This combination was called Chaturangani Sena (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.|$|E

Franklin {{is also the author}} of The Real World of Technology which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures broadcast on CBC Radio.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile heavy metals are mainly f-block elements {{and the more}} reactive of the d-block elements. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile heavy metals are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and period 4–6 p-block metals and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E

5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{influence on}} climate and weather and, in turn, {{the food supply}} of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress {{and delight}} (5, 6, 7, 8), often by including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). Sometimes they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Sometimes {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (10), it is likely to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{groups in}} Australia began forming in the 1990s. The first group, called Ataru Taru Taiko, {{was formed in}} 1995 by Paulene Thomas, Harold Gent, and Kaomori Kamei. TaikOz was later formed by percussionist Ian Cleworth and Riley Lee, a former Ondekoza member, and has been {{performing}} in Australia since 1997. They {{are known for their}} work in generating interest in performing taiko among Australian audiences, such as by developing a complete education program with both formal and informal classes, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> fan base. Cleworth {{and other members of the}} group have developed several original pieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} Nokian tyres is seasonal, {{as a high}} {{percentage}} of the company's sales are of winter tyres, but it has reduced seasonal fluctuations by its development of summer and all weather tyres. According to the company, more than 80% of its passenger car and van tyre sales are winter tyres. Winter tyre sales <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> seasonal characteristic with 30% of retail sales occurring in the ten days after the first snowfall, thus presenting challenges in production and delivery.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{branch of}} swordmaking in Bizen Province is the Ko-Bizen (old Bizen) school. It {{was founded by}} Tomonari who lived around the early 12th century. The school flourished in the late Heian period (10th–12th century) and {{continued}} into the Kamakura period. Three great swordsmiths—Kanehira, Masatsune and Tomonari—are associated with the school. Ko-Bizen tachi are generally thin, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> koshi-zori and small kissaki. The grain is itame-hada or small itame-hada and the hamon is small midare made of nie in combination with chōji and gunome.|$|E

Supporting a generous welfare state for the Dutch people, it was otherwise sceptical of state interventionism in the economy; notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative, or overspending on subsidies.|$|E
5|$|The {{voracious}} {{adults have}} very broad diets, including insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, {{even of the}} same species. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
