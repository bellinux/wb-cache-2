Since the actual river flow data are often low and they correlate and depend yearly and monthly, making the data similar to historical data {{is so difficult}} and complex. In this study, 50 year data and Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARMA) and Clayton and Frank Copulas which are the prediction and simulation methods of the river <b>flow</b> <b>molding,</b> were used to generate random flow data of Helmand River. Results show, SARMA model forecasts minimum river flow data very good, but the generated data hasn’t correlation of historical data and usually the maximum river flow is greater than real data. Otherwise, Copula preserved concordance of real data and make the data {{that are similar to}} real river flow. Therefore it is proposed that Copula is used for Helmand river flow modeling. Also this method use for simulating other river flows and also using other Copulas for river flow modeling could have the subject of future researches...|$|E
40|$|In {{composite}} processing, a compressible dry fiber preform is in {{many cases}} impregnated by a molten polymeric matrix. The impregnated part is sometimes used as produced, but most often it requires a reheating step before stamping, <b>flow</b> <b>molding</b> or even painting of the part. This latter step {{may lead to the}} release of locked-in stresses, a phenomenon often called lofting or deconsolidation. The aim of the present thesis is to analyze the mechanisms and provide tools for predicting the kinetics of consolidation and deconsolidation in order to produce cost-effective and sound composite materials. To achieve this, the two fundamental stages of composite processing, consolidation and deconsolidation, have been studied. The influence of both processing parameters and materials systems have been quantified. A Glass Mat reinforced Thermoplastic (GMT) was selected and characterized for the case study. The first part of this work concerns the consolidation stage, emphasizing the influence of processing parameters such as applied pressure or processing temperature on the final microstructure of the composite products. Experimental impregnation processes were carried out and were completed by parallel theoretical simulations. A model accounting for the saturated infiltration of compressible preform was used to predict the residual fiber content gradient in a part, and its influence on the mechanical properties. It was observed that a gradient of the reinforcement in a GMT part, if controlled by impregnation times, can improve the bending modulus by 50 %. Furthermore, a new infiltration model accounting for multi-phase flow in compressible preforms showing a dual-scale porosity was elaborated. The aim was {{to take into account the}} porosity by considering not only the solid and liquid phases, but also air as a third phase. The local fiber and void content can then be precisely predicted as a function of the infiltration time and position. The radial micro-impregnation of the fiber bundles was also taken into account by adding a sink term of micro-impregnation to the macro-impregnation. The predictions have shown that the time required to provide full micro-infiltration is about four times longer than the time to provide full macro-infiltration. Special care therefore has to be taken when infiltrating a dual-scale porosity system: residual voids may remain even if time to provide macro-infiltration is attained. Once the consolidation state of the part was well defined in terms of void content, fiber content profile and stress state, a study of the post-processing steps was carried out. To achieve this, model experiments of compression and unloading of a stack of mats embedded in a model matrix were carried out. This springback experiment enabled the unloading behavior of the fiber preform to be studied; for instance, the influence of the matrix viscosity on the kinetics of the process. Deconsolidation experiments were also carried out for GMT parts: the consolidated samples were reheated at processing temperatures for different times. Comparing these different experimental results with theory has shown that the deconsolidation phenomenon is mainly governed by the stress/strain behavior of the preform upon unloading. However, the kinetics of deconsolidation are also influenced by the void formation and growth that appear during reheating. Moreover, it was found that the springback effect of the preform leads to tensile forces in the matrix, which enhance void growth. A correlation between the elastic behavior of the fiber and the growth of air bubbles in the matrix was then demonstrated. Since it was observed that the mechanical behavior of the preform plays a major role in the deconsolidation phenomenon, the study on the springback effect was completed by a comparison between two different glass fiber and polypropylene systems. The classic GMT studied previously was compared with a new type of commingled glass and polypropylene fibers. Compressive tests on both dry preforms, as well as consolidation and deconsolidation experiments showed that the commingled system presents a higher void content after deconsolidation than the classic GMT. A porosity of respectively 72 % and 55 % was measured. It was demonstrated that differences in glass fiber arrangement are at the origin of the result. Finally, the deconsolidation of a GMT part in the solid sate was investigated. The role of the matrix which often exhibits a viscoelastic behavior and which may lead to distorsion of the part, was emphasized. After, for instance, 3 months at 100 °C, the part showed no significant void content increase whereas, it was observed that thermal effects may affect the adhesion between the matrix and the fibers, thereby leading to decohesion of the part. This study demonstrated that a combination of numerical approach and experimental observations leads to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms governing consolidation and deconsolidation and then opens the path for an optimization of processing parameters and choice of materials...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Radial flow {{experiment}} {{is often used}} to measure the permeability of fibrous porous media by the composites processing community. However, very little work has been done to calibrate the radial flow set-up with media of known permeability. This article presents a new method for calibrating the permeability measuring set-ups based on radial flows. A reference medium in the form of two concentric annular slits is created for the radial <b>flow</b> <b>mold</b> whose permeability is estimated analytically and numerically. It is observed that the experimentally measured permeability deviates from the theoretical and numerical permeabilities with an increase in the flow rate for an injection setup using a gear pump as well as a piston-cylinder pump. The deviation can be attributed to two possible reasons: one is the leakage between the calibration device and mold plate surfaces because of a slight mold deformation at higher flow rates, the other one is the increase in the gap clearance of the reference medium because of the higher gap pressures at higher flow rates. No such deviation is observed while measuring the permeability of a fiber mat at different flow rates. Hence, the proposed reference medium can calibrate a conventional radial flow-based permeability measuring setups at low flow rates; the accuracy thus obtained can be extended to higher flow rates as well if permeability of a fiber mat can be shown to remain constant with the flow rate...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Variabilities in preform {{permeability}} {{can lead}} to the formation of dry spots and nonuniform <b>flow</b> progression during <b>mold</b> filling in the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. Real-time flow control can improve fill uniformity and eliminate potential fill related defects. Flow control schemes commonly manipulate the inlet pressures or flow rates and have been shown in the literature to be limited in their ability to steer the flow in regions far from the inlet ports [1]. A viable solution to this problem is localized heating of the resin during the mold filling process, which can reduce the local viscosity of the flowing resin to compensate for spatial preform permeability variation. In this paper localized heating is achieved using an induction heater with carbon fiber susceptors embedded in the preform layup. This type of control must be applied to the VARTM process {{in such a way as}} to heat in the lagging regions while avoiding overheating and thus prematurely curing the resin. To this end, this paper presents a real time control strategy that is demonstrated in a lab scale experimental setup, and is shown to be successful in improving the uniformity of the <b>flow</b> during <b>mold</b> filling of heterogeneous preform layups...|$|R

Increasing EMBr strength at a constant SEN depth is found to cause a deeper jet impingement, weaker upper recirculation zone and meniscus velocity, and a smaller meniscus wave. Increasing SEN depth without EMBr caused the same trends. Increasing SEN depth at a constant EMBr strength brought about the opposite: higher meniscus velocity, larger meniscus wave, and deeper penetration depth.
