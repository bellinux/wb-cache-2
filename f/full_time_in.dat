25|$|In 1993, Feyenoord secured another Dutch Championship {{by beating}} Groningen 5–0 {{in the last}} league match of the season. The match was played at the Oosterpark Stadion in Groningen, so 40.000 Feyenoord fans watched the game on giant screens in De Kuip. The title was {{followed}} by another two Dutch Cups in 1994 (beating NEC 2–1) and 1995 (beating Volendam 2–1). During the 1994–95 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Feyenoord reached the quarter finals after beating Werder Bremen in the second round. They eventually lost to Real Zaragoza. In the quarter-finals in the 1995 KNVB Cup, Feyenoord visited Ajax, which would win the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League later that season. Ajax was leading 1–0 when Ruud Heus equalised with a penalty just before <b>full</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> extra time, Feyenoord became the only team to defeat Ajax the same season they won the Eredivisie and the Champions League unbeaten. The goal scored by Mike Obiku was the decider as the new golden goal rule became in use. During the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Everton and Borussia Mönchengladbach were beaten. A total of 14,000 Feyenoord fans travelled to Germany to support the team against Mönchengladbach. Feyenoord were eliminated in the semi-finals by a Carsten Jancker-inspired Rapid Wien.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{division}} was engaged <b>full</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> its defensive role {{as well as}} maintaining constructed defences, it found little time to provide its battalions with field training. As a result, battalions were switched out with those from the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division {{for a period of}} one month. In the event of an actual invasion, it was intended that the battalions return to their original assignments. For example, the 4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (Ox and Bucks) moved to the coastal area and replaced a battalion from the Devon and Cornwall Division who then moved inland for training. The regimental history of the Ox and Bucks noted that they had to leave behind equipment and rear area and specialist personnel in order to make up the equipment deficiencies of the beach defence units {{in order for them to}} complete their training. The division did not solely rely on the 48th to provide training, and did engage in its own training activities. However, in an analysis of the use of umpires during such exercises, historian Timothy Harrison Place highlighted an example involving the 8th Battalion, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment: [...] "Lance-Corporal R.I. Higgins ... took part in a night patrol that captured the opposing brigadier and his staff. For their trouble the umpires made Higgins and his comrades the victims of a retrospective artillery concentration and the brigadier carried on as if nothing had happened – as indeed did Higgins' patrol, resurrected after a short rest." ...|$|E
