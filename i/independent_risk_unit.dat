40|$|Background: Health care-associated {{bloodstream}} infection (HABSI) {{is a frequent}} complication in neonatal intensive care. Research on risk factors stratified by birth weight and adjusted for severity of illness and comorbidities is limited. Our objective is to describe <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for HABSI in critically ill neonates with emphasis on risk variation between birth weight groups. Methods: We performed a single-center historical cohort study in a tertiary referral center. A neonatal intensive care-audit system was used to identify eligible neonates admitted for 72 hours (2002 - 2011). HABSI is defined according to National Institute of Child Health and Human Development criteria. Risk factors for HABSI were assessed by univariate and logistic regression analysis for the total cohort and for birth weight subgroups, that is, neonates 1500 g and > 1500 g. Results: A total of 342 neonates developed HABSI in 5134 admissions of 72 hours (6. 7 %). Very low birth weight, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), mechanical ventilation, gastrointestinal disease, surgery (cardiac and other type), and renal insufficiency are <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for the total cohort. Gastrointestinal disease and cardiac surgery are <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors in both birth weight groups; mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR]: 2. 6; confidence interval [CI]: 1. 6 - 4. 0) and other type of surgery (OR: 4. 3; CI: 2. 1 - 8. 8) are solely <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors in the 1500 -g cohort; TPN is exclusively an <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor (OR: 7. 9; CI: 3. 9 - 16. 2) in the > 1500 -g cohort. Conclusions: In our neonatal intensive care <b>unit,</b> <b>risk</b> stratification by birth weight revealed some difference. Special attention concerning infection control practices is for neonates receiving TPN, mechanical ventilation, cardiac surgery, and with a gastrointestinal disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{identify}} {{the risk factors}} of bile leakage, with different severity, based on Clavien–Dindo complication classification system. Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis of 943 eligible patients was performed. Sixty-eight patients, with bile leakage, were divided into 2 groups: mild bile leakage (grades I, II, n =  41) and severe bile leakage (grades III, IV, V, n =  27). Twenty-five potential factors were analyzed, by multivariate regression analyses, to identify <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors of bile leakage. ResultsThe <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors of bile leakage, for the entire cohort, included attacks of acute cholangitis within 1 month, associated biliary-enteric anastomosis (BEA), associated hepatectomy and previous biliary surgery. The <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for patients with mild bile leakage were attacks of acute cholangitis within 1 month, associated hepatectomy, {{and a history of}} previous biliary surgery. Similarly, the <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for patients with severe bile leakage were attacks of acute cholangitis within 1 month, associated hepatectomy, and associated BEA. ConclusionsRisk factors for mild and severe postoperative bile leakage, in bile duct stones, were different...|$|R

40|$|Severe caustic {{injury to}} the {{gastrointestinal}} tract carries {{a high risk of}} luminal strictures. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify predicting factors for progress of caustic injury to gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) and esophageal strictures (ES), using modified endoscopic mucosal injury grading scale. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with caustic injuries to the gastrointestinal tract in our hospital in the past 7 years. We enrolled 108 patients (49 male, 59 female, mean age 50. 1 years, range 18 – 86) after applying strict exclusion criteria. All patients received early upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 24 hours of ingestion. Grade III stomach injuries were found in 58 patients (53. 7 %); 43 (39. 8 %) esophageal, and 13 (12 %) duodenal. Of the 108 patients, 10 (9. 3 %) died during the acute stage. Age over 60 years (OR 4. 725, P= 0. 029) was an <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor of mortality for patients after corrosive injury. Among the 98 survivors, 36 developed luminal strictures (37. 1 %) : ES in 18 patients (18. 6 %), GOO in 7 (7. 2 %), and both ES and GOO in 11 (11. 3 %). Grade III esophageal (OR 3. 079, P= 0. 039) or stomach (OR 18. 972, P= 0. 007) injuries were <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for obstructions. Age[*]≥ 60 years was the <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor for mortality after corrosive injury of GI tract.

40|$|Background. Prehospital volume therapy remains {{widely used}} after trauma, while {{evidence}} regarding its disadvantages is growing. The primary {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the volume administered in a prehospital setting as an <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor for mortality. Material and Methods. Patients who met the following criteria were analyzed retrospectively: Injury Severity Score = 16, primary admission (between 2002 and 2010), and age = 16 years. The following data had to be available: volume administered (including packed red cells), blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, therapeutic measures, and laboratory results. Following a univariate analysis, <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for mortality after trauma were investigated using a multivariate regression analysis. Results. A collective of 7, 641 patients met the inclusion criteria, showing that increasing volumes administered in a prehospital setting were an <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor for mortality (odds ratio: 1. 34). This tendency was even more pronounced in patients without severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (odds ratio: 2. 71), while the opposite tendency was observed in patients with TBI. Conclusions. Prehospital volume therapy in patients without severe TBI represents an <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor for mortality. In such cases, respiratory and circulatory conditions should be stabilized during permissive hypotension, and patient transfer should not be delayed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} standard risk aversion. A von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function has standard risk aversion if any risk makes a small reduction in wealth more painful (in the sense of an increased reduction in expected utility) also makes any undesirable, <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> more painful. It is shown that, given monotonicity and concavity, the combination of decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing absolute prudence is necessary and sufficient for standard risk aversion. Standard risk aversion is shown to imply not only Pratt and Zeckhauser's 'proper risk aversion" (individually undesirable, <b>independent</b> <b>risks</b> always being jointly undesirable), but also that being forced to face an undesirable risk reduces the optimal investment in a risky security with and independent return. Similar results are established for the effect of broad class of increases in one risk on the desirability of (or optimal investment in) a second, <b>independent</b> <b>risk.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Coronary artery lesions (CALs) {{are known}} to be the main {{complication}} in children with Kawasaki disease (KD). Instead of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroid therapy has been accepted to be used for children with KD who are unresponsive to IVIG. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for CALs in children with KD. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 2331 children with KD from January 2005 to December 2014. To identify the <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for CALs, multivariable logistic regression models were constructed using significant variables identified from univariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The incidence of CALs was 36. 0 % (840 of 2331), including 625 (26. 8 %) coronary artery dilations and 215 (9. 2 %) coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified that male, incomplete KD, longer fever duration, and C-reactive protein (CRP) > 100 mg/L were <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for coronary artery dilatations. On the other hand, male, incomplete KD, longer fever duration, prolonged days of illness at the initial treatment, corticosteroid therapy, sodium ≤ 133 mmol/L, and albumin < 35 g/L were the <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for CAAs. In addition, corticosteroid therapy, prolonged days of illness at the initial treatment, and albumin < 35 g/L were the <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factors for giant CAAs. Conclusions: CALs might be associated with male sex, incomplete KD, longer fever duration, prolonged days of illness at the initial treatment, albumin 100 mg/L, and corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroid therapy was an <b>independent</b> <b>risk</b> factor for CAAs and giant CAAs. Thus, corticosteroids should be used with caution in the treatment of KD with the risk for CALs...|$|R
