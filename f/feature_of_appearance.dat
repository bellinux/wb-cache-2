40|$|Body dysmorphic {{disorder}} (BDD) is {{a mental}} disorder with {{five times the}} prevalence of anorexia, affecting up to 2. 4 % of the general population. The main symptom is a fixation on a <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> that they attest looks ugly and they may engage in repetitive and ritualistic behaviour, including picking of their skin or checking their appearance in the mirror very frequently. The concern with appearance and associated behaviours are analogous to the obsessions and compulsions experienced in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This thesis aimed to characterise the brain structure and circuitry of BDD to understand the mechanism that underlie the disorder's onset and maintenance. We acquired the largest BDD neuroimaging sample to date, scanning 20 BDD participants and compared them to 20 healthy controls. Three imaging techniques were reported; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI. The structural data showed reduced volumes in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, while the DTI data revealed {{for the first time}} that BDD patients have compromised integrity of most major white matter tracts throughout the brain. Resting state functional MRI showed abnormalities in fronto-amygdala and occipital lobe connectivity. Collectively, our evidence contributed rich data showing widespread abnormalities in the brains of BDD participants. These abnormalities may be the foundation for BDD symptoms, including increased fearful threat perception, and dysfunction in self-reflection, executive function and visual processing. It was concluded that the frontal and fronto-amygdala deficits found in BDD are important to the disorder, and suggest it lies on a spectrum of anxiety disorders characterized by emotional dysregulation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} how {{to model the}} <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> an object using multiple views � learn such a model from training images � and recognize objects with it. The model uses probability distributions to character� ize the signi�cance � position � and intrinsic measurements of various dis� crete <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> � it also describes topological relations among features. The features and their distributions are learned from training images depicting the modeled object. A matching procedure � combining qualities of both alignment and graph subisomorphism methods � uses fea� ture uncertainty information recorded by the model to guide {{the search for a}} match between model and image. Experiments show the method capable of learning to recognize complex objects in cluttered images� acquiring models that represent those objects using relatively few views. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} how {{to model the}} <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a 3 -D object using multiple views, learn such a model from training images, and use the model for object recognition. The model uses probability distributions to describe the range of possible variation in the object's appearance. These distributions are organized on two levels. Large variations are handled by partitioning training images into clusters corresponding to distinctly different views of the object. Within each cluster, smaller variations are represented by distributions characterizing uncertainty in the presence, position, and measurements <b>of</b> various discrete <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance.</b> Many types <b>of</b> <b>features</b> are used, ranging in abstraction from edge segments to perceptual groupings and regions. A matching procedure uses the feature uncertainty information to guide {{the search for a}} match between model and image. Hypothesized feature pairings are used to estimate a viewpoint transformation taking account <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> uncertai [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the semantics of bird denominations in Mari: an attempt is made to define the factors, or features, motivating bird denominations. Analysis is based on a set of words of inner origin {{that are part of the}} corpus of bird names compiled by the author. The results show that the ornithonomy of the Mari language, created over centuries, constitutes a well-shaped system. It reflects a variety <b>of</b> <b>features</b> associated with the <b>appearance,</b> way <b>of</b> life of the birds, sounds they produce, etc. Many bird terms reflect <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance.</b> It is interesting to note that the names of birds not seen for some reason may relate to the characteristics of the birds’ voices. In some cases, terms are based on a combination <b>of</b> <b>features.</b> In dialects, different names for same birds may occur, as observed in the sources...|$|R

40|$|A {{predominant}} {{purpose of}} vision is to facilitate {{interaction with the}} world. Motivated by biological vision, we argue that many common vision-guided activities {{can be carried out}} directly on the basis <b>of</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance,</b> and do not require elaborate world models. We describe a visual feature learning system that supports a haptically guided, dextrous robotic grasping system. It learns <b>features,</b> combinations <b>of</b> Gaussian-derivative filter responses, that correlate well with successful grasping parameters. Without explicit knowledge of object identities or categories, the system learns to propose object-specific grasp parameters, considerably improving the quality of haptically guided grasps with respect to the "blind" system. The combined system is loosely anthropomorphic in that it is guided by vision for hand pre-shaping, and by haptics during execution of a grasp, without explicit object recognition, scene reconstruction, or path planning...|$|R
