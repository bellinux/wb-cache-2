60|$|On {{the very}} day when Murgh the Messenger sailed forth into that uttermost sea, {{a young man and}} a maiden met {{together}} at the Blythburgh marshes, near to Dunwich, on the eastern coast of England. In this, the month of February of the year 1346, hard and bitter frost held Suffolk in its grip. The muddy stream of Blyth, it is true, was <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> in places, since the tide, flowing up from the Southwold harbour, where it runs into the sea between that ancient town and the hamlet of Walberswick, had broken up the ice. But all else was set hard and fast, and now toward sunset the cold was bitter.|$|E

She regrets that she effectively took away his manhood.|$|E
40|$|The {{shelf-life}} {{of frozen}} oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps) {{can be improved}} by preserving the fish immediately after catch in chilled sea water before freezing.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of DNA degradation {{is of concern}} to all involved in the storage of DNA, whether for diagnostic or research purposes. Many DNA banks are at present maintained at low temperatures, but optimum conditions for storage and handling {{have yet to be}} fully assessed. Both DNA and fresh blood have been subjected to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing and DNA extracted from the blood. DNA yield has been established and integrity examined by digestion, electrophoresis, and Southern blot analysis using DNA fingerprinting techniques. No degradation of DNA could be detected using these techniques; however, DNA yield was shown to be adversely affected by freezing, with yield reduced by more than 25 % in blood samples <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> once...|$|E

40|$|The 1992 - 93 Georgia-Abkhazia War, {{in which}} ethnic Abkhazians {{effectively}} extracted northwestern Georgia from Tbilisi’s control, {{is a conflict}} largely forgotten in the West, despite its high profile re-ignition in August 2008. Historical arguments can be made both for Abkhazia’s unity and autonomy from Georgia, but the conflict cannot be solely blamed on Soviet ‘ethno-federalism’. It must, however, be understood {{within the context of}} Georgian independence. Ethnic tension between Abkhazians and Georgians was a necessary but not sufficient cause for the conflict. It took an unstable transition in Moscow, and chaotic Russian involvement {{in the run-up to the}} conflict, to turn tension into violence. Russia’s one-sided role in ending hostilities meant that the conflict’s causal issues were left <b>frozen,</b> <b>only</b> to be violently thawed fifteen years later...|$|E
40|$|Vision based {{systems are}} rapidly growing. However a {{simulator}} that can perform the required vision based simulation for verifying and validating algorithms is not common. Due {{to lack of}} such simulators, more often than not, the algorithms are <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> after several trials on the actual prototype platform which is time consuming and expensive. The paper brings out {{the development of a}} Vision-in-the-Loop-Simulation platform (VILS) that facilitates vision based development studies on UAVs. The simulator is a self-contained, compact, low cost, PC/Laptop based set-up developed using Matlab and FlightGear software. The paper also develops a novel image processing algorithm for roll attitude determination using the Earth’s horizon in the presence of foreground objects by focusing on the central portion of the image. The Simulation results of testing the algorithm on the developed VILS is also presented...|$|E
40|$|A new {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented to efficiently simulate the inelastic hard sphere (IHS) model for granular media, when fluid and frozen regions coexist {{in the presence of}} gravity. The IHS model is extended by allowing particles to change their dynamics into either a frozen state or back to the normal collisional state, while computing the dynamics only for the particles in the normal state. Careful criteria, local in time and space, are designed such that particles become <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> at mechanically stable positions. The homogeneous deposition over a static surface and the dynamics of a rotating drum are studied as test cases. The simulations agree with previous experimental results. The model is much more efficient than the usual event driven method and allows to overcome some of the difficulties of the standard IHS model, such as the existence of a static limit.

50|$|It {{is common}} to {{occasionally}} take snapshots of the rolling release, which can be refined and <b>frozen</b> and <b>only</b> maintained for software security. This is often impractical since it requires duplication of effort. Typically, defects and characteristics of a particular software release are not specifically addressed in a separate/isolated effort (e.g. as patches); instead, they are addressed in the main software development effort.|$|R

40|$|Cold-acclimated twigs of Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt. {{released}} less HCN at − 4. 5 C than nonacclimated twigs following {{slow freezing}} to − 25 C or rapid freezing to − 78 C. Cold-acclimated twigs frozen slowly to − 25 C released more HCN than cold-acclimated twigs <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> to − 4. 5 C. Cold-acclimated twigs frozen slowly to − 25 C and then rapidly to − 78 C released less HCN at − 4. 5 C than cold-acclimated twigs frozen rapidly to − 78 C. In general, K+ efflux {{and the inability}} to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride following freezing and thawing paralleled HCN release at − 4. 5 C. Because low K+ efflux and high triphenyl tetrazolium chloride reduction are known to depend upon membrane integrity, the increased K+ efflux and the decreased triphenyl tetrazolium chloride reduction following freezing and thawing provide indirect evidence that HCN release at − 4. 5 C {{is a measure of}} membrane damage in frozen cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of dinuclear rhodium(I) derivatives of the formula [Rh(DIOL) X] 2 with the axially chiral phosphinyl phosphane 2 -(diphenylphosphinyl) - 2 ′-(diphenylphosphanyl) - 1, 1 ′-binaphthalene ((S) -BINAPO 1 1) {{leads to the}} formation of cationic complexes [(BINAPO) Rh(DIOL) ] + where the ligand (S) -BINAPO consistently displays a P,O-chelate coordination which is mantained even in solvents of fair polarity. The mononuclear rhodium(I) complexes (S) - 2 -diphenylphosphanyl- 2 ′-diphenylphosphinyl- 1, 1 ′-binaphthalene-(1, 5 -cyclooctadiene) rhodium tetrafluoroborate (3 b) and (S) - 2 -diphenylphosphanyl- 2 ′-diphenylphosphinyl- 1, 1 ′-binaphthalene-(1, 4 -norbornadiene) rhodium tetrafluoroborate (3 c) with 1, 5 -cyclooctadiene (COD) and 2, 5 -norbornadiene (NBD) as the diolefin were isolated and characterized. Both show a fluxional behaviour in solution which is due to the mobility of the diolefin rather than to a displacement-recombination of the oxygenated arm of the ligand. The mobility of the 1, 4 -norbornadiene ligand in 3 c is extremely pronounced and the coordinated diolefin flexibility could be <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> at about 200 [*]K.

40|$|A photon gas [...] semi-contained by {{a neutral}} plasma through Compton {{scattering}} [...] comprises a rather peculiar MHD fluid where {{the magnetic field}} is truly <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> to the co-moving volume associated with the mass density but for which pressure perturbations do not behave adiabatically. Using a Lagrangian displacement vector field formalism, we find analytical expressions for the magnetorotational modes of fastest growth in a background toroidal field embedded in a gaseous accretion disk with arbitrary adiabatic index. This result and the above remark are then utilized {{to assess the impact}} of radiative heat conduction on the development of the MRI. For exponentially growing, non-propagating modes, the energy equation is shown to behave mathematically in "quasi-adiabatic" fashion: A real, slow-varying function of the properly normalized scales of the perturbations, tilde{Gamma} (i tilde{k}^ 2 / tilde{omega}), can be used in lieu of the adiabatic index to account for loss of radiative pressure support out of compressive modes. When gas pressure is negligible, the fastest growth rate is diminished by a factor (1 + 2 Theta / tilde{Gamma}) ^{- 1 / 2 } where Theta = PB/Prad. For Keplerian rotation and in the weak field limit: tilde{Gamma} stackrel{Theta [...] > 0 } [...] > 1 / 2...|$|E

40|$|AbstractReconstitution of apoequine {{myoglobin}} (apoEqMb) with hemin dicyanide (FePPIX(CN) 2) was {{monitored by}} 1 H NMR spectroscopy to gain {{information about the}} sequence of events leading to metEqMbCN. At least one step in the pathway is slow enough to allow us to follow the time-dependence of formation of the product, a mixture of heme-insertion isomers characterized by others (Jue, T., Krishnamoorthi, R. and La Mar, G. N. (1983) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105, 5701 – 5703; Lecomte, J. T. J., Johnson, R. D. and La Mar, G. N. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 829, 268 – 274). However, in contrast to all previously reported Mb-FePPIX reconstitutions, we find that the initial ratio of heme-insertion isomers is not 1 : 1. This mixture is, instead, found to be enhanced in the isomer which dominates at equilibrium. This is taken as evidence for a ‘[FePPIX(CN) 2 ·EqMb]’ intermediate which lacks the proximal His 93 F 8 -Fe bond and which proceeds quickly toward an equilibrium ratio of heme-insertion isomers. Therefore the heme-insertion isomer ratio is <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> when the proximal His 93 F 8 -Fe bond is formed. The difference in this ratio of heme-insertion isomers between EqMb(4, 5 : 1) and SwMb(2. 5 : 1) likely reflects the amino acid substitution: Lys→Arg 45 CD 3 (EqMb→SwMb) ...|$|E
40|$|The Mu 2 e {{experiment}} at Fermilab {{searches for}} the charged flavor violating conversion of a muon into an electron in the Coulomb field of a nucleus. The detector consists of a straw tube tracker and a CSI crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, both housed in a superconducting solenoid. Both the front-end and the digital electronics, located inside the cryostat, will be operated in vacuum under a 1 T magnetic field, having to sustain the high flux of neutrons and ionizing particles coming from the muons stopping target. These harsh experimental conditions {{make the design of}} the calorimeter waveform digitizer quite challenging. All the selected commercial devices must be tested individually and qualified for radiation hardness and operation in high magnetic field. At the moment the expected particles flux and spectra at the digitizers location are not completely simulated and we are using initial rough estimates to select the components for the first prototype.

40|$|A photon or {{neutrino}} gas [...] semi-contained by a baryonic species through scattering [...] comprises {{a rather}} peculiar MHD fluid where {{the magnetic field}} is truly <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> to the co-moving volume associated with the mass density. Although radiative diffusion precludes an adiabatic treatment of compressive perturbations, we show that the energy equation may be cast in "quasi-adiabatic" form for exponentially growing non-propagating wave modes. Defining a generalized quasi-adiabatic index leads to a relatively straightforward dispersion relation for non-axisymmetric magnetorotational modes in the horizontal regime when an accretion disk has comparable stress contributions from diffusive and non-diffusive particle species. This analysis is generally applicable to optically thick, neutrino-cooled disks since the pressure contributions from photons, pairs and neutrinos, {{all have the same}} temperature dependence whereas only the neutrino component has radiative heat conduction properties on the time and length scales of the instability. We discuss the energy deposition process and the temporal and spatial properties of the ensuing turbulent disk structure {{on the basis of the}} derived dispersion relation. Comment: M. N. R. A. S. submission (11 / 03), 7 pages. V 3 : the analysis is specialized to the case of equal pressure contributions from diffusive and non-diffusive particle species.

40|$|The {{majority}} of overwintering insects avoid lethal freezing {{by lowering the}} temperature at which ice spontaneously nucleates within their body fluids. We examined the effect of ice-nucleating-active bacteria on the cold-hardiness of the lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens, a freeze-intolerant species that overwinters by supercooling to ca. − 16 °C. Topical application of the ice-nucleating-active bacteria Pseudomonas syringae increased the supercooling point to temperatures as high as − 3 °C. This decrease in cold tolerance was maintained for at least 3 days after treatment. Various treatment doses (108, 106, and 104 bacteria per ml) and modes of action (bacterial ingestion and topical application) were also compared. At the highest concentration of topically applied P. syringae, 50 % of the beetles froze between − 2 and − 4 °C. After topical application at the lowest concentration, 50 % of the individuals froze by − 11 °C. In contrast, beetles fed bacteria at this concentration did not begin to freeze until − 10 °C, and 50 % were <b>frozen</b> <b>only</b> at temperatures of − 13 °C or less. In addition to reducing the supercooling capacity in H. convergens, ice-nucleating-active bacteria also significantly reduced the cold-hardiness of four additional insects. These data demonstrate that ice-nucleating-active bacteria {{can be used to}} elevate the supercooling point and thereby decrease insect cold tolerance. The results of this study support the proposition that ice-nucleating-active bacteria may be used as a biological insecticide for the control of insect pests during the winter...|$|E
