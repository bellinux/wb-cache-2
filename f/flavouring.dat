5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant <b>flavouring,</b> beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for <b>flavouring.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although {{monophenols}} {{are known}} {{to contribute to the}} <b>flavour</b> of many foods and beverages, little is known about their influence on beer <b>flavour.</b> Therefore, the contribution of 11 monophenols to the overall beer <b>flavour</b> was studied by determining their <b>flavour</b> thresholds. Large differences in sensitivity were observed between individual tasters. Next, <b>flavour</b> interactions between monophenols were examined in nine binary mixtures, which showed that strong interactions like synergy and antagonism occur. Based on these results, the <b>flavour</b> contribution of the monophenols was estimated by calculating <b>flavour</b> units. These proved to be rather low for most of the studied monophenols. However, recombination experiments demonstrated that monophenols enriched beer <b>flavour</b> with spicy, smokey and vanilla <b>flavour</b> aspects. This showed how monophenols might influence overall <b>flavour,</b> even at sub-threshold concentrationsstatus: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus, {{it is only}} distantly {{related to}} {{other members of the}} genus Boletus and was {{reclassified}} as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908. The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties. Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (a symbiotic relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C.piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria.

5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop <b>flavouring</b> and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for <b>flavouring.</b> The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the planning abilities of nonhumans, specifically rats. This was assessed by the animals’ tendency to behave in response to future rather than present motivations. For the purposes of this study the future motivation in question was anticipatory sensory specific satiety, i. e., the animals were trained to expect satiating exposure to a certain <b>flavour</b> of rat pellet in the near future. At the testing phase of the study the animals were offered an unexpected choice of two <b>flavours</b> prior to being exposed to the excess of the experimental <b>flavour.</b> This unexpected <b>flavour</b> choice consisted of the <b>flavour</b> that the animal was about to receive (the <b>flavour</b> congruous with the animal’s expectation), and an alternative <b>flavour,</b> of equal familiarity and palatability (the incongruous <b>flavour).</b> The consumption of the congruous and incongruous <b>flavours</b> was recorded. When faced with this choice, an animal successfully anticipating satiation to the upcoming <b>flavour</b> would be expected to consume proportionally more of the alternative (incongruous) <b>flavour,</b> in order to maintain the pleasantness of the anticipated <b>flavour.</b> However the results were inconclusive: there was no significant difference between the proportion of the congruous and the incongruous <b>flavours</b> consumed, suggesting that the current group of animals was not capable of spontaneously anticipating the upcoming <b>flavour.</b> An altered procedure then investigated whether the animals were capable of learning to anticipate the upcoming <b>flavour</b> by introducing regular (and therefore expected) <b>flavour</b> choices. Under these new circumstances the animals consumed significantly higher proportions of the congruous compared to the incongruous <b>flavour.</b> Taken together, these results suggest both that the animals were unable to spontaneously anticipate being satiated by an upcoming <b>flavour,</b> and were unable to learn to anticipate this satiation following repeated trials. The results and certain assumptions of the study are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other <b>flavouring</b> agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a <b>flavouring</b> in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon {{in the months}} before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for <b>flavouring.</b>|$|E
40|$|Perinatal <b>flavour</b> {{learning}} through the maternal diet {{is known to}} enhance <b>flavour</b> preference and acceptance of <b>flavoured</b> food in many species, yet still {{little is known about}} the mechanism underlying perinatal <b>flavour</b> learning. Previously we found positive effects of perinatal <b>flavour</b> learning on food intake, growth and behaviour of piglets postweaning, but no increased preference for the <b>flavour.</b> This suggests that <b>flavour</b> learning in pigs works through a reduction of weaning stress by the presence of the familiar <b>flavour</b> instead. The aim of this study was to investigate whether perinatal <b>flavour</b> learning reduces stress at weaning, and whether the effect is stronger when the familiar <b>flavour</b> is present in the food. Sows were offered an anethol-flavoured diet (<b>Flavour</b> treatment) or control diet (Control treatment) during late gestation and lactation. <b>Flavour</b> and Control piglets were provided with anethol either in their food (Food treatment) or in the air (Air treatment) after weaning. Preweaning and postweaning treatments did not affect food intake, preference or growth in the first two weeks postweaning but <b>flavour</b> treatment reduced the latency to eat (24 versus 35 hours, P = 0. 02) and within-pen variation in growth (SD within-pen: 0. 7 versus 1. 2 kg, P, 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractThe {{cognitive}} {{mechanisms for}} the analysis of <b>flavour</b> information remain poorly understood. Patients with semantic dementia (SD) could potentially provide a window on these mechanisms; however, while abnormal eating behaviour and altered food preferences are common in SD, <b>flavour</b> processing has been little studied in this disorder. Here we undertook a detailed investigation of <b>flavour</b> processing in three patients at different stages of SD. One patient with a clinical syndrome of logopenic aphasia (LPA) was studied as a disease control, and six healthy control subjects also participated. Olfaction was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and processing of <b>flavours</b> was assessed using a novel battery to assess <b>flavour</b> perception, <b>flavour</b> identification, and congruence and affective valence of <b>flavour</b> combinations. Patients with SD performed equivalently to healthy controls on the perceptual subtest, while their ability to identify <b>flavours</b> or to determine congruence of <b>flavour</b> combinations was impaired. Classification of <b>flavours</b> according to affective valence was comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, the patient with LPA exhibited a perceptual deficit with relatively preserved identification of <b>flavours,</b> but impaired ability to determine <b>flavour</b> congruence, which did not benefit from affective valence. Olfactory and <b>flavour</b> identification performance was correlated in both patients and controls. We propose that SD produces a true deficit of <b>flavour</b> knowledge (an associative agnosia), while other peri-Sylvian pathologies may lead to deficient <b>flavour</b> perception. Our findings are consistent with emerging evidence from healthy subjects for a cortical hierarchy for processing <b>flavour</b> information, instantiated in a brain network that includes the insula, anterior temporal lobes and orbitofrontal cortex. The findings suggest a potential mechanism for the development of food fads and other abnormal eating behaviours...|$|R

5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a <b>flavouring</b> such as hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that caffeine consumption can reinforce changes in liking for caffeine-paired <b>flavours,</b> while pairing a novel <b>flavour</b> with a liked or dislike taste can also result in enduring changes in liking for the <b>flavour.</b> The present study examined how these {{two forms of}} flavour-learning interact. 72 habitual caffeine consumers who liked sweet tastes rated the odour and <b>flavour</b> of a novel tea drink before and after four training sessions where the <b>flavour</b> was paired with either 100 mg caffeine or placebo {{in one of three}} <b>flavour</b> contexts: added sweetness (aspartame), bitterness (quinine) or control. The liking for both the odour and <b>flavour</b> of the tea increased after pairing with caffeine regardless of <b>flavour</b> context, while pairing with bitterness reduced <b>flavour</b> liking regardless of the presence of caffeine. Pairing with quinine increased the rated bitterness of the tea odour, and reduced the rated sweetness of the tea <b>flavour,</b> post-training, independent of effects of caffeine. These data suggest that flavour-caffeine and flavour-flavour associations have additive effects on drink liking, while confirming that flavour-flavour associations can alter the immediate sensory experience of a <b>flavour</b> alone...|$|R
