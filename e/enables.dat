5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy <b>enables</b> a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This <b>enables</b> clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

The hypothesis that physician factors moderate the effect of <b>enabling</b> conditions was also confirmed, but (contrary to illness script theory) evidence was also found for moderation of consequences. Both <b>enabling</b> conditions and consequences were found to be moderated by physician factors to a larger extent than previously assumed by illness script theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} on counterfactual thoughts about prevention suggests that {{people tend to}} focus on <b>enabling</b> rather than causing agents. However, research has also demonstrated that people have a preference for mutating controllable events. We explore whether counterfactual thinking about enablers is distinct from ‘undoing’ controllable events. We presented participants with scenarios in which a cause and an <b>enabler</b> contribute to a negative outcome. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups in which we systematically manipulated the controllability of the cause and the <b>enabler.</b> Participants generated counterfactuals which focused on the cause or the <b>enabler</b> and completed blame ratings for the cause and the <b>enabler.</b> The results indicate that participants had a preference for mutating the <b>enabling</b> relation, apart from in one condition where the cause was controllable and the <b>enabler</b> was uncontrollable. Participants tended to assign more blame to the cause than the <b>enabler,</b> regardless of controllability. The findings are discussed in the context of previous {{research on}} causal and counterfactual thinking. Ye...|$|R
