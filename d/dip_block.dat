The 3 -D model has a unique grid block discretization that facilitates the accurate representation of the complex geologic structure present in faulted formations. Each hydrogeologic layer is discretized into a single layer of irregular and <b>dipping</b> grid <b>blocks,</b> and faults are discretized such that they are laterally continuous and varied in displacement varies along strike. In addition, the presence of altered fault zones is explicitly modeled, as appropriate. Simulations show that upward head gradients can be readily explained by the geometry of hydrogeologic layers, the variability of layer permeabilities, {{and the presence of}} permeable fault zones or faults with displacement only, not necessarily by upwelling from a deep aquifer. Large-scale macrodispersion results from the vertical and lateral diversion of flow near the contact of high- and low-permeability layers at faults, and from upward flow within high-permeability fault zones. Conversely, large-scale channeling can occur as a result of groundwater flow into areas with minimal fault displacement. Contaminants originating at the water table can flow in a direction significantly {{different from that of the}} water table gradient, and isolated zones of contaminants can occur at the water table downgradient. By conducting both 2 -D and 3 -D simulations, we show that the 2 -D cross-sectional models traditionally used to examine flow in faulted formations may not be appropriate.

40|$|Hard tissue defect, {{particularly}} at the bone structure, is a common problem in Indonesia causing improper function. About 60 % of it is caused by defects that occur since birth, {{and the rest is}} caused by other factors, such as accidents. To treat these problems, medical doctor usually carry out transplantation or implantation. Implantation is done by filling the bone cavity with biomaterial made from Ca/P-based material, such as hydroxyapatite (HA). In the form of powder, pure HA is difficult to be formed into a certain shape and geometry since this material is brittle and has a high melting point (1400 o c), which is impossible to reach in a surgery environment. Additionally, in the form of macro-porous blocks, they are very weak and easy to break, far from the requirements. In order to form pure HA at room temperature and still fulfill the required strength, other biocompatible materials are needed. In this work, HA, gelatin and PVA were used to form samples. The HA was derived from bovine bone, bioactivity and oteoconductivity. Gelatin was used as a matrix of the composite, whilst Polyvynil Alchohol (PVA) acted as a coating. The HA was derived by calcination of bovine chips at 900 o C for 2 hours, while the gelatin (G) and PVA were supplied by commercial purchase.

Many management tasks, e. g. optimizing AP placement and detecting rogue APs, require a user to efficiently determine the location of wireless APs. Unlike prior localization techniques that require either specialized equipment or extensive outdoor measurements, we propose a way to locate APs in real-time using commodity smartphones. Our insight is that by rotating a wireless receiver (smartphone) around a signal-blocking obstacle (the user’s body), we can effectively emulate the sensitivity and functionality of a directional antenna. Our measurements show that we can detect these signal strength artifacts on multiple smartphone platforms for a variety of outdoor environments. We develop a model for detecting signal <b>dips</b> caused by <b>blocking</b> obstacles, and use it to produce a directional analysis technique that accurately predicts the direction of the AP, along with an associated confidence value.

Directional dip filtering of the seismic data underlines horizontal events crossing the dipping layer interfaces. Some of them can be interpreted as the gas/oil contact. A careful picking and mapping of these events reveal two accumulations of carbon dioxide on each side of a system of N-S faults, with slightly different gas/oil contact levels. Estimation of the gas volume and of the density leads to a rough estimate of the mass of CO 2 in place, indicating that about one third of the CO 2 injected was stored in the reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of groundwater flow at Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{are used to}} investigate how the faulted hydrogeologic structure influences groundwater flow from a proposed high-level nuclear waste repository. Simulations are performed using a 3 -D model that has a unique grid block discretization to accurately represent the faulted geologic units, which have variable thicknesses and orientations. Irregular grid blocks enable explicit representation of these features. Each hydrogeologic layer is discretized into a single layer of irregular and <b>dipping</b> grid <b>blocks,</b> and faults are discretized such that they are laterally continuous and displacement varies along strike. In addition, the presence of altered fault zones is explicitly modeled, as appropriate. The model has 23 layers and 11 faults, and approximately 57, 000 grid blocks and 200, 000 grid block connections. In the past, field measurement of upward vertical head gradients and high water table temperatures near faults were interpreted as indicators of upwelling from a deep carbonate aquifer. Simulations show, however, that these features can be readily explained by the geometry of hydrogeologic layers, the variability of layer permeabilities and thermal conductivities, and {{by the presence of}} permeable fault zones or faults with displacement only. In addition, a moderate water table gradient can result from fault displacement or a laterally continuous low permeability fault zone, but not from a high permeability fault zone, as others postulated earlier. Large-scale macrodispersion results from the vertical and lateral diversion of flow near the contact of high and low permeability layers at faults, and from upward flow within high permeability fault zones. Conversely, large-scale channeling can occur due to groundwater flow into areas with minimal fault displacement. Contaminants originating at the water table can flow in a direction significantly different than that of the water table gradient, and isolated zones of contaminants will occur at the water table downgradient. This behavior is not predicted by traditional models of contaminant transport. In addition, the influence of a particular type of fault cannot be generalized; depending on the location where contaminants enter the saturated zone, faults may either enhance of inhibit vertical dispersion...|$|R
30|$|The Pampean {{plain of}} Cordoba {{province}} (Argentina) has hydrothermal manifestations linked to Cretaceous depocenters. However, {{they are in}} general neither well known nor carefully used, and, in numerous cases, they are unjustifiably wasted. The objective of this work is to show the most outstanding hydrogeological features and the geologic setting that control the low enthalpy hydrothermal deep systems and groundwater age in the Pampean plain of Cordoba province. To perform the study, conventional geological and hydrogeological methodologies were used. Isotopic (18 O, 2 H, 3 H, 13 C and 14 C) and geochemical studies (Cl–SO 4 –HCO 3 and Na–K–Mg ternary diagrams) were made to evaluate groundwater age and hydraulic and geochemical features of the aquifer system. The confined aquifer systems (CASs), located at 120 – 350  m depth, are multilayered and linked to fluvial Neogene paleosystems. The isotopic analysis for these hydrothermal systems shows that groundwater {{is not related to}} magmatic waters and it has a meteoric origin being recharged in the mountain and piedmont western areas (Comechingones Mountains). The 14 C ages obtained for A 1 and A 2 CASs indicate waters recharged during Holocene cold periods, between the “Little Ice Age” and the ending of “Holocene Climatic Optimum,” and during the last glaciation, respectively. The groundwater temperatures in the discharge points are between 24 and 38  °C, which exceeds 4 – 12  °C the expected value for that depth, if normal gradients are considered. The analysis using geothermometers showed that the groundwater samples were located in the immature water field near the boundary of the partially equilibrated waters. The thermal anomaly is linked to the Cretaceous depocenters of General Levalle, especially associated to the low block of the Tigre Muerto regional fault. This geothermal anomaly shows agreement with the regional geotectonic setting and it should be the result of the continental crustal thinning and the geological regional faults that make easy groundwater circulation to several depths. The groundwater flowing from recharge areas, favored by the structure of <b>dipping</b> regional <b>blocks,</b> would be reached higher temperatures (the order of 79  °C) explaining the present oversaturation in SiO 2, what implies maximum depths of up to 1500  m and the observed thermodynamic behavior of such mineralogical phases.

In contrast, the heat flow within zone II is 5 - 15 mW/m higher than predicted. assuming that the mantle heat flow remains constant across the basin. This region of high values is coincident with the location of a major intra-crustal "S"-type reflector east of ODP Site 900. and the anomaly is consistent with the presence of 2 - 3 km of primarily upper continental crust above the reflector, with concentrations of radiogenic components similar to those from granodiorite samplles dredged off Galicia Bank. It is not, however, consistent with the low values of heat production measured on gabbroic sanhples from its western end at ODP Site 900. In zone I, detailed measurements across the tilted fault block south of ODP Site 901 show consistent variations which closely match predictions due to the effects of basement structure and sediment deposition. There is no evidence for variations due to vertical convective transport along the <b>dipping</b> basement fault <b>block.</b> Once corrected for these variations. measurements in zone I yield average values that agree quite well with previous measurements across Calicia Bank. indicating no systematic landward increase in heat flow with decreasing amounts of continental, extension...|$|R
40|$|Cinder cones {{are common}} on Banks Peninsula and this study {{concentrates}} on eleven sites {{situated on the}} Lyttelton Volcano. The study focuses on the structure, petrology and geochemistry of cinder cones and discusses their eruptive history. Lyttelton volcanism began in the Miocene (10. 8 Ma) with early (L 1) activity centred near "Head of the Bay". Constant replenishment of the main chamber caused L 1 lavas to be dominantly basaltic with limited differentiation. The development of a large cone resulted in distension which caused the development of horizontally fed radial dikes. Initial dike activity was low and lavas were dominantly fed from the central conduit with little flank activity. As L 1 grew though, dikes became more common and so did cinder cone activity on the flanks. Cinder cones would have been fed by volatile rich magmas quickly reaching the surface via dikes and hence erupting explosively. The increase in dikes during L 1 also caused the increasing development of more evolved magmas that fed lavas. Then during a quiescent period there was large-scale collapse of the eastern flank, followed by erosion and weathering of the L 1 volcanic edifice during which activity shifted north-east to "Charteris Bay". Renewed (L 2) activity after the quiescent period gave rise to more evolved lavas due to the large increase in dike activity, caused by the large amounts of stress acting on the edifice. Hence cinder cone activity on the flanks was also very common. Cinder cone samples are dominated by phenocrysts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine and Ti-magnetite and show {{a wide range of}} mineral textures. This suggests that crystals have grown under a variety of temperatures and pressures and/or been derived from magmas of different compositions. Geochemically the cones are part of an alkaline basalt-hawaiite-mugearite- benmoreite-trachyte association. The deposits in this study are all inferred to have formed by Strombolian and Hawaiian type eruptions due to their small dispersal areas. These eruptions formed cinder cones whose morphology depended on numerous factors, all of which contributed to their overall development: In this study the deposits have been classified into four facies based on welding, <b>dip</b> direction, <b>block</b> and bomb size, colour and {{the presence or absence of}} some clasts. The Vent Facies consists of densely welded grey/black fused spatter and represents vent and early formed products. Vesicularity is 80 % flattened clasts with deposits inferred to be welded due to their flattened nature. Spatter flows are common in the facies due to the rapid accumulation of spatter and its flowage. The Medial Facies consist of crudely bedded bomb, block and lapilli beds. Clasts are undeformed and non-welded. The Distal Facies consist of lapilli, ash, and crystals. Rare bombs occasionally occur and the deposits are generally well sorted and bedded. Overall, throughout each of the facies, clast size and welding decreases with increasing distance from the vent area...|$|R
40|$|New data reveal {{details of}} the post-caldera history at the Earth’s {{youngest}} resurgent supervolcano, Toba caldera in Sumatra. Resurgence after the caldera-forming ~ 74 ka Youngest Toba Tuff eruption uplifted the caldera floor as a resurgent dome, Samosir Island, capped with 100 m of lake sediments. 14 C age data from the uppermost datable sediments reveal that Samosir Island was submerged beneath lake level (~ 900 m a. s. l) ~ 33. 7 ky. Since then, Samosir experienced 700 m of uplift as a tilted <b>block</b> <b>dipping</b> to the west. Using 14 C ages and elevations of sediment along a transect of Samosir reveal that minimum uplift rates were ~ 4. 9 cm/yr from ~ 33. 7 to 22. 5 ka, but diminished to ~ 0. 7 cm/yr after 22. 5 ka. Thermo-mechanical models informed by these rates reveal that detumescence does not produce the uplift nor the uplift rates estimated for Samosir. However, models calculating the effect of volume change of the magma reservoir within a temperature-dependent viscoelastic host rock reveal that a single pulse of ~ 475 km 3 of magma produces a better fit to the uplift data than a constant flux. Reproducing the uplift rates require more sophisticated models. Motivation for resurgent uplift of the caldera floor is rebound of remnant magma as the system re-established magmastatic and isostatic equilibrium after the caldera collapse. Previous assertions that the caldera floor was apparently at 400 m a. s. l or lower requires that uplift must have initiated between sometime between 33. 7 ka and 74 ka at a minimum average uplift rate of ~ 1. 1 cm/ year. The change in uplift rate from pre- 33. 7 ka to immediately post- 33. 7 ka suggests a role for deep recharge augmenting rebound. Average minimum rates of resurgent uplift at Toba are at least {{an order of magnitude}} slower than net rates of restlessness at currently active calderas. This connotes a distinction between resurgence and restlessness controlled by different processes, scales of process, and controlling variables...|$|R
40|$|On the 16 th of August 2014, {{an intense}} seismic swarm was {{detected}} at the Bárðarbunga caldera (central Iceland), which {{migrated to the}} east and then to the northeast during the following days. The swarm, highlighting magma propagation pathway from the caldera, migrated laterally during the following two weeks over 40 km. By the end of August, a volcanic eruption had started along a north-south oriented fissure located ~ 45 km from the caldera. Here we focus on the near-field deformation related to the dike emplacement in the shallow crust, which generated in few days an 8 km long by 0. 8 km wide graben (depression) structure. The new graben extends from the northern edge of the Vatnajökull glacier and to the north to the eruptive fissure. We analyze the temporal evolution of the graben by integrating structural mapping using multiple acquisitions of TerraSAR-X amplitude radar images, InSAR and ground-truth data with GPS and structural measurements. Pixel-offset tracking of radar amplitude images shows clearly the graben subsidence, directly above the intrusion pathway, of up to 6 meters in the satellite line-of-sight direction. We installed a GPS profile of 15 points across the graben in October 2014 and measured its depth up to 8 meters, relative to the flanks of the graben. Field structural observations show graben collapse structures that typically accompany dike intrusions, with two tilted <b>blocks</b> <b>dipping</b> toward the graben axis, bordered by two normal faults. Extensive fractures {{at the center of the}} graben and at the graben edges show a cumulative extension of ~ 8 meters. The formation of the graben was also accompanied by strong seismic activity locally, constraining the time frame period of the main graben formation subsidence. Our results show a rare case of a graben formation captured from space and from ground observations. Such structures are the dominant features along rift zones, however, their formation remain poorly understood. The results also provide information about transient deformation occurring along rift zones, suggesting that rapid dike intrusions modify the topography permanently in only a few days. This supports that rift morphologies are primarily generated during rifting events rather than by long-term regional tectonic processes...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{regulation}} and RNA metabolism, two essential cellular processes, are linked by Disconnected Interacting Protein 1 (DIP 1) in Drosophila melanogaster. This linkage occurs through DIP 1 interactions with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and {{its association with}} other proteins, such as Disconnected (zinc-finger transcription factor), Ultrabithorax (Ubx) (Hox transcription factor), Suppressor of variegation 3 [...] 9 (chromatin methyltransferase), and Adat (tRNA deaminase). This thesis explores the molecular mechanisms of DIP 1 function by elucidating its interactions with dsRNA and two protein partners, Adat and Ubx. Proteins with dsRNA-binding domains bind dsRNA with high affinity and no sequence specificity in vitro. Nonetheless, these proteins are involved in many important facets of cellular metabolism in vivo that encompass splicing, deamination, and RNA interference. Analytical ultracentrifugation suggests that DIP 1 is a homodimer in solution, consistent with data for other proteins with dsRNA-binding domains. Gel retardation demonstrates that DIP 1 prefers dsRNA over dsRNA. Additionally, DIP 1 binds the Adenovirus VA 1 RNA with the highest affinity {{we have been able}} to identify for this class of proteins. DIP 1 also binds to a stem-loop structure similar to those involved in long-range enhancer effects of the Bithorax complex as well as in the generation of two microRNAs that potentially regulate Ubx. Adat·DIP 1 interaction was established in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the Adat interaction with DIP 1 was confirmed with GST pulldown experiments. DIP 1 binds with high affinity to the pre-tRNAala, a potential in vivo target of Adat. We hypothesize that Adat is recruited by the DIP 1 ·RNA complex in order to properly deaminate the pre-tRNA ala. DIP 1 also binds Ubx, a Hox transcription factor necessary for haltere formation during embryogenesis. All Hox proteins rely on protein-protein interactions to define their cellular function, although few such interactions have been identified. The Ubx·DIP 1 interaction was demonstrated using phage display, immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown assays, and gel supershifts in complex with DNA. Yeast one-hybrid assays establish <b>DIP</b> 1 can <b>block</b> Ubx activation, and a functional consequence of this interaction may be to differentiate Hox function in vivo. Elucidating these molecular mechanisms via DIP 1 interactions potentially provide insight into cancer {{regulation and}} a physical bridge that links transcription and RNA metabolism...|$|R
