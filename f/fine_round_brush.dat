5000|$|Spotter: <b>Round</b> <b>brushes</b> {{with just}} a few short bristles. These brushes are {{commonly}} used in spotting photographic prints.|$|R
5000|$|Stencil: A <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> with a {{flat top}} used on stencils to ensure the {{bristles}} don't get underneath. Also used to create texture.|$|R
5000|$|Rigger: <b>round</b> <b>brushes</b> with longish hairs, {{traditionally}} {{used for}} painting the rigging in pictures of ships. They {{are useful for}} fine lines and are versatile for both oils and watercolors.|$|R
5000|$|Striker: Large <b>round</b> (cylindrical) <b>brush</b> for {{exterior}} painting difficult areas ...|$|R
5000|$|Blow dryer with a comb {{attachment}} or <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> {{to straighten}} your hair. Use medium to low heating level {{to protect your}} scalp and hair texture. Too much heat can cause damage to the hair. Adding some rinse-free or leave-in hair conditioner could help moisturizing hair while using hair dryer to heat.|$|R
60|$|The outlook {{grew more}} {{attractive}} {{as the train}} sped on. Old Mosinee rose, a <b>fine</b> <b>rounded</b> blue shape, on the left.|$|R
6000|$|LILY. Yes, it's very likely, Isey, {{with those}} <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> eyes! (To L.) You'll tell me {{something}} of what you've been saying, to-morrow, won't you? ...|$|R
50|$|Spray drying is {{preferred}} to freeze drying {{in some cases}} because it allows larger scale economic production, shorter drying times, and because it produces <b>fine,</b> <b>rounded</b> particles.|$|R

5000|$|P.O. Ackley {{maintained}} that the [...]220 Swift was a <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> for medium-large game and used it extensively for example when culling wild burros in the American West.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Thompson {{was a great}} crony of the steward's, who, being a handsome, dandy mulatto, {{that had}} once been a barber in West-Broadway, went by the name of Lavender. I have {{mentioned}} the gorgeous turban he wore when Mr. Jones and I visited the captain in the cabin. He never wore that turban at sea, though; but sported an uncommon head of frizzled hair, just like the large, <b>round</b> <b>brush,</b> used for washing windows, called a Pope's Head.|$|R
25|$|The small <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> head {{comprises}} seven {{tufts of}} tightly packed soft nylon bristles, trimmed so the bristles {{in the center}} can reach deeper into small spaces. The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a firm grip, giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach. These areas include the posterior of the wisdom teeth (third molars), orthodontic structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth. It {{can also be used}} to clean areas around implants, bridges, dentures and other appliances.|$|R
5000|$|A brush is {{typically}} used on longer hair but {{can still be}} used for shorter hair, which is normally dealt with using a comb. A flat brush is normally used for detangling neat and tidy hair, after a sleep; a <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> for styling and curling hair, especially by a professional stylist, and with a blowdryer. A paddle brush is used to straighten hair, but not all work; they are usually used on untidy unkept hair. A hairbrush is also useful in removing loose hairs and in increasing circulation to the scalp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hity-tity!" [...] {{cried the}} barber, losing patience, {{and with it}} respect; [...] "stubbornness?" [...] Then {{clattering}} <b>round</b> the <b>brush</b> in the cup, [...] "Will you be shaved, or won't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...]35 Remington is {{considered}} a <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> for deer, elk, black bear, and other medium and large game as long as ranges are reasonable. Hornady currently produces a [...]35 Remington load in their LEVERevolution line that features a rubber-tipped spitzer bullet which is safe to use in lever action or pump guns with tubular magazines.|$|R
50|$|A brush is {{typically}} used on long hair while a comb is normally used on shorter hair; however, both {{may be used}} for either. A flat brush is normally used for detangling hair, for example after sleep or showering. A <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> can be used for styling and curling hair, especially by a professional stylist, often with a blowdryer. A paddle brush is used to straighten hair, flatten long hair, and tame fly-aways. A hairbrush can be used to remove loose hairs, and increase circulation to the scalp. For babies, many bristle materials are not suitable due to the hardness; some synthetic materials and horsehair/goat hair bristles are appropriate.|$|R
5000|$|Adherents {{believe that}} their founder knew {{everything}} almost at birth due to his connection with/being a Divine Power. They also state that for members [...] "the skull enlarges and expands into a <b>fine</b> <b>rounded</b> shape" [...] due to their faith, making them more intelligent. They state their women suffer from no morning sickness when pregnant and that their childbirth is naturally without pain.|$|R
60|$|In full armour, a white cloak simply {{embroidered}} in gold at {{the edge}} and knotted at the shoulder, he rode to the Cathedral, attended by his half-brother Pedro Affonso, {{and two of his}} knights, Emigio Moniz and Sancho Nunes. There on the great iron-studded doors he found, as he had been warned, the Roman parchment pronouncing him accursed, its sonorous Latin periods set forth in a <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> clerkly hand.|$|R
60|$|In the end {{he falls}} asleep, and waking {{refreshed}} picks up his poles and starts again <b>brushing</b> <b>round.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The {{exercises}} began. A {{very little}} boy {{stood up and}} sheepishly recited, [...] "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage," [...] etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> of applause {{when he made his}} manufactured bow and retired.|$|R
5000|$|North Country Brünette, ABV 5.4%, The long, slow, {{secondary}} fermentation allowed the authentic Brettanomyces yeast culture {{to work on}} the residual sugars that remained in the beer, transforming it into a complex, almost spicy flavor profile. North Country Brünette is very tart and dry, with a <b>fine,</b> <b>rounded</b> acidic profile, and a malty, spiced fruity character. This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Next Sunday, perhaps. Doing beautifully,' the Nurse called back, {{and with}} a ping-ping-ping of the bell <b>brushed</b> <b>round</b> the corner.|$|R
50|$|The outcrop is a well-sorted gravel conglomerate, {{containing}} well-rounded, smooth, abraded pebbles. Occasional pebbles up {{to a few}} centimeters across {{are embedded}} in amongst a matrix of <b>finer</b> <b>rounded</b> particles, up to a centimeter across. It has been interpreted as a fluvial sediment, deposited by a vigorously flowing stream, probably between ankle and waist deep. This stream {{is part of an}} ancient alluvial fan, which descends from the steep terrain at the rim of Gale crater across its floor.|$|R
50|$|After <b>fine</b> {{qualifying}} <b>round</b> {{wins over}} Worcester City (7-0) and Lincoln City (4-0), Stoke lost 2-1 {{in the first}} round to Manchester City.|$|R
2500|$|Both designs used a plywood covered D-box {{forward of}} the spar, with fabric {{covering}} behind, and their 2.50m (8ft2in) half span, parallel chord inner wing panels were similar, though close to the fuselage the Wien's wing was strengthened with full chord plywood skin. [...] The V-form bracing struts linked the extremes of these panels to the lower fuselage. The extra span of the Wien was in the double straight tapered outer panels, which continued out to <b>finer,</b> <b>rounded</b> tips. [...] Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of these sections.|$|R
50|$|First {{built in}} the 11C, it was torn down on Richelieu's orders. It used to be {{protected}} by a wall, the trace of which can still be followed. It includes a strange polygonal tower perched on a rocky spur, the façades dominating the sheer drop, and a <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> corner tower. Once inside the walls, a staircase leads to a small Romanesque chapel with a charming, sculpted tympanum, {{and then to the}} musée Auguste Jacquet. The museum has exhibits on the region's archaeology (dating back more than 40,000 years) and popular arts and traditions.|$|R

5000|$|In the Tal Chhapar Sanctuary, {{a special}} type of grass is found. This grass is called Mothiya locally. The word [...] "Mothiya" [...] comes {{come from the}} word [...] "Moti" [...] or from the English word for pearl. The shape of the seed of this grass is like very <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> shaped pearls. Mothiya has a very sweet taste. People enjoy eating it, but it is found in very small quantities. Production {{is only a few}} {{kilograms}} every season. Mothiya is also food for blackbucks and birds which dig it from earth with their starks.|$|R
50|$|Most {{information}} about the Nicoleño comes through Juana Maria. When Nidever located her, {{she was living in}} a <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> enclosure, about 6 ft in diameter and 5 ft high, with a narrow opening on one side. She cooked her food over a fire inside her home. Several similar enclosures were still standing at the time, and another type of structure, made of brush walls supported by whale ribs, was also found. Juana Maria hung seal meat from a series of 4 - 8 ft long poles placed around the structures, or from ropes stretched between the poles. Like other California natives, the Nicoleño were apparently skilled basket weavers, and Juana Maria is described as making four different shapes. When found she was wearing a dress made of green cormorant skins, decorated with feathers. She had a number of possessions made of sinew and bone.|$|R
25|$|Later in the year, Nicklaus won the Senior Players Championship by six shots over Lee Trevino for {{his second}} win of the year, and also his second major {{of the year by}} {{shooting}} a record 27-under par 261. The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the U.S. Senior Open at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against Chi-Chi Rodríguez and his <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> of 69, the PGA Seniors Championship and The Tradition for the second year straight. These, again, were all majors on the senior circuit.|$|R
40|$|Broom is {{composed}} of thin pine twigs which have been tied together using {{what appear to be}} pine needles. The top 10 cm are tightly bound, and a second binding (2 cm wide) is 15 cm below this binding. Below that, the broom flares. The handle is <b>round,</b> the <b>brush</b> is flat. There is a small twine loop at the top...|$|R
40|$|Polymer nanofibers {{are used}} in {{numerous}} applications ranging from the design of new composite materials to the fabrication of nanostructured biomimetic scaffolds for artificial bones and organs for regenerative medicine. Here, we describe a simple controllable set-up for drawing single filament nanofibers from polymer solutions or melts using a rotating rod or a set of rods (<b>round</b> <b>brush).</b> The set-up can be assembled {{in a few minutes}} and applied to fabricate customized nanofiber scaffolds and meshes for various applications. The resulting fiber diameter is controlled precisely in the range 40 nm to 5 μ m by adjusting the rotational speed and polymer concentration. Owing to the simple design and capability to manipulate single nanofibers, the spinning set-up can be used to wind a single filament into unidirectional, orthogonal or randomly oriented 2 D and 3 D meshes with controlled density, thickness and combinations of different fibers and materials in the scaffolds. The method is scalable and can be implemented easily for laboratory and industrial manufacturing...|$|R
50|$|Crioceritites is coiled in an open, {{normally}} equiangular spiral with an oval or subquadrate whorl section. The {{surface is}} banded by <b>fine,</b> dense, <b>rounded</b> ribbing sectioned by periodically spaced thick and often spinose ribs.|$|R
50|$|The summit {{has a small}} tarn {{between the}} two highest knolls, and gives a <b>fine</b> all <b>round</b> view. A short and simple ascent {{can be made from}} Hartsop, {{although}} the upper section has no clear path.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he stole}} a {{look out of}} the corner of his eye, and, seeing that her face was hidden from him by the hood, he turned to observe her at better advantage. A long braid of hair hung down her back. In the {{twilight}} it gleamed dull gold. She came up to his shoulder. The sleeve nearest him was rolled up to her elbow, revealing a <b>fine</b> <b>round</b> arm. Her hand, like her foot, was brown, strong, and well shaped. It was a hand that had been developed by labor. She was full-bosomed, yet slender, and she walked with a free stride that made Shefford admire and wonder.|$|R
