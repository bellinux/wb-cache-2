40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a novel {{predictive}} medium-throughput screening method for drug permeability, with use of a tight barrier of liposomes on a filter support. To our knowledge no one has succeeded in depositing membrane barriers without the use of inert solvent such as hexadecane. The first part of the study involved development of a protocol for preparation of these barriers, which were made of liposomes from egg phosphatidylcholin in phosphate buffer pH 7. 4 with 10 % (v/v) ethanol. The liposomes were deposited into the pores and onto the surface of a filter support (mixed cellulose ester) by use of centrifugation. Solvent evaporation and freeze-thaw cycling were then used to promote fusion of liposomes and a tight barrier could be obtained as shown with calcein permeability and electrical resistance. In the second part of the study the model was validated using 21 drug compounds, which cover a wide range of physicochemical properties and absorption (Fa) in humans (13 - 100 %). The drug permeation studies were carried out at room temperature with phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) in both acceptor and <b>donor</b> <b>chambers.</b> The apparent permeability coefficients obtained from the phospholipid vesicle based model correlated well with literature data on human absorption in vivo, which suggests that its performance is adequate and that the method is suitable for rapid screening of passive transport of new chemical entities. The results obtained from our model were compared with polar surface area (PSA) and experimental log D and results obtained by established permeability screening methods such as immobilised liposome chromatography (ILC), the PAMPA models and the Caco- 2 model.

The delivery of a NABD molecule from poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles and stearic acid (SA) nanoparticles was studied using an experimental apparatus comprising a <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> separated from the receiver chamber by a synthetic membrane. A possible toxic effect on cell biology, as evaluated by studying cell proliferation, was also conducted for just PLGA microparticles. A mathematical model based on the hypothesis that NABD release from particles is due to particle erosion was used to interpret experimental release data. Despite zero shear conditions imposed in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber,</b> particle erosion was the leading mechanism for NABD release from both PLGA microparticles and SA nanoparticles. PLGA microparticle erosion speed is one order of magnitude {{higher than that of}} competing to SA nanoparticles.

40|$|Sink {{conditions}} are often violated when using conventional release methods for dispersed systems. A novel reverse dialysis bag method {{was designed to}} overcome this problem. Model drug transport rates from submicron emulsions obtained using the conventional diffusion cell method and this novel method were compared. In the side-by-side diffusion cell method, emulsions {{were placed in the}} <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> and surfactant/buffer solutions in the receiver chamber. In the novel dialysis bag method, emulsions were diluted infinitely in the donor phase and surfactant/buffer solutions were placed in the receiver phase (dialysis bags). Slow release rates and linear release profiles were obtained using the side-by-side diffusion cell method apparently due to limited model drug solubility in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> resulting in violation of sink conditions. Biphasic release profiles were obtained using the dialysis bag method apparently due to an initial rapid release of free and micellar solubilized model drug from the donor to the receiver chambers followed by slow release from the oil droplets. Using both release methods, an initial increase and latter decrease in release rates were observed with increase in surfactant concentration. The initial increase was considered to be due to a decrease in the model drug oil-in-water partition coefficients and the subsequent decrease in release rates was due to micellar shape change (spheres to rods) causing a decrease in diffusion rates. Sink conditions were violated using the side-by-side diffusion cell method but were maintained in the dialysis bag method since emulsions were diluted infinitely in the donor phase...|$|E

Homologous alkyl p -aminobenzoates were diffused through dimethylpolysiloxane membranes, and permeability coefficients increased with increasing chain length, reaching a plateau at the butyrate ester for both types of cells. This behavior suggests a shift from membrane-controlled diffusion to boundary layer control. Permeation of the butyrate and valerate compounds was significantly faster when the flow-through cell was used, suggesting that better mixing is obtained through the flow-through cell design.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} human skin {{penetration}} of linalool [CAS # 78 - 70 - 6] was assessed in three vehicles relevant to fragrance exposure [1 : 3 Ethanol:diethyl phthalate (1 : 3 EtOH:DEP), 1 : 3 Ethanol:dipropylene glycol (1 : 3 EtOH:DPG) and petrolatum]. The assays were conducted under both occlusive and non-occlusive conditions. Diffusion cells were prepared with epidermal membranes obtained from surgical donors. Permeation of linalool, from a 5 μl/cm 2 target dose of a 4 % (w/v) solution, was measured at twelve time-points over 24 hours, using a {{phosphate buffered saline}} receptor phase. At 24 hours, the epidermal membranes were wiped, tape stripped 10 times and the linalool content of the wipes, strips and remaining epidermis determined. The fi lter paper skin supports were extracted and the diffusion cell <b>donor</b> <b>chambers</b> washed and wiped. Potential evaporative loss of linalool was estimated by measuring the loss from PTFE sheets under the same experimental conditions. Levels of linalool in the epidermis (plus any remaining stratum corneum after tape stripping), fi lter paper membrane support and receptor fl uid were combined to produce a total absorbed dose value. Under non-occlusive conditions 2. 71 ± 0. 2 % of the applied dose was absorbed at 24 hours in 1 : 3 EtOH:DEP, 2. 01 ± 0. 2 % in 1 : 3 EtOH:DPG and 3. 54 ± 0. 4 % in petrolatum.

40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of a reliable in vitro permeation system necessitates {{the use of a}} precise and accurate method of quantifying the amount of permeant partitioning from the membrane into the cell receptor phase. Aqueous <b>donor</b> and receptor <b>chamber</b> fluids have been used in the majority of reported investigations, which makes quantitative permeant analysis relatively facile. Alternatively, radiolabelled diffusants have been used and flux rates monitored by scintillation counting, obviating the need for chromatographic separation of the receptor-phase components. However, this technique is not applicable when nonlabelled compounds or commercial dosage forms are to be evaluated by a cell system. Furthermore, several studies indicate that aqueous receptor phases may not present an optimal partitioning environment for certain lipophilic permeants (1 - 4), thereby impairing accurate flux monitoring due to limited diffusant solubility. Several attempts have therefore been made to improve the partitioning environment within these systems, by the addition of surfactants for example (4). A lipophilic receptor environment appears beneficial for corticosteroid partitioning, and thus, the use of isopropyl myristate has been investigated because of its bipolar properties that tend to mimic the biochemical composition of the skin (5, 6). Betamethasone 17 -valerate and its 21 -valerate degradation product are highly soluble in isopropyl myristate and this nonaqueous solvent will not augment C- 17 -to-C- 21 ester degradation reactions...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the relative contamination of in situ excised corneal tissue and relevance to final success or rejection by recipients of the corneal grafts. METHODS: Ninety-three <b>donors</b> underwent anterior <b>chamber</b> puncture (ACP) and corneal epithelium scarification (CS) before and after disinfection with 5 % povidone-iodine. Following in situ excision, corneas were preserved in culture medium at + 35 degrees C. Morphological and bacteriological assessment was carried out after culture, and recipients were followed up over a 2 -year period. RESULTS: Samples taken by ACP, CS before disinfection, CS after disinfection and a culture medium sample were contaminated by bacteria in, respectively, 8 (8. 6 %), 23 (24. 7 %) 4 (4. 3 %) and 5 (5. 4 %) donors. Contamination of aqueous humor was significantly associated with age, death-to-sample time and premortem systemic infection. Contamination of epithelium significantly increased culture medium contamination. CONCLUSION: External bacteria on donor cornea are mainly skin bacteria (especially Staphylococcus) and can be partially eliminated by a povidone-iodine wash. Internal bacteria are mainly gut bacteria and may be due to perimortem bacteriemia. However, bacterial infection at the time of death appears to have no effect on the incidence of endophthalmitis in recipients and should no longer prevent use of such corneal tissue in grafts...|$|R

The peritoneal exudate cells were separated into purified macrophage and purified lymphocyte populations. Both cell populations transferred skin reactions. However, their time course was different. The reactions produced by lymphocytes were greater at 24 hr than at 12 hr while the reactions produced by macrophages declined slightly between 12 and 24 hr. The working hypothesis was formed that the peritoneal lymphocytes conveyed a factor (presumptive cytophilic antibody) to peritoneal macrophages which enabled them to transfer ear reactions.

Here, we investigate the physical and functional integrity of the phospholipid vesicle based barriers to agitation by stirring or shaking, and whether agitation affects drug permeability of sulpiride, metoprolol and testosterone. In addition, three drugs (caffeine, naproxen and sulphasalazine) which were shown in a previous study to affect the electrical resistance of the barriers, were investigated for their influence on the permeability of a simultaneously applied hydrophilic marker (calcein), and on the thermotropic phase transition of the phospholipid bilayers using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Electrical resistance measurements indicated that the barriers should withstand shaking speeds up to 150 rpm without losing their integrity, but significant release of phospholipids from the membrane barriers to the <b>donor</b> and acceptor <b>chambers</b> was observed under agitation ≥ 150 rpm. When using agitation up to 100 rpm no increase in permeability was observed for sulpiride, metoprolol and testosterone. The phospholipid vesicle-based barrier thus differ from other permeability models in that agitation {{does not lead to}} an increase in permeability, not even for highly lipophilic drugs such as testosterone. This is explained by the different morphology of the vesicle-based barrier which is containing a 100 μm thick layer of mostly aqueous compartments immobilised within a matrix of phospholipids vesicles. Sulphasalazine and naproxen were shown to decrease the electrical resistance and increase the permeability of the hydrophilic marker calcein. The DSC experiments showed that these two drugs probably interact with the head groups of the phospholipids. In contrast, caffeine gave an increase in electrical resistance and a decrease in permeability of calcein. From the DSC experiments no signs of interaction of caffeine with the phospholipid bilayer could be observed...|$|R

The permeability for cholesterol incorporated into liposomes in a phosphatidyl choline/cholesterol molar ratio of 1 : 1, produced by sonication for 1 h, and subsequent centrifugation at 100000 x g for 1 h, was 1. 6 [middle dot] 10 - 8 cm sec- 1. Dilution of the liposome suspension did not change the permeability coefficient significantly. The permeability coefficient of sitosterol incorporated into liposomes was about 4 -times smaller than that of cholesterol. These {{results suggest that the}} sterols were delivered to the silastic membrane by the intact liposomes and that free solute was not involved in the transport to the membrane to a significant degree. The large differences in the permeability coefficients between cholesterol and sitosterol indicate that an aqueous interfacial barrier was crossed by the sterol during the delivery to the membrane...|$|E
40|$|A {{flow-through}} {{arrangement for}} electrodriven extraction across a polymer inclusion membrane was developed. Sample introduction into the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> was continuous, while the acceptor solution was stagnant. By adjustment {{of the total}} volume of the donor solution pumped through the cell the best compromise between enrichment factor and extraction time can be set. The enriched extract was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection. Membranes of 20 !m thickness were employed which consisted of 60 % cellulose triacetate as base polymer, 20 % o-nitrophenyl octyl ether as plasticizer, and 20 % Aliquat 336. By passing through 10 mL of sample at a flow rate of 1 mL/min the model analytes glyphosate (a common herbicide) and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid could be transported from the aqueous donor solution to the aqueous acceptor solution with efficiencies > 87 % in 10 min at an applied voltage of 1500 V. Enrichment factors of 87 and 95 and limits of detection down to 43 and 64 pg/mL were obtained for glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid, respectively. The intra- and interday reproducibilities for the extraction of the two compounds from spiked river water were about 6 and 7 % respectively when new membranes were used for each experiment. For consecutive extractions of batches of river water with {{a single piece of}} membrane a deterioration of recovery by about 16 % (after 20 runs) was noted, an effect not observed with purely aqueous standards...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models were}} {{developed}} for the prediction of surface-active and non- surface-active drug transport in triphasic (oil, water, and micellar) emulsion systems {{as a function of}} micellar concentration. These models were evaluated by comparing experimental and simulated data. Fick's first law of diffusion with association of the surface-active or complexation nature of the drug with the surfactant was used to derive a transport model for surface-active drugs. This transport model assumes that the oil/water (O/W) partitioning process was fast compared with membrane transport and therefore drug transport was limited by the membrane. Consecutive rate equations were used to model transport of non- surface-active drugs in emulsion systems assuming that the O/W interface acts as a barrier to drug transport. Phenobarbital (PB) and barbital (B) were selected as surface-active model drugs. Phenylazoaniline (PAA) and enzocaine (BZ) were selected as non- surface-active model drugs. Transport studies at pH 7. 0 were conducted using side-by-side diffusion cells and bulk equilibrium reverse dialysis bag techniques. According to the surface-active drug model, an increase in micellar concentration is expected to decrease drug-transport rates. Using the Microft EXCEL program, the non- surface-active drug model was fitted to the experimental data for the cumulative amount of the model drug that disappeared from the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber.</b> The oil/continuous phase partitioning rates (k 1) and the membrane transport rates (k 2) were estimated. The predicted data were consistent with the experimental data for both the surface-active and non- surface-active models...|$|E
40|$|Rifampicin, {{a poorly}} soluble drug, has great {{importance}} in therapeutics {{as it is}} the main drug used to treat tuberculosis. The characterization of its permeability and the factors that influence it represent an important tool for predicting its bioavailability. Caco- 2 cell monolayers were used as models of the intestinal mucosa to assess the uptake and transport of rifampicin and the effects of various experimental conditions were investigated, in order to establish the influence of these variables on rifampicin permeability. Different pHs (5. 8, 6. 8 and 7. 4) in the apical medium, {{the presence or absence of}} mucin (3. 0 % w/v) in the donor site and the presence or absence of bovine serum albumin (4. 0 % v/v) in the receptor chamber were the evaluated conditions. The quantification of rifampicin in the apical or basolateral chambers was performed by a validated HPLC-UV method. The change in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> pH showed that permeability values were greater at pH 6. 8, although this increase does not result in an alteration of the qualitative classification of rifampicin, which has high permeability. Mucin and bovine serum showed no effects on the permeability of rifampicin at the concentration tested. Overall, the current study suggests that pH, artificial mucin and bovine serum proteins have no influence on rifampicin permeability. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|We have {{reported}} that the P-gp substrate digoxin required basolateral and apical uptake transport in excess of that allowed by digoxin passive permeability (as measured {{in the presence of}} GF 120918) to achieve the observed efflux kinetics across MDCK-MDR 1 -NKI (The Netherlands Cancer Institute) confluent cell monolayers. That is, GF 120918 inhibitable uptake transport was kinetically required. Therefore, IC 50 measurements using digoxin as a probe substrate in this cell line could be due to inhibition of P-gp, of digoxin uptake transport, or both. This kinetic analysis is now extended to include three additional cell lines: MDCK-MDR 1 -NIH (National Institute of Health), Caco- 2 and CPT-B 2 (Caco- 2 cells with BCRP knockdown). These cells similarly exhibit GF 120918 inhibitable uptake transport of digoxin. We demonstrate that inhibition of digoxin transport across these cell lines by GF 120918, cyclosporine, ketoconazole and verapamil is greater than can be explained by inhibition of P-gp alone. We examined three hypotheses for this non-P-gp inhibition. The inhibitors can: (1) bind to a basolateral digoxin uptake transporter, thereby inhibiting digoxin’s cellular uptake; (2) partition into the basolateral membrane and directly reduce membrane permeability; (3) aggregate with digoxin in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber,</b> thereby reducing the free concentration of digoxin, with concomitant reduction in digoxin uptake. Data and simulations show that hypothesis 1 was found to be uniformly acceptable. Hypothesis 2 was found to be uniformly unlikely. Hypothesis 3 was unlikely for GF 120918 and cyclosporine, but further studies are needed to completely adjudicate whether hetero...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HPβCD) on aqueous solubility, stability, and in vitro corneal permeation of acyl ester prodrugs of ganciclovir (GCV). Aqueous solubility and stability of acyl ester prodrugs of Ganciclovir (GCV) were evaluated in pH 7. 4 isotonic phosphate buffer solution (IPBS) in the presence and absence of HPβCD. Butyryl cholinesterase-mediated enzymatic hydrolysis of the GCV prodrugs was studied using various percentage w/v HPβCD. In vitro corneal permeation of GCV and its prodrugs (with and without 5 % HPβCD) across isolated rabbit cornea was studied using side-by-side diffusion cells. HPβCD-prodrug complexation was of the AL type with values for complexation constants ranging between 12 and 108 M− 1. Considerable improvement in chemical and enzymatic stability of the GCV prodrugs was observed in the presence of HPβCD. The stabilizing effect of HPβCD was found to depend on the degree of complexation and the degradation rate of prodrug within the complex. Five percent w/v HPβCD was found to enhance the corneal permeation of only the most lipophilic prodrug GCV dibutyrate (2. 5 -fold compared with 0 % HPβCD). All other prodrugs showed little or no difference in transport in the presence of 5 % w/v HPβCD. Agitation in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> largely influenced the transport kinetics of GCV dibutyrate across cornea. Results indicate the presence of an unstirred aqueous diffusion layer at the corneal surface that restricts the transport of the highly lipophilic GCV dibutyrate prodrug. HPβCD improves corneal permeation by solubilizing the hydrophobic prodrug and delivering it across the mucin layer at the corneal surface...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the use of iontophoresis, soluble microneedles and their combination for the transdermal delivery of glycopyrrolate. Methods: In vitro permeation was tested using full thickness porcine ear skin mounted onto Franz diffusion cells. Iontophoresis (0. 5 mA/cm 2) was done for 4 h using Ag/AgCl electrodes. For microneedles, three line array (27 needles/line) of maltose microneedles were used to microporate the skin prior to mounting. Pore uniformity was determined by taking fluorescent images of distribution of calcein into pores and processing the images using an image analysis tool, which measured the fluorescent intensity in and around each pore to provide a pore permeability index (PPI). The <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> contained 500 µL of a 1 mg/mL solution of glycopyrrolate, and the receptor chamber contained 5 mL of 50 mM NaCl in deionized water. Samples were collected at predetermined time points over a period of 24 h and analyzed by HPLC. Skin irritation testing was performed with a 3 D cell culture kit of human skin. MTT assay determined cell viability; viability less than 50 % was considered irritant. Results: A control experiment which investigated passive permeation of glycopyrrolate delivered an average cumulative amount of 24. 92 ± 1. 77 µg/cm 2 at 24 h, while microneedle pretreatment increased permeability to 46. 54 ± 6. 9 µg/cm 2. Both iontophoresis (158. 53 ± 17. 50 µg/cm 2) and a combination of iontophoresis and microneedles (182. 43 ± 20. 06 µg/ cm 2) significantly increased delivery compared to passive and microneedles alone. Glycopyrrolate solution was found to be nonirritant with cell viability of 70. 4 % ± 5. 03 %. Conclusion: Iontophoresis and a combination of iontophoresis with microneedle pretreatment can be effectively used to enhance the transdermal delivery of glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate was found to be non-irritant to skin...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{integrity}} of the recently developed phospholipid vesicle-based permeability barrier {{in the presence of a}} variety of co-solvents and tensides has been investigated. Also included are studies of the influence of these additives on drug permeation and the effect of pH changes on the permeability of ionogenic drug compounds. Permeability experiments using the hydrophilic model compound calcein together with polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), polyoxyl 35 castor oil (Cremophor EL), macrogol lauryl ether (Brij 35), sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), ethanol and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were performed to determine whether the barriers were affected by the presence of these additives in the donor compartment. It was found that {{the integrity of}} the phospholipid vesicle-based barriers did not seem to be influenced by Span 20 up to a concentration of 5 mg/ml, PEG 400 up to a concentration of 40 mg/ml and ethanol and DMSO up to a concentration of 20 mg/ml, respectively. Brij 35, Tween 80 and Cremophor EL were however found to be incompatible with the model at all concentrations as the barriers became leaky. Appearance of phospholipid in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> in presence of these three tensides indicated that the loss of integrity was due to partial dissolution of the phospholipid vesicles from the barrier. The permeability of testosterone was not significantly improved by the presence of the different co-solvents, except for 40 mg/ml PEG 400 and 20 mg/ml DMSO where the permeability was increased. In the pH study the permeability of metoprolol and naproxen was shown to decrease with increasing degree of ionisation according to the pH partition hypothesis. This renders the permeability model suitable for using pH-shift as a factor to influence solubility of drugs as well as to predict segmental absorption in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E
30|$|At {{the last}} {{sampling}} time point, the receptor medium was drawn {{out of the}} receptor chamber completely. Each diffusion cell was dismantled to analyze the amount of test compound in the different compartments: to determine the remained amount of test compound on the skin surface, the skin was washed by alternately pipetting 1  mL of the corresponding solvent of the test substance {{up and down on}} the skin surface and wiping the skin with cotton swabs dampened into the solvent. This procedure was repeated two times, followed by wiping the skin surface with one dry cotton swab. All cotton swabs, pipettes, and pipetted solvents of one diffusion cell were collected in one vessel and extracted in the corresponding extraction fluid (water for the extraction of caffeine and 100  % ethanol for the extraction of testosterone). This step represented the first skin wash. In the next step, the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> was removed from the skin surface and wiped at the bottom with a cotton swab soaked in solvent, followed by a dry cotton swab. The donor chambers were extracted with the cotton swabs and the covering piece of Fixomull® in a second series of vessels. The skin was wiped by two cotton swabs (one soaked in solvent and one dry) a second time for extraction. In order to determine the amount of test compound within the skin in case of radiolabeled studies, the skin was removed from the receptor chamber and digested in 8  mL of a tissue solubilizer (Soluene® 350, PerkinElmer Health Sciences B.V., Groningen, the Netherlands). For determination of the amount of test compound in the receptor medium in addition to aliquots at the end of exposure, the receptor chambers were extracted with the covering piece of Parafilm M® on the inlet and the magnetic stir bars in the corresponding extraction fluid. Volumes of extraction fluids and aliquots of receptor media at various time points were calculated by subtraction of net weights from filled weights of all vials.|$|E
30|$|Further, single frozen skin {{samples were}} shown to exhibit {{negative}} impedances. Since existence of negative skin impedances is unlikely, such individual cases might be rather attributed to inaccurate fixing of the electrode in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> before or after clamping the skin into the diffusion cells or other unknown influencing parameters. Even slight differences in {{the distance from the}} tip of the donor electrode to the skin surface may lead to considerably different impedance results, indicating the susceptibility of impedance measurement for slight methodical inaccuracies or external influences. Furthermore, measured impedance ranges of freshly excised and frozen skin of X. laevis overlapped clearly and impedances of freshly excised skin of X. laevis were rather low. Intact human skin samples are usually characterized by an impedance of higher than 1  kΩ at 1  kHz and may be rejected below this range based on historical datasets and depending on laboratory-specific conditions [47]. Due to these low impedances of amphibian skin, only little room would be left for the detection of impaired skin samples and transition between intact and impaired skin might be smooth and overlapping. This was also shown by the additional perforation test of two dorsal skin samples, which decreased only about 15 and 50  % in their impedances relative to their original impedances before perforation. Accordingly, when impedance is already low, a structural damage such as a hole in the skin sample is difficult to detect. However, since the check of skin integrity is essential for the permeability test, impedance measurement {{does not appear to be}} suitable for this purpose and the derivation of an impedance cut-off value to distinguish impaired from intact skin samples might be difficult. Additional investigation into other skin integrity tests should be evaluated for suitability, such as the measurement of transevaporative water loss or the absorption of internal standards (e.g., methylene blue). However, as integrity tests are based on species-specific historical datasets, a broad collection of data is necessary for the derivation of cut-off values.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Efflux {{transport}} of adenosine across the choroid plexus (CP) epithelium {{might contribute to}} the homeostasis of this neuromodulator in the extracellular fluids of the brain. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore adenosine transport across sheep CP epithelial cell monolayers in primary culture. Methods To explore {{transport of}} adenosine across the CP epithelium, we have developed a method for primary culture of the sheep choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) on plastic permeable supports and analysed [14 C] adenosine transport across this cellular layer, [14 C] adenosine metabolism inside the cells, and cellular uptake of [14 C] adenosine from either of the chambers. The primary cell culture consisted of an enriched epithelial cell fraction from the sheep fourth ventricle CP and was grown on laminin-precoated filter inserts. Results and conclusion CPEC grew as monolayers forming typical polygonal islands, reaching optical confluence on the third day after the seeding. Transepithelial electrical resistance increased over the time after seeding up to 85 ± 9 Ω cm 2 at day 8, while permeability towards [14 C] sucrose, a marker of paracellular diffusion, simultaneously decreased. These cells expressed some features typical of the CPEC in situ, including three nucleoside transporters at the transcript level that normally mediate adenosine transport across cellular membranes. The estimated permeability of these monolayers towards [14 C] adenosine was low and the same order of magnitude as for the markers of paracellular diffusion. However, inhibition of the intracellular enzymes, adenosine kinase and adenosine deaminase, led to a significant increase in transcellular permeability, indicating that intracellular phosphorylation into nucleotides might be a reason for the low transcellular permeability. HPLC analysis with simultaneous detection of radioactivity revealed that [14 C] radioactivity which appeared in the acceptor chamber after the incubation of CPEC monolayers with [14 C] adenosine in the <b>donor</b> <b>chamber</b> was mostly present as [14 C] hypoxanthine, a product of adenosine metabolic degradation. Therefore, it appears that CPEC in primary cultures act as an enzymatic barrier towards adenosine. Cellular uptake studies revealed that concentrative uptake of [14 C] adenosine was confined only to the side of these cells facing the upper or apical chamber, indicating uneven distribution of nucleoside transporters. </p...|$|E
