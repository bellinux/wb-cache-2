5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight {{to the issue of}} homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E

As a result, there were {{concerns}} that serious flooding and mudslides would result due to saturated ground.

5|$|After being rested for the eight-wicket {{win over}} Hampshire, Morris {{rectified}} his technical problem, and success followed against Sussex. After the hosts had been rolled for 86 {{in their first}} innings, Morris dominated an opening partnership of 153 with Brown, who made only 44 before becoming {{the first man to}} fall. Morris added a further 189 for the second wicket with Bradman before he fell for 184 at 2/342.

5|$|Attempt {{to retake}} {{the town was}} made under the {{leadership}} of the new Swedish Governor-General of Finland Carl Nieroth with 10 000 men strong army supported by naval squadron led by Admiral Olof Wernfelt consisting of 6 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 brigantines. Swedish light infantry had started the harassing operations already in the spring of 1711 and naval blockade had been place for most of the summer. Swedish manpower had been sapped by a plague which <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> Finland in late 1710 killing amongst others nearly a thousand in Helsinki alone - half the population at the time. Same plague <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> Karlskrona making it difficult for the Swedish to equip their naval squadron Finland and it took until late June before it was able to sail delaying all Swedish operations. Actual siege by land forces was started in the autumn. However, as king refused to release more troops and supplies from Sweden for the besieging forces the siege was doomed to fail. On 2 December 1711 freezing waters and harsh weather forced the naval force to retire and by the Christmas also the land forces had to withdraw. Nieroth who had invigorated the whole of Finland perished suddenly on 25 January 1712 and was succeeded by weak Georg Henrik Lybecker.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E

5|$|He {{remained}} in Maʿarra {{for the rest}} of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet.

5|$|Nazi {{occupation}} {{ended on}} 30 August 1944 and Liberation slowly healed the town's wounds. It {{had been a}} catastrophe for the network: of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939, 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged; track and overhead lines had been mutilated; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still, service was slowly restored, thanks to the staff's hard work and above all passengers' help in shunting trailing cars. In 1945, 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational, but, despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946, the war <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> a fatal blow. Rouen was full of out-of-date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses.|$|E
