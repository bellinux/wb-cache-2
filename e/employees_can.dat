5|$|We are {{introduced}} to Michael Scott (Steve Carell), the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, a paper-production company that is currently under threat of facing downsizing. The news is delivered {{to him by the}} Vice President of Northeast Sales, Jan Levinson-Gould (Melora Hardin), who, along with the other <b>employees,</b> <b>can</b> barely tolerate Michael’s foolish antics.|$|E
5|$|According to Joris-Jan van ‘t Land, {{the project}} lead for ARMA 3, Bohemia Interactive gives their {{employees}} {{a lot of}} freedom and autonomy. <b>Employees</b> <b>can</b> brainstorm ideas and exchange with each other, {{and some of these}} ideas may be implemented as official releases, shown through one of ARMA 3s downloadable contents, Zeus. Bohemia Interactive also had a close relationship with International Committee of the Red Cross, in which they partnered together for a special award named Health Care in Danger Special Award at the Make Arma Not War competition, and Bohemia also promised to follow some of Red Cross' suggestions on how video games should handle war crimes.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
50|$|Section 112 of the ERA {{states that}} when an <b>employee</b> <b>can</b> choose {{to bring an}} action under the ERA or the Human Rights Act 1993 the <b>employee</b> <b>can</b> not bring an action under both acts.Section 114 of the ERA states that a {{personal}} grievance must be raised with the employer within 90 days.|$|R

Only funded schemes can be registered.|$|E

25|$|Businesses {{with ten}} or fewer <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> use the {{exchange}} {{in the first}} year after the act begins. The cutoff changes to twenty or fewer employees the next year. On the third year, the 'Health Choices Commissioner' has the authority to phase in businesses with more employees. The legislation does not specify any further phases, leaving that up to the officer to decide.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{its efforts}} in the Positive Energy Buildings Consortium, Intel has been {{developing}} an application, called Personal Office Energy Monitor (POEM), to help office buildings to be more energy-efficient. With this application, <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> get the power consumption info for their office machines, {{so that they can}} figure out a better way to save energy in their working environment.|$|E
25|$|Through {{incentive}} compensation structures, <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> {{be guided}} {{to focus their}} attention and efforts on certain organizational goals. The goals that are reinforced through incentive pay should be carefully considered {{to make sure they}} are in alignment with the organizational objectives. If there are multiple rewards programs, it is important to consider if there might be any conflicting goals. For example, individual and team-based rewards can sometime work at cross-purposes.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of organizational change and stress management {{is often the}} most useful approach for preventing stress at work. Both organizations and <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> employ strategies at organizational and individual levels. Generally, organizational level strategies include job procedure modification and employee assistance programs (EAP). Individual level strategies include taking vacation. Getting a realistic job preview to understand the normal workload and schedules of the job will also help people to identify {{whether or not the}} job fit them.|$|E
25|$|Part of Title I {{was found}} unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court as it {{pertains}} to states in the case of Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State <b>employees</b> <b>can,</b> however, file complaints at the Department of Justice or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who can sue on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, Nova amended its working {{times for}} {{instructors}} and standardized lesson length to 40 minutes, with two minutes either side for lesson planning and student evaluation, {{resulting in a}} total lesson time of 44 minutes. Six to eleven minutes of unpaid time was left between classes. As a result of changes to working hours, regular non-titled teachers whose work weeks were reduced to slightly under 30 hours became ineligible for shakai hoken, giving an estimated savings to the company of over one billion yen in annual premium payments. Such <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> register for National Health Insurance (a different system to Shakai Hoken), although this system does not offer coverage for time taken off work due to illness. Nova also offered its own private insurance program.|$|E

25|$|The MTA {{continues}} {{to struggle with}} passengers who purchase day passes, use them, then resell them at a direct loss to the agency. State employees who possess a Maryland State Employee ID card can ride MTA local bus, Light Rail, and the Metro Subway free of charge. Any state employee with the ID card can get a continuation ticket {{to get through the}} gates on the Metro Subway. For the bus, the person shows the state employee ID card to the driver when boarding. On the Light Rail, they have to show the ID card only {{in the event of a}} fare inspection while other passengers show their tickets. MTA <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> also ride free of charge if they carry their MTA employee ID card.|$|E
25|$|Employee {{participants}} {{can choose}} to contribute 3%, 4% or 8% of their gross pay, and can switch rates three months after setting a rate (unless employers agree to a shorter time frame). These contributions are deducted from an employee's pay, and sent by the employer to Inland Revenue alongside their PAYE tax returns. The self-employed and unemployed can choose how much they want to contribute; while most KiwiSaver schemes have minimum contribution amounts for people in this category, several schemes allow any level of contributions. All eligible participants aged 18 to 64 starting a new job, with some exceptions, are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. New <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> choose to opt out from day 14 to day 56 of their employment.|$|E
500|$|SAS has {{a limited}} {{corporate}} hierarchy and an egalitarian culture. [...] As the company grew it created new divisions, instead of layers of management, creating a flat, simple organizational structure. According to professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from Stanford, {{there are only}} three levels in the organization and CEO Jim Goodnight has 27 people who directly report to him. The organizational structure is fluid and <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> change roles rapidly.|$|E
40|$|Gu (2002) {{introduces}} proportional-strike {{options to}} study a residential real estate pro-gram in China. Under this program, a state <b>employee</b> <b>can</b> buy her house {{at a fraction of}} the market price. The <b>employee</b> <b>can</b> also qualify for a subsidized mortgage. Given that the homeowner has the option, but not the obligation, of taking the subsidy, we show that the solution of the housing problem derived by Gu can be wrong. We provide a numerical example to illustrate the point. JEL Classification: G 13, J 3...|$|R

500|$|Also in 1999, Steve Dahl {{admitted}} secretly recording conversations among staffers at WCKG {{because he}} suspected {{they were talking}} about him behind his back. In snippets Dahl has played on his afternoon show, two station <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> be heard mocking him as [...] "Steve Dull" [...] and ridiculing his show. Dahl said, [...] "I did it within my organization to confirm my suspicions. This was in a studio filled with microphones and cameras. Legally, I don't feel they had any expectation of privacy in that case." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{exceptions}} to normal infringement such as fair dealing do not apply, {{the right to}} object to derogatory treatment has its own, individualised exceptions. When works are created by employees of a company {{in the course of}} their work, the company or its other <b>employees</b> <b>can</b> alter the work in question, with the author's rights [...] "giving way to the light of business reality". This exception does not apply if the employee has already been identified on the work, either at the time of alteration or at any point beforehand. Another exception allows for the alteration of work in order to avoid committing a criminal offence, such as one of those under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.|$|E
500|$|No {{more than}} 1,800 {{copies of the}} 17-by-22-inch (559 by 432mm) [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster were printed. It was not {{initially}} seen beyond several Westinghouse factories in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the midwestern U.S., where it {{was scheduled to be}} displayed for two five-day work weeks starting Monday, February 15, 1943. The targeted factories were making plasticized helmet liners impregnated with Micarta, a phenolic resin invented by Westinghouse. Mostly women were employed in this enterprise, which yielded some 13million helmet liners {{over the course of the}} war. The slogan [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] was probably not interpreted by the factory workers as empowering to women alone; they had been subjected to a series of paternalistic, controlling posters promoting management authority, employee capability and company unity, and the workers would likely have understood the image to mean [...] "Westinghouse <b>Employees</b> <b>Can</b> Do It", all working together. The upbeat image served as gentle propaganda to boost employee morale and keep production from lagging. The pictured red, white and blue clothing was a subtle call to patriotism, one of the frequent tactics of corporate war production committees.|$|E
