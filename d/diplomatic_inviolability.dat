5000|$|The French Foreign Affairs Ministry {{stated in}} January 2012 that French {{residents}} in Canada would indeed {{be able to}} elect a representative for the French communities of North America, even as the Canadian Foreign Affairs Ministry reiterated {{that this was not}} acceptable. Le Monde wrote that there would probably be a [...] "de facto compromise", whereby Canada would tacitly recognise the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> of French consulates where the voting would take place. This was what had happened for the election of a Tunisian constituent assembly in October 2011, where Canada had objected to the existence of [...] "international districts" [...] for the Tunisian legislature, but had done nothing in practice to prevent Tunisians residents in Canada from electing a representative.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{comprehensive}} analysis {{of the principle of}} <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability.</b> The principle of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> is generally regarded by international law scholars as one of the oldest established principles of international law. The concept of inviolability in contemporary international law contains two distinct aspects: in terms of the duty of the receiving State, the first aspect involves the negative duty of not taking any enforcement action against the inviolable diplomatic premises, diplomatic agents or the diplomatic property, while the second aspect requires the positive duty to protect these premises, personnel and property. The contemporary legal regime governing the principle of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> can be seen through the core provisions stipulated in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961. Several controversies can be identified when the authorities of the receiving State face dilemmas of deciding whether the principle of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> or other norms of international law shall prevail. The dilemmas reveal the conflicts between the principle of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> and other norms of international law, such as the protection of national security, public safety and human life. In the era of fragmentation of international law, it is not easy for either the authorities of the receiving State or international law scholars to settle the controversies with any straightforward solutions, for the reason that the precedence of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> would inevitably compromise other norms and vice versa. The thesis examines the concept and theoretical basis of the principle of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability,</b> explores the historical evolution of the principle, analyses the contemporary legal regime of the principle and the controversies involving the conflicts between the principle and other norms of international law. Finally, the thesis critically reviews the various traditional solutions and proposes several alternative solutions to settle the controversies...|$|E
40|$|This article {{traces the}} place and {{development}} of diplomatic asylum in international law in close connection with the more specific questions raised by the case of Julian Assange, who was granted asylum in the Ecuador embassy in London on 16 August 2012. After discussing the historical rise and decline of diplomatic asylum, the article reviews {{the current status of}} diplomatic asylum in international law and its implications for the triangular legal relationship between the United Kingdom, Ecuador, and Mr Assange. The article submits that, although there would not seem to be a title in general international law or human rights law for Ecuador to grant asylum to Assange, there is no obvious legal route for the United Kingdom to terminate the asylum. The fate of Assange resembles that of a long series of historical precedents where diplomatic asylum resulted in protracted stays. Although this may seem an unsatisfactory result from the perspective of international law, the uneasy balance between territorial sovereignty and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> also engenders incentives to avoid disputes or to resolve them through diplomatic channels...|$|E
50|$|Key {{elements}} of diplomatic law are the immunity of <b>diplomatic</b> staff, the <b>inviolability</b> of the <b>diplomatic</b> mission and its grounds, {{and the security}} of diplomatic correspondence and diplomatic bags. Famous cases involving the breaking of diplomatic laws includes the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, the shooting of a British police woman from the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984, and {{the discovery of a}} former Nigerian Minister in a diplomatic crate at Stansted airport in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crisis was}} {{described}} by the western media as an entanglement of [...] "vengeance and mutual incomprehension." [...] In Iran, the hostage taking was widely seen as a blow against the United States and its influence in Iran, its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution, and its longstanding support of the recently overthrown Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Following his overthrow, the Shah was allowed into the U.S. for medical treatment. The Iranians wanted the United States to return the Shah to them for trial of the crimes committed by him during his reign on ordinary citizens {{with the help of}} his secret police, the SAVAK. In Iran the asylum granted by the U.S. to the Shah was seen as American complicity in the atrocities meted by the Shah on the Iranian people. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as an outrage violating the principle of international law granting diplomats immunity from arrest and <b>diplomatic</b> compounds' <b>inviolability.</b>|$|R
5|$|Within the Macedonian commonwealth, some {{evidence}} from the 3rd centuryBC indicates that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although individual Macedonian cities nominally participated in Panhellenic events as independent entities, in reality, the granting of asylia (<b>inviolability,</b> <b>diplomatic</b> immunity, {{and the right of}} asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities was handled directly by the king. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek koina (i.e., federations of city-states, the sympoliteia) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of proxenia (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. Abundant evidence exists for the granting of proxenia as being the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League, and {{some evidence}} suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. City-states that were allied with Macedonia issued their own decrees regarding proxenia. Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (prostates) of the league.|$|R
40|$|Legal {{instruments}} of protection of diplomatic missions and representatives This diploma thesis thematically deals with public international law, namely {{with the law}} of diplomatic and consular relations focusing on the legal {{instruments of}} the protection of diplomatic missions and representations. It aims to analyze selected international legal instruments and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of protection provided by them. The first chapter deals with the right of a sovereign state to establish diplomatic relations, i. e. ius legationis. Briefly mentioned are attempts to unofficial codification of the law of diplomatic and consular relations, which preceeded the official codification of the Vienna Convention, which are developed by the International Law Commission. The bulk of the chapter is devoted to the process of creation and adoption of both the Vienna Conventions. In the second chapter are analyzed those provisions of Vienna conventions, which provide preventative protection to diplomatic agents and consular officers as well as to premises of diplomatic missions and representatives. These provisions govern legal institut od <b>diplomatic</b> <b>inviolability</b> and also the special duty to protect diplomatic misssions and representatives provided by the receiving State. The third chapter focuses on selected [...] ...|$|E
5|$|Within the Macedonian commonwealth, or the Koinon of Macedonians, {{there is}} some epigraphic {{evidence}} from the 3rd century BC that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although Macedonian cities nominally participated in panhellenic events on their own accord, in reality the granting of asylia (<b>inviolability,</b> <b>diplomatic</b> immunity, {{and the right of}} asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities (e.g. Kyzikos in Anatolia) was handled directly by the king or a preexisting regulation. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek koina (i.e., federations of city-states, the sympoliteia) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of proxenia (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. While there is plenty of surviving evidence that the granting of proxenia was the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League, a small amount of evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. However, city-states that were allied with the Kingdom of Macedonia and existed outside of Macedonia proper issued their own decrees regarding proxenia. Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (prostates) of the league.|$|R
