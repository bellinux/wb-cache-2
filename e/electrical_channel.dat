This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the work piece. An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and the work piece itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the work piece. At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the work piece.|$|E

During transmission through an optical or <b>electrical</b> <b>channel,</b> images become corrupted by blur and noise as a result of channel limitations (i. e. optical aberrations or a bandlimit). If images are treated as a matrix whose elements (pixels) assume a finite number of values then there is a large but finite set of possible images that can be transmitted. By treating this finite set as a 'signal' set, digital communications methods may be used to estimate the uncorrupted image given a blurred and noisy version. Specifically, row-by-row estimation, decision-feedback and vector-quantization are used to extend the 1 D sequence estimation ability of the a-posteriori probability (APP) and Viterbi algorithm (VA) to the estimation of 2 D images.

This constant growth drives an increasing demand for high bandwidth communication between ICs. <b>Electrical</b> <b>channel</b> bandwidth {{has not been able}} to keep up with this demand, making I/O link design more challenging. Interconnects which employ optical channels have negligible frequency dependent loss and provide a potential solution to this I/O bandwidth problem. Apart from the type of channel, efficient high-speed communication also relies on generation and distribution of multi-phase, high-speed, and high-quality clock signals. In the multi-gigahertz frequency range, conventional clocking techniques have encountered several design challenges in terms of power consumption, skew and jitter. Injection-locking is a promising technique to address these design challenges for gigahertz clocking. However, its small locking range has been a major contributor in preventing its ubiquitous acceptance. In the first part of this dissertation we describe a wideband injection locking scheme in an LC oscillator. Phase locked loop (PLL) and injection locking elements are combined symbiotically to achieve wide locking range while retaining the simplicity of the latter.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for bandwidth-hungry {{applications}} and increasing number of smart interconnected devices has increased the data traffic on radio access networks. Subsequently, the saturating spectral efficiencies in crowded radio frequency spectrum has impelled the researchers to exploit the optical spectrum for communications. In particular, many developments in the visible light communication (VLC) as a combined lighting and communications system have taken place. Despite abundant optical bandwidth, the data transmission rates and power efficiencies in VLC are partly limited by the <b>electrical</b> <b>channel</b> bandwidth {{and the type of}} signalling sets which can be used in this intensity modulated, direct detected system. In order to improve the power and spectral efficiencies, this thesis focuses on physical layer (PHY) techniques. The state-of-the-art single channel modulations (SCM) based on M-PAM, multi-channel modulations (MCM) based on OFDM, and IEEE standardised multi-colour modulations are investigated comprehensively through simulations and theoretical analysis, over representative VLC channels considering the optical properties of front-end devices. The bit error performances and spectral efficiencies of DC-biased and non DC-biased MCM systems are compared. A new vector coding based MCM is proposed to optimally utilise the channel state information at the transmitter as an alternative to optical OFDM. The throughputs, peak-to-average power ratios and DC-bias requirements of SCM and MCM systems are investigated which show that the lower DC-bias requirements reduce power consumed for the same throughput in SCM systems when compared to MCM systems. A new quad-chromatic colour shift keying (CSK) system is proposed which reduces power requirements and complexity, enhances throughput and realises a four-dimensional signalling to outperform the IEEE standardised tri-chromatic CSK system.

If we interconnect these body-based devices with capacitive communication approach in a manner appropriate to the power, size, cost and functionality, it lessens the burden of supporting a communication channel by existing wired and wireless technologies.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} calibrating a wind-tunnel force balance {{involves the use}} of a unique load application system integrated with formal experimental design methodology. The Single-Vector Force Balance Calibration System (SVS) overcomes the productivity and accuracy limitations of prior calibration methods. A force balance is a complex structural spring element instrumented with strain gauges for measuring three orthogonal components of aerodynamic force (normal, axial, and side force) and three orthogonal components of aerodynamic torque (rolling, pitching, and yawing moments). Force balances remain as the state-of-the-art instrument that provide these measurements on a scale model of an aircraft during wind tunnel testing. Ideally, each <b>electrical</b> <b>channel</b> of the balance would respond only to its respective component of load, and it would have no response to other components of load. This is not entirely possible even though balance designs are optimized to minimize these undesirable interaction effects. Ultimately, a calibration experiment is performed to obtain the necessary data to generate a mathematical model and determine the force measurement accuracy. In order to set the independent variables of applied load for the calibration 24 NASA Tech Briefs, October 2003 experiment, a high-precision mechanical system is required. Manual deadweight systems have been in use at Langley Research Center (LaRC) since the 1940 s. These simple methodologies produce high confidence results, but the process is mechanically complex and labor-intensive, requiring three to four weeks to complete. Over the past decade, automated balance calibration systems have been developed. In general, these systems were designed to automate the tedious manual calibration process resulting in an even more complex system which deteriorates load application quality. The current calibration approach relies on a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) methodology, where each independent variable is incremented individually throughout its full-scale range, while all other variables are held at a constant magnitude. This OFAT approach has been widely accepted because of its inherent simplicity and intuitive appeal to the balance engineer. LaRC has been conducting research in a "modern design of experiments" (MDOE) approach to force balance calibration. Formal experimental design techniques provide an integrated view to the entire calibration process covering all three major aspects of an experiment; the design of the experiment, the execution of the experiment, and the statistical analyses of the data. In order to overcome the weaknesses in the available mechanical systems and to apply formal experimental techniques, a new mechanical system was required.

40|$|The {{key point}} {{in the success of}} the {{semiconductor}} industry is its ability to continuously provide electronic products with decreasing cost per function as well as, at the same time, increasing performance. This is a result of a steady reduction in the feature size combined with a steady rise in density. In this framework, MOSFETs are being aggressively scaled down to dimensions well below 100 nm. However, at a given device dimension, the scaling of the physical processes breaks down and new phenomena that are absent in larger structures can dominate device behavior. The SIA roadmap (1) predicts a minimum feature size of 35 nm and 10 8 transistors per cm 2 for the commercial CMOS technology around 2012. It is now quite obvious that the behavior of the devices that will build up the circuits produced with this technology will significantly deviate from the behavior of their counterparts of greater dimensions. Subsequently, if devices are not properly characterized and modeled, this can {{turn out to be a}} barrier for further development in the semiconductor industry. The main scope of this work is to help and speed up the proper characterization and modeling of sub- 100 nm MOSFETs. The term mesoscopic phenomena, the main subject of this work, has been introduced to describe the characteristics of systems that are neither microscopic (one or few atoms) nor macroscopic. Meso is borrowed from the Greek, meaning middle. In such systems the wave nature of electron transport or the discrete charge nature of electrons may become relevant. In this thesis negative differential resistance and single electron switching events in the channel of bulk MOSFETs with channel lengths down to 30 nm are demonstrated. First, reproducible unexpected periodic transconductance oscillations in the I D xVG characteristics of nMOSFETs are presented. The oscillations, present from sub-threshold up to strong inversion, are reproducible from sample to sample and with temperature cycling. No dependency of the oscillation period on gate oxide thickness or channel length could be observed and the period of the oscillations does not change in magnetic fields up to 15 T. Various electric transport models for small size MOS systems are analyzed. For several reasons, Coulomb blockade seems to be a rather plausible explanation for the observed effects. This is the first time that such phenomena are reported for a conventional bulk MOS system, suggesting that the electrical behavior of ultra short channel devices may still be an open question. Second, another single electron switching phenomenon is studied. Namely, oxide traps are used as a probe into the local channel surface potential. Studying the bias point dependence of the random telegraph signal (RTS) it is possible to estimate the trap location along the channel. It is shown that the behavior of the RTS does depend upon the properties of the trap and channel electrons, making RTS analysis a valuable tool to study effects as coulomb scattering, electron gas heating and the mechanisms that inuence <b>electrical</b> <b>channel</b> formation in very small area devices. The investigations carried out in this work intend to contribute to the better understanding of the properties of ultra short MOS devices, a necessary issue to produce optimized and reliable systems, leading ultimately to better products.

40|$|The ever-growing {{demands for}} {{high-bandwidth}} data transfer {{have been pushing}} towards advancing research efforts {{in the field of}} high-performing communication systems. Studies on the performance of single chip, e. g. faster multi-core processors and higher system memory capacity, have been explored. To further enhance the system performance, researches have been focused on the improvement of data-transfer bandwidth for chip-to-chip communication in the high-speed serial link. Many solutions have been addressed to overcome the bottleneck caused by the non-idealties such as bandwidth-limited <b>electrical</b> <b>channel</b> that connects two link devices and varieties of undesired noise in the communication systems. Nevertheless, with these solutions data have run into limitations of the timing margins for high-speed interfaces running at multiple gigabits per second data rates on low-cost Printed Circuit Board (PCB) material with constrained power budget. Therefore, the challenge in designing a physical layer (PHY) link for high-speed communication systems turns out to be power-efficient, reliable and cost-effective. In this context, this dissertation is intended to focus on architectural design, system-level and circuit-level verification of a PHY link as well as system performance optimization in respective of power, reliability and adaptability in high-speed communication systems. The PHY is mainly composed of clock data recovery (CDR), equalizers (EQs) and high- speed I/O drivers. Symmetrical structure of the PHY link is usually duplicated in both link devices for bidirectional data transmission. By introducing training mechanisms into high-speed communication systems, the timing in one link device is adaptively aligned to the timing condition specified in the other link device despite of different skews or induced jitter resulting from process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations in the individual link. With reliable timing relationships among the interface signals provided, the total system bandwidth is dramatically improved. On the other hand, interface training offers high flexibility for reuse without further investigation on high demanding components involved in high costs. In the training mode, a CDR module is essential for reconstructing the transmitted bitstream to achieve the best data eye and to detect the edges of data stream in asynchronous systems or source-synchronous systems. Generally, the CDR works as a feedback control system that aligns its output clock {{to the center of the}} received data. In systems that contain multiple data links, the overall CDR power consumption increases linearly with the increase in number of links as one CDR is required for each link. Therefore, a power-efficient CDR plays a significant role in such systems with parallel links. Furthermore, a high performance CDR requires low jitter generation in spite of high input jitter. To minimize the trade-off between power consumption and CDR jitter, a novel CDR architecture is proposed by utilizing the proportional-integral (PI) controller and three times sampling scheme. Meanwhile, signal integrity (SI) becomes critical as the data rate exceeds several gigabits per second. Distorted data due to the non-idealties in systems are likely to reduce the signal quality aggressively and result in intolerable transmission errors in worst case scenarios, thus affect the system effective bandwidth. Hence, additional trainings such as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) EQ trainings for SI purpose are inserted into the interface training. Besides, a simplified system architecture with unsymmetrical placement of adaptive Rx and Tx EQs in a single link device is proposed and analyzed by using different coefficient adaptation algorithms. This architecture enables to reduce a large number of EQs through the training, especially in case of parallel links. Meanwhile, considerable power and chip area are saved. Finally, high-speed I/O driver against PVT variations is discussed. Critical issues such as overshoot and undershoot interfering with the data are primarily accompanied by impedance mismatch between the I/O driver and its transmitting channel. By applying PVT compensation technique I/O driver impedances can be effectively calibrated close to the target value. Different digital impedance calibration algorithms against PVT variations are implemented and compared for achieving fast calibration and low power requirements...|$|E

The next work presents receive-side circuitry which merges the cancellation of both near-end and far-end crosstalk (NEXT/FEXT) and can automatically adapt to different channel environments and variations in process, voltage, and temperature. NEXT cancellation is realized with a novel 3 -tap FIR filter which combines two traditional FIR filter taps and a continuous-time band-pass filter IIR tap for efficient crosstalk cancellation, with all filter tap coefficients automatically determined via an ondie sign-sign least-mean-square (SS-LMS) adaptation engine. FEXT cancellation is realized by coupling the aggressor signal through a differentiator circuit whose gain is automatically adjusted with a power-detection-based adaptation loop. In conclusion, the proposed architectures in the transmitter side and receiver side together are to be good solution in the high speed I/O serial links to improve the performance by overcome the physical channel loss and adjacent channel noise as the system becomes complicated...|$|R
40|$|The {{prototype}} of time digitizing {{system for the}} upgrade of BESIII endcap TOF (ETOF) is introduced in this paper. The ETOF readout electronics has a formation of distributed architecture that hit signal from multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) is signaled as LVDS by front-end electronics (FEE) {{and sent to the}} back-end time digitizing system via long shield differential twisted pair cables. The ETOF digitizing system consists of 2 VME crates each of which contains modules of time digitizing, clock, trigger and fast control etc. The time digitizing module (TDIG) of this prototype can support up to 72 <b>electrical</b> <b>channels</b> of hit information measurement. The fast control (FCTL) module can operate at barrel or endcap mode. The barrel FCTL fans fast control signals from the trigger system out to endcap FCTLs, merges data from endcaps and transfers to the trigger system. Without modifying the barrel TOF structure, this time digitizing architecture benefits for improving ETOF performance without degrading barrel TOF measuring. Lab experiments show that the time resolution of this digitizing system can be less than 20 ps, and the data throughput to DAQ can be about 92 Mbps. Beam experiments show that the complete time resolution can be less than 45 ps...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{research}} is to study the interaction between electrical tree and nonlinear barrier. The propagation of electrical tree in solid insulation is of great particular concern for power engineering industry as it is regarded as most significant mechanism for dielectric breakdown in high voltage equipment. Composite material with barriers and surrounding matrix polymers are used to extend the breakdown time of the insulation. The major influence of barriers on propagation of electrical trees is investigated in this study with experiments and software simulation. The very low conductivities of modern insulating material do not permit the dissipation of accumulated space charge and charge at the extremities of the propagating <b>electrical</b> tree <b>channel.</b> High field non-linear conductivity characteristics of SiC were employed at the barrier to influence the electrical tree growth as they impinge upon on the barrier. The electrical tree growth was greatly reduced and time to breakdown extended. The tree propagation characteristics were studied by needle plane electrode geometry with five different concentration of SiC at the barrier (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 % by weight). The results show that propagating <b>electrical</b> tree <b>channels</b> did not penetrate the barrier when SiC has high field non-linear conductivity characteristics i. e., percolation threshold > 35 % SiC. As {{a result of this}} phenomenon, the tree growth and barrier penetration is inhibited, leading to extended lifetime of insulation...|$|R
