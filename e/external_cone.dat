40|$|Let L(lambda) be a self-adjoint {{quadratic}} operator polynomial on a Hilbert {{space with}} numerical range W(L). The main concern {{of this paper}} is with properties of eigenvalues on partial derivativeW(L). The investigation requires a careful discussion of repeated eigenvectors of more general operator polynomials. It is shown that, in the self-adjoint quadratic case, non-real eigenvalues on partial derivativeW(L) are semisimple and (in a sense to be defined) they are normal. Also, for any eigenvalue at a point on partial derivativeW(L) where an <b>external</b> <b>cone</b> property is satisfied, the partial multiplicities cannot exceed two...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this note}} is to present an {{alternative}} proof for an already known result relative to the solvability of the Dirichlet problem in Riemannian manifolds (see remark 0. 1). In particular, we discuss the p-regularity (regularity relative to the p-laplacian) of domains of the form I = O-K, where O is a regular domain and K is a regular submanifold of variable codimension (see theorem 4. 4). In theorem 5. 1 we prove a sort of generalized <b>external</b> <b>cone</b> condition for the regularity of domains in Riemaniann manifolds giving a geometric and intuitive proof of this fact. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author. This problem has already been solved, and {{in a much more}} general way than I did. Moreover, in the field {{it appears to be a}} standard resul...|$|E

A pin (4) has a full length thread (5) which accepts a rotation ball (6) and a connecting cone (7) and which has an elastic guide cap (8) at its lower end. The whole assembly is elastically fixed in place by a foam cement (9). After screwing on the connecting cone (7) the pin (4) is cut off flush.

40|$|We study {{existence}} of continuous weak (viscosity) solutions of Dirichlet and Cauchy-Dirichlet problems for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic and parabolic equations. Two types of results are obtained in contexts where uniqueness of solutions fails or is unknown. For equations with merely measurable coefficients we prove solvability of the problem, {{while in the}} continuous case we construct maximal and minimal solutions. Necessary barriers on <b>external</b> <b>cones</b> are also constructed...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{commercial}} spincast reels were {{introduced by the}} Denison-Johnson Reel Company and the Zero Hour Bomb Company (ZEBCO) in 1949. [...] The spincast reel {{is an attempt to}} solve the problem of backlash found in baitcast designs, while reducing line twist and snare complaints sometimes encountered with traditional spinning reel designs. Just as with the spinning reel, the line is thrown from a fixed spool and can therefore be used with relatively light lures and baits. [...] However, the spincast reel eliminates the large wire bail and line roller of the spinning reel in favor of one or two simple pickup pins and a metal cup to wind the line on the spool. [...] Traditionally mounted above the rod, the spincast reel is also fitted with an <b>external</b> nose <b>cone</b> that encloses and protects the fixed spool.|$|R

40|$|The general {{theme of}} this note is {{illustrated}} by the following theorem: Theorem 1. Suppose K is a compact set in the complex plane and 0 belongs to the boundary ∂ K. Let A(K) denote the space of all functions f on K such that f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of K and f(0) = 0. Also for any given positive integer m, let A(m,K) denote the space of all f such that f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of K and f(0) =f^'(0) = [...] . =f^(m) (0) = 0. Then A(m,K) is dense in A(K) under the supremum norm on K provided that there exists a sector W={r e^iθ; 0 ≤ r≤δ,α≤θ≤β} such that W∩ K={ 0 }. (This is the well-known Poincare's <b>external</b> <b>cone</b> condition). We present various generalizations of this result in the context of higher dimensions replacing holomorphic with harmonic.

40|$|Trees in a Douglas-fir stand {{infested with}} {{western spruce budworm}} were treated with a {{systemic}} insecticide to protect cone and seed production at three locations in Montana during 1983. Treatments applied were (1) acephate as an Acecap implant, (2) acephate as an Inject-A-Cide injection, and (3) control. Potential cone-bearing trees were selected and then randomly assigned one of the above treatments. Treatments were applied from mid- to late April. Cone buds varied from tight to recently burst. Data collected were as follows: tree heights and diameters, cone damage and infestation rate just after pollination, host tree defoliation from one location, estimate of external damage on mature cones, green cone weight, and seed per cone classified as full, hollow or damaged. Rates of infestation and damage on the small cones were not different by treatment. Foliage protection was between 56 and 74 percent. <b>External</b> <b>cone</b> damage and cone weights improved with both acephate treatments. Seed yield increased 69 to 82 percent for Acecaps and 65 to 84 percent for Inject-A-Cides. The proportion of full, hollow, and damaged seed did not change between treatments. In budworm-infested Douglas-fir, both Acecaps and Inject-A-Cides are an effective means to improve seed production...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the study, design and realisation {{of a gas}} cladding head specifically designed for high-power active fibre lasers. The new cladding head has a coaxial architecture {{and is able to}} manage three different gases with three different roles in the coaxial cones. From the central cone to the <b>external</b> <b>cone,</b> the roles of the three gases are as follows: - The first gas (inner gas) is used to protect the focusing lens and control the atmosphere of the molten pool in the cladding to protect and change the final cladding proprieties, - The second gas (central gas) is the powder feeder, and - The last gas (outer gas) is used to shield the work area and increase the process efficiency (to avoid wasting the powder). The new laser cladding head is specifically designed to emphasise the active fibre laser characteristics, such as the small divergence of the fibre beam. The new triple gas head was tested in a long experiment in which the cladding of worn dies used in a hot stamping process for automotive components was repaired. The laser source used in the experiment was an IPG Photonics active fibre laser (1000 -W maximum power, 400 -micron delivery fibre). The die was made of H 13 steel and had considerable dimensions (approximately 450 x 300 x 150 mm 3). The worn features of the dies were previously milled, and the cavities were filled via laser cladding with Stellite 21...|$|E

40|$|A clear {{signature}} of enhanced backscattering of excitons is {{observed in the}} directional resonant Rayleigh scattering of light from localized two-dimensional excitons in disordered quantum wells. Its spectral dependence and time dynamics are measured and theoretically predicted in a quantitative way. The intensity enhancement has a large momentum span extending beyond the <b>external</b> light emission <b>cone.</b> This {{is a consequence of}} the small localization length of the exciton as a massive particle probed close to the band bottom. The localization length can be controlled by the photon kinetic energy. This constitutes a qualitative difference to backscattering phenomena in other branches of physics...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{advancement}} of {{optical coherence tomography}} has improved the resolution of in-vivo images of the retina. This {{has led to a}} wealth of novel knowledge regarding the microstructures of the photoreceptor layer and its relationship with visual functions under different pathological diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Identification of the hyperreflective lines in the photoreceptor layer has been made possible by spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The inner segment/outer segment junction, <b>external</b> limiting membrane, <b>cone</b> outer segment tips, and the retinal pigment epithelium were thought to be the origins of the four hyperreflective lines seen in the photoreceptor layer. Integrity of these lines has been linked with visual functions in various retinopathies, and has been suggested to carry prognostic implications. Recovery of initially interrupted lines has been documented following successful treatment. SUMMARY: Identification of these hyperreflective lines may have clinical implications as visual function was found to correlate closely with their integrity. Restoration of these lines may indicate treatment response and potential visual recovery. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} experimental tests {{carried out}} on three ring-stiffened circular conical shells that suffered plastic general instability under uniform <b>external</b> pressure. The <b>cones</b> were carefully machined from EN 1 A mild steel to a very high degree of precision. The end diameters of the cones, together with their thicknesses were the same, but {{the size of their}} ring stiffeners was different {{for each of the three}} vessels. In the general instability mode of collapse, the entire ring-shell combination buckles bodily in its flank. The paper also provides three design charts using the results obtained from these three vessels, together with the results obtained for twelve other vessels from other tests. All 15 vessels failed by general instability. One of these design charts was based on conical shell theory and two of the design charts were based on the general instability of ring-stiffened circular cylindrical shells, using Kendrick’s theory, which were made equivalent to ring-stiffened circular conical shells suffering from general instability under uniform external pressure. The design charts allowed the possibility of obtaining plastic knockdown factors, so that the theoretical elastic buckling pressures, for perfect vessels, could be divided by the appropriate plastic knockdown factor, to give the predicte...|$|R
