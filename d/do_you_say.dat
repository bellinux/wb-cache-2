25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our people my age and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E

In November, her twenty-second studio album, So Good Together was released, spawning three singles. The first release, [...] "What Do You Say" [...] {{and the second}} release, [...] "I'll Be" [...] both reached the Top 5 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. So Good Together also brought her into the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time, peaking at No.31. The album would eventually certify Platinum {{by the end of}} the decade. What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Say</b> became her first crossover hit as well. Unlike any of her previous albums, So Good Together was produced by three people, including McEntire. Entertainment Weekly commented that most of the album's material was [...] "an odd set—mostly ballads, including an English/Portuguese duet with Jose e Durval on Boz Scaggs' 'We're All Alone'".|$|E

In his next {{appearance}} vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, [...] "What else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its {{great to see}} Anthony have six points {{in the game and}} win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance.

The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have any words. Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?" [...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), and she liked the way it sounded, and included the line {{at the beginning of the}} song. After [...] "Look at Me" [...] peaked only at number two, her record company wanted her to release [...] "Lift Me Up", while the Absolute team wanted [...] "Bag It Up", but she chose to release [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] after receiving good reception from children.

500|$|In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes {{to the point of}} brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions. [...] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a [...] "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions. Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns. The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor. Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, [...] "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> temperamental." [...] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, [...] "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand." [...] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been [...] "totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational." [...] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, [...] "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [...] was sexist, plain and simple." ...|$|E

Simon Peter answers him: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

[...] In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God, which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.|$|E
