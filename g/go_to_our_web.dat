40|$|Although {{this article}} (excerpted from the full text) {{describes}} using bottle rockets to teach concepts {{in high school}} physics, {{it is a good}} example of physical experiments followed by the use of system dynamics to understand the conceptual framework. This curriculum could be adapted for use in younger grades especially with the use of the resources noted at the end of the article. For a complete copy of the curriculum, please <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> site- sysdyn. mit. edu/cle/. In this unit, high school physical science and physics students design, build, and launch soda bottle water rockets which whoosh off the launch pad trailing a spray of water. Then, after an introduction to the basic principles of system dynamics and STELLA modeling, students build a series of computer models leading up to a model of their soda bottle water rocket systems. The rockets provide for real-world, hands-on, minds-on project-based learning, while the computer modeling gives students a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationships among the factors that govern the behavior of the rockets. This paper will describe the lessons and the models, and how they can be adapted for use with high school students of varying ages and ability levels. The complete STELLA models are included. Although this is a high school physics unit, the introductory modeling lessons, the modeling suggestions, and the learner-centered approach can apply to other grade levels, and subjects as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this lab is to help students understand cross-site-request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attacks. A CSRF attack involves a victim user, a trusted site, and a malicious site. The victim user holds an active session with a trusted site and simultaneously visits a malicious site. The malicious site injects a HTTP request for the trusted site into the victim user session compromising its integrity. In this lab, you will be attacking a web-based project management system using CSRF attacks. The open-source project management application called Collabtive is vulnerable to the CSRF attacks. 2 Lab Environment You need <b>to</b> use <b>our</b> provided virtual machine image for this lab.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{conducted}} an Internet-based randomized trial comparing four graphical displays {{of the benefits}} of antibiotics for people with sore throat who must decide whether <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the doctor <b>to</b> seek treatment. <b>Our</b> objective was <b>to</b> determine which display resulted in choices most consistent with participants' values. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was {{the first of a series}} of televised trials undertaken in cooperation with the Norwegian Broadcasting Company. We recruited adult volunteers in Norway through a nationally televised weekly health program. Participants <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>Web</b> site and rated the relative importance of the consequences of treatment using visual analogue scales (VAS). They viewed the graphical display (or no information) to which they were randomized and were asked to decide whether <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the doctor for an antibiotic prescription. We compared four presentations: face icons (happy/sad) or a bar graph showing the proportion of people with symptoms on day three with and without treatment, a bar graph of the average duration of symptoms, and a bar graph of proportion with symptoms on both days three and seven. Before completing the study, all participants were shown all the displays and detailed patient information about the treatment of sore throat and were asked to decide again. We calculated a relative importance score (RIS) by subtracting the VAS scores for the undesirable consequences of antibiotics from the VAS score for the benefit of symptom relief. We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' RIS and their choice. 1, 760 participants completed the study. There were statistically significant differences in the likelihood of choosing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the doctor in relation to different values (RIS). Of the four presentations, the bar graph of duration of symptoms resulted in decisions that were most consistent with the more fully informed second decision. Most participants also preferred this presentation (38 %) and found it easiest to understand (37 %). Participants shown the other three presentations were more likely <b>to</b> decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the doctor based on their first decision than everyone based on the second decision. Participants preferred the graph using faces the least (14. 4 %). CONCLUSIONS: For decisions about going to the doctor to get antibiotics for sore throat, treatment effects presented by a bar graph showing the duration of symptoms helped people make decisions more consistent with their values than treatment effects presented as graphical displays of proportions of people with sore throat following treatment.

40|$|Almost 40 years ago, Captain Ross Poldark galloped {{across the}} TV screens of {{millions}} of PBS viewers, vexing villains and winning female hearts in one of MASTERPIECE’s first hit series, Poldark. Now the gallant captain rides again in a brand new version with all the action, adventure, and romance of the original, plus even more spectacular Cornish scenery and rousing local color. Join us for this vibrant new adaptation of Winston Graham’s multi-chapter story, set in post-Revolutionary War Cornwall. I’m pretty sure it’s {{going to be one}} of your new favorites. As always in June, WTTW 11 presents a variety of entertaining music specials for you to enjoy. This month, we bring you concerts headlined by bluegrass stars Dailey & Vincent, flamenco guitarist Benise, Hungarian violinist Zoltán Mága, The Tenors (formerly The Canadian Tenors), and a soulful evening of gospel music at the White House – plus the return of artists such as ukulele virtuoso and YouTube hit Jake Shimabukuro, the angelic Irish boys choir Libera, and Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson in his lively new Soundstage special. Another June mainstay is our special slate of programming in celebration of LGBT Pride Month (see page 7 and wttw. com/june for details). We’ll present a new season of Last Tango in Halifax, starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, and a new drama series, The Crimson Field, about volunteer nurses at a field hospital during World War I. We give you an exclusive look inside two London establishments that cater to the very rich: Asprey department store and Claridge’s Hotel. And speaking of the very rich, we know you will want to hear Tales from the Royal Wardrobe. You can watch all of these series on our website at video. wttw. com. In other website news, we hope you have <b>gone</b> online <b>to</b> watch <b>our</b> <b>web</b> series Central Standard and FOODPHILES. We are also excited to tell you about another web series that got its start on YouTube and is produced by a local production group here in Chicago. The Good Stuff is a series of videos on different themes like Time, Recycling, Senses, and Airplanes and, in May and June, The Good Stuff will premiere new videos on Sleep and Robots.
