40|$|Background: Chronic asthma is a common, obstructive lung disease, {{affecting}} 300 {{million people}} worldwide. In the past 30 years prevalence has increased. Control of asthma is currently achieved with pharmacotherapeutic interventions such as inhaled sympathicomimetics and glucocorticocoids. <b>High</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>climate</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is an alternative}} method to pharmacological treatment. In the age before antibiotics, high altitude clinics in Europe were popular treatment destinations for those suffering {{from a variety of}} pulmonary disorders. Early 20 th century researchers demonstrated appreciable benefits for asthmatics sojourning at high altitude. Despite a storied history, high altitude therapy is not a common therapy for refractory asthma in the modern era. Furthermore, the efficacy and underlying mechanism of high altitude therapy for the treatment of atopic asthma remains equivocal. Method: The focus {{of this study was to}} review the contemporary literature (1992 - 2012) that focused on the efficacy of high altitude therapy for the treatment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in atopic asthmatic children. An exhaustive search of Medline, CINAHL, and Web Of Knowledge was conducted with keyword “asthma” and “altitude”. Results: In the four studies reviewed, there was a significant decrease in total eosinophil count, no improvement in methacholine provocation challenge, a significant improvement in histamine provocation challenge, a statistically significant decrease in CD 4 lymphocyte activation, no change in total serum IgE, and weak evidence for improved lung function (FEV 1) in subjects undergoing high altitude therapy. Conclusion: The current literature is thought provoking but lacking in quality, validity, and methodology. Furthermore, small sample sizes yield underpowered outcomes and statistically insignificant results. A large randomized controlled trial, with blinding of group allocation and outcome, is needed to further assess the efficacy of high altitude therapy for the treatment of asthma.

50|$|When P. atrimandibularis mate, {{males and}} females migrate to the tops of high mountains. At {{the top of the}} mountains, the males will occupy and aggressively defend their mating territories from male competitors. Once inseminated, females remain for {{overwintering}} for several months, under a thick blanket of snow and ice. To ensure that they arrive and usurp their host colonies at the correct time, P. atrimandibularis postpone the overwintering exit. These severe, <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>climate</b> conditions extend parasite diapause for about a month compared to the lowland host colonies, which allows the P. atrimandibularis to usurp colonies that are more developed. Since Polistes social parasites are very rare, these altitudinal migrations also give them an advantage. The migrations promote encounters between the two sexes and give more opportunities for matings between non-relatives.|$|R

40|$|Darbandsar is {{a village}} {{located in the}} Alborz Mountains in north of Tehran, at {{latitude}} of 36 º N and {{at an altitude of}} 2500 m. Its climate is characterised by snowy, cold winters and warm summers. Existing houses in this village are built to low construction standards and are not designed with respect to the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>climate.</b> As a result, their energy consumption is extremely high; especially the energy demand for space heating. These houses also fail to provide adequately comfortable conditions for their occupants throughout the year. They suffer from low temperatures during winters and overheating during summers. This paper describes how a climatically responsive design for six housing units in Darbandsar can reduce dependence on energy intensive active heating systems and significantly improve occupant comfort. This hypothesis is explored first through a detailed analysis of climate, site and occupancy patterns. Two case study buildings, located in climates similar to that of Darbandsar, are assessed in terms of their passive design strategies. Through a comparative analysis with the case study climates, passive strategies appropriate for the climate of Darbandsar are identified and the design of the six units are developed accordingly. The impact of these strategies is then assessed through parametric studies, and the final space heating energy demand of the project compared to existing benchmarks...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of glacier accumulation {{areas in the}} Jotunheim, Norway has been predicted where glacier initiation is expressed {{as a function of}} the glacier’s mass balance including gains and losses of snow by wind and avalanches. With the increasing global coverage of local scale digital elevation data remote and inaccessible areas are now able to be investigated. The model was designed to allow mass balance studies to be performed without the need for infield measurements and only requires a digital elevation model (DEM) and regional climate data to make accurate predictions. A 100 m DEM provided the topographic data and was used in conjunction with regional climate data to create a GIS of local scale <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>climate</b> variables. These were used in conjunction with predicted global radiation to model snow accumulation. A suite of geomorphologically significant measures was extracted from the DEM to increase the accuracy of these local datasets. Results show that it is essential to include these topographic parameters in climate predictions and reject standard lapse rate models. Best results were found when a seasonal lapse rate model was adopted. The applications of the model allow the reconstruction of past climate and predictions of how glacier systems will react to future climate change scenarios.

40|$|ABSTRACTUnderstanding soil {{formation}} processes across different landscapes {{is needed to}} predict how soil properties will respond to land use change. This study aimed to characterize mountainous Inceptisols (Cambisols) under <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> subtropical <b>climate</b> in southeastern Brazil, by soil physical, chemical and micromorphological analyses, under native forest and pasture. The soil under pasture had a greater bulk density than under forest, resulting in a severe reduction of macroporosity. At two depths, coarse quartz grains are angular, suggesting absence of transportational processes, thus confirming an autochthonous pedogenesis from the underlying gneissic rock. Most feldspars were weathered beyond recognition, but mineral alteration was commonly seen across cleavage plans and edges of micas. The micromorphological results suggest an intermediate stage of mineral weathering and soil development, which is in accordance with properties expected {{to be found in}} Inceptisols...|$|R
40|$|River flow is a {{reflection}} of the input of moisture and its transformation in storage and transmission over the catchment. In the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), since <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>climate</b> measurement and observations of glacier mass balance are weak or absent, analysis of trends in magnitude and timing in river flow provides a window on trends and fluctuations in climate and glacier outflow. Trend analysis is carried out using a Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend test on records extending from 1960 to 1998. High level glacial catchments show a falling trend in runoff magnitude and a declining proportion of glacial contribution to the main stem of the Indus. Elsewhere annual flow has predominantly increased with several stations exhibiting statistically significant positive trends. Analysis of timing using spring onset date (SOT) and centre of volume date (CoV) indicated no clear trends – in direct contrast to what has been observed in Western North America. There is, however, a consistent relationship between CoV and annual runoff volume. A consistently positive correlation was also found between SOT and CoV for all the stations implying that initial snowpack conditions before the onset of runoff influence timing throughout the season. The results of the analysis presented here indicate that the magnitude and timing of streamflow hydrograph is influenced both by the initial snowpack and by seasonally varied trends in temperature. The study contributes to the understanding of the links between climate trends and variability and river runoff and glacier mass balance and runoff. The Upper Indus Basin is predominantly influenced by winter precipitation; similar trend analysis applied to summer monsoon dominated catchments of the Central Himalaya is recommended...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the factors that mould ecological community structure is required to accurately predict community composition and to anticipate threats to ecosystems due to global changes. We tested how well stacked climate-based species distribution models (S-SDMs) could predict butterfly communities in a mountain region. It has been suggested that climate is the main force driving butterfly distribution and community structure in mountain environments, and that, as a consequence, climate-based S-SDMs should yield unbiased predictions. In contrast to this expectation, at lower altitudes, climate-based S-SDMs overpredicted butterfly species richness at sites with low plant species richness and under predicted species richness at sites with high plant species richness. According to two indices of composition accuracy, the Sorensen index and a matching coefficient considering both absences and presences, S-SDMs were more accurate in plant-rich grasslands. Butterflies display strong and often specialised trophic interactions with plants. At lower altitudes, where land use is more intense, considering climate alone without accounting for land use influences on grassland plant richness leads to erroneous predictions of butterfly presences and absences. In contrast, at <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes,</b> where <b>climate</b> is the main force filtering communities, there were fewer differences between observed and predicted butterfly richness. At <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> even if stochastic processes decrease the accuracy of predictions of presence, climate-based S-SDMs are able to better filter out butterfly species that are unable to cope with severe climatic conditions, providing more accurate predictions of absences. Our results suggest that predictions should account for plants in disturbed habitats at lower altitudes but that stochastic processes and heterogeneity at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes</b> may limit prediction success of climate-based S-SDMs...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{research}} suggests that tropical insects are particularly sensitive to temperature, but information on their responses to climate change has been lacking—even though the majority of all terrestrial species are insects and their diversity is concentrated in the tropics. Here, we provide evidence that tropical insect species have already undertaken altitude increases, confirming the global reach of climate change impacts on biodiversity. In 2007, we repeated a historical altitudinal transect, originally carried out in 1965 on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo, sampling 6 moth assemblages between 1, 885 and 3, 675 m elevation. We estimate that the average altitudes of individuals of 102 montane moth species, in the family Geometridae, increased by a mean of 67 m over the 42 years. Our findings indicate that tropical species {{are likely to be}} as sensitive as temperate species to climate warming, and we urge ecologists to seek other historic tropical samples to carry out similar repeat surveys. These observed changes, in combination with the high diversity and thermal sensitivity of insects, suggest that large numbers of tropical insect species could be affected by climate warming.
