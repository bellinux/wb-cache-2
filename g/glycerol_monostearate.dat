40|$|Low density, {{closed cell}} {{polyethylene}} foams show severe post-extrusion collapse when isobutane or carbon dioxide {{are used as}} physical blowing agents. This dimensional instability {{is caused by the}} fact that the blowing agent permeates faster out of the foam than the air permeates into the foam. Permeation experiments on polyethylene films showed that this is an intrinsic property of polyethylene: for both isobutane and carbon dioxide the permeability is 12 to 15 times larger than the air permeability. However, it was observed that the addition of small amounts (< 2 wt. %) of certain additives, such as stearyl stearamide or <b>glycerol</b> <b>monostearate,</b> could improve the dimensional stability of isobutane blown foams considerably.

The hydrophobic nature of GMS retarded the drug release markedly, while the inclusion of increasing percentage of AS and DOSS in GMS-based suppositories enhanced the release rate of DS to a considerable extent. Throughout the investigation, the release patterns in both cases were found to be square root of time dependent; indicating diffusion type of drug release.

The zeolite was treated according to a 23 full factorial design of experiment. Attenuated total reflectance – Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical structure of treated zeolite.

The amount of bloomed wax in surface of NR composite sheets was monitored with time at 50 oC. Results show the bloom amount to be linear with the square root of time. NR composites reinforced with untreated, acid-activated, and ion-exchanged zeolite fillers indicate reduction in wax blooming as compared to unfilled NR. The bloom rate (slope) and initial bloom (y-intercept) were determined from the experimental plots. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows the bloom rate to be signif icantly increased when zeolite fillers are treated with GMS.

Leaching of amylose and solubility decreased in all starches with added GMS. Gelatinization temperatures increased in NMS {{but there was}} no change in WMS. During first heating in DSC, only NMS with added GMS displayed the dissociation peak of amylose-lipid complex.

In second heating, the complex enthalpy increased in NMS and HAMS while WMS with added GMS did not display any transition peak of inclusion complex. Pasting temperature increased in NMS and was not altered in WMS as GMS was added. Addition of GMS decreased retrogradation and syneresis, and increased paste transparency in NMS and WMS.

Semisolid matrixes of TH were prepared by melt-matrix method and were filled in hard gelatin capsule shell (size 0). In this experiment, a mixture of <b>Glycerol</b> <b>monostearate</b> (GMS) and lipid materials like different lipophilic oils and surfactants were used to improve the matrix integrity and drug release. The effects of different oils like Arachis oil, Soyabean oil, castor oil, neobee oil and olive oil and different surfactants such as Span 80, Tween 80, PEG 400, Chremophore RH 40, Cremophor EL were analyzed by formulating at various ratios. The matrices were subjected to the paddle dissolution method using 900 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8). The dissolution test was performed at 100 RPM and the temperature was set at 37 ± 0. 5 0 C. The amount of drug was measured from the absorbance with a UV spectrophotometer at 270 nm. The release of drug was plotted in zero order-, 1 st order- and Higuchi-release patterns. The correlation coefficients values of the trend lines of the graphs revealed that the formulations best fit in Higuchian release pattern. So it can be said that the pharmaceutical quality of Tramadol HCl capsules can be improved by using a semisolid lipophilic matrix filled in hard gelatin capsules...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A new {{processing}} method for polypropylene-untreated precipitated silica (PP/SiO 2) Composites {{based on the}} incorporation of a second polymer phase of polyamide 6 (PA 6) is presented and compared with a more classic one making use of compatibilizers: <b>glycerol</b> <b>monostearate</b> (GMS), ethylene acrylic acid ionomer (IAAZE) and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (NIA-graft-PP). The effects of {{processing method}}s and conditions on the microstructure and properties Of PP/SiO 2 Composites prepared by melt compounding are investigated {{with a view to}} reduce the size of aggregates of silica from the micrometre to the nanometre scale and to improve the link between filler and matrix. RESULTS: On the one hand, the presence of GMS and LAAZE compatibilizers significantly improves the dispersion of the silica particles. On the other hand, when using a PA 6 second phase, the SiO 2 particles are dispersed in PA 6 nodules. Within these nodules, SiO 2 appears dispersed at the nanoscale but with larger particles ('aggregates') of about 200 nm. Significant improvements in tensile strength and modulus are obtained using MA-graft-PP compatibilizer. An increase in impact strength is observed in the case of GMS compatibilizer. Thermal parameters indicate also that silica plays the role of nucleation agent for PP matrix. All improvements (tensile strength, modulus and impact strength) increase with the addition of compatibilized PA 6 second phase. CONCLUSION: By the incorporation of masterbatch of silica in PA 6 as a second polymer polar phase, a successful new production method for PP/SiO 2 nanocomposites has been developed. Interestingly, this method does not require any (expensive) pre-treatment of the silica. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimThe {{current study}} aimed {{to prepare a}} {{sustained}} release tablet for a drug which has poor solubility in alkaline medium using complexation with cyclodextrin. Nicardipine hydrochloride (NC) a weak basic drug was chosen as a model drug for this study. MethodFirstly the most suitable binary system NC-HPβCD was selected {{in order to improve}} drug solubility in the intestinal media and then embedding the complexed drug into a plastic matrix, by fusion method, consists of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monostearate</b> (GMS) as an inert waxy substance and polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) as a channeling agent, after that the final solid dispersion [(NC:HPβCD) :GMS:PEG 4000] which was prepared at different ratios was mixed with other excipients, avicel PH 101, lactose, and talc, to get a tablet owning dissolution profile complying with the FDA and USP requirements for the extended release solid dosage forms. ResultsInfrared spectroscopy (IR), differential scanning colorimetry (DSC), polarized microscopy and X-ray diffractometry proved that the coevaporation technique was effective in preparing amorphous cyclodextrin complexes with NC and trapping of NC within the HPβCD cavity by dissolving both in ethanol and evaporate the solvent using a rotavapor at 65 °C. Dissolution profile of NC enhanced significantly in pH 6. 8 from NC:HPβCD inclusion complex prepared by the rotavapor (t-test Student p< 0. 05). The release of NC from tablet containing [(NC:HPβCD) :GMS:PEG 4000] [(1) : 0. 75 : 0. 5] (w/w/w) solid dispersion (F 8) was complying with the FDA dissolution requirements for extended release dosage forms, and studying the kinetics of the release showed that the diffusional contribution is the major factor controlling the drug release from that formula. ConclusionThe prepared waxy matrix tablet containing NC complexes with CD shows promising results as extended release tablets...|$|E
