40|$|The {{flammability}} {{hazard assessment}} of wall and ceiling linings has occupied {{the attention of}} fire scientists and engineers and regulators over the last fifty years. Several tests (small, medium, and large) {{have been developed to}} classify the flammability of linings and predict their burning behavior in real enclosure fire situations. We examine in some detail three such efforts: (a) the development of an experimental room and a 9 ft vertical wall full scale test by Ferris leading to the Early <b>Fire</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>test</b> in Australia, (b) the ISO room corner test, and (c) The new SBI (Single Burning Item test) which maybe the most thoroughly examined test in the history of flammability testing. Of these tests, the experimental room used by Ferris and the ISO room corner test may be considered as end use applications for medium size rooms whereas the SBI test and the vertical wall test by Ferris are intermediate scale test designed to represent the room fire behavior in a more controlled way. Performance criterion in the ISO room corner test is the time to reach flashover. Performance criteria in the SBI test are related to the fire growth in an open corner (no ceiling) configuration due to upward flame spread. Performance criterion in the experimental room of Ferris was the time to reach untenable conditions in the room. Finally, performance criterion in the vertical wall of Ferris was the time interval from ignition until the flames reach the top of the wall. Examination of all these efforts has led to consistently validating a new correlation of the performance criteria of these tests with small-scale cone calorimeter tests whenever both data are available. Previous correlations are also discussed. The new correlation compares well with essential features of upward flame spread as this is related to flammability properties. Comparison between the ISO room corner test and the SBI test leads to suggestions regarding the suitability of these tests as a regulatory tool. Some comments are also directed towards a new test method of parallel wall panels recently proposed by Fmglobal. This test method can be analyzed using the same methodology outlined in this paper...|$|E

50|$|The {{committee}} reported:“The sandwich panels {{used for}} the roof construction meet the legal requirements {{for this type of}} building with regard to the flammability and/or fire development. However, they do bring a huge danger. When heated the polyurethane will produce gases and smoke which may lead to an unexpected and quick spread of fire. Although the dangers of sandwich constructions have been previously acknowledged during <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>testing</b> and <b>fire</b> practice, they are not known throughout the fire service.”These panels comply with the legal requirements that apply to such a building with regard to flammability and/or the spread of a fire, {{but at the same time}} they also present a major risk: if the panels are sufficiently heated, the polyurethane present will lead to gas emission, flammable and toxic fumes will be released. These fumes include ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and nitrous fumes. The nitrous fumes have a characteristic yellow-brown colour. Initially, these fumes are released at the edges of the panels, but they also build up inside the sandwich panels themselves.|$|R

The safety benefit of the advanced panel ranged from a 2 -minute delay in the onset of flashover when the cabin fire was initiated by a fuel fire adjacent to a fuselage rupture, to the elimination of flashover when the fuel fire was adjacent to a door opening or when an in-flight fire was started from a seat drenched in gasoline. Analysis of the cabin hazards measured during postcrash fire tests indicated that {{the greatest threat to}} passenger survival was cabin flashover, and that toxic gases did not reach hazardous levels unless flashover occurred...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine the engine performance obtained with a hydrogenated safety fuel developed to eliminate <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> The <b>tests</b> were made on a single-cylinder universal test engine at compression ratios of 5. 0, 5. 5, and 6. 0. Most of the tests were made with a fuel-injection system, although one set of runs was made with a carburetor when using gasoline to establish comparative performance. The tests show that the b. m. e. p. obtained with safety fuel when using a fuel-injection system is slightly higher than that obtained with gasoline when using a carburetor, although the fuel consumption with safety fuel is higher. When the fuel-injection system is used with each fuel and with normal engine temperatures the b. m. e. p. with safety fuel is from 2 to 4 percent lower than with gasoline and the fuel consumption about 25 to 30 percent higher. However, a few tests at an engine coolant temperature of 250 F have shown a specific fuel consumption approximating that obtained with gasoline with only a slight reduction in power. The idling of the test engine was satisfactory with the safety fuel. Starting was difficult with a cold engine but could be readily accomplished when the jacket water was hot. It is believed that the use of the safety fuel would practically eliminate crash fires...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} tests {{conducted at}} the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on an "air-inducting" exhaust manifold for aircraft engines. The exhaust gases from each cylinder port are discharged into the throat of an exhaust pipe which has a frontal bellmouth. Cooling air is drawn into the pipe, where it surrounds and mixes with the exhaust gases. Temperatures of the manifold shell and of the exhaust gases were obtained in flight for both a conventional manifold and the air-inducting manifold. The air-inducting manifold was installed on an engine which was placed on a test stand. Different fuels were sprayed on and into the manifold {{to determine whether the}} use of this manifold reduced the <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> The flight <b>tests</b> showed reductions in manifold temperatures of several hundred degrees, to values below the ignition point of aviation gasoline. On the test stand when the engine was run at idling speeds fuels sprayed into the manifold ignited. It is believed that at low engine speeds the fuel remained in the manifold long enough to become thoroughly heated, and was then ignited by the exhaust gas which had not mixed with cooling air. The use of the air-inducting exhaust manifold must reduce the <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> by virtue of its lower operating temperature, {{but it is not a}} completely satisfactory solution of the problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Fire hazard {{monitoring}} and evacuation for building environments {{is a novel}} application area for the deployment of wireless sensor networks. In large place such as a marketplace, it is crucial for firefighters to know the <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> situation, and decide on how to best tackle the disaster. Fire sensors in the traditional <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> monitoring system are isolated in large place, and it results in failure to remain aware of current overall fire conditions. To improve the assessment accuracy of fire situation, a novel wireless sensor network based algorithm is proposed in this paper to detect and localize the origin of <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> in large place. Fuzzy artificial neural network is trained by fire signal from the wireless sensor nodes, then determine whether the <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> occurred and estimate its situation. The smoke and temperature diffusion models in limited space are adopted to localize the origin of <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> Theory analysis and experimental results show that this fire detection and localization algorithm could more accurately assess <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> situation in large place, which is helpful for firefighters to take measures to exterminate <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> Index Terms—Fire <b>hazard</b> detection, <b>Fire</b> origin localization...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} a systematic methodology for predicting fire spread and growth and for a relative <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> classification of materials for any scale and fire environment. This methodol-ogy consists of three steps: (1) select laboratory test methods to perform flam-mability measurements; (2) based on these measurements, obtain key flamma-bility material properties which are precisely defined in this work; and (3) use these properties in a mathematical model of fire spread and growth to predict <b>fire</b> <b>hazards.</b> The complementary <b>test</b> methods we have selected and used are: (a) a general flammability test apparatus (such as NIST or FMRC) [1, 2] modified to also provide pyrolysis measurements in an inert N 2 atmosphere; (b) the Limited Oxygen Index (LOI) apparatus, which is used here as a tool for ob-taining properties needed for creeping flame spread and extinction, including vitiated environments; and (c) a solid material smoke-point height apparatus [8], which is used to characterize the smokiness of the burning material needed to determine the radiation and smoke yield for arbitrary fire situations (wall fires, pool fires or ceiling fires) [8]. The use and proper interpretation of the Limited Oxygen Index apparatus can replace the LIFT [10] apparatus for deter-mining in a more accurate and direct way the material properties required for creeping (vertical downward, lateral, horizontal) flame spread. The present methodology has been compared well with experiments in this work and else-where [9], and it has been used to predict critical conditions for fire spread [11], not empirically as it is usually done, but based on first principles of fire spread, fire growth and burning, together with material flammability properties syste-matically deduced from small-scale test measurements...|$|R
40|$|Various <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> {{rating systems}} {{have been used by}} many {{countries}} at strategic and tactical levels for fire prevention and fire safety programs. Assigning subjective weight to parameters that cause <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> has been widely used to model wildland <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> However, these methods are sensitive to experts' judgements because they are independent of any statistical approaches. Therefore, in the present study, we propose a wildland <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> method based on frequency analysis (i. e. a probability distribution model) to identify the locations of <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> in north-eastern Iran, which has frequent fire. The proposed methodology uses factors that do not change or change very slowly over time to identify static <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> areas, such as vegetation moisture, slope, aspect, elevation, distance from roads and proximity to settlements, as essential parameters. Several probability distributions are assigned to each factor to show the possibility of fire using non-linear regressions. The results show that approximately 86 % of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) hot spot data are located truly in the high <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> areas as identified in the present study and the most significant contributing factor to fire in Golestan Province, Iran, is elevation. The present study also reveals that approximately 14 % of the total study area (∼ 20368 km 2) has a <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> of 66 %, which can be considered very high. Therefore, this area - located mostly in the central, west and north-east regions of Golestan Province - should be considered for an effective conservation strategy of wildland fire...|$|R
