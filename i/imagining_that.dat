After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. <b>Imagining</b> <b>that</b> Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally {{learns to}} read and write. She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> she and her fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for {{a safe place for}} Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells Precious that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E

25|$|The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle also {{believed}} that female pleasure {{played a central role}} in conception.

25|$|These epithets are {{associated}} with the ritual function of Janus in the opening of the Porta Ianualis or Porta Belli. The rite might go back to times pre-dating the founding of Rome.

30|$|The {{simple answer}} {{is that we are}} humans and we need to tell stories. We need to tell stories that glorify the human estate. We need heroes.

That’s very good. I think, if you could just imagine – suppose you had a choice, a world that’s uncontrollable – would you rather <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> you could control it, or give up?

In August of the next year, 54 BC, she died in child birth, and her infant—a son, according to some writers, a daughter, according to others,—did not survive and died along with Julia. Caesar was in Britain, according to Seneca, when he received the tidings of Julia's death.|$|E

25|$|Leaving a small {{force on}} the {{northern}} shore of the broad estuary, Cabot proceeded up the Río Paraná for about 160 kilometers, where he founded a settlement he named Sancti Spiritu. He continued upstream for another 800 kilometers, past the junction with the Río Paraguay. When navigation became difficult, Cabot turned back, after having obtained some silver objects that the Indians said came from a land far to the west. Cabot retraced his route on the Río Paraná and entered the Río Paraguay. Sailing upriver, Cabot and his men traded freely with the Guaraní tribes until a strong force of Agaces Indians attacked them. About forty kilometers below the site of Asunción, Cabot encountered a tribe of Guaraní in possession of silver objects, {{perhaps some of the}} spoils of Garcia's treasure. <b>Imagining</b> <b>that</b> he had found the route to the riches of Peru, Cabot renamed the river Río de la Plata.|$|E
25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the film, {{especially}} those involving Sivaji Ganesan and Saroja Devi were parodied many times. One notable parody is the comedy track from Guru En Aalu (2009), which featured Vivek and M. S. Bhaskar, who imitate Saroja Devi and Sivaji Ganesan respectively. The parody became popular and was frequently screened on comedy channels like Adithya TV and Sirippoli. In Muthu (1995), Padmini (Subhashri) hums the song [...] "Aha Mella". In Thenali (2000), Kailash (Jayaram) watches [...] "Chittu Kuruvi" [...] on television but changes the channel after <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> Ganesan's face morphs into that of Thenali (Kamal Haasan). In the film Siruthai (2011), Kaatu Poochi (Santhanam) watches the film's climax on television before stealing the television set.

George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us.

Outraged moralists condemned her as a sex kitten and sought to ban the song and the video. Conservatives were angered that Madonna dared to portray religious symbolism and the virginal wedding attire in a sexual context. Clerk noted the song attracted an unprecedented level of attention from social groups compared to any female singer's song.

On the other hand, Polybius, a Greek historian of the Mediterranean world, was highly critical of Demosthenes's policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens.
