5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} <b>it</b> <b>differently</b> {{from the}} way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E
5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw <b>it</b> <b>differently,</b> calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E

5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put <b>it</b> <b>differently,</b> we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then {{it is possible to}} maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret <b>it</b> <b>differently.</b> The point is {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.|$|E

25|$|The Jefferson-Wayles {{descendants}} {{and most}} historians denied for nearly 200 {{years that he}} was the father of Hemings' children. Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to interpret <b>it</b> <b>differently.</b> Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian Dumas Malone later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.|$|E

The disturbance left Fellini pale and shaken and Masina in tears. Marxist critics such as Guido Aristarco rejected the film on ideological grounds, particularly objecting to what they considered Christian notions of conversion and redemption: [...] "We don't say, nor have we ever said, that La Strada is a badly directed and acted film. We have declared, and do declare, that it is wrong; its perspective is wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} her {{perspective on}} her music, Chana identified it as [...] "trop-electro-hip-pop".

[...] She said {{that she wanted to}} make the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never set out to make music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic. When asked about how her music is received, Chana responded that various Latin communities responded to <b>it</b> <b>differently</b> as they had different definitions of mainstream and underground music.|$|E
