25|$|In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince {{showed that}} {{ethosuximide}} and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June {{of that same}} year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 µmol/L to 1mmol/L.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|E

60|$|How selfish I {{must have}} been not to have thought of this before! I don't know what I said now.
