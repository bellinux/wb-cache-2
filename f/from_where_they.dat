5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{leaves of}} the codex were {{scattered}} in several places of the monastery, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were collected on several occasions by people from France, Russia, and Italy. The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and {{became a part of}} the Fonds Coislin. They were held in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage. Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies.|$|E

5|$|In Montreal, Carleton {{was finally}} prodded to move. Under {{constant}} criticism {{for failure to}} act sooner, and mistrustful of his militia forces, he developed a plan of attack.

5|$|Newman and Copland led {{the charge}} from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and {{advanced}} into the new town. The Commandos attempted {{to get through the}} narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded.

Not all the Commandos were captured; five men reached neutral Spain, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> eventually returned to England.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1651, {{the first}} {{significant}} naval battle {{of the war was}} fought south of Naxos, a three-day engagement in which the Venetians with 58 ships under Alvise Mocenigo were victorious over the twice as large Ottoman fleet. The remainders of the Ottoman fleet withdrew to Rhodes, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were however able to reach Candia. Mocenigo was replaced soon after by Leonardo Foscolo, but both sides did not accomplish much in the next two years, although the Ottomans did succeed in supplying their forces on Crete while keeping their fleet intact.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March the Embassy {{predicted}} {{there would}} be 3,600 evacuees, far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated {{the development of a}} new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry evacuees from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> would be flown on C-130 planes to Thailand. However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be moved in a final evacuation.|$|E

5|$|On August 11, 1658 Charles X and {{his forces}} reached Valby hill (current day Frederiksberg) <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could {{overlook}} the Danish capital. His arrival was expected and the Danish king Frederick III had already ordered every building {{outside the city}} walls burnt, {{even though it had}} housed a third {{of the population of the}} city. That same day the city gates were closed and would not open again for another 22 months. A Swedish fleet of 28 ships blocked the harbor, preventing resupply by sea. The siege had begun.|$|E

5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.|$|E
5|$|Another probe {{was made}} {{early on the}} morning of 28 March on the {{positions}} of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on {{the west bank of the}} Puriata river <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the booby traps that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.|$|E
