Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters.

I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E

The colonial authorities could not call in reinforcements to put down the revolt because at the time Great Britain controlled the seas and access to Canada was blocked because the river was frozen over.|$|R

[...] Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated it 2.5 out of five. Foley felt the death of Porter in the first episode was [...] "striking" [...] since Armitage was the [...] "main reason for watching."

500|$|Describing her character's personality, Smith has stated: [...] "Dr. Hahn is a {{workaholic}} and she's very professional [...] I think {{she feels that}} there should be professionalism at work, and when other people do things that aren't professional she gets a little upset.", adding: [...] "She has little rules in her head about how you’re supposed to act at work. That doesn’t mean she can’t break the rules. But everyone else is supposed to follow them." [...] Stacy McKee, writer of season four episode [...] "Kung Fu Fighting", which saw the establishment of Hahn as a main character, has deemed her: [...] "hardcore. [...] a kick ass female surgeon". Smith has explained that the show's writers [...] "didn’t want to rush to make [...] likable, and hoped I didn’t mind. A lot of actors don’t want to be unlikable, even if they’re the bad guy. But I’m okay with that— I’m good with being unlikable." [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang – which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement— has given the insight: [...] "Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her teaching skills? [...] Well, let's just say she can use a little more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] I felt sorry for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a [...] "dog eat dog" [...] kind of surgical world)." [...] Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: [...] "She's very strong, very <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> she does, and actually a lot of men are threatened by that. She's very confident with what she does and who she is".|$|E

[...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but she was <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E

2500|$|Orwig was the {{athletic}} director at Indiana University from 1961 to 1975. [...] He took over as athletic director in February 1961, ten months into a four-year NCAA probation. [...] On accepting the post, Orwig said: [...] "No strong athletic department has been built on fraud. [...] We'll never have {{a part of that}} as long as I am the director at Indiana University. [...] I know there have been mistakes made here, but I think they've been honest ones. [...] These are mistakes to be corrected." [...] In the 61 years preceding Orwig's arrival, Indiana had won 49 conference championships and seven NCAA championships. [...] During Orwig's 15 years, the Hoosiers won 37 Big Ten championships in seven sports and six NCAA titles including a tie for the Big Ten football title in 1967 and a Rose Bowl appearance. [...] Home football attendance at Indiana averaged 25,854 the year before Orwig arrived, and by 1969 it had more than doubled to 53,319. [...] Orwig also guided the expansion of the school's athletic facilities, including the Assembly Hall basketball facility. [...] Among the coaches hired by Orwig were John Pont in football and Bobby Knight in basketball. [...] Bobby Knight said of Orwig: [...] "Bill Orwig, {{the athletic}} director who hired me, was a man of exceptional intelligence and class who knew how to get along with people and work with coaches. He had a great arrogance, in a positive way—he knew he was damned <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he did. [...] I think more than anybody else in the school's history, Bill Orwig developed Indiana's athletic program into a major league operation—facilities, teams, coaches. [...] Sam Bell was a nationally respected track coach. Doc Counsilman {{was one of the great}} coaches of all time; John Pont took a team to the Rose Bowl; and Jerry Yeagley started the soccer program and built it from nothing into the best one going. [...] The architect of all that, Bill Orwig, is in the college athletic directors hall of fame." [...] He was also one of the founders and the first president from 1969-1970 of the National Athletic Directors of America.|$|E

60|$|Dove was peculiarly <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> may be styled toast-cooking. Indeed, all the lightkeepers {{were equally}} good. The bread was cut an inch thick, and butter was laid on as plasterers spread plaster with a trowel. There was no {{scraping}} {{off a bit}} here {{to put it on}} there; no digging out pieces from little caverns in the bread with the point of the knife; no repetition of the work to spread it thinner, and, above all, no omitting of corners and edges;--no, the smallest conceivable fly could not have found the minutest atom of dry footing on a Bell Rock slice of toast, from its centre to its circumference. Dove had a liberal heart, and he laid on the butter with a liberal hand. Fair play and no favour was his motto, quarter-inch thick was his gauge, railway speed his practice. The consequence was that the toast floated, as it were, down the throats of the men, and compensated to some extent for the want of milk in the tea.|$|E

Warehouse Point served as the southern border of Springfield, Massachusetts, for 132 years — until 1768 — when Warehouse Point, Connecticut was annexed by the Connecticut Colony.

By constructing a warehouse at Warehouse Point, Pynchon essentially forced all northern Connecticut River business to run through him and his settlement at Springfield.|$|R
