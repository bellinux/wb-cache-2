40|$|A <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> {{service is}} system which stores the {{information}} describing hypertext links in a database which is {{separate from the}} data content over which the links are intended to operate. One of the first open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> services was Microcosm, which takes this philosophy to the extreme, storing not only the links in a separate database, but also {{the information about the}} endpoints of the links. The most important advantage of such an organisation is that the system remains open so that hypertext functionality may be extended to third party applications. The first part of this thesis describes the background to open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> services and describes the Microcosm system, which was developed by the Multimedia Research Group at the University of Southampton. The major problem with storing all the information about links separately from the content is that such a scheme introduces man...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{multiplication}} {{of presentation}} contexts (such as mobile phones, PDAs) for multimedia documents requires {{the adaptation of}} document specifications. In an earlier work, a semantic approach for multimedia document adaptation was proposed. This framework deals with the semantics of the document composition by transforming the relations between multimedia objects. In this chapter, we apply the defined framework to the hypermedia dimension of documents, i. e., <b>hypermedia</b> <b>links</b> between multimedia objects. By considering <b>hypermedia</b> <b>links</b> as particular objects of the document, we adapt the hypermedia dimension with the temporal dimension. However, due to the non-deterministic character of the hypermedia structure, the document is organized in several loosely dependent sub-specifications. To preserve the adaptation framework, we propose a first straightforward strategy that consists of adapting all sub-specifications generated by the hypermedia structure. Nevertheless, this strategy has several drawbacks, e. g., the profile {{is not able to}} change between user interactions. Hence, we propose an incremental approach which adapts document sub-specifications step by step according to these interactions. To validate this framework, we adapt real standard multimedia documents such as SMIL documents. Key words: Qualitative representation and reasoning, SMIL documents. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Hyperlinks {{and forms}} let humans {{navigate}} with ease through websites {{they have never}} seen before. In contrast, automated agents can only perform preprogrammed actions on Web services, reducing their generality and restricting their usefulness to a specialized domain. Many of the employed services call themselves RESTful, although they neglect the hypermedia constraint as defined by Roy T. Fielding, stating that the application state should be driven by hypertext. This lack of link usage on the Web of services severely limits agents in what they can do, while connectedness forms a primary feature of the human Web. An urgent need for more intelligent agents becomes apparent, and in this paper, we demonstrate how the conjunction of functional service descriptions and <b>hypermedia</b> <b>links</b> leads to advanced, interactive agent behavior. We propose a new mode for our previously introduced semantic service description format RESTdesc, providing the mechanisms for agents to consume Web services based on links, similar to human browsing strategies. We illustrate the potential of these descriptions by a use case that shows the enhanced capabilities they offer to automated agents, and explain how this is vital for the future Web.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system which}} supports dynamic user interaction with multimedia information using content-based hypermedia navigation techniques, specialising in a technique for navigation of musical content. The model combines the principles of open hypermedia, whereby <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> information is maintained by a link service, with content-based retrieval techniques in which a database is queried based on {{a feature of the}} multimedia content; our approach could be described as 'content-based retrieval of hypermedia links'. The experimental system focuses on temporal media and consists of a set of component-based navigational hypermedia tools. We propose the use of melodic pitch contours in this context and we present techniques for storing and querying contours, together with experimental results. Techniques for integrating the contour database with open hypermedia systems are also discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2000...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{tendency}} for the research community to move away from closed hypermedia systems, towards open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> services which allow third parties to produce applications so that they are hypertext-enabled. This paper explores the frontiers of this trend by examining the minimum responsibility of an application to co-operate with the underlying link service, and, in the limiting case where the application has not been enabled in any way, it explores the properties and qualities of hypermedia systems that can be produced. A tool, the Universal Viewer, which allows the Microcosm Hypermedia System to co-operate with applications which have not been enabled is introduced and a case study is presented which demonstrates the functionality that may be achieved using entirely third party applications, most of which have not been enabled...|$|E

We describe OvalTine, a system for tracking objects in video streams so that <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> anchors can be associated with objects in the frames without manual markup. We show how OvalTine can be used to provide hyperlinked structure to real-time video streams (such as teleconferences), as well as to mark up stored video (digital libraries) with hyperlinks in automated fashion. We also discuss the software architecture of OvalTine, which is designed to allow multiple tracker algorithms to be composed dynamically, in response to the particulars of the images being tracked...|$|E

40|$|TBD 1. Introduction Open {{hypermedia}} systems [ØsWi 96], due {{to their}} emphasis on interacting with the applications populating a user's computing environment, and the separation they enforce between hypermedia structure and application objects, have needed to integrate external, third-party applications with their <b>hypermedia</b> <b>link</b> service or linkbase to provide hypermedia functionality to end users. Since each open hypermedia system has integrated many external applications with their system, there is currently {{a large body of}} experience within the Open Hypermedia community on how to integrate these applications. Yet {{with the exception of the}} excellent paper by Hugh Davis describing application integration with the Microcosm system [DKW 94], the emphasis to date has been on describing the open hypermedia systems themselves, rather than the details of integrating applications to work with the system.
