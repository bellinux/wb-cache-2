Some motivation for studying noncommutative cylindric algebras: Noncommutative cylindric algebras (<b>NA’s)</b> <b>have</b> the same “substitutional structure ” as cylindric algebras (CA’s from now on), where substitutional structure refers to the equational behaviour of the substitution operations, the s i j ’s.

40|$|Growth of Bordetella {{pertussis}} in a {{high concentration}} of nicotinic acid (<b>NA)</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> modulating effect on several properties and activities of the bacteria.

By contrast, cells grown in {{a high concentration of}} ND showed only a slightly decreased capacity for uptake of ND and none of the other changes. Modulation of B. pertussis by NA varied with the strain and culture conditions and appeared to be distinct from the antigenic modulation induced by high Mg 2 + in the culture medium.
