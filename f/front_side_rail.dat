40|$|For {{the weight}} {{efficient}} and crashworthy {{design of the}} structural body of a transportation system, {{a thorough understanding of}} crushing behavior of thin-walled structural members such as spot-welded sheet metal beams or extruded aluminum beams must be gained. In the present thesis, the complex crushing process of three-dimensional thin-walled structures subject to combined loading is solved analytically and numerically. Also, several new design concepts of strengthening "S" shaped frame with regard to weight efficiency and energy absorption are proposed. The mechanics of biaxial bending collapse and the collapse under combined bending and compression of thin-walled prismatic member are formulated and initial and subsequent shrinking interaction curves between the loading components are constructed. All the analytical derivations show close correlations with the results of the accompanying finite element analysis. Based on these two complex crushing mechanisms, the analytical derivation of the crushing resistance of three-dimensional "S" shaped frame is presented. Extensive study on the strengthening of the three-dimensional "S" shaped frame is performed with two types of internal reinforcing member, diagonally positioned sheet metal stiffener and ultralight metallic foam-filler. The optimization process involving varying the cross-sectional shape and the type of reinforcing member for both aluminum-extruded member and spot-welded hat-type cross-section member is developed. (cont.) Using the analytical closed form expression of the crushing force of "S" shaped frame, the optimization process was performed based on Sequential Quadratic Programming. As a more realistic application, a <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> and subframe structure of a mid size passenger car is analyzed. The combinational optimization process of "Design of Experiment" and "Response Surface Method" is carried out with the objective of weight minimization while maintaining the same or higher level of crash energy absorption. Both methods of internal reinforcement show high increase in the energy absorption and weight efficiency. The gain in terms of the specific energy absorption varies from 37 % to 267 % depending on the method. The proposed theoretical understanding and the design methodologies could be used as crash oriented early-stage component design tools. by Heung-Soo Kim. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of vehicle crashworthiness and occupant protection are addressed. The vehicle crashworthiness design objectives are {{to design the}} vehicle structure for optimum impact energy absorption, and to design the restraint system (seatbelts, airbags, bolsters, etc.) for optimum occupant protection. The following approaches are taken; {{a major part of}} the impact energy is to be absorbed by the vehicle structure; the restraint components will provide protection against the remaining crash energy; certain vehicle components are designed to deform under specific types and speeds of impact in a desired mode for sound energy management; structural components such as <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> rear rails, door structure and pillars undergo large amounts of deformation; and with properly designed geometry and material these components assist in mitigating the effects of impact...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{front bumper}} inner plate was {{researched}} based on contrastive {{analysis of the}} crashworthiness considering using 22 MnB 5, a typical hot forming AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steel) and DP 590, a kind of general high strength steel. In this paper, we contrasted energy absorption, section force, and maximum displacement of the two different front bumper systems in low-speed collision. The analysis shows the front bumper inner plate using hot forming AHSS can improve the crashworthiness of automobiles {{and make it more}} balanced and reasonable to transfer collision energy and force. As a result, the maximum displacement of the front bumper system decreases and other parts such as <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> can be safer. Thus, using hot forming AHSS in designing a front bumper inner plate can improve the passive safety of automobiles...|$|R

The maximum front to back load was obtained with the curved frames of chairs when compared to control samples. One-piece and two-piece type chairs have an important advantage in comparison with control samples, if only the front to back load is noted. The comparisons with custom chairs very clearly show the superior performance of the curved frames of one-piece type and two-piece type chairs. The high load at front to back was obtained with the curved frames, especially for one-piece type chairs. The front to back loads of first, two-piece type chairs, and custom chairs are equal to 1.72 E 3, 1.42 E 3, and 1.02 E 3  N, respectively. The increasing strength of chairs with curved frames {{is due to the}} removal of joints when compared with chairs of solid wood.|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of an {{advanced}} practice nurse (APN) intervention on restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> usage in four nursing homes and with a sample of 251 residents. A secondary question explored the association between restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> reduction and bed-related falls. DESIGN : Pre- and posttest design. SETTING : Four urban nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS : All nursing home residents present in the nursing home at three time points (n= 710, 719, and 707) and a subset of residents (n= 251) with restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use at baseline. INTERVENTION : APN consultation with individual residents and facility-wide education and consultation. MEASUREMENTS : Direct observation of <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> status, resident and nurse interview for functional status, mobility, cognition, behavioral symptoms, medical record review for demographics and treatment information, and incident reports for fall data. RESULTS : At the institutional level, one of the four nursing homes significantly reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use (P =. 01). At the individual participant level, 51. 4 % (n= 130) reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use. For the group that reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> there was a significantly (P <. 001) reduced fall rate (− 0. 053; 95 % confidence interval (CI) =− 0. 083 to − 0. 024), whereas the group that continued restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> did not demonstrate a significantly (P =. 17) reduced fall rate (− 0. 013; 95 % CI=− 0. 056 – 0. 030). CONCLUSION : An APN consultation model can safely reduce <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use. Restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> reduction does not lead to an increase in bed-related falls. Although <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> serve many purposes, routine use of these devices to restrict voluntary movement and prevent falls is not supported...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} safety of the {{standard}} and the low hospital bed, we report on a microanalysis of 15 patients’ ability to ingress, move about the bed, and egress. The 15 participants were purposefully selected with various disabilities. Bed conditions were randomized with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> up or down and one low bed with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> down. We explored the patients’ use of the <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> bed height, ability to lift their legs onto the mattress, and ability to turn, egress, and walk back to the chair. The standard bed was too high for some participants, both for ingress and egress. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> were used by most participants when entering, turning in bed, and exiting.

40|$|Background: The use of {{hospital}} bed <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> for increased mobility and safety for elderly and high fall risk patients {{has become a}} controversial topic. The suggested removal of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> to prevent entrapment, as recommended by Consumer Federation of America, increases the risk that a patient may {{fall out of the}} bed. Additionally, without <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> patients may require additional assistance from nurses to reposition patients in bed, which increases the risk of back injuries among nurses (Jang et al. 2007). Objective: To examine the biomechanics associated with a patient’s ability to move freely in bed with and without <b>side</b> <b>rails.</b> Methods: Biomechanical data for in bed movements from fifty-two older adults with a history of falls (Morse Fall Scale value> 45) (mean age= 68 years, SD= 11. 4) was analyzed. An 18 -camera motion tracking system (NaturalPoint, Corvallis, OR) was used to track body biomechanics. Participants were instructed to lie down on an instrumented hospital bed. They were then instructed to turn onto their right side, then onto their left side. This was performed three times with three different <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> configurations; rail 1, rail 2 and no rails.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{fundamental}} challenge of balancing the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in silicon heterojunction solar cells. We present two-dimensional numerical device simulations as well as experimental investigations concerning n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells featuring either a front emitter or rear emitter. By varying both, the pitch of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metal grid electrode and the sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO, the fill factor losses associated with the two-dimensional carrier transport are investigated. We prove experimentally {{that in the case}} of the rear emitter design a substantial part of the lateral carrier transport is shifted from the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO into the absorber, thus, lowering the effective sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side.</b> Owing to this additional lateral current path the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO are less pronounced for a rear emitter cell design compared to the traditional front emitter cell design. This leads to fewer restrictions for the choice of <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCOs and the design of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metal grid electrode.
