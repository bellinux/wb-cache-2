The special responsibility of the dominant undertaking is the obligation not to allow its conduct to impair <b>genuine</b> undistorted <b>competition</b> on the common market. The doctrine of the special responsibility {{is tied to the}} prohibition on abuse of such position. One concept could not be assessed without the other, because the concept of special responsibility of the dominant undertaking is a fundamental principle for the application of the prohibition on abuse of such position. Based on {{that it is necessary to}} describe in this thesis the prohibition on abuse of dominant position together with selected prohibited practices, in which the special responsibility of the dominant undertaking is reflected. This responsibility presupposes a higher standard of vigilance reflected in the conduct of such an undertaking, because an undertaking in dominant position on the relevant market could not take all actions that the other undertakings lacking such market power could do.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the provisions of}} the new Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), drawing insights from trade theory and recent developments in the economics of information and law. A central conclusion is that in a world where imperfectly informed procurers purchase from imperfectly competitive firms on behalf of imperfectly informed tax-payers, {{it is not easy to}} devise rules which would be optimal in all situations. Nevertheless, the non-discriminatory provisions of the GPA seem to approximate closely the rules which would maximize global welfare. A significant benefit of the GPA is in helping to overcome national agency problems in procurement by creating mechanisms for reciprocal international monitoring supported by multilateral enforcement. There is, however, scope for improvement. First, the GPA does not equip bidders for government contracts to vault over trade restrictions, so the creation of <b>genuine</b> international <b>competition</b> for government procurement remains crucially dependent on the liberalization of trade. Secondly, weaknesses remain in the enforcement mechanism. These include the low level of compensation to a successful challenger, the absence of restrictions on settlements, and the lack of provision for challenge and review of bail-outs.

Second, I illustrate the necessity to analyze data on the logit scale rather than on raw proportions, because only the logit scale allows a clean separation of additive and nonadditive effects (i. e., male x male and female x male interactions) ...|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: Individual {{clubs in}} Scotland have {{experienced}} financial crises {{on several occasions}} in the past. But to many observers what we are witnessing at present is a systemic crisis in Scottish football: {{a common set of}} problems afflicting all clubs with negative financial implications for all, the crisis in one club or group of clubs threatening to damage the financial stability of other clubs (Rimini Group 2004). As of March 2004 a quarter of Scottish Premier League (SPL) clubs are in administration. The playing staff at another SPL club were obliged to accept substantial pay cuts to avoid the same fate, while the board of another club is seeking to sell its stadium to meet its debts, moving its home matches (average attendance 12, 521) to Murrayfield Stadium (capacity 67, 500). The combined debt of the twelve SPL clubs is estimated at £ 190 m, some £ 30 - 40 m higher than the clubs' combined turnover; in the last three seasons only one SPL club has reported a pre-tax profit. The annual turnover of two clubs (the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers) equates to about 70 % of the total turnover of the SPL. Unsurprisingly this dominance is also apparent on the field: no club outside the Old Firm has won the title since 1984 / 85. Yet, if any SPL club is in administration on 31 st May 2004, it will begin season 2004 / 05 with a tenpoint deduction. Thus any semblance of <b>genuine</b> sporting <b>competition</b> is further threatened by the very real prospect of a quarter of the SPL beginning next season 10 points adrift from other clubs. To those not familiar with the business of Scottish football these facts may be quite extraordinary. The explanations of how Scottish football ended up in this situation are perhaps no less so...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{military}} coup in 1952, Egypt has been ruled by an authoritarian regime which {{has proved to}} be remarkably resilient. International pressure for political liberalization and democratization has only led to cosmetic changes, which have given the regime a democratic façade. Oppressive laws combined with the almost continuous state of emergency in the country prevents the emergence of <b>genuine</b> political <b>competition.</b> While newer secular parties such as Kefaya and Al-Ghad have been suppressed by the regime, the older opposition parties such as the Wafd Party and the Nationalist Unionist Progressive Party have become locked with the regime in a stagnant, undemocratic political system. The outlawed Islamic party, The Muslim Brotherhood, remains the biggest threat to the political power of the regime because of its increasing popularity, which is based on its social and humanitarian activities and its programme of spreading Islamic values, combating corruption and (more recently) demanding a more liberal and democratic political system. During the rule of president Mubarak and his National Democratic Party, civil society has exerted a growing pressure for democratization, but so far the regime has been able to contain the pressure. On this basis, the thesis investigates the possibilities for a democratic transition in Egypt. The thesis uses a combination of structuralist theories of democratization (early and later modernization theory, social structural analysis) and agency-based theories (transition theory) as theoretical tools for analysing the problem. Structuralist theories help us ascertain whether structural and historical factors in Egypt rule out the possibility of democratization, or whether democratization should, in principle, be possible. They also help to pinpoint the structural forces which support or hinder democratization. Transition theory tells us how transitions from authoritarian to democratic regimes have taken place during the 20 th century and, as a consequence, which events might lead to a democratization in Egypt - and how. A description of the modern history of Egypt and of the society and political system of Egypt today forms the basis of the later analyses. These show that Egypt meets the necessary prerequisites for democratization, but that the class structure of the Egyptian society is a barrier for democratization. Following this, Egypt is described as a semi-autocracy in balance (based on a terminology presented by Marina Ottaway), and an analysis of the low level of support and legitimacy of the Egyptian regime amongst the population highlights the motives behind the desire for democratization amongst the Egyptian public. In the final analysis, we focus on the possible scenarios for democratization, and their likelihood. We conclude that democratization will only be possible, if the pressure of civil society for democratization increases, while the ability - or will - of the regime to suppress it is weakened. Following this, we seek to point out how this could happen, and conclude that the most likely scenario is a serious or prolonged economic crisis, even though political crises would also increase the likelihood of a transition. Finally, we conclude that a democratic transition is only possible if the regime is weakened enough to be unable to control the process of transition, and if the transition is dominated by democratic forces...|$|R

40|$|Politics as {{partisan}} warfare: {{that is our}} world. Over {{the last}} generation, American democracy has had one defining attribute: extreme partisan polarization. We {{have not seen the}} intensity of political conflict and the radical separation between the two major political parties that characterizes our age since the late 19 th century. Within Congress, the parties have become purer and purer distillations of themselves. The parties are now more internally unified, and more sharply differentiated from each other, than anytime over the last 100 years. Moreover, this polarization is not limited to those in office. Over the last generation, there has been a dramatic ideological and partisan sorting of voters as well. A center in America’s governance institutions has all but disappeared. This article explores the causes of this polarization. Are the causes relatively contingent and short-term ones, so {{that it is possible to}} envision this structure of extreme partisan polarization changing, perhaps if certain institutional changes were made in the way American democracy and elections are designed? Or are the causes deep-rooted and structural ones, so that the appropriate conclusion is that this extreme partisan polarization is likely to be the ongoing structure of American politics and democracy for the coming years, regardless of any efforts that might be made to diminish this polarization? In particular, the article explores three potential causes of this polarization, which I label Persons, History, and Institutions. 2 ̆ 2 Persons 2 ̆ 2 refers to the view that polarization is a reflection of particularizing polarizing personalities of various recent political figures, including Presidents. This view is reflected in the longing for the 2 ̆ 2 statesmen 2 ̆ 2 of past decades, who forged political breakthroughs across party and ideological lines to enact major policy initiatives. 2 ̆ 2 History 2 ̆ 2 describes the view that large-scale historical and transformative forces in American politics account for the modern structure, coherence, and polarization of the Democratic and Republican parties of today. The specific historical processes involve the end of the 20 th Century one-party monopoly on the American South, which began with the 1965 enactment of the Voting Rights Act; the destruction of that world eventually led, by the 1990 s, to the South having a system of <b>genuine</b> two-party <b>competition</b> for the first time since the Civil War. How much does the dramatic re-organization of American democracy entailed by that transformation account for the structure of partisan conflict today? 2 ̆ 2 Institutions 2 ̆ 2 refers to more discrete structures that organize democracy: the structure of primary elections, gerrymandering, campaign finance, and the internal rules that allocate power to political leaders in the House and Senate today. How much do these specific institutional features contribute to polarization, and in what ways, if any might they be changed to diminish it? To foreshadow, the article concludes that the major cause of the extreme polarization of our era is the historical transformation of American democracy and America 2 ̆ 7 s political parties set into motion by the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Thus, perhaps the extreme polarization over the last generation should not be seen as aberrational (indeed, the pre- 1965 structure of parties is the one to view as aberrational). This polarization, for better or worse, might be the 2 ̆ 2 mature 2 ̆ 2 structure of American democracy. As such, it is likely to be enduring, despite the best efforts of Presidents and reformers to transcend the extreme polarization of recent years.

40|$|Despite strong {{economic}} growth, election handouts and law suits against opposition candidates, {{the ruling party}} lost support last Saturday, writes Garry Rodan SINGAPORE prime minister Lee Hsien Loong can rightly claim a strong mandate after leading the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) to another emphatic victory in Saturday’s general election. The government secured {{all but two of}} the 84 seats in parliament and took 66. 6 per cent of the votes cast. But that still means one-third of Singaporeans rejected the PAP in spite of impressive economic growth, seductive election-eve budget handouts and a host of constraints on opposition parties. The government saw its share of the vote fall by 8. 7 percentage points compared with the last elections in 2001. Singapore’s two opposition MPs - Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) and Low Thia Khiang of the Workers’ Party (WP) - were returned with increased majorities, despite concerted attempts to unseat them. Mixed as the results are for the PAP, one election outcome gives it cause for unqualified satisfaction: the rejection of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) at the polls. This is more than an issue of one opposition party’s demise. It is the nature of opposition that the SDP represents which the PAP seeks to expunge from the Singaporean political system. The PAP has long been disparaging about political opposition, depicting it as a distraction at best to good government. This was reiterated during the recent election campaign. Reflecting on the existing opposition MPs, Prime Minister Lee observed: “We can deal with them. Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members in parliament. Instead of spending my time thinking what is the right policy for Singapore, I’m going to spend all my time thinking what’s the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters’ votes, how can I solve this week’s problem and forget about next year’s challenges?” However, different forms of opposition attract different degrees of hostility from the PAP. Under the leadership of Secretary-General Chee Soon Juan, the SDP has engaged in the most explicit questioning of PAP values and ideologies, and has challenged the PAP on fundamental issues of transparency and accountability. Mr Chee and the SDP have also embarked on extra-electoral strategies of public protests and civil disobedience to highlight the administrative and legal impediments to free speech that undermine <b>genuine</b> political <b>competition</b> in the city-state. The SDP entered this election with the stated intention of scrutinising the government’s handling of a controversy involving the National Kidney Foundation charity. The NKF had been exposed in the Singaporean media for its extravagance over its chief executive’s S$ 600, 000 (US$ 384, 000) annual salary and first-class air tickets, and discrepancies over the public disclosure of the size of its reserves. While the NKF is not a state body, the SDP tried to use the NKF fiasco to bolster its argument for more transparency and accountability in government-linked companies and statutory authorities. It sought to challenge the PAP team headed by Minister of Health Khaw Boon Wan in the constituency of Sembawang, which elects six MPs. But the SDP’s campaign had barely got off the ground when its 12 central executive committee members found themselves facing defamation suits from Prime Minister Lee and his father, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. The Lees allege that an SDP newsletter depicts them and the government as withholding information about the NKF and perpetuating a corrupt political system {{for the benefit of the}} political elite. Thereafter, the NKF issue effectively disappeared from the campaign and the state-controlled media echoed the PAP’s denunciation of the SDP more generally. The SDP secured just 23. 3 per cent of the vote in Sembawang. The party’s Ling How Doong, a former MP who contested the seat of Bukit Panjang, suffered the heaviest loss of the election, with just 22. 8 per cent of the vote. There is now a serious prospect that pending court cases will kill off the SDP altogether. Cases by PAP leaders against their political opponents have never failed. The SDP has no funds to deal with the scale of damages that could be awarded in the pending cases against Mr Chee and his sister Chee Siok Chin, the only two of the twelve-member committee who have yet to apologise and arrange to settle out of court. Although the PAP finds the SDP especially objectionable, it still left no stone unturned in battling the other opposition parties. Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was assigned a special role in assisting PAP candidates trying to win back the seats of Potong Pasir and Hougang, held by Messrs Chiam and Low respectively. The PAP renewed threats of lower state funding for upgrading housing estates in these two constituencies if it lost, and offered expansive upgrading programs if it won. This included S$ 80 million for Potong Pasir and S$ 100 million for Hougang. Despite this, Messrs Chiam and Low saw their share of the vote increase - in Mr. Chiam’s case to 55. 8 per cent from 52. 4 per cent, and in Mr. Low’s case to 62. 7 per cent from 55. 0 per cent. That led Prime Minister Lee to declare that “we will review our strategy for approaching these two constituencies over the next five years”. But whether that will lead to a serious acceptance of political pluralism is another matter. By far and away the most creditable overall performance among opposition parties came from the WP. Apart from Mr. Low’s victory, the WP scored well in the five-member constituency of Aljunied, where it secured 43. 9 per cent of the vote. Overall, it obtained an average of 38. 4 per cent of the votes in the seats it contested - 6 per cent better than the SDA and 15 per cent better than the SDP. On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Lee positively contrasted the WP with the SDP, noting that the former had improved since its previous leader J. B. Jeyaretnam stepped down in 2001 - after being bankrupted by law suits. He also observed that it had fielded better quality candidates and was rewarded accordingly. However, the WP came to the polls with a 52 -page manifesto containing a range of policy prescriptions relating to Singapore’s mounting material inequalities. Much of the nine-day election campaign was consumed by controversies over defamation cases and attacks by the PAP on the character and integrity of opposition figures. This reduced the scope for debate over the WP’s calls for a minimum wage and an “unconditional needs-based safety net” and other substantive differences over coping with globalisation. The PAP rejects such a direction, but it has yet to deliver an effective alternative to protect the interests of those Singaporeans who feel they have not shared in the fruits of the city-state’s economic growth. This may explain why as many as one-third voted for opposition parties, despite their obvious limitations. • Garry Rodan is director of the Asia Research Centre and professor of politics and international studies at Murdoch University.

40|$|The {{revival of}} {{interest}} in music evident in recent historiography {{has led to an}} investigation of the specifically transnational nature of musical languages and practices. This article explores the possibility of re-reading in a transnational perspective the classical theme {{of the relationship between the}} Risorgimento and opera. It focuses on two different points of view: on the one hand, the construction of the librettos as a delicate balance between European romantic narratives and dramatic themes evoking nationalistic sentiments; on the other, the fact that ideas and practices of the theatre as a vehicle of political mobilization developed in a broad international context where Mazzini and many others nationalists found inspiration in multinational political experiences and discourses. The article concludes by saying that the meanings of terms such as cosmopolitanism and nationalism need to be carefully weighed when we look at 19 th-century opera production. Only in the closing decades of the century did <b>genuine</b> <b>competition</b> between national traditions arise and led in Italy to a veritable “obsession” with ‘italianness’ in music...|$|E
