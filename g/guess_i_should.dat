500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{is similar}} to [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] in its lyrics. Many media outlets, {{including}} the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them [...] "confessional ballads", with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words [...] "I know it's not right but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{try to do what}} I should do" [...] were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] shared similarities with [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in expressing uncontrollable [...] "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] is that the lyrics are recorded with [...] "powerful agony" [...] which forces the narrator to [...] "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" [...] because her lover may or may not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, as the second-string quarterback, he saw {{his first}} action against [...] when he was {{substituted}} for injured starter Jordan Steffy. Turner executed a scoring drive and completed four of six passes, but also threw two interceptions. He sat out the next two games and then took one snap against Wake Forest. When the unranked Terps faced 10th-ranked Rutgers, Steffy suffered a concussion and Turner again filled in. He led drives for two touchdowns and two field goals in an upset of the Scarlet Knights, 34–24. About the then relatively unknown Turner, Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano said, [...] "I wish I would have seen this guy before." [...] Turner started for the remaining eight games of the season. In his career-first start, he passed for 255yards in a win against Georgia Tech, 28–26. In the game, he threw a 78-yard touchdown pass, which was caught by tight end Jason Goode rather than his intended receiver, Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a three-game losing streak, Turner led another upset win over a top-ten team, this time against eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. In the 24–16 loss to Florida State, Turner had his worst performance of the season. Late in the second quarter, he was benched and replaced by Steffy for two possessions. Turner said, [...] "I didn't know that my leash was that short in the first place, to be honest. I didn't think {{it would come to}} this. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have." [...] After an uneven performance by Steffy, Turner played the entire second half and showed improvement. The following week Maryland played their regular season finale against NC State and both teams needed an additional win to attain bowl eligibility. Maryland led in the second quarter, 3–0, but was struggling offensively. Turner, a generally immobile pocket quarterback, invigorated the offense when he executed a 41-yard option run for a first down. He completed 19 of 24 passes for 206 yards and led a shutout of NC State, 37–0. With the sixth win, Maryland was invited to the Emerald Bowl, where they were beaten by Oregon State, 21–14. Turner finished the season as the third-most efficient passer in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).|$|E

"Let me depart, father Simon," [...] said Henry Smith, mournfully, [...] "I {{might have}} <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have my old luck, and spread strife and bloodshed where I would wish most {{to bring peace}} and happiness. Care not for me. Look to poor Catharine; the fright of such an affray hath killed her, and all through my fault." ...|$|R

I thought you hadn't succeeded in what you {{set out to do}} and were ashamed to come back when you'd failed. <b>I</b> never <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be faced with this. I'm so desperately sorry, Edward. I'm so disappointed. I hoped you would do great things. It's almost more than I can bear to think of you wasting your talents and your youth and your chance in this lamentable way." ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2011, Minneapolis based {{record label}} Doomtree {{released}} {{an album of}} mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the Wu-Tang Clan. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself {{did not have any}} involvement with the release. Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated [...] "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the Fun Fun Fun Fest festival and talk to them. But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stack says {{he became}} {{involved}} in politics through his parents, who took him to political rallies in Union City. The Stacks were active in their community, as their apartment was a hospitable place that was likened to [...] "a stop for tenants and neighborhood people seeking assistance or advice." [...] It was with his parents that Stack first began {{to participate in the}} practice of providing turkeys and holiday gifts to the needy, a practice that Stack would later institute as Mayor As Stack explained to a reporter when he was 19, [...] "I remember when I was about 6 or 7 years old being at the Doric Temple polling place on election day just sitting and listening to the local politicians. I would probably say I dedicated my high school years to politics when I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been more into school activities. My classmates would call me 'mayor'. But I always believed it's vitally important for young people to get involved. We are the future." ...|$|E

[...] "Were I in your place, I think that, if driven to it, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> know what to do. One thing, however, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not do. Whatever may be the judgment of the divine King of Kesh upon you, and that can easily be <b>guessed,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not return to Egypt with my escort, until I was quite sure of my welcome. No, I think that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> stop in Napata, which I am told is a rich and pleasant city, and try to put its affairs in order, trusting that Egypt, to which it once belonged, would in the end forgive me for so doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They guessed, ma'am: they <b>guessed.</b> Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{say it was}} ascertained {{beyond a}} doubt.

6000|$|He <b>guessed</b> what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> answer, <b>I</b> believe, for I {{was sure}} that Eustace would fail without Harold, and I {{told him that his}} cousin must not be left to himself till he had a good wife.

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{wondering}} vaguely, Philip," [...] she said, {{when he had}} told the story, [...] "how it was {{that you should have}} appeared so suddenly, and should have a disguise in readiness for me.

6000|$|He {{perceived}} the anxiety that the girl's pride {{could not keep}} out of her tone, but he answered indifferently, [...] "I'm a little too near that color myself.

6000|$|The lad {{opened his}} mouth to say, 'Not a bit,' but checked that answer as if {{something}} in Dan's face made him change his mind. 'Well, if it was my duty in war or self-defence, I suppose I shouldn't; but if I'd pitched into him in a rage, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be very sorry.

60|$|Now as I spoke thus {{my heart}} bounded with hope, for if once I could come among the Spaniards, perhaps I might escape {{the altar of}} sacrifice. Also they seemed a link between me and home. They had sailed hither in ships, and ships can retrace their path.

6000|$|... "Good!" [...] Whitwell {{slapped his}} leg. Westover {{saw that he}} had on long India-rubber boots, which came up to his knees, and he gave a wayward thought to the misery they would be on an August day to another man; but Whitwell was {{probably}} insensible to any discomfort from them. [...] "When a man's mindin' his own business any government's good, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like to prowl round some them places where they had the worst scenes of the Revolution, Ever been in the Place de la Concorde?"

6000|$|... "It {{may be as}} you say," [...] said I, [...] "but {{the general}} did not strike me during our short {{interview}} as being {{a man who was}} likely to have any very pronounced literary tastes. If I might hazard a <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say that he is here upon medical advice, {{in the hope that the}} complete quiet and fresh air may restore his shattered nervous system. If you had seen how he glared at me, and the twitching of his fingers, you would have thought it needed some restoring." ...|$|E
60|$|At a rough <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say I {{have met}} from {{one hundred and}} fifty to two hundred young and middle-aged men whom I {{specifically}} found to be Brooklyn persons. Many of them I recognized as having seen their faces before, and very many of them knew me. Some said they had known me from boyhood. Some would call to me as I passed down a ward, and tell me they had seen me in Brooklyn. I have had this happen at night, and have been entreated to stop and sit down and take the hand of a sick and restless boy, and talk to him and comfort him awhile, for old Brooklyn's sake.|$|E
60|$|A {{word or two}} on the Isle of Wight. I {{have been}} no further than Steephill. If I may <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{say that there is}} no finer part in the Island than from this Place to Steephill. I do not {{hesitate}} to say it is fine. Bonchurch is the best. But I have been so many finer walks, with a background of lake and mountain instead of the sea, that I am not much touch'd with it, though I credit it for all the Surprise I should have felt if it had taken my cockney maidenhead. But I may call myself an old Stager in the picturesque, and unless it be something very large and overpowering, I cannot receive any extraordinary relish.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have it, sir," [...] said Douglas. [...] "May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes. You're {{a smoker}} yourself, if I {{remember}} right, and you'll guess {{what it is}} to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away." [...] He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. [...] "I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. <b>I</b> never <b>guessed</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> meet you. But before you are through with that," [...] he nodded at my papers, [...] "you will say I've brought you something fresh." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{clearness}} of {{mind with}} the morning; <b>I</b> have no <b>guess</b> what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do. 'Tis {{easy to say}} that the public duty should brush aside these little considerations of personal dignity; so it is that politicians begin, and in a month you find them rat and flatter and intrigue with brows of brass. I am rather of the old view, that a man's first duty is to these little laws; the big he does not, he never will, understand; I may be wrong about the Chief Justice and the Baron and the state of Samoa; I cannot be wrong about the vile attitude I put myself in if I blow the gaff on Cedarcrantz behind his back.|$|R
6000|$|He gives, {{in broken}} phrases and often single words, it is true, but none the less vividly for that, {{a record of}} the twenty-four hours {{following}} the demonstration of the correctness of his intricate tracery of computations and <b>guesses.</b> 'I thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not sleep,' he writes--the words he omitted are supplied in brackets--(on account of) 'pain in (the) hand and chest and (the) wonder of what I had done....

6000|$|... "I've {{thought a}} great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties', and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason {{everyone}} loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm {{going to try and}} be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do better. May we try this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I can {{understand}} the surprise which you have felt at the strange course taken by their father, {{as a means of}} concealing the difference which there must be in the ages of these young ladies. Many years since, I happened to discover a romantic incident in the life of your popular preacher, which he has his reasons, as I suspect, for keeping strictly to himself. If I may venture on a bold <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say that any person who could discover which was the oldest of the two daughters, would be also likely to discover {{the true nature of the}} romance in Mr. Gracedieu's life.'--Isn't that very remarkable, Euneece? You don't seem to see it--you funny child! Pray pay particular attention to what comes next. These are the closing sentences in my friend's letter: ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{you will}} ask, [...] "If {{that is not}} the reason why fire burns, what is?" [...] My dear child, I do not know. That is Lady Why's business, who is {{mistress}} of Mrs. How, and of you and of me; and, as I think, of all things that you ever saw, or can see, or even dream. And what her reason for making fire burn may be I cannot tell. But I believe on excellent grounds that her reason is a very good one. If I dare to <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say that one reason, at least, why fire burns, is that you may take care not to play with it, and so not only scorch your finger, but set your whole bed on fire, and perhaps the house into the bargain, as you might be tempted to do if putting your finger in the fire were as pleasant as putting sugar in your mouth.|$|E

[...] "But never mind that; I'm going to make a guess--a desperate <b>guess,</b> mind. <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> be {{altogether}} in error if I thought that this letter had been stolen; and that the fingers of Mr. Davager, of suspicious commercial celebrity, might possibly be the fingers which took it?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} my throne was abdicated, the attic evacuated; an inverse {{repetition}} of the impetus which had brought me up into the attic, instantly took me down--down--down to the very kitchen. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have gone to the}} cellar. The cook was imperatively ordered to produce food, and I, as imperatively, was commanded to eat. To my great joy this food was limited to coffee and cake: I had feared wine and sweets, which I did not like. How he <b>guessed</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like a petit pâté à la crême I cannot tell; but he went out and procured me one from some quarter. With considerable willingness I ate and drank, keeping the petit pâté till the last, as a bonne bouche. M. Paul superintended my repast, and almost forced upon me more than I could swallow.|$|R
