25|$|Frictional {{machines}} were, in time, gradually {{superseded by}} the second class of instrument mentioned above, namely, influence machines. These operate by electrostatic induction and convert mechanical work into electrostatic energy by {{the aid of a}} small initial charge which is continually being replenished and reinforced. The first suggestion of an influence machine appears to have grown out of the invention of Volta's electrophorus. The electrophorus is a single-plate capacitor used to produce <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> electric charge via the process of electrostatic induction.|$|E
25|$|Galen's humoral {{theories}} were {{influential in}} Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering {{was attributed to}} <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> the four bodily humors—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation {{continued to be a}} dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.|$|E

The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate (± 1 percent) by tying its currency to gold {{and the ability of}} the IMF to bridge temporary <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.|$|E

This paper, by using empirical method and adjusting the data of trade from 1989 to 2005, finds that the causes <b>of</b> the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade are as follows: 1) the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> domestic demands of US; 2) the adjustment of American economic structure, and 3) the growing of multinational enterprises. The paper also finds that the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade is {{not as big as}} it was reported by US; the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade is an inevitable result of economic development, and the trade deficit does not necessarily mean a loss of profit. In fact, American investors and consumers have greatly benefited from China-US trade...|$|R

25|$|The {{fat content}} of meat can vary widely {{depending}} on the species and breed of animal, {{the way in which}} the animal was raised, including what it was fed, the anatomical part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild animals such as deer are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat. The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. However, the nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is cholesterol associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> fat and cholesterol in the human diet.|$|E

Like anyone else, TBI survivors may suffer seizures due to factors including <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> fluid or electrolytes, epilepsy from other causes, hypoxia (insufficient oxygen), and ischemia (insufficient {{blood flow to the}} brain). Withdrawal from alcohol is another potential cause of seizures. [...] Thus these factors must be ruled out as causes of seizures in people with head injury before {{a diagnosis}} of PTE can be made.|$|E

In addressing media balance, Jiao noted that the Chinese public lacked negative, critical information regarding their country.

Eisenman {{was a friend of}} Derrida, but even so his approach to architectural design was developed long before he became a Deconstructivist. For him Deconstructivism should be considered an extension of his interest in radical formalism. Some practitioners of deconstructivism were also influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> Russian constructivism. There are additional references in deconstructivism to 20th-century movements: the modernism/postmodernism interplay, expressionism, cubism, minimalism and contemporary art.

However, today it is owned by a Jamaican publisher and has a Caribbean focus. Pride magazine, which has been going for 21 years, is the largest lifestyle magazine for the community and was described by The Guardian newspaper as the dominant lifestyle magazine for the black community in the UK for over 15 years. Its owner Pride Media also specialises in helping organisations target the community through a range of media. Other publications have included the Gleaner, Black Voice, New Editor and The Caribbean Times. The growth of such media {{is a response to}} the perceived <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> [...] "mainstream" [...] media.

Kashyapa Samhita specially deals with pediatrics, gynecology, and obstetrics Another Indian medical work Kumara Tantra of Ravana, which mainly deals with paediatric diseases, was translated into Chinese. According to book of sui and Book of Tang eleven Indian medical works were translated into Chinese. Indian monks introduced surgery in China. Before the arrival of Buddhism surgical techniques were unknown within China Indian monks and translators themselves had {{a good understanding of}} medicine. An Shigao translated an Indian medical work into Chinese which dealt with 404 diseases Yijing (monk) went to India and brought back some 400 Buddhist translated texts which includes many medical works like Arsaprasamanasutra (A classic on curing all hemorrhoid-related diseases).

Indian medicine has a profound influence on Physician Sun Simiao's medical work. In his work, he attributes many formulae to Jivaka Komarabhacca.
