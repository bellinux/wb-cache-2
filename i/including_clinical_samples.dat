40|$|Protein {{arginine}} methyltransferase PRMT 5 {{interacts with}} human SWI/SNF complexes and methylates histones H 3 R 8 and H 4 R 3. To elucidate {{the role of}} PRMT 5 in human cancer, we analyzed PRMT 5 expression in normal human B lymphocytes and a panel of lymphoid cancer cell lines as well as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) clinical samples. We show that PRMT 5 protein levels are elevated in all cancer cells, <b>including</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> examined despite its low rate of transcription and messenger RNA stability. Remarkably, polysome profiling revealed that PRMT 5 mRNA is translated more efficiently in Mino and JeKo MCL cells than in normal B cells, and that decreased miR- 92 b and miR- 96 expression augments PRMT 5 translation. Consequently, global methylation of H 3 R 8 and H 4 R 3 is increased and is accompanied by repression of suppressor of tumorigenecity 7 (ST 7) in lymphoid cancer cells. Furthermore, knockdown of PRMT 5 expression reduces proliferation of transformed JeKo and Raji cells.

40|$|Abstract: Aim: This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} {{the psychometric properties of}} the short version of the revised ‘Experience of Close Relationships ’ questionnaire, comparing non-clinical and clinical samples. Methods: In total 702 subjects participated in this study, of whom 531 were non-clinical participants and 171 were psychiatric patients. They completed the short version of the revised ‘Experience of Close Relationships ’ questionnaire (ECR-R- 18), the Perceived Stress Scale- 10 (PSS- 10), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the UCLA Loneliness scale. A retest of the ECR-R- 18 was then performed at four-week intervals. Then, confirmatory factor analyses were performed to test the validity of the new scale. Results: The ECR-R- 18 showed a fair to good internal consistency (0. 77 to 0. 87) for both samples, and the test-retest reliability was found to be satisfactory (ICC = 0. 75). The anxiety sub-scale demonstrated concurrent validity with PSS- 10 and RSES, while the avoidance sub-scale showed concurrent validity with the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis using method factors yielded two factors with an acceptable model fit for both groups. An invariance test revealed that the ECR-R- 18 when used on the clinical group differed from when used with the non-clinical group. Conclusions: The ECR-R- 18 questionnaire revealed an overall better level of fit than the original 36 item questionnaire, indicating its suitability for use with a broader group of samples, <b>including</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>samples.</b> The reliability of the ECR-R- 18 might be increased if a modified scoring system is used and if our suggestions with regard to future studies are followed up...|$|E

Attentional bias modification has been studied as a form of additional treatment related to automatic processing. Objectives: This systematic literature review compared and discussed methods, evidence of success and potential clinical applications of studies about attentional bias modification (ABM) using a visual probe task.

Though the causal direction remains unknown, research has also linked creativity to a heightened risk for mental illness, from where {{the idea of the}} “mad creative genius” is born. This research utilizes a nonclinical sample of Connecticut College students (n = 84) to explore how differing amounts of hypomania and creativity within an individual may be related to his/her psychological wellbeing. The student sample was 24 males, 57 females, and 3 students identifying themselves as “other,” all between the ages of 18 and 22. Participants completed a series of creativity measures, as well as questionnaires regarding hypomania, flow, impulsivity, resilience, vulnerability, and personal and familial mental health history. Several regression analyses were conducted examining the predictive capacity of creativity and hypomania on emotional functioning. Creative behavior tended to predict positive emotionality, hypomania tended to predict negative emotionality, and creative thought was mixed. Interaction effects between creative thought and hypomania were observed in the models predicting both vulnerability and resilience. Future research should utilize greater sample size to better understand these interactions.

40|$|Background: Different {{strategies}} {{have been proposed}} to target neoangiogenesis in gliomas, besides those targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The chemokine Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) {{has been shown to}} possess both tumorigenic and proangiogenic properties. Although different pathways of induction of IL- 8 gene expression have been already elucidated, few data are available on its post-transcriptional regulation in gliomas. Methods: Here we investigated the role of the microRNA miR- 93 on the expression levels of IL- 8 and other pro-inflammatory genes by RT-qPCR and Bio-Plex analysis. We used different disease model systems, <b>including</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> from glioma patients and two glioma cell lines, U 251 and T 98 G. Results: IL- 8 and VEGF transcripts are highly expressed in low and high grade gliomas in respect to reference healthy brain; miR- 93 expression is also increased and inversely correlated with transcription of IL- 8 and VEGF genes. Computational analysis showed the presence of miR- 93 consensus sequences in the 3 ′UTR region of both VEGF and IL- 8 mRNAs, predicting possible interaction with miR- 93 and suggesting a potential regulatory role of this microRNA. In vitro transfection with pre-miR- 93 and antagomiR- 93 inversely modulated VEGF and IL- 8 gene expression and protein release when the glioma cell line U 251 was considered. Similar data were obtained on IL- 8 gene regulation in the other glioma cell line analyzed, T 98 G. The effect of pre-miR- 93 and antagomiR- 93 in U 251 cells has been extended to the secretion of a panel of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, which consolidated the concept of a role of miR- 93 in IL- 8 and VEGF gene expression and evidenced a potential regulatory role also for MCP- 1 and PDGF (also involved in angiogenesis).

The uses of alternative methodologies to enable high-resolution differentiation between the species in the genus are needed. A comparative multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of four selected 'house-keeping' genes (atpD, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) assessed the individual gene sequences for their potential in developing a reliable, rapid and cost-effective diagnostic protocol for Achromobacter species identifications. The analysis of the type strains of the species of the genus and 46 strains of Achromobacter species showed congruence between the cluster analyses derived from the individual genes. The MLSA gene sequences exhibited different levels of resolution in delineating the validly published Achromobacter species and elucidated strains that represent new genotypes and probable new species of the genus. Our results also suggested that the recently described A. spritinus is a later heterotypic synonym of A. marplatensis.

40|$|The pestivirus bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) {{was shown}} to bind to the bovine CD 46 molecule, which subsequently promotes entry of the virus. To assess the receptor usage of BVDV type 1 (BVDV- 1) and BVDV- 2, 30 BVDV isolates <b>including</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> were assayed for their sensitivity to anti-CD 46 antibodies. With a single exception the infectivity of all tested strains of BVDV- 1 and BVDV- 2 was inhibited by anti-CD 46 antibodies, which indicates the general usage of CD 46 as a BVDV receptor. Molecular analysis {{of the interaction between}} CD 46 and the BVD virion was performed by mapping the virus binding site on the CD 46 molecule. Single complement control protein modules (CCPs) within the bovine CD 46 were either deleted or replaced by analogous CCPs of porcine CD 46, which does not bind BVDV. While the epitopes recognized by anti-CD 46 monoclonal antibodies which block BVDV infection were attributed to CCP 1 and CCP 2, in functional assays only CCP 1 turned out to be essential for BVDV binding and infection. Within CCP 1 two short peptides on antiparallel beta strands were identified as crucial for the binding of BVDV. Exchanges of these two peptide sequences were sufficient for a loss of function in bovine CD 46 as well as a gain of function in porcine CD 46. Determination of the size constraints of CD 46 revealed that a minimum length of four CCPs is essential for receptor function. An increase of the distance between the virus binding domain and the plasma membrane by insertion of one to six CCPs of bovine C 4 binding protein exhibited only a minor influence on susceptibility to BVDV...|$|E

40|$|Hoarding, {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD), and Tourette's disorder (TD) are psychiatric disorders that share symptom overlap, which might partly {{be the result}} of shared genetic variation. Population-based twin studies have found significant genetic correlations between hoarding and OCD symptoms, with genetic correlations varying between 0. 1 and 0. 45. For tic disorders, studies examining these correlations are lacking. Other lines of research, <b>including</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> and GWAS or CNV data to explore genetic relationships between tic disorders and OCD, have only found very modest if any shared genetic variation. Our aim was to extend current knowledge on the genetic structure underlying hoarding, OC symptoms (OCS), and lifetime tic symptoms and, in a trivariate analysis, assess the degree of common and unique genetic factors contributing to the etiology of these disorders. Data have been gathered from participants in the Netherlands Twin Register comprising a total of 5293 individuals from a sample of adult monozygotic (n = 2460) and dizygotic (n = 2833) twin pairs (mean age 33. 61 years). The data on Hoarding, OCS, and tic symptoms were simultaneously analyzed in Mplus. A liability threshold model was fitted to the twin data, analyzing heritability of phenotypes and of their comorbidity. Following the criteria for a probable clinical diagnosis in all phenotypes, 6. 8 % of participants had a diagnosis of probable hoarding disorder (HD), 6. 3 % of OCS, and 12. 8 % of any probable lifetime tic disorder. Genetic factors explained 50. 4, 70. 1, and 61. 1 % of the phenotypic covariance between hoarding-OCS, hoarding-tics, and OCS-tics, respectively. Substantial genetic correlations were observed between hoarding and OCS (0. 41), hoarding and tics (0. 35), and between OCS and tics (0. 37).

To accomplish this, repeated deep sequencing results were generated using the Roche GS-FLX (454) {{from a number of}} sources <b>including</b> a non-homogeneous <b>clinical</b> <b>sample</b> (N =  47 replicates over 18 deep sequencing runs), and a large clinical cohort from the MOTIVATE and A 400129 studies (N =  1521). For repeated measurements of a non-homogeneous <b>clinical</b> <b>sample,</b> increasing input copy number both decreased variance in the measured proportion of non-R 5 using virus (p<< 0. 001 and 0. 02 for single replicates and triplicates respectively) and increased measured viral diversity (p< 0. 001; multiple measures). Detection of sequences with a mean abundance less than 1 % abundance showed a 2 fold increase in median coefficient of variation (CV) in repeated measurements of a non-homogeneous <b>clinical</b> <b>sample,</b> and a 2. 7 fold increase in CV in the MOTIVATE/A 400129 dataset compared to sequences with ≥ 1 % abundance. An unexpected source of error included read position, with low accuracy reads occurring more frequently towards the edge of sequencing regions (p<< 0. 001). Overall, the primary source of variability was sampling error caused by low input copy number/minority species prevalence, though other sources of error including sequence intrinsic, temporal, and read-position related errors were detected...|$|R
40|$|Background: Temporomandibular Disorders is a {{prevalent}} disease affecting a {{large population}} worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine, {{as a part of}} complementary alternative medicine, has been used in treating TMDs for thousands of years in the Chinese society and being postulated beneficial. The aim {{of this article is to}} review the possible mechanisms and effectiveness of various TCM approaches in treating TMDs. Methods: Literatures in English and Chinese <b>including</b> <b>clinical</b> trials with <b>sample</b> randomization and control groups and basic scientific studies were analysed. Conclusions: The most common TCM treatment modalities in treating TMDs include acupuncture, moxibustion with or without acupuncture and medicated compress. A review of these TCM treatment modalities showed that possible beneficial effects existed in TMDs management. Acupuncture seems to be the most evidenced based treatment modality among the three and being investigated the most. However, due to a lack of evidence based studies, more scientific and rigorous randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to further evaluate TCM's safety, efficacy and effectiveness. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Integrating CCR 5 antagonists into {{clinical}} practice {{would benefit from}} accurate assays of co-receptor usage (CCR 5 versus CXCR 4) with fast turnaround and low cost. Design: Published HIV V 3 -loop based predictors of co-receptor usage were compared with actual phenotypic tropism results in a large cohort of antiretroviral naive individuals to determine accuracy on <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> and identify areas for improvement. Methods: Aligned HIV envelope V 3 loop sequences (n = 977), derived by bulk sequencing were analyzed by six methods: the 11 / 25 rule; a neural network (NN), two support vector machines, and two subtype-B position specific scoring matrices (PSSM). Co-receptor phenotype results (Trofile Co-receptor Phenotype Assay; Monogram Biosciences) were stratified by CXCR 4 relative light unit (RLU) readout and CD 4 cell count. Results: Co-receptor phenotype was available for 920 <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> with V 3 genotypes having fewer than seven amino acid mixtures (n = 769 R 5; n = 151 X 4 -capable). Sensitivity and specificity for predicting X 4 capacity were evaluated for the 11 / 25 rule (30 % sensitivity/ 93 % specificity), NN (44 %/ 88 %), PSSM(sinsi) (34 %/ 96 %), PSSM(x 4 r 5) (24 %/ 97 %), SVMgenomiac (22 %/ 90 %) and SVMgeno 2 pheno (50 %/ 89 %). Quantitative increases in sensitivity could be obtained by optimizing the cut-off for methods with continuous output (PSSM methods), and/or integrating clinical data (CD 4 %). Sensitivity was directly proportional to strength of X 4 signal in the phenotype assay (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Current default implementations of co-receptor prediction algorithms are inadequate for predicting HIV X 4 co-receptor usage in <b>clinical</b> <b>samples,</b> particularly those X 4 phenotypes with low CXCR 4 RLU signals. Significant improvements {{can be made to}} genotypic predictors, <b>including</b> training on <b>clinical</b> <b>samples,</b> using additional data to improve predictions and optimizing cutoffs and increasing genotype sensitivity.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that working memory training programs are effective both as treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other cognitive disorders in children and as a tool to improve cognitive ability and scholastic attainment in typically developing children and adults. However, effects across studies appear to be variable, and a systematic meta-analytic review was undertaken. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments without randomization, have a treatment, and have either a treated group or an untreated control group. Twenty-three studies with 30 group comparisons met the criteria for inclusion. The studies <b>included</b> involved <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> and samples of typically developing children and adults. Meta-analyses indicated that the programs produced reliable short-term improvements in working memory skills. For verbal working memory, these near-transfer effects were not sustained at follow-up, whereas for visuospatial working memory, limited evidence suggested that such effects might be maintained. More importantly, there was no convincing evidence of the generalization of working memory training to other skills (nonverbal and verbal ability, inhibitory processes in attention, word decoding, and arithmetic). The authors conclude that memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize. Possible limitations of the review (including age differences in the samples and the variety of different <b>clinical</b> conditions <b>included)</b> are noted. However, current findings cast doubt on both the clinical relevance of working memory training programs and their utility as methods of enhancing cognitive functioning in typically developing children and healthy adults...|$|R

40|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei is not {{represented}} in {{the current version of}} Bruker Biotyper matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. A total of 66 isolates of B. pseudomallei, <b>including</b> 30 <b>clinical</b> isolates collected from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH, n= 27) and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH, n= 3), and 36 isolates of genetically confirmed strains, <b>including</b> 13 from <b>clinical</b> <b>samples</b> and 23 from environmental samples, collected from southern Taiwan were included in this study. All these isolates were identified by partial 16 S rDNA gene sequencing analysis and the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system. Among the 30 isolates initially identified as B. pseudomallei by conventional identification methods, one was identified as B. cepacia complex (NTUH) and three were identified as B. putida (PUMCH) by partial 16 S rDNA gene sequencing analysis and Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system. The Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system misidentified 62 genetically confirmed B. pseudomallei isolates as B. thailandensis or Burkholderia species (score values, 1. 803 - 2. 063) when the currently available database (DB 5627) was used. However, using a newly created MALDI-TOF MS database (including B. pseudomallei NTUH- 3 strain), all isolates were correctly identified as B. pseudomallei (score values > 2. 000, 100 %). An additional 60 isolates of genetically confirmed B. cepacia complex and B. putida were also evaluated by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system using the newly created database and none of these isolates were identified as B. pseudomallei. MALDI-TOF MS is a versatile and robust tool for the rapid identification of B. pseudomallei using the enhanced database...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{potential}} {{link between}} dissociative symptoms and symptom over-reporting {{has been given}} little attention. In two student samples (N’s = 139 and 113) and a <b>clinical</b> <b>sample</b> (N = 21), we examined whether self-reported dissociative symptoms are related to symptom over-reporting. Methods: We relied on different measures of dissociation and over-reporting. In the <b>clinical</b> <b>sample,</b> we looked at whether the well-established link between dissociative symptoms and sleep disturbances would survive if we corrected for symptom over-reporting. Results: Dissociativity correlated with symptom over-reporting in the student samples, {{but not in the}} <b>clinical</b> <b>sample.</b> Correcting for over-reporting tendencies did not fundamentally alter the relationships between dissociative symptoms and sleep disturbances in the <b>clinical</b> <b>sample.</b> Conclusions: Our results suggest that the overlap between symptom over-reporting and dissociativity is much more a problem in nonclinical than in <b>clinical</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
