25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a fin keel characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155Â°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a fin keel creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a <b>full</b> <b>keel,</b> and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern monohull boats have fin keels, {{which are}} heavy and deep, but short in {{relation}} to the hull length. More traditional yachts carried a <b>full</b> <b>keel</b> which is generally half or more of the length of the boat. A recent feature is a winged keel, which is short and shallow, but carries a lot of weight in two [...] "wings" [...] which run sideways from {{the main part of the}} keel. Even more recent is the concept of canting keels, designed to move the weight at the bottom of a sailboat to the upwind side, allowing the boat to carry more sails.|$|E
2500|$|Boat rudders may {{be either}} {{outboard}} or inboard. Outboard rudders are {{hung on the}} stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit. [...] Inboard keel hung rudders (which are {{a continuation of the}} aft trailing edge of the <b>full</b> <b>keel)</b> are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing. [...] Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.|$|E
50|$|The boat has a {{draft of}} 5.00 ft with the {{standard}} wing keel and 6.33 ft with the optional <b>full</b> fin <b>keel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed <b>keels,</b> including <b>full</b> <b>keels,</b> long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs. Deep-draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions ...|$|R

5000|$|Carl Alberg {{designed}} {{many of the}} company's models, favoring simple lines, narrow beams, {{and often}} utilizing a <b>full</b> <b>keel</b> for superior handling in heavier winds and seas.

Ballast of 1234 kg (2721 lb), which was 321 lbs more than the Mark 1's, of leador steel shot in the keel and a displacement of 2580 kg (5688 lb), makes a safe ballast ratio of 48%. The hulls were gun sprayed in two halves, joined down the middle and then steel shot ballast was cemented into the keel.|$|R
40|$|User {{requirements}} for the first ten years of space station operation are assessed, and space station system capabilities to meet those needs are delineated. A module length of about 11. 5 m with external interconnects best meets growth needs, and a power unit which provides 42 KW is desirable. Four growth scenarios for the manned element of the space station program are studied, and typical growth configurations are described. The <b>full</b> dual <b>keel</b> configuration is attractive at this point due to its increased flexibility...|$|R
5000|$|Early Bristols {{offered a}} lot for their modest prices, {{including}} encapsulated lead keels on many models, but with iron punchings and concrete {{on many of the}} boats that joined the Bristol line when Bristol acquired the molds from Sailstar. The boats features large galleys for their day, large cockpits with seats you could sleep on, fiberglass cabin headliners on some models, and interiors with a nice blend of white formica and mahogany trim. The early boats had keel-hung rudders, cut away <b>full</b> <b>keels</b> and were moderately stout boats with an relatively comfortable motion for their day. The second generation Bristol yachts carried a decimal and a repeat of the second model number (27.7, 29.9, 31,1, 33.3, 35.5, 38.8, 41.1, 43.3, 45.5, 47.7, 51.1). They came from the design team of Ted Hood, an America's Cup designer. Hood designs generally were centerboard boats which aimed for performance without deep draft, although some models offered the option of a deeper fixed keel. The hull designs were a development of Ted Hood's [...] "whale bottom" [...] delta hull form, with a steep deadrise allowing the ballast to be placed low in the hull (compensating for the lack of ballast in the centreboard), and improving interior space. This hull design is known for its comfortable motion in a seaway. Several of the second generation boats were designed by Dieter Empacher, who, at the time, was employed by Hood design group.|$|R
50|$|The Sea Sprite 23, a Carl Alberg design, {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1957. The Sea Sprite 28', 30' and Sea Sprite 34 {{were designed by}} Alfred E. (Bill) Luders Jr. The series share their <b>full</b> <b>keel,</b> sea friendly design.|$|E
50|$|Around 100 {{were built}} from {{approximately}} 1970-1980 starting with hull number 100. These vessels have a <b>full</b> <b>keel</b> and {{a relatively short}} rig.

5000|$|A 2014 {{review of}} the design in Sail Magazine said, [...] "the Bayfield 25 {{is well known for}} its 1,500-pound <b>full</b> <b>keel</b> that draws less than 3 feet, shippy-looking {{miniature}} bowsprit and comfortable living spaces that provide 6 feet of standing headroom." ...|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{styles of}} stems: plumb and raked. When the stem comes {{up from the}} water, if it is {{perpendicular}} to the waterline it is [...] "plumb." [...] If it is inclined {{at an angle to}} the waterline it is [...] "raked." [...] (E.g., [...] "The hull is single decked and characterized by a plumb stem, <b>full</b> bows, straight <b>keel,</b> moderate deadrise, and an easy turn of bilge.") ...|$|R
5000|$|Bolger evolved {{the concept}} of {{traditional}} sharpies and by squaring off the bow and stern to give the longest useful waterline. Most were configured as yawls (with main mast quite far forward and a small mizzen far aft). The bow on these designs is cut off and blunt and the sterns are vertical. In some designe an open bow can allow passage to land if the boat is beached, space for holding anchors and cables, or clearance to step and unstep a mast. Oldshoe, Micro and Long Micro have shallow ballasted <b>full</b> length <b>keels</b> whereas {{what he called the}} [...] "Advanced Sharpies" [...] AS19, AS29 and AS39 have one or two bilgeboards and inside ballast. The latter are very definitely in the extended cruise/liveaboard category.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{determining}} the PHRF for an individual boat begins with the regional PHRF rating, then adjustments are made for the individual attributes of the boat such as: modifications to the rig, {{the size of the}} largest foresail (jib or genoa), the size of the spinnakers, type of <b>keel</b> (<b>full,</b> fin, wing etc.), the number of blades on the propeller, and the style of the propeller (fixed, folding, feathering). Significant modifications to the mainsail can cause penalties.|$|R

5000|$|In Australia, {{the best}} known and most popular pocket cruiser is the locally {{produced}} Savage Nautilus, a shoal draft yacht of 19 ft 4 in length overall with a 7 ft 10 in beam and a <b>full</b> length <b>keel</b> that draws only 2 ft 9 in. Fitted with an 8hp Yanmar diesel inboard motor (an unusual feature in a boat so small) and capable of sleeping four adults, they were produced in large numbers and have proved incredibly popular with Australian pocket cruising enthusiasts. Loosely based on a lifeboat design, they are sufficiently stable and heavily constructed to sail offshore and some have made long distance blue water crossings, such as the notorious waters of Bass Strait, between mainland Australia and the island state of Tasmania (including the pictured example, [...] "Bullwinkle", which was sailed from Brisbane to Hobart).|$|R
6000|$|As he {{said this}} he smiled, patted the little boy {{on the head and}} left him. But Davy replied not a word to his friend's remarks. His curly head was stuffed quite <b>full</b> with the <b>keel,</b> timbers, ribs, beams, stern-post, planks, and {{cutwater}} of the Fair Nancy; he could not speak, he found it difficult even to think, so he thrust his hands deep into his pockets, sat down on the shank of an anchor, and stared out to sea. In half an hour he heaved a very deep sigh indeed, and said, [...] "Oh! dear me, I wonder if I shall ever go to sea in the Fair Nancy!" ...|$|R
50|$|The gigs {{generally}} {{had a high}} wineglass transom, full skeg, <b>full</b> <b>keel,</b> {{straight stem}} and somewhat rounded sides. There was in general very little rocker in the keel.

Fastenings were originally treenails, but were replaced during restoration by spiking.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} a {{sailboat}} company is the design of its boats. Down East Yachts started with a single boat, the Downeaster 38 which was designed by Henry Morschladt, a California Naval Architect who specialized in cruising sailboats. The design was traditional, with a wineglass stern, <b>full</b> <b>keel,</b> and bowsprit. As additional boats {{were added to the}} line, they were modifications of this original design.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were <b>full.</b> The <b>keels</b> had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a âpee deeâ.
