5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|Nikolas Tomas Stauskas (born October 7, 1993) is a Canadian {{professional}} basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A native of Mississauga, Ontario, Stauskas played two seasons of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{competition for the}} Michigan Wolverines ending with the 2013–14 team before declaring for the NBA draft. Stauskas was drafted eighth overall in the 2014 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings, for which he began his NBA career. Towards {{the end of his}} rookie season, Stauskas was tagged with the nickname Sauce Castillo after a closed captioning error resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> media meme.

5|$|On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc {{compilation}} album entitled New Moon {{was released}} by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label, songs that were not included on albums, {{as well as a}} few early versions and previously released B-sides. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic's 15th best-reviewed album of 2007. A portion of the proceeds from album sales were to go to Outside <b>In,</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.|$|E

5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among variegated fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> group and for advertising and defending a territory. The basic song type is a high-pitched reel {{of a large}} number of short elements (10–20 per second); this lasts 1–4 seconds. The reel of the variegated fairywren is the softest of all malurids. Birds maintain contact with each other by tsst or seeee calls, while a short, sharp tsit serves as an alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> group and for advertising and mobbing, or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by {{both males and}} females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given {{in response to the}} calls of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds (Cracticus torquatus). The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. Superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp chits, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a purr while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.|$|E
5|$|Wulfstan {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{distinguished}} and effective Old English prose writers. His writings cover a wide range of topics in an even greater range of genres, including homilies (or sermons), secular laws, religious canons, and political theory. With Ælfric of Eynsham, he is one of the two major vernacular writers in early eleventh-century England, a period which, ecclesiastically, was still very much enamoured of and greatly influenced by the Benedictine Reform. The Benedictine Reform was a movement which sought to institute monastic standards among the secular clergy, a movement made popular by the churchmen of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Reform promoted a regular (i.e. based on a regula, or rule) life for priests and clerics, a strict church hierarchy, the primacy of the Roman see, the authority of codified or canonical church law, and stressed the importance of catholic, that is universal, church practices throughout all Christendom. These ideas could only thrive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> and political atmosphere which recognised the importance of both the clergy's and the laity's obedience to the authority of the church on all things spiritual, and also on many things secular and juridical. This {{was one of the}} main theoretical models behind much of Wulfstan's legal and quasi-legal writings. But Wulfstan was not blind to the fact that, in order for this Reform model to thrive in England, the English clergy and laity (especially the laity) needed to be educated in the basic tenets of the faith. Nothing less than the legitimacy of English Christendom rested on Englishmen's steadfastness on certain fundamental Christian beliefs and practices, like, for example, knowledge of Christ's life and passion, memorisation of the Pater Noster and the Apostles' Creed, proper baptism, and the correct date and method of celebrating Easter mass. It is towards the promotion of such beliefs and practices, that Wulfstan engaged in writing a number of homilies dedicated to educating both clergy and laity in those Christian fundamentals which he saw as so important for both the flourishing of Christian lives and the success of the English polity.|$|E
