5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> {{into the}} contiguous United States from the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, {{and the eastern}} Pacific Ocean. The highest rainfall totals in {{the country have been}} measured across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{inhabited}} a {{wide range}} of marine environments (i.e., shallow coastal waters, areas of coastal upwelling, swampy coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle. Adult megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with {{the rim of the}} shell to the front.
