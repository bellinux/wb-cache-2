After {{the opening of the}} Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010, Universal began considering <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> attendance balanced between the adjacent parks.

25|$|The Ars Amatoria is a , a didactic elegiac poem {{in three}} books that {{sets out to}} teach the arts of {{seduction}} and love. The first book addresses men and teaches them how to seduce women, the second, also to men, teaches <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a lover. The third addresses women and teaches seduction techniques. The first book opens with an invocation to Venus, in which Ovid establishes himself as a praeceptor amoris (1.17)—a teacher of love. Ovid describes the places one can go to find a lover, like the theater, a triumph, which he thoroughly describes, or arena—and ways to get the girl to take notice, including seducing her covertly at a banquet. Choosing the right time is significant, as is getting into her associates' confidence.|$|E

25|$|Cameron's {{choice of}} cinematographer {{on the movie}} was Mikael Salomon – a US-based Danish {{national}} who {{would go on to}} work on other blockbusters such as Backdraft and Arachnophobia before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series Band of Brothers. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.|$|E
