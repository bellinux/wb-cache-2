40|$|Reported herein is a {{detailed}} study of the kinetics and mechanism of formation of a 1, 4 -GG interstrand cross-link by the dinuclear platinum anticancer compound [15 N][{cis-PtCl(NH 3) 2 } 2 {孎H 2 (CH 2) 6 NH 2 }] 2 + (1, 1 /c,c (1)). The reaction of [15 N] 1 with 5 '-{d(ATATGTACATAT) 2 } (I) has been studied by [1 H, 15 N] HSQC NMR spectroscopy {{in the presence of}} different concentrations of phosphate. In contrast with the <b>geometric</b> trans <b>isomer</b> (1, 1 /t,t), there was no evidence for an electrostatic preassociation of 1, 1 /c,c with the polyanionic DNA surface, and the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the aquation of [15 N] 1 was actually slightly higher (rather than lower) than that in the absence of DNA. When phosphate is absent, the overall rate of formation of the cross-link is quite similar for the two geometric isomers, occurring slightly faster for 1, 1 /t,t. A major difference in the DNA binding pathways is the observation of phosphate-bound intermediates only in the case of 1, 1 /c,c. 15 mM phosphate causes a dramatic slowing in the overall rate of formation of DNA interstrand cross-links due to both the slow formation and slow closure of the phosphate-bound monofunctional adduct. A comparison of the molecular models of the bifunctional adducts of the two isomers shows that helical distortion is minimal and globally the structures of the 1, 4 interstrand cross-links are quite similar. The effect of carrier ligand was investigated by similar studies of the ethylenediamine derivative [15 N] 1 -en. A pKa value of 5. 43 was determined for the [15 N] 1, 1 /c,c-en diaquated species. The rate of reaction of [15 N] 1 -en with duplex I {{is similar to that of}} 1, 1 /c,c and the overall conformation of the final adduct appears to be similar.

The objective of this paper was to determine the opportunities of improving milk productivity and altering the milk composition through nutritional interventions. The increase in the nutraceutical value of milk is expected through dietary modifications of the animal. Feeding high concentrate diets combined with dietary fat can be used to modify the FA profile of milk, without negative effect on milk yield and milk fat or protein contents. Their effects may be complementary, at least for trans fatty acids. The profile of trans isomers relative to total trans-C 18 : 1 seems dependent on the source of dietary fat. Feeding oilseeds and / or novel fat supplements to ruminants can be used to modify the lipid metabolism in the mammary gland in modulating the secretion of fat and the profile of milk fatty acids. Feeding novel fatty acid sources the nutritive value of milk can be enhanced by decreased atherogenic saturated FA in milk and increased t 11 -C 18 : 1 (trans vaccenic acid), and c 9,t 11 -C 18 : 2 (<b>geometric</b> and positional <b>isomer</b> of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in milk, which are considered as positive for human health.

40|$|End {{of project}} reportgrass-based systems of production. A {{series of studies}} were carried out to (i) improve our {{understanding}} of the physiological basis of poor reproductive performance; (ii) examine management and nutritional strategies to improve fertility; and (iii) examine the potential role of extended lactation to mitigate the effects of poor reproductive performance. A comprehensive characterization of the North American and New Zealand strains of Holstein-Friesian cow was carried out. North American cows produce a greater volume of milk, but yield a similar amount of fat and protein on a grass-based diet. Dry matter intake was greater for the larger NA strain, but energy balance did not differ during the first 20 weeks of lactation. Circulating concentrations of metabolic hormones and metabolites during the early lactation period were indicative of lesser bioenergetic status in the NZ strain compared to the NA strain. During established lactation, circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were greater in the NZ strain. Liver biopsies collected at day 35 and day 150 postpartum indicated that the greater circulating concentration of IGF-I was due to greater hepatic mRNA abundance of IGF-I and acid labile subunit (ALS). Embryos were collected from both strains after superovulation. A greater proportion of the embryos recovered were transferable in the NZ strain compared with the NA strain, indicating that the previously reported differences in reproductive performance were manifest as early as 7 days post-insemination. Collectively, {{the results of the study}} indicate that the NZ strain are genetically better equipped to survive on a pasture-based seasonal calving system. A study was carried out to examine the effect of dry period duration and dietary energy density on milk production, bioenergetic status and postpartum ovarian function. Omitting the dry period and increasing dietary energy density both resulted in improved energy balance and metabolic status, but omitting the dry period reduced the postpartum interval to resumption of cyclicity whereas increasing dietary energy density had no effect. Omitting the dry period reduced the inherent drive to produce milk, and allowed the cow to fully meet nutritional requirements from voluntary dry matter intake. Increased dietary energy density also allowed the cow to more closely meet nutritional requirements from a higher energy density diet, albeit at a greater milk yield. The results suggest that the mechanism by which a cow arrives at a particular energy balance status may be as important as energy balance per se. One of the main energy costs associated with lactation is milk fat. Trans 10, cis 12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a <b>geometric</b> and positional <b>isomer</b> of linoleic acid that reduces milk fat synthesis in a dose dependent manner. Supplementing cows with CLA resulted in improved energy balance status during the transition period and reduced postpartum body condition score loss. Some indices of reproductive performance were also improved. In seasonal systems, cows that fail to become pregnant by the end of the breeding season are typically culled and replaced. When reproductive performance is poor, this represents a major cost on dairy farms. A study was carried out to examine the feasibility of extending the lactation to 22 months, resulting in a calving interval of 24 months instead of 12 months. High yielding cows produced the equivalent of 2 normal lactations in an extended lactation system. An economic analysis indicated that an efficient spring calving system with a compact calving pattern and a 12 month calving interval is still the most profitable, but with high yielding cows extending the lactation of non-pregnant cows is more profitable than culling and replacing...|$|R

5000|$|The third {{chapter is}} named [...] "Maxwell's Demons". It starts off {{by stating that}} {{proteins}} are the molecular agents of teleonomic performance in living beings. Monod continues by writing that living beings are chemical machines, every organism constitutes a coherent and functional unit, and that the organism is a self-constructing machine whose macroscopic structure is not determined by outside forces but by autonomous internal interactions. The author spends much of the chapter reviewing general facts of biochemistry. He explains that proteins are composed of 100-10,000 amino acids and he distinguishes between elongated fibrous proteins that play a mechanical role and the more numerous globular proteins that are folded upon themselves. He talks about the extraordinary specificity of action that enzymes display as exemplified by their ability to not only recognize a specific <b>geometric</b> <b>isomer</b> but an optical isomer as well. He points out that enzymes are optically active themselves, L isomers are the [...] "natural" [...] isomers, and that the specificity of action and the sterospecificity of the reaction conducted by an enzyme {{are the result of}} the positioning of the molecules with respect to each other. Monod writes that an enzymatic reaction can be seen in two steps: The formation of a sterospecific complex between protein and substrate and the catalytic activation of a reaction within the complex (he stresses again that the reaction is oriented and specified by the structure of the complex). He next considers the energetic differences between covalent and non-covalent bonds and how the speed of a reaction is affected by activation energy. Since the activation energy of a covalent bond is high the reaction will have a slower speed than that of a non-covalent bond (which occurs spontaneously and rapidly). The author points out that non-covalent interactions attain stability only through numerous interactions and when applied over short distances. To attain stable non-covalent interaction {{there is a need for}} complementary sites between two interacting molecules so as to permit several atoms of the one to enter into contact with several atoms of the other. In this complex the molecule of substrate is strictly positioned by the multiple non-covalent interactions with the enzyme. Enzymatic catalysis is believed to result from the inductive and polarizing action of certain chemical groupings of the specific receptor. By virtue of an enzyme's capacity to form sterospecific and non-covalent complexes with specific substrate the substrate is correctly presented in the precise orientation that specifies the catalytic effect of the enzyme. Monod reminds us that this reaction comes at the expense of chemical potential energy.|$|E

40|$|The O-N-N-O-type tetradentate ligands H 2 S,S-eddp (H 2 S,S-eddp {{stands for}} S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N'-di- 2 -propionic acid) and H(2) edap (H(2) edap stands for ethylenediamine-N-acetic-N'- 3 -propionic acid) and the {{corresponding}} novel octahedral nickel(II) complexes have been prepared and characterized. N 2 O 2 ligands coordinate to the nickel(II) ion via four donor atoms (two deprotonated carboxylate atoms and two amine nitrogens) affording octahedral geometry {{in the case of}} all investigated Ni(II) complexes. A six coordinate, octahedral geometry has been verified crystallographically for the s-cis-[Ni(S,S-eddp) (H 2 O) (2) ] complex. Structural data correlating similarly chelated Ni(II) complexes have been used to carry out an extensive configuration analysis. Molecular mechanics and Density Functional Theory (DFT) have been used to model the most stable <b>geometric</b> <b>isomer,</b> yielding, at the same time, significant structural and spectroscopic (TDDFT) data. The results from density functional studies have been compared to X-ray data. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Natural Energetic Decomposition Analysis (NEDA) have been done for the [Ni(edda-type) (H 2 O) (2 -n) ] and nH(2) O fragments. Molecular orbital analysis (MPA) is given as well. The infra-red and electronic absorption spectra of the complexes are discussed in comparison to the related complexes of known geometries. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of this study, various species of Tongan marine sponges were {{investigated}} using an NMR-based screening method and has resulted in the discovery of three new sesterterpenes and 11 known compounds. Examination of the sponge Fascaplysinopsis sp. resulted in the isolation of two novel sesterterpenes, isoluffariellolide (46) and 1 -O-methylisoluffariellolide (47). Compounds 46 and 47 share the same backbone pattern as the known luffariellolide (45) and 25 -Omethylluffariellolide (107) respectively, and differ only in the substitution pattern of the butenolide rings. Isoluffariellolide (46) was found to be approximately six times less cytotoxic than 1 -O-methylisoluffariellolide (47). Interestingly, these results suggested that the 1 -O-methyl group in compound 47 {{plays an important role in}} the cytotoxicity of the compound. Secothorectolide (49), a new ring-opened and <b>geometric</b> <b>isomer</b> of the known compound thorectolide (48), was obtained from a sponge of the order Dictyoceratida. This ring closure and opening relationship was also observed between manoalide (109) and secomanoalide (110), as well as luffariellins A (141) and B (142). Despite the different carbon skeleton, the functional groups in 141 and 142 are similar with those in 109 and 110, respectively, and not surprisingly the biological properties are almost identical. The biological activities of compounds 48 and 49 were almost the same, which would give an insight into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between these types of compounds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractActivities of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase-I were {{examined}} {{in the presence of}} the anti-tumor drug cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II) and its inactive <b>geometric</b> <b>isomer</b> trans-diaminedichloroplatinum(II). The trans-isomer did not inhibit the enzyme activity. The anti-tumor drug, on the other hand, retarded the enzyme in its ability to extend the primer strand of DNA. Two alternative mechanisms of inhibition, covalent binding of cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II) to the polymerase and to the template DNA, were explored. Selective pre-incubations of the platinum drug with the polymerase and DNA reveal that the inhibition is primarily due to covalent binding to the enzyme. The rates of inhibition were found to be first order in enzyme and zeroth order in platinum in the concentration range 0. 05 – 3. 0 mM. A mechanism that deals with the formation of an initial platinum–polymerase-I complex with a binding constant > 105 M− 1 followed by a further reaction to form an inhibitory complex is consistent with the kinetic data. The rate limiting first order rate constant for the formation of the inhibitory complex is comparable to that observed for the thiol coordination of peptides containing cysteine residues. Analyses of known structures and functions of catalytic domains of various polymerases point to the direction that the inhibition is perhaps due to the distortion of the DNA binding domain of the enzyme due to platinum coordination...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} form of fat spoilage is oxidative rancidity, {{produced by the}} action of atmospheric oxygen upon the fat. The effects of oxidation on edible fats include loss of palatability, destruction of contained vitamins (the fat-soluble A, D and E), and bleaching of the natural pigments, which are often of a carotenoid nature. In addition, oxidized fats may exhibit toxic properties. It is therefore evident that the prevention and detection of oxidative rancidity are problems of considerable practical significance. An oil or fat consists of a complex mixture of glycerides, these being combinations of glycerol with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are ordinarily stable in air but may oxidize to some extent under extreme conditions, as, for instance, {{under the influence of the}} peroxides present in oxidizing fat mixtures. Fatty acids react more readily with oxygen as the number of double bonds in the molecule increases. For example, linoleic acid oxidizes more rapidly than oleic acid under the same conditions. Ease of oxidation is governed in some measure by molecular structure; thus oleic acid is less resistant than its <b>geometric</b> <b>isomer,</b> elaidic. The insertion of a hydroxyl group into oleic acid to form ricinolelc acid likewise results in a decrease in susceptibility. It is also probable that the position of a double bond in the chain relative to other unsaturated centres and to the carboxyl group will influence its rate of oxidation. [ [...] . ...|$|E
