25|$|The <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle,</b> in its {{canonical}} form, {{applies only}} {{to changes in the}} vibrational levels of a molecule {{in the course of a}} change in electronic levels by either absorption or emission of a photon. The physical intuition of this principle is anchored by the idea that the nuclear coordinates of the atoms constituting the molecule do not have time to change during the very brief amount of time involved in an electronic transition. However, this physical intuition can be, and is indeed, routinely extended to interactions between light-absorbing or emitting molecules (chromophores) and their environment. Franck–Condon metaphors are appropriate because molecules often interact strongly with surrounding molecules, particularly in liquids and solids, and these interactions modify the nuclear coordinates of the chromophore in ways closely analogous to the molecular vibrations considered by the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> is a {{statement}} on allowed vibrational transitions between two different electronic states; other quantum mechanical selection rules may lower {{the probability of a}} transition or prohibit it altogether. Rotational selection rules have been neglected in the above derivation. Rotational contributions can be observed in the spectra of gases but are strongly suppressed in liquids and solids.|$|E
25|$|For many fluorophores the {{absorption}} spectrum is {{a mirror image}} of the emission spectrum. This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.|$|E

25|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} typical line shape for {{electronic}} transitions of individual chromophores in a solid matrix. The zero-phonon line {{is located at}} a frequency ω’ determined by the intrinsic difference in energy levels between ground and excited state {{as well as by}} the local environment. The phonon sideband is shifted to a higher frequency in absorption and to a lower frequency in fluorescence. The frequency gap Δ between the zero-phonon line and the peak of the phonon side band is determined by <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Consider chromophores {{surrounded}} by solvent molecules. These surrounding molecules may {{interact with the}} chromophores, particularly if the solvent molecules are polar. This association between solvent and solute {{is referred to as}} solvation and is a stabilizing interaction, that is, the solvent molecules can move and rotate until the energy of the interaction is minimized. The interaction itself involves electrostatic and van der Waals forces and can also include hydrogen bonds. <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principles</b> can be applied when the interactions between the chromophore and the surrounding solvent molecules are different in the ground and in the excited electronic state. This change in interaction can originate, for example, due to different dipole moments in these two states. If the chromophore starts in its ground state and is close to equilibrium with the surrounding solvent molecules and then absorbs a photon that takes it to the excited state, its interaction with the solvent will be far from equilibrium in the excited state. This effect is analogous to the original Franck–Condon principle: the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion of nuclei—the rearrangement of solvent molecules in the case of solvation. We now speak of a vertical transition, but now the horizontal coordinate is solvent-solute interaction space. This coordinate axis is often labeled as [...] "Solvation Coordinate" [...] and represents, somewhat abstractly, all of the relevant dimensions of motion of all of the interacting solvent molecules.|$|R
25|$|The {{applicability}} of the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> in both absorption and fluorescence, along with Kasha's rule leads to an approximate mirror symmetry shown in Figure 2. The vibrational structure of molecules in a cold, sparse gas is most clearly visible due {{to the absence of}} inhomogeneous broadening of the individual transitions. Vibronic transitions are drawn in Figure 2 as narrow, equally spaced Lorentzian lineshapes. Equal spacing between vibrational levels is only the case for the parabolic potential of simple harmonic oscillators, in more realistic potentials, such as those shown in Figure 1, energy spacing decreases with increasing vibrational energy. Electronic transitions to and from the lowest vibrational states are often referred to as 0–0 (zero zero) transitions and have the same energy in both absorption and fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} clear that the quantum {{mechanical}} formulation of the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> {{is the result of}} a series of approximations, principally the electrical dipole transition assumption and the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Weaker magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole electronic transitions along with the incomplete validity of the factorization of the total wavefunction into nuclear, electronic spatial and spin wavefunctions means that the selection rules, including the Franck-Condon factor, are not strictly observed. For any given transition, the value of P is determined by all of the selection rules, however spin selection is the largest contributor, followed by electronic selection rules. The Franck-Condon factor only weakly modulates the intensity of transitions, i.e., it contributes with a factor on the order of 1 to the intensity of bands whose order of magnitude is determined by the other selection rules. The table below gives the range of extinction coefficients for the possible combinations of allowed and forbidden spin and orbital selection rules.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle,</b> after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. Figure 7 illustrates the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic transition energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
40|$|The spectroscopic <b>Franck-Condon</b> (FC) <b>principle</b> is {{extended}} to mechanochemistry. If the external {{force is applied}} rapidly (the sudden-force regime), then the transition between the potential energy surface and the force-modified potential energy surface {{is analogous to the}} optical electronic transition. Such a transition produces a nonequilibrium ensemble of vibrationally excited molecules. This excess of vibrational energy is another activation source in addition to the well-known reaction barrier modulation by the external force. In the same time, the nonequilibrium vibrational distribution implies nonstatistical kinetics of a mechanochemical transformation. Mechanochemical FC principle thus provides a conceptual picture for the sudden-force mechanochemistry and opens possibilities for quantitative calculations of the mechanochemical rates and mechanisms. Here we use it to compute the dissociation rates of a model diatomic molecule and to explain the selectivity in mechanochemical bond breaking in n-butane. The approach is predicted to be relevant for large-magnitude external forces, applied instantaneously. Otherwise, the excess vibrational energy will dissipate due to intramolecular vibrational redistribution and interaction with environment...|$|R

2500|$|The closest Franck–Condon {{analogy is}} due to the {{interaction}} of phonons (quanta of lattice vibrations) with the electronic transitions of chromophores embedded as impurities in the lattice. In this situation, transitions to higher electronic levels can take place when the energy of the photon corresponds to the purely electronic transition energy or to the purely electronic transition energy plus the energy of one or more lattice phonons. In the low-temperature approximation, emission is from the zero-phonon level of the excited state [...] to the zero-phonon level of the ground state or to higher phonon levels of the ground state. Just like in the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle,</b> the probability of transitions involving phonons is determined by the overlap of the phonon wavefunctions at the initial and final energy levels. For the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> applied to phonon transitions, the label of the horizontal axis of Figure 1 is replaced in Figure 6 with the configurational coordinate for a normal mode. The lattice mode [...] potential energy in Figure 6 is represented as that of a harmonic oscillator, and the spacing between phonon levels (...) is determined by lattice parameters. Because the energy of single phonons is generally quite small, zero- or few-phonon transitions can only be observed at temperatures below about 40 kelvins.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> has a {{well-established}} semiclassical interpretation {{based on the}} original contributions of James Franck [...] Electronic transitions are essentially instantaneous compared with the time scale of nuclear motions, therefore if the molecule is {{to move to a}} new vibrational level during the electronic transition, this new vibrational level must be instantaneously compatible with the nuclear positions and momenta of the vibrational level of the molecule in the originating electronic state. In the semiclassical picture of vibrations (oscillations) of a simple harmonic oscillator, the necessary conditions can occur at the turning points, where the momentum is zero.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} picture, the vibrational levels and vibrational wavefunctions {{are those of}} quantum harmonic oscillators, or of more complex approximations to the potential energy of molecules, such as the Morse potential. Figure 1 illustrates the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> for vibronic transitions in a molecule with Morse-like potential energy functions in both the ground and excited electronic states. In the low temperature approximation, the molecule starts out in the v = 0 vibrational level of the ground electronic state and upon absorbing a photon of the necessary energy, makes a transition to the excited electronic state. The electron configuration of the new state {{may result in a}} shift of the equilibrium position of the nuclei constituting the molecule. In the figure this shift in nuclear coordinates between the ground and the first excited state is labeled as q 01. In the simplest case of a diatomic molecule the nuclear coordinates axis refers to the internuclear separation. The vibronic transition is indicated by a vertical arrow due to the assumption of constant nuclear coordinates during the transition. The probability that the molecule can end up in any particular vibrational level is proportional to the square of the (vertical) overlap of the vibrational wavefunctions of the original and final state (see Quantum mechanical formulation section below). In the electronic excited state molecules quickly relax to the lowest vibrational level of the lowest electronic excitation state (Kasha's rule), and from there can decay to the [...] electronic ground state via photon emission. The <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle</b> is applied equally to absorption and to fluorescence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transition}} between {{the ground and}} the excited state is based on the <b>Franck–Condon</b> <b>principle,</b> that the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion in the lattice. The energy transitions can then be symbolized by vertical arrows between the ground and excited state, that is, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates during the transition. Figure 2 is an energy diagram for interpreting absorption and emission with and without phonons in terms of the configurational coordinate qi. The energy transitions originate at the lowest phonon energy level of the electronic states. As represented in the figure, the largest wavefunction overlap (and therefore largest transition probability) occurs when the photon energy is equal to the energy difference between the two electronic states (E1 – E0) plus three quanta of lattice mode i vibrational energy (...) [...] This three-phonon transition is mirrored in emission when the excited state quickly decays to its zero-point lattice vibration level by means of a radiationless process, and from there to the ground state via photon emission. The zero-phonon transition is depicted as having a lower wavefunction overlap and therefore a lower transition probability.|$|E
