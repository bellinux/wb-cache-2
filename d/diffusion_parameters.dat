50|$|A Benchtop nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectrometer (Benchtop NMR spectrometer) refers to a Fourier transform nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (FT-NMR) spectrometer that is significantly more compact and portable than the conventional equivalents, such that it is portable and can reside on a laboratory benchtop. This convenience comes from using permanent magnets, which have a lower magnetic field and decreased sensitivity compared to the much larger and more expensive cryogen cooled superconducting NMR magnets. Instead of requiring dedicated infrastructure, rooms and extensive installations these benchtop instruments can be placed directly on the bench in a lab and moved as necessary (e.g., to the fumehood). These spectrometers offer improved workflow, even for novice users, as they are simpler and easy to use. They differ from relaxometers in {{that they can be}} used to measure high resolution NMR spectra and are not limited to the determination of relaxation or <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> (e.g., T1, T2 and D).|$|E

The aim is to perform the experimental study of the grain-boundary antimony diffusion in the thin films and copper bicrystals; to obtain {{the orientation of the}} latter, to compare the obtained data and to analyse the orientation relation. The basic results are as follows - temperature relation of volumetric and grain-boundary <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> in Cu-Sb films, temperature and orientation relation of Sb <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> in Cu bicrystals, analysis results of orientation relation of Sb grain-boundary <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> in Cu bicrystals and comparison results of volumertic and grain-boundary parameters in thin-film system Cu-Sb with massive samples.

The study also showed that the changes in <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> from the mid- to post-RT scan may be more significant than those from pre- to mid-RT and pre- to post-RT.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Aim {{of present}} study was to {{evaluate}} changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters in the whole brain of 28 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) compared to 26 healthy controls. METHODS: In both fibertracking and voxel-based analysis, quantitative comparisons of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> between ALS patients and controls were performed. Correlation analyses of <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> and disease duration and disease severity were performed. A second DTI examination was acquired, allowing the evaluation of the effect of disease progression on the <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters.</b> RESULTS: Fibertracking analysis revealed that especially the precentral part of the corticospinal tract (CST) was impaired. In the voxel-based analysis, it was shown that changes of <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> occurred throughout the brain, including frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Disease severity was inversely correlated with the fractional anisotropy (FA). In the follow-up examination, a further decline of FA over time could be demonstrated in the CST {{as well as in the}} whole brain white matter.

Mice genetically deficient in leptin (B 6. V-Lep/J) or NPY (129 S-Npy/J) and the corresponding wild-type controls, were subjected to sequential isocaloric feeding, fasting and recovery regimes. Non-invasive fDWI measurements were performed under these conditions, and complemented with parallel determinations {{of food and water}} consumption, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), locomotor activity and endocrine profiles. Control mice showed significant increases in hypothalamic water <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> upon fasting, returning to normal values in the recovery period. Leptin deficient mice depicted permanently increased water <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> under all feeding conditions as compared to wild type controls, without important changes upon fasting or recovery. These results paralleled sustained increases in food and water intake, significantly augmented body weight, and decreased RER values or locomotor activity, thus configuring an obese phenotype. NPY-deficient mice showed significantly reduced increases (or even slight decreases) in the water <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> upon fasting as compared to wild type controls, paralleled by decreased food and water intake during the recovery period. In conclusion, leptin deficiency results in sustained orexigenic stimulation, leading to increased water <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters,</b> while NPY deficiency lead to reduced orexigenic stimulation and water <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters.</b> Diffusion changes are proposed to reflect net astrocytic volume changes induced by the balance between the orexigenic and anorexigenic firings of AgRP/NPY and POMC/CART neurons, respectively. Together, our results suggest that fDWI provides an adequate tool to investigate hypothalamic appetite disorders.

40|$|Traditionally, systems {{governed by}} linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are {{spatially}} discretized to exploit their algebraic structure {{and reduce the}} computational effort for controlling them. Due to beneficial insights of the PDEs, recently, the reverse {{of this approach is}} implemented where a spatially-discrete system is approximated by a spatially-continuous one, governed by linear PDEs forming diffusion equations. In the case of distributed consensus algorithms, this approach is adapted to enhance its convergence rate to the equilibrium. In previous studies within this context, constant <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameter</b> is considered for obtaining the diffusion equations. This is equivalent to assigning a constant weight to all edges of the underlying graph in the consensus algorithm. Here, by relaxing this restricting assumption, a spatially-variable <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameter</b> is considered and by optimizing the obtained system, it is shown that significant improvements are achievable in terms of the convergence rate of the obtained spatially-continuous system. As a result of approximation, the system is divided into two sections, namely, the spatially-continuous path branches and the lattice core which connects these branches at one end. The optimized weights and <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameter</b> for each of these sections are optimal individually but considering the whole system, they are suboptimal. It is shown that the symmetric star topology is an exception and the obtained results for this topology are globally optimal. Furthermore, through variational method, the results obtained for the symmetric star topology are validated and it is shown that the variable <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameter</b> improves the robustness of the system too.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new method for the {{uncertainty}} estimation of <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> for quantitative body DW-MRI assessment. Dif-fusion parameters uncertainty estimation from DW-MRI {{is necessary for}} clinical applications that use these parameters to assess pathology. However, uncertainty estimation using traditional techniques requires re-peated acquisitions, which is undesirable in routine clinical use. Model-based bootstrap techniques, for example, assume an underlying linear model for residuals rescaling and cannot be utilized directly for body <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> uncertainty estimation due to the non-linearity of the body diffusion model. To offset this limitation, our method uses the Unscented transform to compute the residuals rescaling parameters from the non-linear body diffusion model, and then applies the wild-bootstrap method to infer the body <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> uncertainty. Validation through phantom and human subject experiments shows that our method identify the regions with higher uncertainty in body DWI-MRI model parameters correctly with realtive error of ∼ 36 % in the un-certainty values. ...|$|E

In low-permeability media, transport by diffusion is often the most important mass transport process.

A geostatistical approach for integrating heterogeneity of <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> in groundwater flow and transport models is proposed and applied to the Toarcian argillites in France which are studied in the framework of feasibility of storing radioactive waste in deep clayey massifs. Stochastic fields of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>parameters</b> of the Toarcian argillites (France) are generated based on 64 measured values of diffusion coefficient and diffusion accessible porosity and used as input for a 3 D local-scale groundwater flow and transport model. The chloride concentrations computed by these heterogeneous models are compared to the measured chloride concentrations and to concentrations calculated with a model in which the Toarcian argillites are subdivided into several homogeneous zones. The heterogeneous simulations result in a slightly better correspondence between measured and calculated values and have the additional advantage that the measured diffusion coefficient values in the Toarcian are perfectly honored in the model.
