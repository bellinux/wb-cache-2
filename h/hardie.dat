This ends at (7:04), leaving the sound of ambient guitar noise to fade out and end the song.|$|E

5|$|In the Khaki Election of 1900, {{nationalist}} {{concern with}} the Boer War meant that the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy in the next election. Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British Labour Party in 1906, with Keir <b>Hardie</b> as its first chairman. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name Unionist Party in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International {{had both}} sold their shares in ASC. The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums' shares then sold to James <b>Hardie</b> Industries to {{maintain}} an Australian majority ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend {{at the time to}} privatise government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the Collins class worth $3.5billion over 25years was awarded to ASC.|$|E
5000|$|In the General Election of 1918, Nicholas {{was invited}} by the Labour Party {{to stand in}} the Aberdare {{division}} of <b>Hardie's</b> old Merthyr Tydfil seat, against Charles Butt Stanton (1873-1946). Stanton had won one of the two Merthyr Tydfil seats in the by-election caused by <b>Hardie's</b> death: he had supported the Coalition Government and the war; and fought the General Election {{as a member of the}} National Democratic Party (NDP) with the assistance of the Coalition 'coupon'. Nicholas campaigned on <b>Hardie's</b> socialist and pacifist positions. He was badly mistreated. He won 6,229 votes to Stanton's 22,824. However, he was heartened by the fact that the Labour Party greatly increased its vote share nationally (from 7% to 21%) and for the first time it won the most seats in Wales, breaking the long Liberal dominance. Nicholas took heart also from the Russian Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|When the United Kingdom {{entered the}} First World War, Stanton became a strong {{supporter}} of the national war effort, and publicly opposed Keir <b>Hardie's</b> stance opposed to the war.|$|R
5000|$|In 1884, {{the council}} ran four {{candidates}} for Glasgow Town Council, without success. However, another attempt in 1888 {{led to the}} election of H. Tait, followed a year later by James Millar Jack, and in 1890 by A. J. Hunter and John Battersby. [...] This experience led the council to support Keir <b>Hardie's</b> candidature at the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888; it supported but did not affiliate to <b>Hardie's</b> Scottish Labour Party, and {{played a central role}} in establishing the Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party. [...] Both labour parties stood candidates in the city at the 1892 general election.|$|R
5|$|The Scottish Reform Act 1832 {{increased}} the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived. Towards {{the end of the century}} Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone, and the Earl of Rosebery. In the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with <b>Hardie</b> as its first leader.|$|E
5|$|The {{first quarter}} of the 20th century also saw a shift in the {{political}} landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906, only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir <b>Hardie</b> of Merthyr Tydfil, represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain when he was made head of the 1916 coalition government. In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected {{at the head of a}} Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coalminers' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards a new political organisation, established by <b>Hardie</b> and others to ensure an elected representation for the working class, which is now called the Labour Party. When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half of the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians—the start of a Labour hegemony which would dominate Wales into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The militant suffragettes, {{who were}} at one point public enemies, were now seen as fierce {{nationalist}} and patriots. Old foes became allies and vice versa. Lloyd George was now referred to as 'that great Welshman' while Labours' Kier <b>Hardie,</b> the WSPU's staunchest defender before the war, was lambasted for his pacifist stance. There were still those in the suffragette movement who wished to keep pushing the agenda of emancipation. Some members of the WSPU broke away to form the Suffragettes of the WSPU (SWSPU), amongst their members were Conway-born Helena Jones, who continued to campaign for women's votes and was a columnist in the Suffragists News Sheet.|$|E
5000|$|... 1Based on <b>Hardie's</b> {{earliest}} estimated birth year of [...] "ca.1860", {{although some}} biographers cite a date {{as late as}} 27 January 1871, making him only 60 years old at time of that election.|$|R
50|$|A {{few weeks}} after Stanton's election, on 6 January 1916, the {{government}} introduced its first conscription bill. Stanton's by-election victory in Keir <b>Hardie's</b> old seat {{has been seen as}} facilitating the introduction of conscription.|$|R

5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was introduced {{at the age}} of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than her, known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir <b>Hardie</b> but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{politics}} in the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century was dominated by the Whigs and (after 1859) their successors the Liberal Party. From the Scottish Reform Act 1832 (which {{increased the number of}} Scottish MPs and significantly widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes), {{until the end of the}} century they managed to gain a majority of the Westminster Parliamentary seats for Scotland, although these were often outnumbered by the much larger number of English and Welsh Conservatives. English-educated Scottish peer Lord Aberdeen (1784–1860) led a coalition government from 1852 to 1855, but in general very few Scots held office in the government. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and when the Conservative Lord Salisbury became prime minister in 1885 he responded to pressure for more attention to be paid to Scottish issues by reviving the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, which had been in abeyance since 1746. He appointed the Duke of Richmond, a wealthy landowner who was both Chancellor of Aberdeen University and Lord Lieutenant of Banff. Towards the end of the century the first Scottish Liberal to become prime minister was the Earl of Rosebery (1847–1929), like Aberdeen before him a product of the English education system. In the later 19th century the issue of Irish Home Rule led to a split among the Liberals, with a minority breaking away to form the Liberal Unionists in 1886. The growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with <b>Hardie</b> as its first leader.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hardie's</b> death, on 2 September 1915, a {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, caused a vacancy in one of the two Merthyr Tydfil parliamentary seats. The by-election to fill the vacancy was called for 25 November 1915.|$|R
