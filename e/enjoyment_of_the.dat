She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.|$|E

5|$|Buildings {{from most}} of the {{architectural}} periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> media {{coverage}} of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E

5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiplayer action.|$|E

5|$|The {{group that}} would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 {{as the result of}} a {{practical}} joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, annoyed at The New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey's clients (Eugene O'Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott's <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive. The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff noted his <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storyline, but he mostly enjoyed the episode's {{inclusion}} and voice work of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. He also commented favorably on the gags that describe Russia as filled with bears on unicycles and that Adam West {{turns out to be}} the Russian sleeper agent. He criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets. He graded the episode a B, tying with The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show. IGN Television critic Ahsan Haque gave the episode a mixed review, stating that he did not like the improv storyline, and he was not amused with Peter's usage of Joe's American flag as toilet paper. However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel to Russia, and he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well with management of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were {{the primary focus of}} the game, still liked the wide variety of role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Edwards {{published}} a significant treatise entitled Bibliographic Catalogue of the Described Transformation of North American Lepidoptera. In {{response to an}} invitation and after arranging a business contract, he traveled back to Australia to accept a position as stage manager of a theatrical company in Melbourne. Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York the next year {{with the intention of}} returning to acting, but poor health kept him from full <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limelight. In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost at Augustin Daly's Daly Theatre, but was often short of breath and unable {{to keep pace with the}} run—his part was given to a young Tyrone Power who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of The School for Scandal.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the match, Larwood was unfit and Allen played. England batted first, and Allen scored three runs before being {{dismissed}} on the first afternoon. On the second morning, an article in the Daily Express by Trevor Wignall, a popular journalist who wrote sensational sports stories, suggested that the crowd's <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day was marred by Allen's inclusion on the grounds of his Australian birth. Wignall claimed that the public felt Allen should have been omitted, and that the selectors were rumoured to be ignorant of his birthplace. That day, Allen opened the bowling for England; after a slow start, the Australian openers added 162 runs before the first wicket fell. Like the other bowlers, Allen then rapidly conceded runs to Donald Bradman, who scored 254 runs. Australia scored 729 for six declared in reply to England's 425, and Allen returned bowling figures of none for 115 from 34 overs. England lost early wickets in their second innings, and when Allen came in to bat, the score was 147 for five wickets, still 167 behind the Australians. He scored 57 and shared a partnership of 125 with his captain, Percy Chapman, to take England into the lead but Australia won the match by seven wickets. In contrast to the reaction to his bowling, Allen's innings was praised in the press. This was his only Test of the series.|$|E

50|$|IGN {{called the}} concept unique and hilarious, but overall felt that many aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game were sloppy, {{inconsistent}} and unfinished in execution. They gave it 3/10.

40|$|Attitude {{has long}} been a central concept in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> {{learning}} and academic performance. This study was designed to investigate <b>the</b> attitudes <b>of</b> undergraduates at different levels, taking different degree courses, toward value of theories, value <b>of</b> applications, <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories and <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> applications <b>of</b> mathematics. <b>The</b> setting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study has been Massey University at Palmerston North, New Zealand. The subjects were 203 Students enrolled in " 60. 101 Algebra and Calculus", " 60. 203 Calculus" and " 60. 303 Calculus and Differential Equations". The problem was threefold: (1) <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> an instrument to assess attitudes toward value of theories, value <b>of</b> applications, <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories and <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> applications of mathematics. (2) To use the inventory to treasure differences in attitudes of (i) male and female students; (ii) mathematics majors and non-mathematics majors; (iii) mathematics majors at different stages. (3) To find <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> association between <b>the</b> different attitude measures. A 32 -item attitude instrument of Likert-type was specially developed and administered to the sample population. They were tested in <b>the</b> Autumn <b>of</b> 1980 with <b>the</b> instrument. A pilot study was carried out to assess <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> all measures before the actual study. <b>The</b> principal function <b>of</b> this pilot study was to assess <b>the</b> adequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measuring instrument and the administration procedures. Using a 0. 05 level <b>of</b> significance <b>the</b> results showed a difference between first year male and female students in their attitudes toward <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories. No other significant sex-related difference or mathematics majors/non- mathematics major difference was found. Furthermore, first year mathematics majors and sccond year mathematics majors differ significantly in their attitudes toward <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories. <b>The</b> attitude towards value of theories was positively and significantly correlated with attitude towards <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories and <b>the</b> attitude towards value of applications was positively and significantly correlated with attitude towards enjoyment ol applications. The attitude towards value of theories was not significantly correlated with attitude towards value <b>of</b> applications and <b>the</b> attitude towards <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories was not significantly correlated with attitude towards <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> applications...|$|R
