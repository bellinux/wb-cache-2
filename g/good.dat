5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as <b>good,</b> 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving <b>good</b> scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated <b>good,</b> while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as <b>good</b> ecological status, 40 percent <b>good</b> for chemical status and 31 percent <b>good</b> for biological status.|$|E

5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first <b>good</b> entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second.

The sacrifice in the production of the second <b>good</b> is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first <b>good</b> entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second <b>good</b> forgone for one or more units of the first <b>good.</b>|$|E

5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty.

The <b>good</b> will is unique in that it is always <b>good</b> and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions.
