We searched for such planets in NN Ser ab, an eclipsing short-period binary that shows long-term eclipse time variations. Using published, reanalysed, and new mid-eclipse times of NN Ser ab obtained between 1988 and 2010, we find excellent {{agreement with the}} light-travel-time effect by two additional bodies superposed on the linear ephemeris of the binary. Our multi-parameter fits accompanied by N-body simulations yield a best fit for the objects NN Ser (ab) c and <b>d</b> <b>locked</b> in a 2 : 1 mean motion resonance, with orbital periods P_c= 15. 5 yrs and P_d= 7. 7 yrs, masses M_c sin i_c = 6. 9 M_Jup and M_d sin i_d = 2. 2 M_Jup, and eccentricities e_c= 0 and e_d= 0. 20. A secondary chi** 2 minimum corresponds to an alternative solution with a period ratio of 5 : 2. We estimate that the progenitor binary consisted of an A star with ~ 2 M_Sun and the present M dwarf secondary at an orbital separation of ~ 1. 5 AU. The survival of two planets through the common-envelope phase that created the present white dwarf requires fine tuning between the gravitational force and the drag force experienced by them in the expanding envelope. The alternative is a second-generation origin in a circumbinary disk created {{at the end of}} this phase. In that case, the planets would be extremely young with ages not exceeding the cooling age of the white dwarf of 10 ** 6 yrs. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; A&A Letters (in press...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation into the effect of a wall normal vibration on a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate (690 mm * 200 mm * 12 mm). Tests were conducted in a subsonic wind tunnel at 17 m/s. An electromagnetic shaker, in conjunction with a vibration control system was used to supply and maintain a controlled sinusoidal plate oscillation. Phase averaged velocity profiles indicate that there is a negligible effect, due to vibration, on the mean boundary layer properties. Phase dependency plots show that Delta* and Theta exhibit a weak phase shift in relation to the plate vibration, whereas <b>d</b> is phase <b>locked.</b> Probability density distributions indicate a slight positive shift in velocity distribution for the 80 Hz test case. Analysis in the frequency domain shows that the overall disturbance effect is limited to a very narrow bandwidth centered on the plate vibration frequency...|$|R

The smallest warm-blooded avian crea-tures, they hover like a helicopter, consume energy like a jet plane, and glitter {{in the sunlight}} like a precious jewel. It is fitting that this most magnificent evolution-ary miracle should be a pollinator for the equally mag-nificent evolutionary miracle that is the orchid. <b>ing</b> flowers <b>locked</b> together in a mutually beneficial dance. Hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are the predominant avian orchid pollinator. Birds are late-comers to the pollination game and only pollinate three percent of orchids. Nonetheless, with an estimated 35, 000 orchid species, there are probably {{hundreds and hundreds of}} orchids that rely on hummingbirds for pollination. Most orchids that are hummingbird- pollinated are from high- elevation ecosystems in the tropical New World where insects are rare or unable to operate because of the cold. They are particularly common in the Andean regions where hummingbirds reach their greatest diversity. Hummingbirds are found only in the Americas with at least 330 species from Alaska to the tip of South America. The greatest numbers are found in the tropics with fewer than 20 species normally found in the United States and Canada. Hummingbirds seem particularly attracted to many species of the genera Elleanthus, Cochliod a, and Comparettia. Some species of Masd evallia, Epidendrum, Encyclia, Cattleya, Sobralia, and Laelia have also adapted to hummingbirds. In addition, the highly-specialized little birds are attracted to certain species of Ad a, Scaphyglo ttis (syn. Hexisea), Sce lo chilus, Cattleya (syn. Sophronitis), and Stenorrhynchos as well as an assortment of other gen-era...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{high order}} systems are reformulated as first order systems {{which are then}} numerically solved by a {{collocation}} method. The collocation method is based on Cartesian discretisation with 1 D-integrated {{radial basis function networks}} (1 D-IRBFN) {MaiDuy_TranCong: 2007 }. The present method is enhanced by a new boundary interpolation technique based on 1 D-IRBFN which is introduced to obtain variable approximation at irregular points in irregular domains. The proposed method is well suited to problems with mixed boundary conditions on both regular and irregular domains. The main results obtained are (a) the boundary conditions for the reformulated problem are of Dirichlet type only; (b) the integrated RBFN approximation avoids the well known reduction of convergence rate associated with differential formulations; (c) the primary variable (e. g. displacement, temperature) and the dual variable (e. g. stress, temperature gradient) have similar convergence order; (<b>d)</b> the volumetric <b>locking</b> effects associated with incompressible materials in solid mechanics are alleviated.

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} are {{an essential}} agent of sediment transport from shallow to deeper waters. Detailed {{measurements of the}} velocity field or particle concentration are only available by means of accurate numerical simulations. In this thesis, a DNS solver for turbidity currents is presented based on the MEEVC scheme, a mass, energy, enstrophy and vorticity conserving solver for the 2 D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with periodic boundary conditions. The construction of the solver consists of two separate steps: the prescription of slip boundary conditions and {{the implementation of a}} transport equation for the particle phase. Tangential velocity boundary conditions cannot be imposed strongly because the velocity is sought in the function space H(div). To this end, three methods are proposed for the weak enforcement of the tangential velocity component by means of vorticity boundary conditions. Of these methods, kinematic Neumann boundary conditions prove to be the most effective and are used {{for the construction of a}} turbidity current solver. An equilibrium Eulerian approach for the particle phase is implemented and the resulting solver is proved to satisfy the discrete energy balance equations up to a residual. This residual does not accumulate over time and no artificial dissipation of energy is introduced into the system. The 2 <b>D</b> <b>lock</b> exchange test case is computed and comparisons are made with reference results. The numerical results indicate that the solver is capable of capturing the essential dynamics of the flow in coarse grids. Aerospace EngineeringAerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsio...|$|E
