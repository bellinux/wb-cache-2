40|$|Problem statement: Due to the climatic {{changes and}} the {{ecological}} variations of the biosphere, global natural resources including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biodiversities, genetic resources and energy, radiation, electric charge and magnetism, must be safeguarded {{for the benefit of}} present and future generations through careful planning and management as appropriate. Approach: The main points of the International Council of <b>Environmental</b> Engineering <b>Education</b> (ICEEE) are to enhance services to its members, work with educational and research institutions to improve <b>environmental</b> engineering <b>education</b> and technology and promote the undergraduate university degree (B. Sc.), graduate higher degree (M. Sc.) and Ph. D. development, facilitate productive cooperation among industry, academy and government, enhance the participation and success of under-represented groups in the <b>environmental</b> engineering <b>education</b> enterprise, promote the value of the engineering profession, unify the <b>environmental</b> engineering <b>education</b> programs throughout the World Countries and exchange the <b>environmental</b> engineering <b>education</b> professionalism among international institutions. Results: Based on the above mentioned concepts, the Obuda University, Rejto Sandor Faculty of Light Industry and Environmental Protection Engineering (Budapest, Hungary), the Technical University of Kosice, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (Kosice, Slovakia), Uzhhorod National University, Faculty of Chemistry at the (Uzhhorod, Ukraine), Polytechnic Engineering College of Subotica and the UNESCO Chair in Water Resources-Sudan (UNESCO-CWR) agreed to establish an international organization dealing with <b>environmental</b> engineering <b>education</b> management. Conclusion: The dynamic development of our professional reforms and combined with effective use of scientific potentials agreed to improve the standards of <b>environmental</b> engineering <b>education.</b> Our institutions are agreed to fund and serve as the premier multidisciplinary council for individuals and organizations committed to promote all aspects of environmental engineering and engineering technology education. This study about ICEEE defines several of the basic components of the environmental engineering and engineering technology professions and the educational processes needed to produce qualified environmental engineers for the future...|$|R

5|$|As {{numerous}} collectors {{had visited}} Negros prior to 1953 {{and did not}} record the species, {{it is likely that}} it was already very rare by the time of its discovery. It is suspected that the Negros fruit dove was originally a lowland species, but the destruction of forests in northern Negros forced the dove from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction. Today, no forest exists in northern Negros at an elevation lower than , and several searches in the 1990s of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding area failed to discover any sign of the species' continued existence. Ornithological fieldwork has discovered that the nearby island of Panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to Negros, including the Negros bleeding-heart. This discovery and the presence of unexplored lowland forests on Panay give hope that the Negros fruit dove may still exist in low numbers on a nearby island. Other than the depiction of the bird on a Philippine <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> poster in the 1990s, no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population.|$|E
5|$|Five miles (8km) past West Shokan, NY28A intersects Monument Road, {{which used}} to connect to the reservoir's {{spillway}} and the road above the reservoir, which is closed to automobile traffic. The junction has {{been converted into a}} small parking area. A quarter-mile (0.4km) further on is the western terminus of NY213, the only other state route that NY28A intersects aside from its parent. Although NY213 is an east–west route, it actually heads due south from this junction to the nearby hamlet of Olivebridge on its way to Stone Ridge and High Falls. Continuing east, NY28A descends to cross Esopus Creek again before climbing back up to the city's watershed visitor center. Across from the center is Beaverkill Road, a local highway leading southeastward to SUNY New Paltz's outdoor <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> center and Ashokan Bridge, a covered bridge over Esopus Creek, located on Ashokan Road.|$|E

5|$|The many awards Caldwell {{received}} {{included the}} William E. Mosher Award (1964) and the Marshall E. Dimock Award of the American Society for Public Administration (1981); the John M. Gaus Award from the American Political Science Association; and the National Environmental Quality Award from the Natural Resources Council of America (1997). In 1991, {{he was named}} one of the United Nations Environmental Program's (UNEP) Global 500 for distinguished environmental services, and in 1997, he was awarded an honorary LLD from Western Michigan University. In 2001 he was the recipient of Indiana University's Distinguished Service Award. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an honorary member of the International Association for Impact Assessment. Annually since 1995 the American Political Science Association has awarded the Lynton Keith Caldwell Prize for the best book in environmental politics and policy published during the previous three years. Shortly after his death in 2006, the Caldwell Center for Culture and Ecology was established in Bloomington, IN to provide <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> for youth and adults.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Caldwell {{served on}} the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and had shorter {{appointments}} at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas. At various times, Caldwell served as advisor or consultant to the U.S. Senate, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and Interior, and the National Institutes of Health. Although not a natural scientist, {{as part of his}} work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities and achieving a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea Grant Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President’s National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program for the <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> and training of engineers.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|E
