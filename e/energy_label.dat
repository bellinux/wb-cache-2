Based on information from a total of 117 samples, this paper finds mean correlations between consumers’ awareness, knowledge, attitude, social norm and <b>energy</b> efficiency <b>labels</b> with purchase intention. <b>Energy</b> <b>labelling</b> shows a negative correlation with green purchasing behaviour. This finding demonstrates that <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> was fruitless to deliver a good message in encouraging consumer buying decision. <b>Energy</b> <b>labels</b> have to be understood, trusted and valued as a tool for consumers’ decision making. It is believed that the use of <b>energy</b> <b>labels</b> alone is not considered enough to protect the environment.

40|$|A {{proposal}} for <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> of refrigerated display cabinets was {{submitted to the}} European Commission in November 1995. However, as the priorities in European <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> schemes are focused on electric appliances for the consumer market, a directive for compulsory <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> of refrigerated cabinets has not been prepared. Stil!, an <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> scheme for refrigerated display cases is being used throughout Europe. The driving force is a subsidy on energy efficient display cases provided by Dutch energy distribution companies - together with an tax deduction possibility for investments in energy efficient refrigerated display cases in The Netherlands. "Energy efficient display cases" are defined as display cases with an "A" or "B" energy efficiency class (energy consumption of more than 45 % below market average for class A or between 25 % and 45 % below market average for class B). The determination of energy efficiency {{is based on the}} original <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> proposal, which has been revised as of January 1998 on the basis of amendments made by the European committee of air handling, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment manufacturers. Physical <b>energy</b> <b>labels</b> - in the foren of adhesives attached to the products - are absent in the <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> scheme in use. Instead a list is prepared monthly on which those display cases are listed that fulfil - according to data received from manufacturers or importers - the energy efficiency criteria.

40|$|To promote energy {{efficiency}} for residential buildings in Hong Kong, a {{research has been}} conducted to investigate the characteristics of energy consumption in the residential buildings and develop a suitable <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> system for assessing the building energy performance. The aims of the research are to review worldwide experience, study the feasibility of establishing building <b>energy</b> <b>labels</b> in Hong Kong, and evaluate the key factors for design and implementation of the building <b>energy</b> <b>labels.</b> The experience in Europe, North America, Australia, Singapore and China has been studied. It is found that appliance <b>energy</b> <b>labels</b> are widely used in many countries; they are effective policy instruments to help increase awareness and overcome the market barriers. Some countries have extended them and developed <b>energy</b> <b>labels</b> for buildings. In Europe, with the launch of the European Union (EU) Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings, <b>energy</b> certificates and <b>labels</b> are being set up to grade buildings in terms of energy performance. Similar approach is being taken by USA, mainland China and other countries. The characteristics of energy consumption of typical residential buildings in Hong Kong have been analyzed. An energy equation for assessing energy consumption of high-rise residential buildings has been established by building energy simulation method and practical design assessment. The final form of the energy equation includes six major factors, namely, HVAC coefficient of performance, window shading, lighting power density, hot water intensity, other appliance intensity and refrigerator energy. postprin...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of energy saving by {{the implementation of}} a voluntary appliance <b>energy</b> <b>labeling</b> program in Sri Lanka was studied by analyzing the appliance market and the system load profiles. End use load profiles for 2006 were derived from the Load Research findings and energy statistics published by Ceylon Electricity Board and Energy Conservation Fund. Air-conditioners, Lighting, Motors, Refrigerators and Fans were identified as potential end uses for <b>energy</b> <b>labeling.</b> The market distribution of efficiencies and prices were gathered for the identified end uses and the existing market picture was modeled. Average efficiency level of appliances in the present market was calculated. Market transformation anticipated by implementation of a voluntary <b>Energy</b> <b>Labelling</b> Program was established under a hypothesis consists of a set of assumptions bases on incremental cost associated with the decision of purchasing a more efficient appliance, pay back period of the additional investment, market penetration of labels, consumer preference on making use of energy efficiency and other related factors. Anticipated market pattern after the implementation of <b>Energy</b> <b>Labelling</b> was modeled based on the market transformation and the average efficiency level of appliances in the transformed market was estimated. Overall improvement of the average efficiency for each identified appliance was estimated and the energy and demand saving due to that was calculated. It was found that implementation of an voluntary <b>energy</b> <b>labeling</b> program for above identified appliance would result in an annual energy saving of 217. 8 GWh and system peak demand reduction of 47. 6 MW. Over 9 million US$ and can be saved annually by the energy saving while assuring 60 million US$ avoided capital investment due to the peak demand chipping by 47. 6 MW...|$|R
50|$|The term {{energy input}} {{labeling}} involved producers {{of goods and}} services determining how much energy is used to produce their product, and then including that information on their product packaging. Energy input labeling is sometimes known by the acronym EIL. Energy input labeling provides the advantage of knowing how much energy was used to produce a product, but it does not indicate how much energy a product uses to operate, such as the European Union <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> or the Energy rating label used in Australia and New Zealand, and is not in itself a standard for energy efficiency such as Energy Saving Trust Recommended or Energy Star.|$|E
50|$|A new <b>energy</b> <b>label,</b> {{introduced}} in 2010, {{is based on}} the energy efficiency index (EEI), and has energy classes in the range A+++ to D.

For the washing cycles, a weighted mix consisting of 42% full-load cycles at 60 °C, 29% partial-load cycles at 60 °C, and 29% partial-load cycles at 40 °C. The washing performance is not mentioned any more, since all washing machines must reach class A anyway. For a 6-kg machine, an EEI of 100 is equivalent to 334 kWh per year, or 1.52 kWh per cycle.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> {{at point}} of {{purchase}} is gaining traction worldwide, yet the potential impact for different socioeconomic groups is unclear. We aimed to summarise evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> by socioeconomic position (SEP). METHODS: A systematic search for papers published to September 2015 was conducted using terms for labelling, food outlets, and SEP. Quality of studies was assessed. Results were summarised across stages of an intervention logic pathway. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were identified. Of twelve studies reporting the effect of menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> in low SEP populations, six reported on purchase outcomes. All but one of these reported no positive effect of the policy for this population. Two of the five studies that compared purchase outcomes of menu labelling across SEP groups reported that the policy was effective overall. These two studies reported either a significant decline in fast food calories purchased from consumers in high (but not low) SEP neighbourhoods or a significantly greater decline in calories purchased among consumers visiting stores in higher SEP neighbourhoods post policy implementation. Few studies were rated as moderate to high quality. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence describing the impact of menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> within or across SEP is limited in quantity and quality. Of the two studies that reported a positive benefit of menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> overall, both identified a greater effect on fast food purchases among consumers visiting stores in high compared to low SEP neighbourhoods. It is difficult to know whether the absence of effectiveness reported in low SEP populations represents a true lack of effectiveness or is a result of a more general lack of policy effectiveness or the limited quality of the reviewed studies...|$|R
