25|$|In April 1993, Yanni {{released}} his eighth studio album, <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Time,</b> on the Private Music label. He supported the album with a concert tour that visited 40 cities worldwide which included three sell out performances at the Herodes Atticus Theatre by the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, his first {{to take place}} in his native country. After he moved to the United States in 1972, returning to Greece to perform at the Acropolis became one of his career goals. The event took over {{a year and a half}} to organise, and recalled his experience of meeting with the local archaeological committee, the mayor, and ministers of culture and tourism as his effort to gain their trust and permission to perform, promising not to cause any damage. For the occasion, Yanni wanted to record and film the concerts for a live album and home video. Without sufficient financial backing, Yanni risked $2 million of his own money on its production in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music. Despite being advised by his management and Private Music personnel not to proceed with the concert due to the high costs, Yanni proceeded regardless and by the end of it, was left with an estimated $50,000 to his name.|$|E

500|$|Sullivan {{loved to}} spend time in France (both in Paris and the south of France), where his acquaintances {{included}} European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling. He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors. In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley, and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis although, according to George Grossmith, [...] "I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>time,</b> but I never saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan".|$|E

He asserted that, [...] "The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts." [...] He called the convictions [...] "a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice". The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission, and the Mann-Chestnut hearings.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Test arena, Willis played 64 One Day International matches for his country, taking 80 wickets, and was a prolific List-A (one day) cricketer with 421 wickets overall at 20.18. With the bat, Willis made little impression as a tail-ender with a best Test score of 28 not-out (*); however, he managed two half-centuries at first-class level {{and for a time}} held a record number of Test not-outs. Willis captained the England team in 18 Tests and 28 ODI matches between June 1982 and March 1984. Under Willis' captaincy England won seven, lost five and drew six Tests, and won 16 of the ODIs. Botham recalled Willis as [...] "a tremendous trier.. a great team-man and an inspiration", as well as the [...] "only world-class fast bowler <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> as an England player." [...] The editor of Wisden wrote of him in similar terms: [...] "His indomitable service to England is handsomely reflected in his great collection of Test wickets. Although often beset with aches and pains, he never spared himself when bowling for his country." ...|$|E

500|$|Luton's cup win was the club's {{first major}} piece of {{silverware}} in its history. A jubilant Harford {{described it as}} [...] "the greatest win <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> at Luton," [...] having thought his team had lost the match when Smith scored. He commended his goalkeeper, saying: [...] "Considering all the circumstances, I think Dibble {{had to be the}} man of the match, and as for the young boy, [...] Black was sensational. He has so much talent." [...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee how long was left and he just blew the whistle." [...] Luton held a civic ceremony two days after the final, where the trophy was presented in front of the club's supporters. It was there the stem of the trophy had become noticeably damaged; Luton the following morning returned it to the competition's sponsors for repairs.|$|E
500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> , the way we have been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E
