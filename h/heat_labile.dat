25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms. Some staphylococcal species have, however, {{been shown to be}} flexible enough to pass through 0.22 µm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the posttranscriptional regulation of hsp 70 gene expression in two human cell lines, HeLa and 293 cells, which constitutively express high levels of HSP 70. HSP 70 mRNA translates with high efficiency in both control and heat-shocked cells. Therefore, heat shock is not required for the efficient translation of HSP 70 mRNA. Rather, {{the main effect of}} heat shock on translation is to suppress the translatability of non-heat shock mRNAs. Heat shock, however, has a marked effect on the stability of HSP 70 mRNA; in non-heat-shocked cells the half-life of HSP 70 mRNA is approximately 50 min, and its stability increases at least 10 -fold upon heat shock. Moreover, HSP 70 mRNA is more stable in cells treated with protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that a <b>heat</b> shock-sensitive <b>labile</b> protein regulates its turnover. An additional effect on posttranscriptional regulation of hsp 70 expression can be found in adenovirus-infected cells, in which HSP 70 mRNA levels decline precipititously late during infection although hsp 70 transcription continues unabated...|$|R

However, {{the relative importance}} of the different enterotoxins in host immune responses against ETEC infection has been poorly defined. In the present study, several isogenic mutant strains of an O 149 :F 4 ac(+), LT+ STa+ STb+ ETEC strain were constructed that lack the expression of LT in combination with one or both types of ST enterotoxins (STa and/or STb). The small intestinal segment perfusion (SISP) technique and microarray analysis were used to study host early immune responses induced by these mutant strains 4 h after infection in comparison to the wild type strain and a PBS control. Simultaneously, net fluid absorption of pig small intestinal mucosa was measured 4 h after infection, allowing us to correlate enterotoxin secretion with gene regulation. Microarray analysis showed on the one hand a non-toxin related general antibacterial response comprising genes such as PAP, MMP 1 and IL 8. On the other hand, results suggest a dominant role for STb in small intestinal secretion early after post-weaning infection, {{as well as in the}} induced innate immune response through differential regulation of immune mediators like interleukin 1 and interleukin 17...|$|R

The plasma membrane-embedded cyclic nucleotide-gated Ca(2 +) channels (CNGCs) can translate mild variations of membrane fluidity into an effective heat shock response, leading to the accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSP) that prevent <b>heat</b> damages in <b>labile</b> proteins and membranes. Here, we deleted by targeted mutagenesis the CNGCd gene in two Physcomitrella patens transgenic moss lines containing either the heat-inducible HSP-GUS reporter cassette or the constitutive UBI-Aequorin cassette. The stable CNGCd knockout mutation caused a hyper-thermosensitive moss phenotype, in which the heat-induced entry of apoplastic Ca(2 +) and the cytosolic accumulation of GUS were triggered at lower temperatures than in wild type. The combined effects of an artificial membrane fluidizer and elevated temperatures suggested that the gene products of CNGCd and CNGCb are paralogous subunits of Ca(2 +) channels acting as a sensitive proteolipid thermocouple. Depending on the rate of temperature increase, the duration and intensity of the heat priming preconditions, terrestrial plants may thus acquire an array of HSP-based thermotolerance mechanisms against upcoming, otherwise lethal, extreme heat waves...|$|R

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 87 - 94. ix, 94 l illusA {{central nervous}} system {{stimulant}} has been isolated from the sea anemone, Stoichactis kenti. A chromatographically homogeneous fraction has been obtained from the crude extract by dialysis and gel filtration on Sephadex G- 50. Attempts were made to purify the active fraction further by ion exchange column chromatography, but the specific activity of the active fraction was not increased. The active substance {{was found to be}} water soluble, <b>heat</b> and acid <b>labile</b> and stable to alkali. It showed a positive color reaction with ninhydrin on paper (circular) chromatography, using n-butanol: acetic acid:water (4 : 1 : 5) system. Steroids, steroidal glycosides, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates were found to be absent in the active fraction, when tested with specific reagents. The active fraction has a characteristic u. v. maximum at 277. 5 nm. Determination of protein by Lowry's method and estimation of nitrogen by Kjeldahl's method indicated the active fraction was rich in protein. An acid and alkaline hydrolysis of the active fraction was carried out and hydrolysates were analyzed both by two dimensional chromatography and Technicon auto aminoacid analyzer. The following amino acids were identified by comparing with standard aminoacids: cysteine, aspartic acid (asparagine), threonine, serine, glutamic acid (glutamine), proline, glycine, alanine, valine, cystine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine and arginine. From these results it was concluded that the active fraction was a polypeptide containing seventeen different aminoacids. Based on behavior on Sephadex G- 50, the approximate molecular weight of the active fraction was estimated to be in the range of 2, 500 - 3, 000. Signs of {{central nervous system}} stimulatory activity produced by the active fraction in male mice included fighting episodes, increased motor activity and clonic convulsions. The ED 50 of the active fraction based on fighting episodes was 6. 4 mg/kg. The fighting episodes occurred at a frequency of 2 - 3 times/minute. After the administration of the active fraction intraperitoneally, the fighting episodes started within 4 - 6 minutes, peaked at 15 minutes and waned within about 30 minutes. The LD 50 dose of the active fraction was 12. 2 mg/kg. Toxic symptoms such as ataxia, catalepsy and tonic convulsions were observed before death. Phenobarbital sodium, chlorpromazine and methocarbamol completely blocked the fighting response of the active fraction even at the ED 100 dose level but did not change the LD 50. The antagonism of the active fraction induced stimulant activity (as measured by fighting episodes) by these drugs suggests that this activity was probably mediated centrally. Reserpine and tetrabenazine pretreatment markedly increased the stimulant effect of the active fraction by decreasing the ED 50 of the active fraction by 50 %. Such treatment increased toxicity twofold. a-methyl p-tyrosine methylester Hel (α-MPT) pretreatment did not alter the ED 50, while the LD 50 was significantly decreased. When α-MPT treatment was incorporated in reserpine or tetrabenazine treated animals, the stimulatory activity of the active fraction was completely blocked even at the ED 100 (9. 3 mg/kg) dose level. The active fraction produced a significant decrease in brain norepinephrine content at the ED 50 and the ED 100 doses during the stimulation period. Both the active fraction and reserpine produced a hyperthermic response in mice. DL-dopa treatment restored the active fraction induced stimulant action (fighting episodes) which was abolished after combined treatment with a-MPT and reserpine and reserpine and disulfiram. DL-dopa also increased the LD 50 of the active fraction. The active fraction at the ED 50 dose significantly decreased brain dopamine content. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine did not alter the ED 50 and the LD 50 of the active fraction. No change in brain serotonin content was observed after administration of the active fraction at the ED 50 dose. The active fraction at the ED 50 dose significantly inhibited the re-uptake mechanism of norepinephrine during the stimulation period. It also elevated normetanephrine levels at the ED 50 dose. Propranolol but not phentolamine treatment completely blocked the stimulatory action of the active fraction, with no change in the LD 50. Atropine treatment decreased the toxicity, with no change in the ED 50. On the other hand physostigmine blocked the stimulatory action and increased toxicity by twofold. In conclusion, the results suggest that the active fraction causes stimulant action by releasing active norepinephrine from functional pools and inhibiting its re-uptake, thus making more norepinephrine available at adrenergic receptors...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and objective: The {{appearance}} {{of resistance to}} anti-tuberculosis drugs has generated research to find new and more effective drugs. Löwenstein-Jensen medium (LJ) is frequently used for culturing strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A group of antimicrobial substances used in treating tuberculosis is sensitive to heat and cannot be used on LJ medium. Research now aims to setup a modified method for evaluation of <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> drugs in LS medium. Materials and methods: In this study, we investigated culturing M. tuberculosis for 48 h on Middlebrook 7 H 9 broth medium with antituberculosis drugs and re culturing on LJ medium (without antibiotic) and incubating for 40 days. Results: Our results after 48 h of contact of the strains with antibiotic were comparable with the standard method of culture on Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar medium containing antibiotic. Therefore, 48 h is a suitable time for primary contact between mycobacterium and <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> antibiotics. Conclusion: This modified method {{can be applied to}} LJ medium instead of expensive Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar medium for evaluation of <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> anti tuberculosis drugs...|$|E
40|$|The heat stable {{phosphatase}} modulator protein (inhibitor- 2) {{has been}} shown to {{play a crucial role in}} the reversible ATP, Mg-dependent activation of a multisubstrate protein phosphatase. The modulator activity is acid and heat stable and resides in a small asymmetrical protein which, after boiling migrates in sucrose density gradient centrifugation with a molecular weight of 17 K. The present report shows that in unboiled rabbit skeletal muscle preparations all the modulator activity is found associated with a <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> protein component, which imposes an important regulatory feature on the heat stable activity. The <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> complex migrates in sucrose density gradient centrifugation as a Mr = 70 K protein. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial toxin of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica strains {{obtained}} from adult periodontitis were analysed using mouse model. Results from subcutaneous injection with whole bacterial cells of 10 8 and 10 10 cells mL - 1 failed to induce any infection. However when bacterial concentration of 10 12 cells mL - 1 was used, all P. asaccharolytica strains {{were able to}} induced the development of localized lesion on balb/c mice. In addition, infected mice appeared cachectic with ruffled hair. Thus, infection with the latter concentration was pathogenic and was dose dependent. The toxin was also found to be <b>heat</b> <b>labile</b> for all strains. Therefore, we conclude that the extracellularly toxin produced by P. asaccharolytica of our local isolates which were {{obtained from}} adult periodontitis, is virulent and <b>heat</b> <b>labile...</b>|$|E
