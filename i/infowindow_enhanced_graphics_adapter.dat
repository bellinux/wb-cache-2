50|$|The Microsoft BASIC {{interpreter}} was {{supplied with}} the computer. It was highly customized for the Tandy 2000 hardware, particularly its high-resolution color graphics. Although IBM produced the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> {{a little more}} than a year later (October 1984), the Microsoft BASIC interpreter would not support its greater color and resolution capabilities until 1988.|$|R
5000|$|Its first product, {{announced}} September 1985, was a four chip EGA chipset that {{handled the}} functions of 19 of IBM's proprietary chips on the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter.</b> By that November's COMDEX, {{more than a half}} dozen companies had introduced EGA-compatible boards based on C&T's chipset. [...] This was followed by chipsets for PC motherboards and other computer graphics chips.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1985, the XT {{was offered}} in floppy-only models without {{a hard drive}} (Model 068 and 078) and the new <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> and Professional <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> became {{available}} as video card options In 1986, the 256-640KB motherboard models were launched, which switched to half-height drives and 101-key keyboards (essentially the IBM Model M, but in a modified variant that used the XT's keyboard protocol and lacked LEDs). 3.5" [...] floppy drives became available and 20 MB Seagate ST-225 hard disks in 5.25" [...] half-height size replaced the full-height 10 MB drives.|$|R
50|$|Although the IBM PC <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) {{standard}} {{offers a}} fixed 64 color space, it only allows 16 simultaneous colors (16 out of 64), {{and then only}} in the relatively slow and barely accelerated high-res (640x350) mode. Hi-res also required a dedicated EGA monitor - the lower resolutions (320x200 + 640x200, same as CGA) use 16 fixed colours, identical {{to those of the}} CGA RGBI palette, for compatibility with older RGBI monitors.|$|R
50|$|According to author Ron Feigenblatt, the WPIX-TV Yule Log {{inspired}} his similar digital medium demonstration on the then-young IBM Personal Computer, {{starting in}} 1985. At that time, the PC's new <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) finally allowed one to achieve limited, full-color, full-screen, pseudo-continuous, raster-graphics animation on a primitive consumer-grade personal computer, by flipping, during the frame-refresh interval, between four different (synthetic or pre-processed photographic) screen images pre-loaded into the display adapter memory, {{using a computer}} application program called PCMOVIE, written at IBM Research and distributed throughout IBM.|$|R

5000|$|EGABTR (EGA for <b>enhanced</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter),</b> {{sometimes}} pronounced [...] "Eggbeater", was a Trojan horse {{program that}} achieved {{some level of}} notoriety in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Allegedly a graphics utility that would {{improve the quality of}} an EGA display, it actually was malware that deleted the file allocation tables on the hard drive. This deletion was accompanied by a text message reading [...] "Arf! Arf! Got you!". Coverage about this virus has translated in languages such as German, Chinese and Indonesian. Various sources disagree as to the exact wording.|$|R
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) text-only <b>graphics</b> card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> and Video <b>Graphics</b> Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R
2500|$|Memory {{managers}} on 386-based systems (such as QEMM or MEMMAX (+V) in DR-DOS) {{could achieve}} the same effect, adding conventional memory at 640 KB and moving the barrier to 704 KB (up to segment B000, the start of MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (up to segment B800, {{the start of the}} CGA). [...] Only CGA could be used in this situation, because <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) video memory was immediately adjacent to the conventional memory area below the 640 KB line; the same memory area could not be used both for the frame buffer of the video card and for transient programs.|$|R
50|$|Most often those {{programs}} used a blue {{background for the}} main screen, with white or yellow characters, although commonly they had also user color customization. They often used box-drawing characters in IBM's code page 437. Later, the interface became deeply influenced by graphical user interfaces (GUI), adding pull-down menus, overlapping windows, dialog boxes and GUI widgets operated by mnemonics or keyboard shortcuts. Soon mouse input was added - either at text resolution as a simple colored box or at graphical resolution thanks {{to the ability of}} the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) and Video Graphics Array (VGA) display adapters to redefine the text character shapes by software - providing additional functions.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} {{peripheral}} chip were introduced by 1978. The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit binary counters {{that could be}} used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a light pen, an alternative to a computer mouse. This was a very popular chip and was even used in the original IBM PC Monochrome Display Adapter with the Intel 8088 16-bit microprocessor in 1981, and in the follow-up IBM Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> for the original PC and successors; the IBM <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> card contained custom IBM chips that emulated the Motorola 6845, with minor differences.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} home computers (such as the TRS-80 and Commodore PET) were limited to monochrome CRT displays, but color display capability was already a standard feature of the pioneering Apple II, introduced in 1977, and the specialty of the more graphically sophisticated Atari 800, introduced in 1979. Either computer could {{be connected to the}} antenna terminals of an ordinary color TV set or used with a purpose-made CRT color monitor for optimum resolution and color quality. Lagging several years behind, in 1981 IBM introduced the Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which could display four colors with a resolution of 320 x 200 pixels, or it could produce 640 x 200 pixels with two colors. In 1984 IBM introduced the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> which was capable of producing 16 colors and had a resolution of 640 x 350.|$|R
50|$|The XT {{had eight}} slots. Two {{were behind the}} floppy drive and shorter than PC's slots. The other six fit into the same space as the PC's five slots. Most PC cards would not fit into the two short slots, and some would not fit into the six standard-length, but narrower, slots, {{particularly}} cards with double boards on them. The floppy and hard drive adapters, the serial port card, and nearly always a display adapter board occupied slots. The basic specification was soon upgraded to have 256 KB of RAM as standard. Expansion slots {{could be used for}} I/O devices or for memory expansion. Available Video cards were initially the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) (the same two cards that were available for the type 5150 PC), with <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) and Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) becoming available in 1984.|$|R
500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) and <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA), but not Video Graphics Array (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|R
50|$|The CGA {{card was}} succeeded in the {{consumer}} space by IBM's <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) card, which supports most of CGA's modes and adds an additional resolution (640&times;350) {{as well as a}} software-selectable palette of 16 colors out of 64 in both text and graphics modes. Along with this move, the price of the older CGA card was lowered considerably; it became an attractive low-cost option and was soon adopted by the new PC cloning companies as well. Entry-level non-AT PCs with CGA graphics sold very well during the next few years, and consequently there were many games released for such systems, despite CGA's limitations. CGA's popularity started to wane after VGA became IBM's high-level standard and EGA the entry-level standard in 1987. However, most software made up to 1990 supported it.|$|R
5000|$|Elaborating {{on the art}} {{style of}} the game, Kenny Lee said he was {{inspired}} by adventure games produced in the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) display standard. He encountered difficulty emulating the 16-color palette due to newer applications enforcing visual improvements, such as anti-aliasing and a widened color palette, by default; because of this, he had to use Deluxe Paint, an older graphics application, in order to force the limited palette and screen resolution. Lee also stated {{that he had no}} prior experience in visual arts. Regarding its premise, Lee explained that it came from an email that made him [...] "laugh out loud at work." [...] The protagonist, intentionally left nameless, was not based on anyone in particular, but Lee based the design on Guybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island series since he could not draw a completely original character design.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 Sid Meier {{listed the}} IBM PC {{as one of}} the three most {{important}} innovations in the history of video games. The IBM PC compatible platform became a technically competitive gaming platform with IBM’s PC/AT in 1984. The primitive CGA graphics of prior models, with only 4-color 320×200 pixel graphics (or, using special programming, 16-color 160×100 graphics) had limited the PC’s appeal to the business segment, as its graphics failed to compete with the C64 or Apple II. The new 64-color <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) display standard allowed its graphics to approach the quality seen in popular home computers like the Commodore 64. However, the sound abilities of the AT were still limited to the PC speaker, which was substandard compared to the built-in sound chips used in many home computers. Also, the relatively high cost of the PC compatible systems severely limited their popularity in gaming.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|R
5000|$|Compute! {{described}} The Pawn as [...] "parodying {{the entire}} genre of interactive fiction, showing us {{that much of}} it—even the serious stuff—has its shortcomings", giving as example a character campaigning to eliminate mazes in text adventures. It stated {{that some of the}} Atari ST version's graphics were [...] "superb" [...] but wished that the pictures contributed to solving the game instead of being optional. The magazine concluded that [...] "Firebird has given us a good adventure, one that bodes well for the company {{and for all of us}} adventurers". Computer Gaming World stated that The Pawn [...] "shows how well something can be done for the Amiga when one KNOWS the machine". In Dragon #114's [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column, reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser stated that the game's [...] ""painted" [...] scenes will leave you in awe". The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #134 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars for IBM micros and compatibles version with an EGA board, but only 2½ stars for systems without an <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) board.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1980s, {{computers}} had outgrown these video {{systems and}} needed better displays. The Apple IIgs {{suffered from the}} use of the old scanning method, with the highest display resolution being 640x200, resulting in a severely distorted tall narrow pixel shape, making the display of realistic proportioned images difficult. Solutions from various companies varied widely. Because PC monitor signals {{did not need to be}} broadcast, they could consume far more than the 6, 7 and 8 MHz of bandwidth that NTSC and PAL signals were confined to. IBM's Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> and <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> as well as the Hercules Graphics Card and the original Macintosh computer generated a video signal close to 350p. The Commodore Amiga created a true interlaced NTSC signal (as well as RGB variations). This ability resulted in the Amiga dominating the video production field until the mid-1990s, but the interlaced display mode caused flicker problems for more traditional PC applications where single-pixel detail is required. 1987 saw the introduction of VGA, on which PCs soon standardized, Apple only followed suit some years later with the Mac when the VGA standard was improved to match Apple's proprietary 24 bit color video standard also introduced in 1987.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. As an augmentation to field training, the author identifies {{a need for}} an easily available light infantry platoon combat model that presents a realistic view of the battlefield environment. To meet this need, the author examines the feasibility of developing a realistic three dimensional display of a terrain representation on a personal computer. The target computer provides only limited graphics support with an <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> and all <b>graphics</b> routines are implemented in software. Three methods of terrain representation are examined, and the Dynamic Tactical Simulation (DYNTACS) terrain model is chosen for implementation. The DYNTACS representation uses a specialized triangle drawing procedure written in assembly language, the painter's algorithm for hidden surface removal, and Defense Mapping Agency Digital Terrain Elevation Data. The implementation obtains a display rate between 1. 2 and 1. 5 seconds on a 80386 based 25 MHz computer. The author concludes that {{with the addition of}} enhancements that provide the capability to display cultural features, and model the target acquisition process, the program could be developed into a light infantry platoon combat model or a research tool for examining effects of human factors effects on tactical decision making.

5000|$|Except {{for very}} low {{resolution}} graphic modes, early home and personal computers rarely implemented an [...] "all-pixels-addressable" [...] design - that is, {{the ability to}} change a single pixel {{to any of the}} available colors independently. Their limitations came from employing separate color attribute or color RAM areas, leading to attribute clash effects. Also, the pixel bits and/or the scan lines of the video memory were commonly arranged in odd ways convenient for the video generator hardware (thus saving hardware costs in a cost-competitive market), but sometimes creating difficulty for the people writing graphics programs. A pixel's bits in indexed-color, all-pixel-addressable images are not always contiguous in video memory or image files (i.e., chunky organization is not always used.) Some video hardware, such as the 16-color graphic modes of the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) and Video Graphics Array (VGA) for IBM PC compatiblesor the Amiga video bufferare arranged as a series of bit planes (in a configuration called planar), in which the related bits of a single pixel are split among several independent bitmaps. Thus, the pixel bits are conceptually aligned along the 3D Z-axis. (The [...] "depth" [...] concept here {{is not the same as}} that of pixel depth.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} introductive and {{user documentation}} [...] including extended summary, theoretical manual, short user manual and description of illustrative examples [...] for {{a version of}} decision analysis and support systems of DIDAS family that is designed for multicriteria analysis of nonlinear models on professional microcomputers. This version has been developed in the years 1986 - 1990 in the Institute of Automatic Control, Warsaw University of Technology, under a joint research program with the Systems and Decision Sciences Program of IIASA. It can be run on professional microcomputers compatible with IBM-PC-XT or AT (with Hercules Graphics Card, Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> or <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> and, preferably, with a numeric coprocessor and a hard disk) and supports graphical representation of results of interactive multicriteria analysis. Moreover, this version called IAC-DIDAS-N is provided with a new nonlinear model generator and editor that support, in an easy standard of a spreadsheet, the definition, edition and symbolic differentiation of nonlinear substantive models for multiobjective decision analysis. A specially introduced standard of defining nonlinear programming models for multiobjective optimization helps to connect the model generator with {{other parts of the}} system. Optimization runs involved in interactive, multiobjective decision analysis are performed by a solver, that is, a version of nonlinear programming algorithm specially adapted for multiobjective problems. This algorithm is based on shifted penalty functions and projected conjugate directions techniques similarly as in former nonlinear versions of DIDAS, but it was further developed and several improvements were added. The system is permanently updated and developed. Currently (starting from October 1990) the version 4. 0 of the system is released. Most of enhancements added in this version are not directly visible to the user. They influence the efficiency of the system...|$|R
500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) <b>graphics</b> mode.|$|R
