25|$|In the end, {{despite the}} passionate {{pleadings}} of Charles Lachaud, Marie, {{no longer as}} composed as she was previously throughout the trial, <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> sentenced {{by the president of}} the court to life imprisonment with hard labor on 19 September and was brought to Montpellier to serve out her sentence. King Louis-Philippe, however, commuted her sentence to life without hard labor.|$|E
500|$|On 5 October 1936 a {{selected}} group of 200 {{set out from}} Jarrow Town Hall on the 282-mile march, aiming to reach London by 30 October {{for the start of}} the new session of parliament. Wilkinson did not march all the way, but joined whenever her various commitments allowed. At that year's Labour Party conference, held in Edinburgh, she hoped to rouse enthusiasm but instead <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> condemned for [...] "sending hungry and ill-clad men across the country". This negative attitude was mirrored by some of the local parties on the route of the march; in such areas, Wilkinson recorded with irony, the Conservatives and Liberals saw to the marchers' needs. On 31 October the marchers reached London, but Baldwin refused to see them. On 4 November, Wilkinson presented the town's petition to the House of Commons. Signed by 11,000 citizens of Jarrow, it concluded: [...] "The town cannot be left derelict, and therefore your Petitioners humbly pray that His Majesty's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay." [...] In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman opined that [...] "the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months". [...] In reply a Labour backbencher commented that [...] "the Government's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience".|$|E
500|$|Continuing {{from the}} ending of [...] "Space", the other Amy reveals that she is from a few moments in the future, {{and is able to}} come into the current outer TARDIS because [...] "the {{exterior}} shell of the TARDIS has drifted forwards in time". The other Amy knows what to say and do because, from her perspective, she is repeating what she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> say earlier on. The Doctor sends the current Amy into the TARDIS within the current TARDIS, in order to [...] "maintain the timeline". The two Amys take a moment to flirt with each other before the current one departs, much to the Doctor's exasperation. However, not long after the current Amy has left, Rory and Amy enter through the door of outer TARDIS [...] explaining that the Doctor, from their perspective, has just sent them into the inner TARDIS. The current Doctor promptly sends the current Rory and the now-current Amy through the inner TARDIS. The Doctor then explains that he will set up a [...] "controlled temporal implosion" [...] in order to [...] "reset the TARDIS", but in order to do so he must know which lever to use on the control panel. Moments after he speaks, another Doctor enters though the outer TARDIS door and tells him to use [...] "the wibbly lever", which he quickly operates, then steps into the inner TARDIS to tell his past self which lever to use. The inner TARDIS dematerialises while the outer TARDIS (being the same TARDIS) does the same, and the Doctor assures Amy and Rory that they are now back in [...] "normal flight", and then advises Amy to [...] "put some trousers on".|$|E
5000|$|Amber <b>Heard</b> plays <b>herself,</b> {{an actress}} {{on the set}} of A Crazy Little Thing Called Love. (Season 1) ...|$|R
60|$|Let us inquire {{also with}} Barizy of the Tower, where was Besso? Alone {{in his private}} chamber, {{agitated}} and troubled, awaiting the return of his daughter from the bath; and even now, the arrival may be <b>heard</b> of <b>herself</b> and her attendants in the inner court.|$|R
60|$|Her next words {{supplied}} a solution. They {{were under}} shelter {{of one of}} the boats now and she could make <b>herself</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am lonely sometimes," [...] she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> admitting--far-off, dreaming, needing {{the close}} affection {{that her mother}} and Walter had once given her.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> answering, very stiffly: [...] "Perhaps I'd better {{apologize}} for what I've said already. You must think I was very unjust {{the last time}} we mentioned him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't at all KNOW you," [...] {{she added}} abruptly; {{and then she}} {{coloured}} as she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> saying {{what she had said}} almost a year before to Lord Warburton.|$|E
60|$|Madge, whose slumbers, {{like those}} of most who labour under mental malady, had been short, and were easily broken, now made <b>herself</b> <b>heard</b> from her place of repose.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{no reply}} {{for that and}} still {{did not look up}} at her. I <b>heard</b> her swing <b>herself</b> around in the saddle. [...] "Lift me down," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "George!" [...] cried Mrs. Fillson, {{who was a}} fine woman, {{raising her}} voice almost to a scream {{in the effort to}} make <b>herself</b> <b>heard</b> above the winch of a {{neighbouring}} steamer.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Isabel's answer caused {{itself to be}} waited for; then she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> utter it in the stillness that Pansy's {{attention}} seemed to make. [...] "Yes--to marry some one else." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} look businesslike, but she could scarce resist rocking her arms with delight when she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> saying such things to him. It {{was as if she}} had the old doctor once more in her hands.|$|E
6000|$|He {{began to}} laugh, {{and they all}} laughed when she said, [...] "You need a {{chaperon}} who doesn't lose her head, in a silhouette." [...] But it seemed useless to hold out after that, and she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> asking, [...] "Shall we let him keep it, Miss Triscoe?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mysie <b>herself</b> <b>heard</b> her destiny {{without much}} elation, {{though she was}} very fond of Lady Phyllis, and the tears came into her eyes {{at the thought of}} her being unwell and wanting her.|$|R
60|$|For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor {{could not}} {{withhold}} her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison {{with what she}} had <b>heard</b> and seen <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bloom {{through the}} bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they <b>heard,</b> each for <b>herself</b> alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.|$|R
6000|$|An {{uncontrollable}} look of mingled {{rage and}} fear made its plain confession in Fanny's face. She had been discovered; she had <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> called [...] "drolesse;" [...] she {{stood before the}} two men self-condemned. Her angry master threatened her with instant dismissal from the house. The doctor interfered.|$|E
6000|$|This {{stirring}} speech affected {{our young}} lady {{as if it}} had been the shake of a tambourine borne towards her from a gypsy dance: her head seemed to go round and she felt a sudden passion in her feet. The emotion, however, was but meagrely expressed in the flatness with which she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> presently say: [...] "I'll go to the Registrar now." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{separate}} {{incidents that}} compose the narrative are, {{to a very}} great extent, authentic, occurring, many of them, either under her own observation, or that of her personal friends. She or her friends have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here introduced; {{and many of the}} sayings are word for word as <b>heard</b> <b>herself,</b> or reported to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Read it, if ye want to, boys." [...] Then {{the door}} closed tightly again, and they <b>heard</b> her fling <b>herself</b> on the bed. Anson handed the letter to Bert, who read it in a steady voice.|$|R
50|$|For the role, Smith had {{to learn}} the two singing voices that Black uses, a loud belt she {{originally}} used to make <b>herself</b> <b>heard</b> in the noisy Cavern Club and a softer one she used in a recording studio.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So glad, so glad,' Minna was <b>heard</b> murmuring to <b>herself</b> {{again and}} again; her rest was calmer {{than it had}} been for weeks, and the doctor found her so much better that he trusted that a {{favourable}} change had begun.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To see me--it was for that? Why {{have you}} come?' she went on. He was evidently {{surprise}}d, and his surprise {{gave her a}} point of anger, a desire almost that her words should hurt him, lash him. She spoke low, but she <b>heard</b> <b>herself,</b> and she thought that if what she said sounded {{to him in the}} same way----! 'You have come very often--too often, too often!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{looked at}} herself in this character--looked intently, {{thinking}} she filled it with a certain grace. But {{what she said was}} not an expression of any such complacency. [...] "You don't offend me; but you ought to remember that, without being offended, one may be incommoded, troubled." [...] "Incommoded," [...] she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> saying that, and it struck her as a ridiculous word. But it was what stupidly came to her.|$|E
6000|$|Short-lip was shamelessly exalted and excited. Really {{she could}} {{scarcely}} believe it! She already <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> relating the whole occurrence. Here {{was the most}} beautiful young man she had ever seen--an entire stranger--talking to them in the most beautiful and natural way, right in the lane, and reciting poetry to her sister! It was like a novel--only more so. She thought that Cynthia, on the other hand, looked distressed, and--she must say it--"silly." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grummit took it, {{and several}} other favours, while his wife, tugging at her brother, endeavoured to explain. It was not, however, until Mr. Grummit claimed the usual {{sanctuary}} of the defeated by refusing to rise that she could make <b>herself</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|R
60|$|This {{was enough}} to prove that her {{approbation}} need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was <b>heard</b> only by <b>herself,</b> soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.|$|R
60|$|At Nuttlebury {{she passed}} the village inn, whose sign creaked in {{response}} to the greeting of her footsteps, which not a human soul <b>heard</b> but <b>herself.</b> Under the thatched roofs her mind's eye beheld relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow, as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on Hambledon Hill.|$|R
6000|$|Iggulden sat in {{his chair}} by the fire, a thistle-spud between his knees, his head drooped. Though {{she had never seen}} death before, her heart, that missed a beat, told her that he was dead. She did not speak or cry, but stood outside the door, and the dog licked her hand. When he threw up his nose, she <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> saying: [...] "Don't howl! Please don't begin to howl, Scottie, or I shall run away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fleda by {{this time}} knew in what way she was affected: she became limp and weak again; she felt herself give {{everything}} up. Mixed with the horror, with the kindness of the station-master, {{with the smell of}} cinders and the riot of sound, was the raw bitterness of a hope that she might never again in life have to give up so much at such short notice. She <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> repeat mechanically, yet as if asking it for the first time: [...] "Poynton's gone?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went up to}} {{her room}} to smooth her hair before dinner. Yes, it was very nice light-brown hair, with a golden shine; {{and her eyes were}} very clear and blue, and her skin very white, with a rosy flush; and her nose was straight, and the shape was a pretty {{delicate}} one. Amy really did think Mr. Wingfield was right, and had better taste than the people who thought her a poor washy, peaky thing, as she had more than once <b>heard</b> <b>herself</b> called.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{release of}} the single was {{accompanied}} by a cover of Britney Spears's hit single [...] "...Baby One More Time". Spears <b>herself</b> <b>heard</b> the Travis version while shopping, and commented by saying it was 'a total shock' and was 'a very good cover'.|$|R
60|$|For {{several moments}} after Aggie ceased reading, the applause {{was so great}} that it was {{impossible}} for anyone to make <b>herself</b> <b>heard..</b> The girls were so pleased with the scheme that they were almost as noisy as the boys would have been under similar circumstances.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no sound}} in the room except the lapping voices of the fire, but we two listened intently, and she at least took comfort from what she <b>heard.</b> She {{recovered}} <b>herself</b> and half rose. I sat still in my chair by the screen.|$|R
