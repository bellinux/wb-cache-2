5|$|Mici {{had been}} a student in Pittsburgh, and wanted {{to return to the}} United States. Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>University,</b> where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>University</b> in 1937, Teller {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm. Teller and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E
