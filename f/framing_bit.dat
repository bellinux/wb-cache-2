50|$|To {{help prevent}} these problems, SMPTE time code {{contains}} a color <b>framing</b> <b>bit,</b> {{which can be}} used to indicate that the video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the color framing sequence. If the color <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> was set in both types of material, the editing system could then always ensure that color framing was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences, and hence the color framing sequences.|$|E
50|$|The speed {{includes}} <b>bits</b> for <b>framing</b> (stop <b>bits,</b> parity, etc.) and so {{the effective}} data rate {{is lower than the}} bit transmission rate. For example, with 8-N-1 character framing only 80% of the bits are available for data (for every eight bits of data, two more <b>framing</b> <b>bits</b> are sent).|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, {{superframe}} (SF) is a T1 framing standard. In the 1970s it {{replaced the}} original T1/D1 framing scheme of the 1960s {{in which the}} <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> simply alternated between 0 and 1.|$|E
50|$|A color <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> {{is often}} used to {{indicate}} field 1 of the colour frame, so that editing equipment can make sure to edit only on appropriate field boundaries in order to prevent picture corruption.|$|E
5000|$|Bit 11, {{the color}} <b>framing</b> <b>bit,</b> {{is set to}} 1 if the time code is {{synchronized}} to a color video signal. The frame number modulo 2 (for NTSC and SECAM) or modulo 4 (for PAL) should be preserved across cuts {{in order to avoid}} phase jumps in the chrominance subcarrier.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{predecessor}} superframe, every sixth <b>frame's</b> least-significant data <b>bit</b> {{can be used}} for robbed-bit signaling of call supervision state. However, there are four such bits (ABCD) per channel per extended superframe, rather than the two bits (AB) provided per superframe.

50|$|Another common {{coding scheme}} used with SerDes is 64b/66b encoding. This scheme {{statistically}} delivers DC-balance and transitions {{through the use}} of a scrambler. Framing is delivered through the deterministic transitions of the added <b>framing</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} where each channel {{is located in the}} stream of data being received, each set of 24 channels is aligned in a frame. The frame is 192 bits long (8 * 24), and is terminated with a 193rd bit, the <b>framing</b> <b>bit,</b> which is used to find the end of the frame.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> to be located by {{receiving}} equipment, a predictable pattern is sent on this bit. Equipment will search for a bit which has the correct pattern, and will align its framing based on that bit. The pattern sent is 12 bits long, so every group of 12 frames is called a superframe. The pattern used in the 193rd bit is 100011 011100.|$|E
50|$|Framing bit: A common {{practice}} in telecommunications, for example in T-carrier, is to insert, in a dedicated time slot within the frame, a noninformation bit or <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> that is used for synchronization of the incoming data with the receiver. In a bit stream, framing bits indicate the beginning or end of a frame. They occur at specified positions in the frame, do not carry information, and are usually repetitive.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the digital}} T-1 system, carrier wave {{systems such as}} 12-channel carrier systems worked by {{frequency}} division multiplexing; each call was an analog signal. A T-1 trunk could transmit 24 telephone calls at a time, because it used a digital carrier signal called Digital Signal 1 (DS-1). DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit. T-1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|E
5000|$|A DS1 {{telecommunication}} circuit {{is made up}} of twenty-four 8-bit channels (also known as timeslots or DS0s), each channel being a 64 kbit/s DS0 multiplexed carrier circuit. A DS1 is also a full-duplex circuit, which means the circuit transmits and receives 1.544 Mbit/s concurrently. A total of 1.536 Mbit/s of bandwidth is achieved by sampling each of the twenty-four 8-bit DS0s 8000 times per second. This sampling is referred to as 8-kHz sampling (See Pulse-code modulation). An additional 8 kbit/s of overhead is obtained from the placement of one <b>framing</b> <b>bit,</b> for a total of 1.544 Mbit/s, calculated as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The signal {{transmitted}} on a T1 line, {{referred to}} as the DS1 signal, consists of serial bits transmitted at the rate of 1.544 Mbps. The type of line code used is called Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI). Digital Signal Designation is the classification of digital bit rates in the digital multiplex hierarchy used in transport of telephone signals from one location to another. DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit, transmitted over a digital circuit called T1. T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|E

This option encodes a video frame and arranges the <b>frame</b> <b>bits</b> {{in a way that}} allows discarding parts of the video <b>frame</b> <b>bits</b> (i.e., ELs) while the truncated frame will still be decodable.

5000|$|Ending {{delimiter}} : The {{counterpart to}} the starting delimiter, this field {{marks the end of}} the frame and consists of the following bits from most significant to least significant: J,K,1,J,K,1,I,E. I is the intermediate <b>frame</b> <b>bit</b> and E is the error bit.|$|R
50|$|A more {{detailed}} {{understanding of how}} the rate of 1.544 Mbit/s was divided into channels is as follows. (This explanation glosses over T1 voice communications, and deals mainly with the numbers involved.) Given that the telephone system nominal voiceband (including guardband) is 4,000 Hz, the required digital sampling rate is 8,000 Hz (see Nyquist rate). Since each T1 frame contains 1 byte of voice data for each of the 24 channels, that system needs then 8,000 frames per second to maintain those 24 simultaneous voice channels. Because each frame of a T1 is 193 bits in length (24 channels × 8 bits per channel + 1 <b>framing</b> <b>bit</b> = 193 bits), 8,000 frames per second is multiplied by 193 bits to yield a transfer rate of 1.544 Mbit/s (8,000 × 193 = 1,544,000).|$|E

To ensure that the 01111110 pattern does not appear somewhere inside the <b>frame,</b> <b>bit</b> stuffing and destuffing procedures are used.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{computer}} networking, {{data to be}} transmitted is the payload, but is almost always encapsulated in some type of a [...] "frame" [...] composed of <b>framing</b> <b>bits</b> and a <b>frame</b> check sequence.

50|$|This is {{precisely}} what MNP 3 did. After negotiating and realizing that both modems supported MNP 3, the <b>framing</b> <b>bits</b> were turned off, improving overall efficiency. When using MNP 3, a user can expect to get {{very close to the}} ideal 2400 bit/s throughput (versus 1900 bit/s) by eliminating the overhead.|$|R
50|$|Ones-density {{is often}} {{controlled}} using precoding {{techniques such as}} Run Length Limited encoding, where the PCM code is expanded into a slightly longer code with a guaranteed bound on ones-density before modulation into the channel.

5000|$|Bit 0 is the <b>frame</b> marker <b>bit</b> Pr. Every 10th bit {{starting}} with bit 9, 19, 29, ... 99 {{is also a}} marker bit, known as position identifiers P1, P2, ..., P9, P0.

40|$|In block-based video coding, {{the current}} frame to be encoded is {{decomposed}} into {{blocks of the}} same size, and a motion vector is used to improve the prediction for each block. The motion vectors and the difference frame, which contains the blocks' prediction errors, must be encoded with bits. Typically, choosing a smaller block size (using more motion vectors) will improve the prediction and hence decrease the number of difference <b>frame</b> <b>bits,</b> but it will {{increase the number of}} motion bits since more motion vectors need to be encoded. Not surprisingly, there must be some value for the block size that optimizes the tradeoff between motion and difference <b>frame</b> <b>bits,</b> and thus minimizes their sum (the total number of <b>bits</b> for the <b>frame).</b> Despite the widespread experience with block-based video coders, there is little analysis or theory that quantitatively explains the effect of block size on encoding bit rate, and ordinarily the block size for a coder is chosen based on empirical experiments [...] ...|$|R
