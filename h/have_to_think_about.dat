"Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would be silly to go out against yourself in the form of The Beatles. So I fell in with the idea and thought, 'Great, I don't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> an album.'"

500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> anything else).

500|$|The team {{overhauled}} the game's {{shooting and}} driving mechanics {{to match the}} standards of its contemporaries. Public reception to the team's previous games (such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3) was considered during the process. To increase the pace of shootouts, the team removed hard lockinga central mechanic in Grand Theft Auto IV that instantly locks onto the enemy nearest to the crosshair. Associate technical director Phil Hooker found hard locking [...] "too disorientating" [...] and immersion-breaking, [...] "as you didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> enemy locations". He said that Grand Theft Auto IV players [...] "just rely on holding and shooting until a target is dead", so Grand Theft Auto V introduces a timer that breaks the lock on a target after a few seconds.

Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it".

500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.

500|$|The idea of {{creating}} a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family.
