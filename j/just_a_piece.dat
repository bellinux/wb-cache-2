The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, {{although there are no}} hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E

500|$|Jezebel {{determined}} that Belle [...] "is often {{held up as}} the standard of the 'feminist' Disney princess." [...] According to Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults author Anna E. Altmann, Disney heavily promoted Beauty and the Beast as [...] "a feminist fairy tale" [...] due to Belle's characterization and role in the film. In his book Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies, author Timothy B. Cargal agreed that the character indicated [...] "Disney's ... continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age." [...] According to Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia author Claudia Mitchell, Belle's feminism was influenced by third-wave feminism and the relatively new concept of girl power during the 1990s. Feminist critics have been generally mixed in their analyses of Belle, arguing {{over whether or not}} the character is in fact [...] "feminist enough." [...] Although Beauty and the Beast was initially lauded upon release for starring a [...] "forward thinking and feminist" [...] heroine, critics tend to agree that, in spite of Belle's independence and resentment towards Gaston, Beauty and the Beast essentially remains a romance about a girl who finally [...] "meets her ideal man." [...] Acknowledging that Belle [...] "represented significant change from [...] sweet, mop-wielding predecessors," [...] Twilight and History author Nancy Reagin observed that [...] "the end result of fulfillment through marriage has been maintained." [...] Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle cited Belle as an example of [...] "pseudo-feminism" [...] because she rejects one man, Gaston, in favor of another, a prince. While commending Belle for [...] "seeing past the beast's appearance," [...] Judith Welikala of The Independent in the end accused the character of [...] "melting back into the role of wife when he turns back into a handsome prince." [...] Fairy Tale author Andrew Teverson referred to Belle as Disney's attempt to address [...] "feminist criticism of its representation of women in earlier films," [...] but ultimately criticized the character's curiosity for [...] "extend only to romance," [...] additionally accusing her of being [...] "a zealous individualist with a pathological hostility to common men and women." [...] Meanwhile, Stylist ranked Belle among the most feminist Disney characters, describing her as an [...] "incredibly intelligent" [...] woman who [...] "doesn't stand for a man who considers her as <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of meat ... she wants someone who loves her for her mind too." [...] Acknowledging the character's [...] "feminist longings," [...] Daniel Eagen, author of America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, cited Belle as Disney's [...] "modern-day corrective to Snow White." [...] Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works author Phyllis Frus wrote that, initially, Beauty and the Beast does not seem [...] "remotely feminist." [...] However, the author did acknowledge Belle as [...] "an appealing character with a noticeable feminist streak," [...] but in the end criticized Disney's Consumer Products of reversing what the film had nearly accomplished by inducting the character into the Disney Princess franchise. In Refinery29's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses As Feminist Role Models," [...] author Vanessa Golembewski ranked the character eighth but described her personality and ambitions as [...] "confusing." [...] Complex's Tara Aquino described Belle as [...] "a kinda feminist ... who's well-read, self-sufficient, and with standards high enough that she doesn't fall for the town's brain-dead pretty boy." ...|$|E
