40|$|The {{presented}} diploma {{thesis is}} concerned with the group of phraseological combinations, namely binominal phrases in Dutch. Binominal phrases are compared to Czech; the goal is to investigate morphosyntactic and semantic-lexical congruence and difference. Theoretical part deals with morphological, syntactical and semantic description of phraseological pairs. At the same time, general characteristics and classification of phrasemes, accompanied by a brief historical overview, has been put together. Last part of the theoretical chapter {{is concerned with}} the types of equivalence. Practical part includes a corpus of Dutch phraseologisms and their Czech translations, which are distributed to three groups according to the degree of equivalence. The corpus has been set up manually, the main source being Van Dale Idioom Woordenboek. Further on, it was expanded by additional phrasemes taken from Nederlandse Spreekwoorden, spreekwijzen, uitdrukkingen en gezegen by F. A: Stoett, as well as by expressions from three websites, which contain lists of proverbs. In total, the corpus contains 286 Dutch binominal phrases, which are in the practical part subsequently analyzed according to the type of equivalence. 22 % out of all <b>binominal</b> <b>pairs</b> are marked by total phraseological equivalence. This type of equivalence subsumes [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly many {{real world}} tasks involve data in {{multiple}} modalities or views. This has motivated {{the development of}} many effective algorithms for learning a common latent space to relate multiple domains. However, most existing cross-view learning algorithms assume access to <b>paired</b> <b>data</b> for training. Their applicability is thus limited as the <b>paired</b> <b>data</b> assumption is often violated in practice: many tasks have only a small subset of <b>data</b> available with <b>pairing</b> annotation, or even no <b>paired</b> <b>data</b> at all. In this paper we introduce Deep Matching Autoencoders (DMAE), which learn a common latent space and pairing from unpaired multi-modal data. Specifically we formulate this as a cross-domain representation learning and object matching problem. We simultaneously optimise parameters of representation learning auto-encoders and the pairing of unpaired multi-modal data. This framework elegantly spans the full regime from fully supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised (no <b>paired</b> <b>data)</b> multi-modal learning. We show promising results in image captioning, and on a new task that is uniquely enabled by our methodology: unsupervised classifier learning. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
40|$|The given article expands on {{peculiarities of}} choir {{performance}} {{as a type of}} artistic activity. It also reports on the specific character of choir {{performance as a}} complex system combining social, artistic and creative, vocal and choral as well as organisational elements. Choir performance is considered to be an artistic process with communicativeness and artistic sense as its main components. The communicative element of choir performance presents itself in such <b>binominal</b> <b>pairs</b> as: composer – musical text; musical text – conductor; conductor – choir; choir – audience; conductor – audience. These pairs give rise to recoding one “language” into another one. Choir performance as a sort of artistic process reveals itself in the essence of the personality’s music and performing culture. Performing culture of a member of the student choir staff can be defined as a group of personal significant qualities such as: experience of performing activity, performing competence and a complex of the performer’s music and artistic skills. Choir performance is a complex system with social, artistic and creative, organisational, vocal and choral components. Choir performance is based on the conductor’s artistic view and his/her interpretation within the scope of music and performance. Underlying the development of artistic conscience, choir performance is a micro-social phenomenon, forming personal significant qualities, performing culture and humane relationships among members of choir staff...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{review of}} methods for comparing means using partially <b>paired</b> <b>data</b> Beibei Guo 1 and Ying Yuan 2, 3 In medical experiments {{with the objective}} of testing the equality of two means, data are often partially paired by design or because of missing <b>data.</b> The partially <b>paired</b> <b>data</b> represent a combination of paired and unpaired observations. In this article, we review and compare nine methods for analyzing partially <b>paired</b> <b>data,</b> including the two-sample t-test, paired t-test, corrected z-test, weighted t-test, pooled t-test, optimal pooled t-test, multiple imputation method, mixed model approach, and the test based on a modified maximum likelihood estimate. We compare the performance of these methods through extensive simulation studies that cover a wide range of scenarios with different effect sizes, sample sizes, and correlations between the paired variables, as well as true underlying distributions. The simulation results suggest that when the sample size is moderate, the test based on the modified maximum likelihood estimator is generally superior to the other approaches when the data is normally distributed and the optimal pooled t-test performs the best when the data is not normally distributed, with well-controlled type I error rates and high statistical power; when the sample size is small, the optimal pooled t-test is to be recommended when both variables have missing <b>data</b> and the <b>paired</b> t-test is to be recommended when only one variable has missing data...|$|R

The recommended family of test statistics uses integrated differences in survival estimates that are available during the study period, where adjustments are made for dependence in the survival and censoring outcomes under comparison. In the context of <b>paired</b> censored survival <b>data,</b> the joint asymptotic closed form distribution of these sequentially monitored test statistics is developed and shown to have a dependent increments structure. Simulations verifying nice operating characteristics of the proposed monitoring methods also reveal consequences of ignoring an underlying <b>paired</b> <b>data</b> structure in terms of size and power properties. A motivating example is also presented via the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, which did not have methods available for sequentially monitoring <b>paired</b> censored survival <b>data</b> at the time.
