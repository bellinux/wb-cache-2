5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate <b>feedback</b> <b>regulation</b> coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E

Three cellular processes control erythropoiesis: self-renewal, differentiation and apoptosis. We describe these processes and regulatory networks that govern them. Two proteins (ERK and Fas) are considered as the basic proteins participating in this regulation. All erythroid progenitors are divided into several sub-populations depending on their maturity level. <b>Feedback</b> <b>regulations</b> by erythropoietin, glucocorticoids and Fas ligand (FasL) are introduced in the model.

2500|$|Multicellular animals {{also have}} a type of kinase closely related to Raf: this is the Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR). Vertebrates like mammals have two, paralogous KSR genes instead of one: KSR1 and KSR2. Their C-terminal kinase domain {{is very similar to}} Raf (originally called CA5 in KSR and CR3 in Raf), but the N-terminal {{regulatory}} region differs. Although they also have the flexible hinge (CA4 in KSR) and a C1 domain (CA3 in KSR) before it, KSRs entirely lack the Ras-binding domain. Instead, they have unique regulatory regions on their N-termini, originally termed CA1 ("conserved area 1") and CA2. For a long time, the structure of the CA1 domain was a mystery. However, in 2012, the structure of the CA1 region in KSR1 was solved: {{it turned out to be}} a divergent SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, supplemented with coiled-coils (CC-SAM): this is supposed to aid KSRs in membrane binding. KSRs, like Rafs, also have the twin 14-3-3 associating motifs (that depend on phosphorylation), but also possess novel MAPK-binding motifs on [...] their hinge regions. With a typical sequence Phe-x-Phe-Pro (FxFP) these motifs are important for the <b>feedback</b> <b>regulation</b> of Raf kinases in the ERK1/2 pathway. According to our current knowledge, KSRs also participate in the same pathway as Raf, although they only play an auxiliary role. With a very poor intrinsic kinase activity, they were long thought to be inactive, until their catalytic activity was finally demonstrated in recent years. But even then, they contribute only negligibly to MKK1 and MKK2 phosphorylation. The main role of KSR appears to be to provide a heterodimerization partner to Raf enzymes, greatly facilitating their activation by means of allostery. Similar phenomena [...] were described for other MAP3 kinases. ASK2, for example, is a poor enzyme on its own, and it activity appears to be tied to ASK1/ASK2 heterodimerisation.|$|E

30|$|Specificity in the {{response}} of the MAPK module to different ligands, which ensures a reliable processing of signals, is achieved through different courses in ERK activity, which in turn regulate ERK substrate activation. In particular, the MAPK module involves several <b>feedback</b> <b>regulations,</b> which are important to shape ERK response. Most importantly, ERK interacts with Raf via different mechanisms in a context dependent manner. This has been exemplified in a study with PC- 12 cell lines, in which the MAPK signaling pathway was investigated upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) [14]. PC- 12 cells show a transient ERK activity after stimulation with EGF, and cells start to proliferate. In contrast, ERK activity is sustained for at least one hour after stimulation with NGF, and NGF triggers differentiation.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>regulations</b> of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in {{chronic fatigue syndrome}}.

RESULTS: Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome had normal salivary free cortisol profiles but showed enhanced and prolonged suppression of salivary free cortisol after the administration of 0. 5 mg of dexamethasone in comparison to the control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced negative feedback of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis could be a plausible explanation for the previously described alterations in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the transcription factors Oct 4, Sox 2, and Nanog is commonly associated with pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} cells exhibiting a low Nanog level are more likely to undergo differentiation. Applying a novel mathematical transcription factor network model we explore mechanisms and <b>feedback</b> <b>regulations</b> to describe the observed variation of the Nanog levels in mouse ES cells. In particular we show that these variations can occur under different assumptions yielding similar experimental characteristics. Based on model predictions we propose experimental strategies to distinguish between these explanations. Concluding from our results we argue that the heterogeneity with respect to the Nanog concentrations is most likely a functional element to control the differentiation propensity of an ES cell population.

Here we report that OspF potentiates the activation of the MAPK JNK and the transcription factor NF-kappaB during S. flexneri infection. This unexpected effect of OspF was dependent on the phosphothreonine lyase activity of OspF on p 38, and resulted from the disruption of a negative <b>feedback</b> loop <b>regulation</b> between p 38 and TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK 1), mediated via the phosphorylation of TAK 1 -binding protein 1.
