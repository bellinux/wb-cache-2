Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime.</b> Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

This changed when, on 29 April 2008, Aziz went on trial over the deaths of a group of 42 merchants who were {{executed}} by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> in 1992, after the merchants had been charged by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> with manipulating food prices when Iraq was under international sanctions.|$|E

25|$|Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani {{were engaged}} in heavy {{fighting}} against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. The First Iraqi–Kurdish War (1961–1970) led to a stalemate and in March 1970 Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> started an Arabization program in the oil-rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Iraq had {{the largest}} air force in the region even after the long Iran–Iraq War. The air force at that time had 934 combat {{aircraft}} in its inventory. Theoretically, the IQAF should have been 'hardened' by the conflict with Iran, but post-war purges of the IQAF leadership and other personnel decimated the air force, as the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> struggled {{to bring it back}} under total control. Training was brought to a minimum during the whole of 1990.|$|E

25|$|The water {{diversion}} {{plan for the}} Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes {{was accompanied by a}} series of propaganda articles by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> directed against the Ma'dan, and the wetlands were systematically converted into a desert, forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes became completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes dramatically shrank. Furthermore, villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned.|$|E
25|$|As an {{international}} coalition under United States command assembled {{in anticipation of}} an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi Kurds {{may be seen}} in two ways. The {{first and}} the most common way is to view the Kurds as victims, both of the central {{government}} in Iraq and of neighbouring powers – particularly Turkey. The second opposing position is to see them as an agent provocateur, acting as proxy forces for states opposed to the incumbent <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime.</b> This polarised notion of their status may be too simplistic, when one considers that there are opposing agendas within Iraqi Kurdistan with regard to issues such as the relationship with Turkey, nationalist aspirations and relations globally.|$|E

25|$|The MEK {{philosophy}} mixes Marxism and Islam. Formed in the 1960s, {{the organization}} was an attempt in bridging Islam and Marxism to offer a revolutionary brand of Islam. It was expelled from Iran after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and its primary support came from the former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> of Saddam Hussein starting in the late 1980s. The MEK conducted anti-Western attacks prior to the Revolution. Since then, it has conducted terrorist attacks against {{the interests of the}} clerical regime in Iran and abroad. The MEK advocates the overthrow of the Iranian regime and its replacement with the group’s own leadership.|$|E
25|$|Under Ould Taya, {{discrimination}} against the Afro-Mauritanian population became more pronounced. Thousands {{were forced to}} flee to Senegal and Mali. In {{the armed forces and}} the civil service, human rights abuses were common and many were killed. The last years of Ould Taya's rule were marred by unrest within the military and hostility between the regime and the country's Islamists. Ould Taya's harsh response to the religious opposition triggered criticisms from abroad. Ould Taya also moved away from his support of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> of Saddam Hussein {{at the time of the}} 1991 Gulf War, and moved towards the West. In late 1999, Mauritania established full diplomatic relations with Israel, becoming only the third Arab country to do so. In doing so, he had at some point formally ended a declared war on Israel that dated from the 1967 Six-Day War. Ould Taya's close ties with Israel and the United States served to deepen the opposition to his rule.|$|E
25|$|Kurds make {{up around}} 17% of Iraq's population. They are the {{majority}} {{in at least three}} provinces in Northern Iraq which are known as Iraqi Kurdistan.

There are around 300,000 Kurds living in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, 50,000 in the city of Mosul and around 100,000 Kurds living elsewhere in Southern Iraq. Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. In March 1970, Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> started an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin. The peace agreement did not last long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds. Moreover, in March 1975, Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord, according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds. Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly those around Kirkuk. Between 1975 and 1978, two-hundred thousand Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq.|$|E
