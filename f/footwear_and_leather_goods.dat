50|$|About 500 {{companies}} in the Dominican Republic manufacture goods primarily for the North American market. Situated in 50 industrial free zones around the country, these mostly foreign-owned corporations take advantage of generous tax and other financial inducements offered {{by the government to}} businesses that operate within the zones. Approximately 200,000 people, or about 8 percent of the workforce, are employed in this sector. They mostly produce clothing, electronic components, <b>footwear,</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods,</b> which are assembled. The raw materials or semi-manufactured goods are usually imported duty-free from other developing countries (electronic parts are imported from industrialized Puerto Rico) and put together in the free zones. Products created are cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, textiles, perfumes & foodstuffs. The value of exports amounted to US$1.9 billion in 1996, but the contribution to the trade balance was only US$520 million because many of the basic materials for the free zones had to be imported and paid for.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1980s {{the economy}} of the region has been radically transformed, without however repudiating its rural past. Many of the small craft {{workshops}} scattered throughout the rural settlements have modernised and become small businesses, some of which have become major brands known all over the world (Indesit, Tod's, Guzzini, Teuco). This evolution led to the emergence of 'specialised' industrial areas, which are still profitable: <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> in a large area straddling the provinces of Macerata and Fermo; furniture in the Pesaro area in particular; household appliances and textile industry in the province of Ancona, in which the main engineering companies are also to be found (including ship building, petrochemicals and paper, as well as consumer durables). The city of Castelfidardo remains an important centre for the production of musical instruments, the accordion in particular.

40|$|Retail {{is now a}} {{significant}} part of the UK economy, accounting for £ 256 billion in sales and one-third of all consumer spending (Skillsmart, 2007). Indeed, it is the largest private sector employer in the UK, employing three million workers, or 1 in 10 of the working population. Retail though should not be seen in a homogenous manner and it should be recognized that retail work is highly variable. This variability can exist at a number of levels, for example by sub-sector and size of organization. With regard to sub-sectors, when broken down by 4 -digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) descriptors the ‘retail sector’ totals 24 sub-sectors in the UK (Skillsmart, 2007). The variability between sub-sectors may be especially true with regard to the labour markets from which organisations seek employees and the skill demands of employers in the various sub-sector. With regard to that latter point Hart et al (2007 : 272) note how skill requirements may not be homogenous across the whole sector and consequently ‘…little is understood about which specific skills are important to different retailers; whether and how the skills need differ for multiple or SMEs, or for different employee groups; and the extent to which retail employers meet these requirements’. The research reported in this paper aims to address this issue by providing an analysis of the labour supply and skills demands for the sub-sectors of clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods.</b> Recognition of the potential differences between sub-sectors is important to consider how issues of labour supply and skills demands may vary between sub-sectors. In particular, the paper argues that different sub-sectors will draw upon different segments of the labour market and that the product being sold will also have an impact on the skills required by employers. Buchanan et al. (2003) for example develop a continuum which ranges from goods which ‘sell themselves’ to those that ‘need to be sold’. The paper draws on a survey of 173 clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> retailers in the Greater Manchester area undertaken as part of a broader comparative project with teams from Australia and Sweden. The results from the survey affirm a number of the findings from earlier research assessing employer skills demands in retail (Bunt et al., 2005; Nickson et al., 2005). For example, Manchester employers were concerned with the softer skills of applicants, such that having the ‘right’ attitude and appearance was considered essential to do front-line work. However, whilst there were a number of similarities with previous research assessing retail employers skill demands there were also revealing differences arising from the Manchester survey. For example, employers in the Manchester clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> sub-sectors indicated an increased demand for product knowledge in their front line staff. The paper considers these differences to develop an analysis of the need to recognize the distinctiveness of sub-sectors within retail. In considering the segmented nature of the retail labour market the paper argues that clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> retailers are less likely to suffer from labour shortages as there is greater cachet working in these areas compared to other parts of the retail sector. Thus the paper contributes to on-going debates about labour supply and skills demands in retail, whilst also offering some support for the notion of a ‘labour aristocracy’ (Warhurst and Nickson, 2007) in certain parts of the service economy...|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{interest}} of buyers {{has opened up}} an opportunity for <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> industries of Bangladesh.

40|$|If, as Adam Smith once famously suggested, Britain was {{a nation}} of shopkeepers then it is now {{a nation of}} shopworkers. Retail is now a {{significant}} part of the UK economy, accounting for £ 256 billion in sales and one-third of all consumer spending (Skillsmart, 2007). It is the largest private sector employer in the UK, employing 3 m workers, or 1 in 10 of the working population. For future job creation in the UK economy retail is also similarly prominent and the sector is expected to create a further 250, 000 jobs to 2014 (Skillsmart, 2007). The centrality of retail to economic success and job creation is apparent in other advanced economies. For example, within the US, retail sales is the occupation with the largest projected job growth in the period 2004 - 2014 (Gatta et al., 2009) and in Australia retail accounts for 1 in 6 workers (Buchanan et al., 2003). Within the UK these workers are employed in approximately 290, 000 businesses, encompassing large and small organizations and also a number of sub-sectors. This variance suggests that retail should not be regarded as homogenous in its labour demands. Hart et al. (2007) note how skill requirements and the types of workers employed may differ across the sector. This chapter further opens up this point, providing an analysis of the labour supply and skills demands for the sub-sectors of clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods,</b> which are described by Skillsmart (2007 : 48) as being 'significant categories in UK retailing'...|$|E

40|$|M. A. (Information Science) The {{first part}} of the study is a {{literature}} review which indicate that small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) represent an important vehicle to address the challenges of job creation, economic growth and equity. Modern economy is driven by innovations and knowledge. Transforming information resources into knowledge and maximise the value of knowledge is the new challenge in achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Information resources are needed by small businesses as much as their larger counter parts but small businesses are usually in a disadvantaged position in terms of finance and expertise. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer small businesses new opportunities in the information economy. Exciting ICT applications such as Web portals provide platforms for business communities to share information and communicate more efficiently than ever. Such information resources enable small businesses to react faster and adapt better to the changing global market. The stimulation of SMMEs must be seen as part of an integrated strategy to develop the society to a higher level. The research findings of this study provide all stakeholders in small business development in South Africa including government, industries and academics a better understanding and practical guideline for delivering information resources to small business owners and managers and the design of information portals that can address the information needs of small businesses in South Africa. The empirical components that follow the literature review comprised a questionnaire survey. The survey focused on non-franchised small businesses in the retail industry in the greater Johannesburg metropolitan. A total of 150 questionnaires completed by small business owners and managers were used for statistic analysis in this research. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: business biographic information, business information and agencies, information and communication technologies usage, and community and portal activities. The survey results revealed valuable insights and trends in the use of ICTs and attitudes towards information sharing amongst small business owners and managers. Textile, clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> were the most popular trade for the small businesses use in the survey. Nearly all respondents prefer English for business communication and the businesses are typically owner manager with a small number of employees.. Infrastructure for ICTs is in place for small businesses, but the usage level is still basic. Short message service (SMS) and e-mail are the most commonly used leT tools. Traditional media such as television, radio, newspapers and magazines remain the most important source of information for these small business owners and managers. Younger businesses adapt better to ICTs than the older businesses. Despite a mixed attitude towards sharing business information, small business owners and managers showed a high level of interest in networking with other businesses, in particular with potential customers and suppliers. Most respondents do not belong to any professional or industrial organisation primarily because they were not aware of these organisations. Based on the literature review and the empirical research, the final conclusion that was made from this research is that Web community information portals can, to a great extent, promote the use of information resources for small businesses in South Africa. The results from this research give a better understanding and are useful guidelines to stakeholders in small business development in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|The global fashion {{market is}} an {{increasingly}} desirable industry sector for many marketers. The apparel and textile industry, in particular, {{is one of}} the largest and most globalised industries worldwide. The fashion industry is experiencing significant change due to clothing retailers transforming into transnational businesses, thereby increasing the availability of clothing fashion brands in more countries worldwide. In South Africa, the fashion retail industry is experiencing a proliferation of international brands, which makes it increasingly challenging for national brands to compete with international brands. Owing to this intensifying competition in the fashion industry, the need for effective differentiation, such as branding, is becoming even more significant. Specifically, effective brand management is required to build and maintain a strong brand. Strategic brand management is a key component of a company’s marketing strategy, which focuses on achieving the planned strategic marketing goals such as creating brand identification and establishing strong brand associations with consumers. Owing to the increasingly important role of building strong brands and becoming the preferred brand amongst consumers and capturing consumers’ loyalty, fashion marketers and retailers, have to focus on creating brand equity, which involves the development and implementation of various marketing activities. Brand equity refers to a set of either benefits or liabilities linked to the brand, the brand name and brand symbol, which can add to or detract from the value of the product or service provided to the consumer. For the Generation Y cohort, individuals born between 1986 and 2005, branded clothing plays an immense role in their purchasing behaviour. In South Africa, the African portion of the country’s Generation Y cohort (referred to as the black Generation Y cohort) amounted to 84 percent in 2014, rendering the cohort an important market segment. Those with a university degree are likely to be of specific interest to marketers given that having a tertiary qualification is generally linked to a higher future earning potential and higher social status in a community. The significant growth of the South African textile, clothing, <b>footwear</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> retail industry and the intensifying competition, combined with the significance of the black Generation Y students market, emphasises the need to understand this lucrative market’s brand perceptions. The primary objective of this study was to propose and empirically test a model that measures the extent to which selected marketing activities influence clothing brand equity amongst black Generation Y students within the South African context. The sampling frame consisted of a list of the 26 registered South African public HEIs, which included 11 traditional universities, nine comprehensive universities and six universities of technology. From the sampling frame, a non-probability judgement sample of three HEI campuses situated in the Gauteng province was selected. Of these, one is a traditional university, one a university of technology and one a comprehensive university. Thereafter, a single cross-sectional non-probability convenience sample of 750 full-time undergraduate black Generation Y students aged between 18 and 24 was taken. A structured self-administered questionnaire was utilised to gather the required data for this study. The questionnaire includes a scale measuring participants’ perceptions of different marketing activities and a scale measuring participants’ perceptions of different brand equity dimensions, including brand awareness, perceived quality, brand associations, brand loyalty and overall brand equity. The captured data was analysed using descriptive statistics analysis, correlation analysis and structural equation modelling. As per the structural equation modelling, the proposed model suggests that pricing activities, product activities, store image activities and advertising activities have a direct positive influence on brand awareness, brand associations, perceived quality, brand loyalty and overall brand equity of clothing brands. The findings of this study provide insight into which marketing activities are effective in creating brand equity, how these marketing activities are linked to the brand equity dimensions and how they can be manipulated to generate and maintain strong brand equity amongst the black Generation Y market segment in South Africa.
