5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> <b>and</b> had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> <b>and</b> had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E

Such signals, which featured a large round target with up to eight amber-colored lights <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> one in the center, could be lit in various patterns to convey different meanings, were more visible in fog, and remained effective even when one light in a row was inoperative.|$|E

50|$|This game {{is popular}} even today amongst the {{children}}. Both {{boys and girls}} play it. Children sit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> child who has cloth in hand goes around the circle-singing: It {{is a kind of}} warning for the children sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> not to look back. The cloth is then dropped at the back of a child. If it is discovered before the child who had placed it there had completed the round, the child who discovered the cloth would run after him and try to touch him with it till he sits in the place vacated by the one who had discovered the cloth.|$|R

25|$|By {{examining}} the common solutions of the equations of two spheres, {{it can be}} seen that two spheres intersect <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> the plane containing that circle is called the radical plane of the intersecting spheres. Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no real point in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, injera compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> {{used as a}} base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} smooth texture, while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the injera to be a good bread to scoop up sauces and dishes.|$|E
25|$|The Simba Lounge is {{set aside}} for first class passengers. Its {{interiors}} celebrate the richness and beauty of unique elements of pan-African culture and heritage in a contemporary setting, using a palette of carefully selected local artworks, materials, artefacts and textiles. The lounge represents a world-class experience carefully planned with appropriate amenities, for example: an exclusive smoking zone, an enclosed VIP sitting area and baby changing units. Just as the village elders sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> shared a traditional beverage and discussed matters, the lounge’s focal feature is its central circular banquette seating, where guests from different backgrounds can meet and converse.|$|E

25|$|The spinner dolphin feeds {{mainly on}} small mesopelagic fish, squids, and sergestid shrimps, and will dive 200–300 m {{to feed on}} them. Spinner {{dolphins}} of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches. They swim around the prey <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the short-finned pilot whale. They are susceptible to parasites, both external ones like barnacles and remoras, and internal ones, like nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.|$|E
25|$|In current Latter-day Saint temple practice, the {{endowment}} ritual contains a prayer circle, where some participants stand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> repeat a prayer {{given by a}} single person. A year after Joseph Smith established the temple endowment in 1843, he extended the privilege to women, who could then participate in the prayer circle and Anointed Quorum. After 1846, it was uncommon for women to participate in prayer circles without their husbands. Under Eliza R. Snow's guidance, some women made women-only prayer circles. In 1896, the first presidency advised against Relief Society prayer circles, but some Relief Societies continued the practice. In 1978, the First Presidency discontinued all prayer circles except those performed in a temple as part of {{the endowment}}. Since members of prayer circles had to be approved by the first presidency, continuing this tradition in a worldwide church made for unwieldy paperwork.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Book I of Euclid's Elements {{dealt with}} {{equality}} of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician Archimedes used {{the tools of}} Euclidean geometry {{to show that the}} area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book Measurement of a Circle. (The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubling method, in which he inscribed a regular triangle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular hexagon, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with circumscribed polygons).|$|E

25|$|Thor is {{a superb}} hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat, excelling {{in the use}} of the war hammer, sword, axe and mace. Thor {{possesses}} two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's strength and endurance while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast (which taps into Thor's life force, and has even forced Galactus to flee), the Thermo-blast, and the Anti-Force (which counteracts another force). Using Mjolnir by throwing it in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle's leather loop, Thor can fly at supersonic speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel faster than light in space. He can also use the hammer to create a barrier by letting it spin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> <b>and</b> even managed to contain an explosion powerful enough to destroy a 1/5th of the universe, although at the cost of his own life. He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere by using his strength, and throw his hammer to Asgard from which it will return.|$|E

It was 19 inches in circumference. We afterwards saw others apparently much larger, and Mr. Low, while wandering in search of flowers, came upon one in which was a drowned rat.|$|E
500|$|Small {{whales are}} known to engage in complex play behaviour, which {{includes}} such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or [...] "bubble rings". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air {{into the water and}} allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Some believe this is a means of communication. Whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of foraging.|$|E
500|$|The {{people of}} Brook Farm {{spent most of}} their time either {{studying}} or working the farm, but they always set aside time in the day for play. In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Every week everyone in the community would gather at The Hive for a dance of the young ladies of the community. They would wear wreaths of wild daisies on top of their heads, and each week a special wreath, bought from a florist, would be given to the best dressed girl. At the end of every day, many performed a [...] "symbol of Universal Unity", in which they stood <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> joined hands and vowed for [...] "truth to the cause of God and Humanity".|$|E
