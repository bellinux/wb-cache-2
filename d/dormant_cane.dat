40|$|A {{factorial}} design {{was used to}} vary leaf canopy structure of mature Pinot noir grapevines during two consecutive seasons: shoot tipping at full bloom (yes or no), lateral shoot length (no laterals, laterals cut back to 4 leaves at full bloom, laterals allowed to grow undisturbed) and cluster zone leaf removal (leaf removal in the cluster zone or no leaf removal). Shoot tipping at bloom had the greatest effect on yield components, fruit composition, and vegetative growth. Tipping increased percent fruit set, berries per cluster, cluster weight, and yield to pruning ratio in both seasons. Shoot tip removal increased early shoot growth in the second season, main and lateral leaf size, and the contribution of lateral leaves to total leaf area. Tipping decreased the number of shoots per vine in the second season, clusters per vine in both seasons, must soluble solids, total amount of sugar exported with fruit harvest, leaf area per vine, pruning weight, and cane weight and length at mid-ripening. Increasing lateral shoot length increased must soluble solids in both seasons and <b>dormant</b> <b>cane</b> diameter the following winter. Vines with long laterals had lower yield to pruning ratios in the first season. Percent fruit set increased only {{in the absence of}} vegetative growing tips, either from the main or from lateral shoots. Leaf removal in the cluster zone four weeks after bloom had no impact on yield components but reduced must soluble solids in both seasons. It also reduced yield to pruning ratios in the first season and <b>dormant</b> <b>cane</b> diameter in the second season. Non-structural carbohydrate concentration in the permanent structure was not affected by any of the treatments but total content in the trunk increased with increasing lateral shoot length...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and persistence of stolbur phytoplasmas were investigated in grapevines affected by “bois noir ” (BN). The phy-toplasma was detected using nested-PCR from different plant tissues.

40|$|Graduation date: 1960 More than {{one-fourth of}} the forest land in the Pacific Northwest is growing timber at reduced {{capacity}} {{as the result of}} brush encroachment. Increasing use of chemicals in brush control requires that more information be available regarding their use. Bigleaf maple, Oregon oak and vine maple are among the more noxious brush species in the Willamette Valley area. This thesis summarizes the progress which has been made in the control of these species by the Forest Research Division. Aerial sprays have been found satisfactory in many areas for broadcast spraying of low brush cover. Basal sprays and ground level foliage sprays are used on weed trees and tall brush. Topography is also a major consideration in choice of method. Effectiveness of the herbicide is determined by climate, season, species, specific chemical, formulation, diluent, concentration, and many unknown factors. Most of the treatments in this project were applied to individual stems. Many of the tests were established in order to find the most effective chemical for a given situation; others expand on information gained in earlier trials. On large trees, applications were made both basally and in frills; also in bands around the boles at breast height with paste type herbicides. Smaller shrubs were treated with foliage sprays, <b>dormant</b> <b>cane</b> sprays, and individual stem sprays. The treatments were located on Bureau of Land Management land near Scio, Oregon, and in the McDonald Forest. Aerial spray projects conducted by the Bureau of Land Management in the Cascades and in the Coast Range have been included in these observations. Bigleaf maple was killed very successfully with basal sprays of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in oil in a mixture of 32 ahg. It is very likely that much lower dosages will prove adequate. Maple stems up to eight inches d. b. h. were well controlled with 2, 4, 5 -T applied in a similar manner. Girdling has not proved to be an adequate method of control because of basal resprouting and delayed top-kill. Frilling followed with a dilute spray (22 ahg) of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in kerosene gave good control. However, the cost of application is higher than for a similar basal spray. Paste herbicides were largely rather ineffective except for kilbrush applied in September. Oregon oak has proven more difficult to kill with basal sprays than maple. However, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and 2, 4 -D amine in frills have both provided complete top killing. 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) gave the better sprout control. Kilbrush gave good results on small stems when applied in August. Scarification of the bark prior to treatment proved to be the most dependable method. Vine maple has been top-killed by 2, 4, 5 -T, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and brushkiller mixtures in many forms and concentrations. Sprouting has not been controlled completely by any of these but 2, 4, 5 -T is the most effective in this respect. Aerial sprays of four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T in some cases have caused nearly complete top-kill, and considerable sprout retardation. Snowbrush has been completely killed by 2, 4, 5 -T with foliage and with step sprays. A Bureau of Land Management aerial spray project using four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T gave 100 per cent kill of this species. Cherry, elderberry, thimbleberry, poison oak and madrone can be effectively top-killed with 2, 4, 5 -T as basal or foliage spray. Sprout control has been relatively poor on most of these species. Grass competition to young seedlings can be reduced with several chemicals. Tree survival is consistently higher, however, when the minimum amount of grass herbicide is applied which will reduce grass density to approximately 60 per cent of normal. Soil sterilization reduces tree survival. The use of herbicides as a forest management tool has increased rapidly in recent years. Public acceptance of the value of this tool and further refinements in techniques can provide much needed relief for the brush problem in out forests...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable grape {{production}} {{entails the}} implementation of management practices that control weeds, maintain grapevine performance, and conserve soil quality. Conventional weed management practices include herbicide application and/or cultivation. These practices compromise soil quality by limiting additions of organic matter and exposing the soil surface, thereby leaving it prone to degradative processes. With the expansion of continental climate viticulture in areas with rain-fed agriculture, {{such as in the}} Midwest, {{there is a need for}} sustainable weed management practices that optimize production while conserving soil quality. The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate weed management practices in an established midwestern vineyard. Sub-objectives of the investigation addressed within individual experiments include: 1) comparing conventional and alternative weed management practices on weed control, grapevine performance, and soil quality, and 2) evaluating the influence of irrigation on grapevine growth and development, grown with and without a living mulch, on mitigation of water competition. An additional objective of this investigation was to survey Iowa fruit growers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and awareness of weed management practices that conserve soil resources. In the first experiment, two conventional and two alternative weed management strategies were compared in an established Iowan vineyard with `Marychal Foch 2 ̆ 7 grapevines (Vitis rupestris Scheele yvinifera L.). Treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design and included: 1) cultivation, 2) herbicide application, 3) straw mulch, and 4) a living mulch of creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. `Pennlawn 2 ̆ 7). Straw and living mulches controlled weed populations and grapevine yield did not differ among the treatments. <b>Dormant</b> <b>cane</b> pruning weights and fruit quality were lowest in cultivated and straw mulch plots, respectively. Mulched plots had greater water-filled pore space and water content, as well as faster infiltration rates. No differences in chemical soil quality attributes were observed. Although earthworm populations were greater in straw mulch plots, no differences in soil enzymatic activity were found. Results from the experiment demonstrate straw and living mulches reduce weed populations, maintain grapevine productivity, and improve several indicators of soil quality. The effects of living mulches, with and without irrigation, on grapevine growth and development were measured in the second experiment. Data were collected from an established vineyard in Iowa with `Reliance 2 ̆ 7 and `Swenson Red 2 ̆ 7 grapevines (Vitus labrusca L.) planted in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were replicated eight times and included: 1) herbicide application without irrigation, 2) herbicide application with irrigation, 3) living mulch without irrigation, and 4) living mulch with irrigation. The living mulch treatment was a mixture of shade-tolerant creeping red and Chewings fescue [Festuca rubra L. `Foxy 2 ̆ 7 and F. rubra var. fallax (Thuill.) Hack. `Ambrose, 2 ̆ 7 respectively]. Supplemental irrigation was provided via drip irrigation and scheduling regimes were based on fescue evapotranspiration. Living mulches and irrigation had no consistent effect on grapevine growth and development, suggesting little-to-no competition existed between the grapevines and living mulches during the period in which the study was conducted. When compared to both herbicide-treated plots, living mulches reduced weed populations and promoted several indicators of soil quality. Results from both experiments demonstrate the alternative practices of straw and living mulches control weeds, maintain grapevine performance, and may be viable alternatives to vineyard weed management that promotes soil quality within the Midwest. While results from the experiments suggest alternative weed management practices may contribute to the sustainability of a weed management system, grower receptiveness to alternative practices is important when planning future extension-education programs and advancing soil-quality awareness. Within a survey of twenty-two Iowa fruit growers, all survey participants were aware of soil quality and considered the quality of their soils when making land management decisions. Most were aware of alternative weed management practices, yet were uncertain about the outcome of implementing alternative practices within their own production systems. To further advance the awareness and adoption of soil-quality concepts and alternative weed management practices, respectively, future extension programs should focus on educating growers how weed management decisions can impact both crop productivity and soil quality...|$|E
40|$|First online: 30 October 2012 One of {{the most}} {{important}} viticultural characteristics of a grapevine rootstock is the ability to form roots on <b>dormant</b> lignified <b>canes</b> (rootstrike). North American species of Vitis are the primary source of germplasm for grapevine rootstocks and vary widely in their rate of rootstrike. Breeders have hybridized grape species in order to introgress traits to produce commercial rootstocks. A combination of 26 parents consisting of improved and wild accessions of Vitis spp. was used to generate 27 families. The percentage of rootstrike of <b>dormant</b> <b>canes</b> was observed over several years for 552 individuals. A logistic generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) method was used to estimate the narrow sense heritability (h 2) of rootstrike. Heritability was found to be moderate (h 2 [*]=[*] 0. 307 [*]±[*] 0. 050). The model also estimated breeding values of all parents and progeny. A GLMM method can be used to estimate breeding values of germplasm to identify individuals with commercially acceptable rates of rootstrike with a defined probability of transmitting this trait to progeny. This is useful for the introgression of traits into potentially new commercial rootstocks. The pattern of normal distribution of rooting indicates {{that it is possible to}} identify individuals with good rootstrike from Vitis species that are generally considered to have low rootstrike. Selection of individuals with a higher breeding value will increase the efficiency of rootstock breeding. Brady P. Smith, Matthew S. Wheal, Tim H. Jones, Norma B. Morales and Peter R.

40|$|Grapevine {{production}} has been endangered by several diseases against which control methods are not available.

These pathogens systemically infect their hosts, thus the use of healthy propagating material is {{a key factor in}} the prevention of disease development. Selection of pathogen-free plant material can be achieved by testing for the presence of pathogens.

40|$|The {{formation}} of inflorescence primordia (IP) marks {{an important step}} in the reproductive cycle of grapevines. The development of an IP to a grape bunch occurs over the course of two growing seasons. During season one, an IP initiates from a group of uncommitted cells, termed an anlage, where initiation is thought to occur around the time of flowering. Further branching and development of IP continues until the onset of winter dormancy. During spring of the following season, branching of IP resumes and each branch terminates in a floral identity, where each floral identity has the potential to form a berry. Inflorescence primordia initiation and development is sensitive to carbohydrate (CHO) availability and temperature. This thesis explores the influence of CHO availability and temperature during IP initiation and their continued development the following season. An inflorescence or bunch has two main components: the inner and outer arm. For the purpose of this thesis, inflorescence or bunch architecture is defined by the type of structure occurring at the outer arm position: and outer arm with floral identities; a tendril; or no structure. While the inner arm is required for an inflorescence structure to occur, development of the outer arm to a floral bearing structure does not always occur. Although initiation of the inner and outer arm likely occurs at the same time, the development of the outer arm into a floral bearing structure is frequently delayed compared to its inner arm structure. The causes and consequences of delayed outer arm formation on yield and grape composition at harvest are also addressed in this thesis. The effect of restricting CHO availability to IP during their second season of development was achieved by pre-budbreak (BB) cane girdling. First, it was established that pre-BB cane girdling alters the CHO availability to developing shoots and IP structures (Chapter 3. 1). Canes were girdled 5, 10 or 20 cm from the terminal bud of the cane and shoot growth of the terminal bud was monitored over a single growing season. A linear relationship was found between the initial rate of shoot growth and the amount of cane isolated by the girdle. A decrease in available CHOs during initial shoot growth appeared to inhibit the shoot’s ability to produce new vegetative nodes past the point of discontinuity. This resulted in a decrease in total leaf area due to incomplete leaf expansion. The transition of the vine’s dependence on reserve CHOs to a net positive state appeared to occur when shoot growth reached a steady state. In the case of severe CHO restriction, no lateral growth occurred, suggesting the CHO status of the vine {{may play a role in}} lateral bud growth. The cross sectional area of canes or shoots were shown to have a linear relationship to their CHO content, which allowed for an estimation of the amount of CHOs required to obtain growth similar to the Control treatment. Additionally, main shoot leaf area can be used to predict total CHO content in the shoot at harvest. In the same experiment, the dates of flowering, flower number, berry number and grape berry soluble solids (SS) were measured for the inner and outer arm components of the basal and apical inflorescence and bunches separately (Chapter 3. 2). Restricting pre-BB CHOs resulted in the abortion of some pre-formed inflorescences and reduced branching of the inflorescences that did develop. In general, berry SS were greatest for the basal inner arm, followed by those of the apical bunch inner arm, then those of the basal bunch outer arm, then lastly by those of the apical bunch outer arm. However, this was influenced by the relative berry numbers between the inner and outer arm. Bunches with more similar berry numbers on the inner and outer arms had more synchronous flowering and uniform SS. The differences in SS were largely a reflection of the timing of flowering of the various inflorescence components and may be an important source of variation in SS within a vine at harvest. The effects of girdling shoots and / or periodic leaf removal post fruit set on the initiation and development of IP was studied (Chapter 4). Dormant latent buds from treatment shoots (shoot node positions one to ten) were grown as single node cuttings (SNCs). Inflorescence number per SNC and their architecture were scored for every SNC. Girdling increased the proportion of SNC basal bunches with an outer arm, but had no effect on the number if inflorescence structures per bud (fruitfulness). However, there was a decrease in fruitfulness per bud and in the proportion of SNC basal inflorescences with an outer arm when girdled shoots had their leaves removed at zero and four weeks post fruit set respectively. This chapter presents novel information regarding the timing of IP initiation, including the initiation and development of the outer arm. As well, for the first time, the {{formation of}} an outer arm is shown to be sensitive to girdling and / or leaf removal. The influence of temperature during IP initiation on the resulting fruitfulness, distribution and architecture over the course of two consecutive growing seasons, at a single vineyard (2 -Cane, 4 -Cane and Spur pruning) was studied (Chapter 5). The pruning system had no effect on the fruitfulness per bud, or on the resulting bunch architecture. Warmer temperatures during IP initiation were correlated to: an increase in fruitfulness; an increase in the occurrence of an outer arm; and a decrease in the basal bunch insertion point on a shoot. As well, an increase in cane cross sectional area correlated to an increase in the average fruitfulness per shoot along a cane, where the influence of cane cross sectional area on fruitfulness was consistent between seasons. Additionally, an increase in cane cross sectional area correlated to an increase in the average occurrence of an outer arm per shoot along a cane, where the influence of cane cross sectional area was greater when temperatures during IP initiation were cooler. Temperatures during winter dormancy and BB were altered to determine its influence on the timing of BB and the branching of IP structures (Chapter 6). Winter dormant buds were passively heated using plastic heating chambers for different periods during dormancy to BB. Heating buds from either July or August to BB advanced the date of BB and the start date of flowering for the basal inner arm component by 14 and 16 days respectively compared to the Control treatment. Heating buds during winter dormancy had no effect on the fruitfulness of buds, the distribution of inflorescence structures on shoots or on the identity of the structure occurring at the outer arm position. However, elevated bud temperatures 12 days pre-BB caused a statistically significant decrease in the flower number per shoot (P < 0. 05). Additionally, it was found that any delay in the start of flowering (which can be influenced by the date of BB, the position of the inflorescence on the shoot and / or the inflorescence component in question) is reflected in the accumulation of SS at harvest. The influence of temperature during IP initiation and CHO availability during BB were combined in a final experiment to improve the ability to predict when IP is occurring (Chapter 7). In this experiment, the influence of temperatures during IP initiation on fruitfulness and inflorescence architecture was studied between vineyards from separate growing regions throughout New Zealand. Winter <b>dormant</b> <b>canes</b> were harvested from each vineyard, and nodes three and ten were grown as SNCs. The volume of the SNC, inflorescence number, the position of the bunch on the SNC shoot and the occurrence of an outer arm were recorded. Inflorescence number and the occurrence of an outer arm increased as the volume of the SNC increased. The timing of IP initiation was predicted using stepwise regressions from 80 days pre to 90 days post 50 % flowering with a variable window of time. Regressions of average daily temperature during IP initiation versus bunch number and versus the occurrence of an outer arm resulted in a linear continuum between node three and node ten for both bunch number (R²= 0. 73) and the occurrence of an outer arm (R²= 0. 47). The results also indicate that the use of 50 % flowering as a reference point to calculate IP initiation is a valid alternative to destructively sampling buds to determine bud fruitfulness and IP architecture. This thesis provides an understanding of two of the major factors affecting bunch architecture, specifically outer arm development, which are temperature and CHO availability. The results indicate that temperature is likely the major factor influencing bunch architecture. Whereas CHO availability is a modifying factor, and is likely not to be an issue in New Zealand where grapevines are rarely CHO stressed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{an attempt}} to combat some of the {{pathogens}} {{that are associated with}} trunk diseases and disorders of grapevines, research in this thesis focused on the taxonomy and pathological aspects of Coniellai/Pilidiella, Botryosphaeria and Phomopsis spp. Previously, conidial pigmentation was used to separate Pilidiella from Coniella. Recently, however, the two genera have been regarded as synonymous, with the older name, Coniella, having priority. The most important species in the Coniellai/Pilidiella complex of grapevines is C. diplodiella (Speg.) Petr. & Syd., the causal organism of white rot of grapevines. Previous studies found it difficult to distinguish between C. diplodiella and C. fragariae (Oudem.) B. Sutton, which is known to occur in soil and caused leaf diseases of Fragaria and Eucalyptus. Both these species have previously been reported from South Africa. None of the reports on C. diplodiella could be scientifically substantiated; therefore it is still a quarantine organism. However, this status has been questioned. Based on sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1, ITS 2), 5. 8 S gene, large subunit (LSU) and elongation factor 1 - α gene (EF l- α) from the type species of Pilidiella and Coniella, Coniella was separated from Pilidiella, with the majority of taxa residing in Pilidiella. Pilidiella is characterised by species with hyaline to pale brown conidia (avg. length: width > 1. 5), with Coniella having dark brown conidia (avg. length: width ≤ 1. 5). Pilidiella diplodiella, previously C. diplodiella, causal organism of white rot of grapevines, was shown to be an older name for C. petrakii. This fungus is present in South Africa and is therefore no longer of quarantine importance. Based on analyses of the histone (H 3) gene sequences of isolates in the P. diplodiella species complex, P. diplodiella was separated from a newly described species, P. diplodiopsis. A new species, P. eucalyptorum, is proposed for isolates formerly treated as C. fragariae, associated with leaf spots of Eucalyptus spp. This species clustered basal to Pilidiella, and may represent yet a third genus within this complex. Pilidiella destruens was newly described as anamorph of Schizoparme destruens, which is associated with twig dieback of Eucalyptus spp. in Hawaii. The genus Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. are known to be cosmopolitan, with broad host ranges and geographical distributions. Several saprotrophic species have been reported from grapevines, while others are severe pathogens of this host. These species include B. dothidea (Moug. : Fr.) Ces. & De Not., B. parva Pennycook & Samuels, B. obtusa (Schwein.) Shoemaker, B. stevensii Shoemaker, B. lutea A. J. L. Phillips and B. ribis Grossenb. & Duggar. Species reported from South Africa as grapevine pathogens are B. obtusa, B. dothidea, B. ribis and B. vitis (Schulzer) Sacco. In the present study, morphological, DNA sequence data (ITS 1, 5. 8 S, ITS 2 and EFI-α) and pathological data were used to distinguish 11 Botryosphaeria spp. associated with grapevines from South Africa {{and other parts of the}} world. Botryosphaeria australis, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina and a Diplodia sp. were confirmed from grapevines in South Africa, while Diplodia porosum, Fusicoccum viticlavatum and F. vitifusiforme were described as new species. Although isolates of B. dothidea and B. stevensii were confirmed from grapevines in Portugal, neither of these species, nor B. ribis, were isolated in this study. All grapevine isolates from Portugal, formerly presumed to be B. rib is, are identified as B. parva based on EF 1 -α sequence data. Artificial inoculations on grapevine shoots showed that B. australis, B. parva, B. ribis and B. stevensii are more virulent than the other species studied. The Diplodia sp. collected from grapevine canes was identified as morphologically similar, but phylogenetically distinct from D. sarmentorum, while D. sarmentorum was confirmed as anamorph of Otthia spiraeae, the type species of the genus Otthia (Botryosphaeriaceae). A culture identified as O. spiraeae clustered within Botryosphaeria, and is thus regarded as a probable synonym. These findings confirm earlier suggestions that the generic concept of Botryosphaeria should be expanded to include genera with septate ascospores and Diplodia anamorphs. The genus Phomopsis (Sacc.) Bubak contains many species that are plant pathogenic or saprotrophic. Ten species are known from grapevines. However, only two have been confirmed as being pathogenic, namely P. viticola (Sacc.) Sacc., causal organism of Phomopsis cane and leaf spot and P. vitimegaspora Kuo & Leu (teleomorph Diaporthe kyushuensis Kajitani & Kanem.), causal organism of swelling arm disease of grapevines. P. amygdali (Delacr.) 1. 1. Tuset & M. T. Portilla, a known pathogen from Prunus sp., was shown to be a possible pathogen of grapevines in a previous study. D. perjuncta Niessl. causes bleaching of <b>dormant</b> <b>canes</b> only and is therefore of little importance as a grapevine pathogen. Recently a number of Phomopsis isolates were obtained from grapevines in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Isolations were made from Phomopsis-like symptoms, pruning wounds and asymptomatic nursery plants. These isolates showed great variation in morphology and cultural characteristics. Earlier taxonomic treatments of Phomopsis, based species identification on host specificity, cultural characteristics and morphology. Recent studies have indicated that these characteristics can no longer be used to distinguish species of Phomopsis due to wide host ranges and morphological plasticity of some species. The use of anamorph/teleomorph relationships in species identification is also untenable, since Diaporthe teleomorphs have only been described for approximately 20 % of the known Phomopsis species. In this study morphological data, DNA sequences (ITS-I, 5. 8 S, ITS- 2) and pathogenicity data were combined to distinguish Phomopsis spp. from grapevines. Fifteen species of Phomopsis were delineated by phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequence data. Diaporthe helianthi, a sunflower pathogen, was reported from grapevines for the first time, with a further six, unknown species also distinguished. Three different clades contained isolates previously identified as D. perjuncta. Based on type studies, it appeared that the name D. viticola was available for collections from Portugal and Germany, a new species, D. australafricana, was proposed for South African and Australian isolates, formerly treated as D. perjuncta or D. viticola. An epitype specimen and culture were designated for D. perjuncta. This species was distinguished from D. viticola and D. australafricana based on morphology and DNA phylogeny. Artificial inoculations of green grapevine shoots indicated that, of the species tested, P. amygdali, a known pathogen of peaches in the USA, and P. viticola were the most virulent. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In 'n poging om sommige patogene geassosieer met stamsiektes en syndrome, te beveg, het die navorsing in die tesis gefokus op die taksonomie en patologiese aspekte van ConiellaiPilidiella, Botryosphaeria en Phomopsis spp Voorheen is konidium pigmentasie gebruik om Pilidiella (hialien tot ligbruin konidia) van Coniella (donkerbruin konidia) te skei. Onlangs is hierdie twee genera egter as sinoniem beskou met die ouer naam, Coniella, wat voorkeur gekry het. Die belangrikste spesies in die ConiellaiPilidiella kompleks van wingerd is C. diplodiella (Speg.) Petr. & Syd., die veroorsakende organisme van witvrot van wingerd. Vorige studies het dit moeilik gevind om te onderskei tussen C. diplodiella en C. fragariae (Oudem.) B. Sutton, wat bekend is dat dit in grond voorkom en ook blaarsiektes van Fragaria en Eucalyptus veroorsaak. Beide hierdie spesies is tevore in Suid-Afrika aangemeld. Geen van die aanmeldings van C. diplodiella is egter wetenskaplik bewys nie en daarom is dit steeds 'n kwarantyn organisme. Hierdie kwarantyn status is egter bevraagteken. Op grond van DNS volgordes van die interne getranskribeerde spasieerder area ("ITS 1 ", "ITS 2 "), die 5. 8 S rRNS geen, die groot ribosomale subeenheid ("LSU") en die verlengingsfaktor 1 -α geen ("EF-lα") van die tipe spesies van Pilidiella en Coniella, is Coniella van Pilidiella geskei, met die meerderheid van die taxa wat binne Pilidiella resorteer. Pilidiella word gekarakteriseer deur spesies met hialien tot ligbruin konidia (gem. lengte: breedte > 1. 5), in teenstelling met die donkerbruin konidia van Coniella (gem. lengte: breedte ≤ 1. 5). Daar is verder bewys dat Pilidiella diplodiella, voorheen C. diplodiella, veroorsakende organisme van witvrot van wingerd, die ouer naam van C. petrakii is. Hierdie swam is teenwoordig in Suid-Afrika en P. diplodiella is dus nie meer van kwarantyn belang nie. Op grond van analises van die histoon (H 3) volgordes van spesies in die P. diplodiella spesies kompleks, is P. diplodiella geskei van 'n nuut beskryfde spesie, P. diplodiopsis. 'n Nuwe spesie, P. eucalyptorum, is ook voorgestel vir isolate voorheen beskou as C. fragariae, geassosieer met blaarvlek van Eucalyptus spp. Hierdie spesie het basaal van Pilidiella gegroepeer en mag moontlik nog 'n derde genus binne hierdie kompleks verteenwoordig. Pilidiella destruens is nuut as anamorf van Schizoparme destruens beskryf, wat geassosieer word met loot terugsterwing van Eucalyptus spp. in Hawaii. Die genus Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. is bekend as kosmopolitaans met 'n wye gasheerreeks en geografiese verspreiding. Verskeie saprofitiese spesies is aangemeld vanaf wingerd, terwyl ander ernstige patogene van hierdie gasheer is. Laasgenoemde spesies sluit in B. dothidea (Moug. : Fr.) Ces. & De Not., B. parva Pennycook & Samuels, B. obtusa (Schwein.) Shoemaker, B. stevensii Shoemaker, B. lutea A. 1. L. Phillips en B. ribis Grossenb. & Duggar. Spesies aangemeld in Suid-Afrika as wingerdpatogene, is B. obtusa, B. dothidea, B. ribis en B. vitis (Schulzer) Sacco In hierdie studie is morfologiese, DNS volgorde data ("ITSl", "ITS 2 ", 5. 8 S en "EF-Iα") en plantpatologiese data gebruik om II Botryosphaeria spesies, geassosieer met wingerde in Suid-Afrika en verskeie ander werelddele, te onderskei. Botryosphaeria australis, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina en 'n Diplodia sp. is bevestig van wingerde in Suid-Afrika, terwyl Diplodia porosum, Fusicoccum viticlavatum en F. vitifusiforme as nuwe spesies beskryf is. AIhoewel isolate van B. dothidea en B. stevensii bevestig is van wingerde in Portugal, is geen van hierdie spesies en ook nie B. ribis geïsoleer nie. AIle isolate vanaf wingerd in Portugal, voorheen beskou as B. rib is, is as B. parva op grond van hul "EF-lα" volgordes geïdentifiseer. Uit kunsmatige isolasies gemaak op wingerdlote is die gevolgtrekking gemaak dat B. australis, B. parva, B. ribis en B. stevensii meer virulent is as die ander spesies wat bestudeer is. Die Diplodia sp. versamel vanaf wingerdlote is geïdentifiseer as morfologies eenders, maar filogeneties verskillend van D. sarmentorum, terwyl D. sarmentorum bevestig is as die anamorf van Otthia spiraeae, die tipe spesie van die genus Otthia (Botryosphaeriaceae). 'n Kultuur wat as 0. spiraeae geïdentifiseer is, het binne Botryosphaeria gegroepeer, en word dus as 'n moontlike sinoniem beskou. Hierdie bevindinge bevestig vroeëre voorstelle dat die generiese konsep van Botryosphaeria uitgebrei behoort te word om genera met gesepteerde askospore en Diplodia anamorwe in te sluit. Die genus Phomopsis (Sacc.) Bubak bevat verskeie spesies wat as of plantpatogenies, of saprofities, beskryf is. Tien spesies is bekend op wingerd. Slegs twee is as patogenies bevestig, naamlik P. viticola (Sacc.) Sacc., veroorsakende organisme van loot-en-blaarvlek ("streepvlek") en P. vitimegaspora Kuo & Leu (teleomorf Diaporthe kyushuensis Kajitani & Kanem.), veroorsakende organisme van geswelde arm van wingerd. In 'n vroeëre studie is bevind dat P. amygdali (Delacr.) 1. 1. Tuset & M. T. Portilla, 'n bekende patogeen van Prunus sp., moontlik ook 'n patogeen van wingerd mag wees. D. perjuncta Niessl. veroorsaak egter net verbleiking van dormante lote en is dus van min belang as 'n wingerd patogeen. Gedurende die afgelope twee jaar is verskeie Phomopsis isolate van wingerde in die Wes-Kaap provinsie van Suid-Afrika verkry. Isolasies is gemaak van Phomopsis-agtige simptome, snoeiwonde en asimptomatiese kwekeryplante. Die isolate verkry uit hierdie materiaal het groot variasie ten opsigte van morfologie en kultuureienskappe getoon. Vroeëre taksonomiese verhandelings van Phomopsis het spesies-identifikasie op gasheerspesifisiteit, kultuureienskappe en morfologie gebasseer. Onlangse studies het egter getoon dat, weens wye gasheerreekse en morfologiese plastisiteit van somnuge spesies, hierdie eienskappe me meer gebruik kan word om Phomopsis spesies te identifiseer nie. Die gebruik van anamorflteleomorf verwantskappe in die identifikasie van Phomopsis spesies ook onbruikbaar omdat Diaporthe teleomorwe vir slegs ongeveer 20 % van die bekende Phomopsis spesies beskryf is. Die huidige studie het dus morfologiese data, DNS volgordes ("ITS 1 ", 5. 8 S, "ITS 2 ") en patogenisiteitsdata gekombineer ten einde Phomopsis spp. vanaf wingerd te identifiseer. Vyftien Phomopsis spesies is deur die filogenetiese analise van die interne getranskribeerde spasieerder area ("ITS") volgordes geskei. Diaporthe helianthi, 'n bekende patogeen van sonneblomme, is vir die eerste maal op wingerd aangeteken, terwyl 'n verdere ses, tans onbekende spesies van Phomopsis ook geidentifiseer is. Drie verskillende groepe het isolate bevat wat voorheen as D. perjuncta geidentifiseer is. Gebasseer op studies van tipes, het dit voorgekom dat die naam D. viticola beskikbaar is vir isolate uit Portugal en Duitsland. 'n Nuwe spesie, D. australafricana, is voorgestel vir Suid-Afrikaanse en Australiese isolate wat voorheen behandel is as D. perjuncta of D. viticola. 'n Epitipe monster en kultuur is vir D. perjuncta benoem. Hierdie spesie is van D. viticola en D. australafricana onderskei op grond van morfologie en DNS filogenie. Kunsmatige inokulasies van groen wingerdlote het getoon dat P. amygdali, bekende perske patogeen, en P. viticola die mees virulent was...|$|R
