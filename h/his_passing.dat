5|$|Although Koubek {{designed}} {{more than}} 100 apartment buildings, condominiums, hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls during his long career, he did {{only a handful}} of private residences. He actively continued his architectural career and his office until the end of January 2003. By the time of <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> he had designed buildings representing a combined investment of more than $2 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his other activities, in 1885 Samfield founded The Jewish Spectator, a weekly journal on Southern Jewish life and culture. He was its editor {{until his death in}} , just days before his planned retirement. His death was announced with banner headlines, and to commemorate <b>his</b> <b>passing,</b> Memphis's streetcars were stopped for ten minutes.|$|E
50|$|His worst {{games were}} against Mississippi State (completing only 48.7% of <b>his</b> <b>passes</b> and {{throwing}} two interceptions), at Florida (completing 52.5% of <b>his</b> <b>passes,</b> but throwing three interceptions), and at Tennessee (completing only 44.8% of <b>his</b> <b>passes).</b>|$|R

5|$|While the paratroopers {{prepared}} to cross, Reshef {{was informed that}} Akavish had been closed again by Egyptian infantry units soon after <b>his</b> <b>passing.</b> He sent one armored battalion to clear the road and committed his remaining three armored and three mechanized battalions to push northwards and secure Tirtur and the Chinese Farm.|$|E
5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
5000|$|He {{had strong}} {{performances}} at LSU (completing 62.9% of <b>his</b> <b>passes,</b> throwing for 291 yards, two touchdowns, and 1 interception), and against Ole Miss (completing 57.1% of <b>his</b> <b>passes,</b> throwing for 206 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions) ...|$|R
50|$|Bradford, {{who came}} in {{completing}} 71 percent of <b>his</b> <b>passes,</b> went only 13-for-32 for 255 yards. The 40 percent completion rate was the lowest of his career and {{only the second time}} more than half of <b>his</b> <b>passes</b> were incomplete.|$|R
50|$|In LSU's 58-0 {{victory over}} Western Carolina he {{completed}} 80.0% of <b>his</b> <b>passes</b> for 291 yards, throwing two touchdowns and no interceptions.

He threw an interception along the left sideline on {{what turned out}} to be the Tigers' final offensive play of the game, turning the ball over to the Blazers in field goal range. UAB won on a 32-yard Rhett Gallego field goal with no time left.|$|R
5|$|Aladdin, {{released}} in November 1992, continued the upward trend in Disney's animation success, earning $504 million worldwide {{at the box}} office, and two more Oscars for Best Song and Best Score. Featuring songs by Menken, Ashman, and Tim Rice (who replaced Ashman after <b>his</b> <b>passing)</b> and starring the voice of Robin Williams, Aladdin also established the trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices of Disney characters, which had been explored to some degree with The Jungle Book and Oliver & Company, but now became standard practice.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the field, Air Force had the No. 2 rushing offense in the country during the 1984 regular season. Air Force fullback Pat Evans led the team with 159carries for 1,015rushing yards. Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss also was known more for his running than <b>his</b> <b>passing.</b> Weiss {{finished}} the regular season with just 41completions for 668yards and threetouchdowns. He carried the ball 126times for 540yards and 10touchdowns. Wide receiver Ken Carpenter benefited the most from the few passes that were thrown. He had 15catches for 258yards and twotouchdowns during the regular season.|$|E

50|$|On 14 June 2014, it was {{reported}} that Mouche would travel to SÃ£o Paulo to sign a four-year contract with Palmeiras, who has paid US$4 million for %70 of <b>his</b> <b>pass</b> transfer, whilst the other %30 of <b>his</b> <b>pass</b> would remain with Boca Juniors. During his first season with the club, Mouche was widely used as a first choice substitute for the attack.|$|R
5000|$|First rookie quarterback to ever {{complete}} over 70% of <b>his</b> <b>passes</b> in {{four straight}} games.|$|R
5|$|The Huskies {{struggled}} {{to pass the}} ball all season, only completing four touchdown passes as a team heading into the International Bowl. Lorenzen completed under half of <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> attempts on the season. He threw for 820yards with more interceptions (eight) than touchdowns (two). Nevertheless, before the game Randy Edsall confirmed that Lorenzen would be the starting quarterback for UConn in the International Bowl. This would be his ninth appearance at quarterback on the season; he missed four games with a broken right foot.|$|E
5|$|Guest came {{up against}} Sir Charles Coghlan, the senior partner of Coghlan and Welsh, {{in a case}} before the Court of the Mining Commissioner. Coghlan {{represented}} a mining company, which had pegged some gold claims on Guest's client's farm. The Commissioner gave judgment in favour of Guest, who had been instructed to oppose their registration. Following this case, although initially irritated by Guest, Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury, which Guest did in January 1912. The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. <b>His</b> <b>passing</b> away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner. For a while, the firm was known as Coghlan, Welsh, Townsend and Guest, when Townsend, one of the 1820 Settlers in the Eastern Cape, joined the firm in Salisbury. It reverted to Coghlan, Welsh and Guest, when Townsend died a little time later.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>passing</b> did not {{diminish}} his popularity in Philadelphia {{and in a}} 1999 Philadelphia Daily News poll, he {{was selected as the}} city's greatest professional coach/manager, beating out other notable coaches such as: Connie Mack of MLB Philadelphia Athletics, Dick Vermeil, and Greasy Neale of the NFL Philadelphia Eagles. In 2010 there was a push to get him elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame, which included an online petition at Flyershistory.net. Shero was eventually elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 2013. He remains the winningest coach in Flyers history with 308 wins, plus 48 more in playoff competition.|$|E

5|$|However, it did {{not take}} long for FÃ bregas {{to become one of the}} most coveted and celebrated young talents in the game with his success at Arsenal. Functioning mostly as a playmaker and renowned for <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> range, he was {{described}} as the general of Arsenal's first team, bringing vision, creativity, and an innate understanding of timing and space to Arsenal's intricate passing game, displaying maturity that belied his age. He was the main creative force when he was at Arsenal, as exemplified by his 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006â07 season. Between 2006â07 and 2010â11, FÃ bregas created the most chances in the top-division leagues of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, a {{few years}} before his death in 1852, Mantell {{realised}} that iguanodonts were not heavy, pachyderm-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; however, <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> left him unable to participate {{in the creation of the}} Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades. With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two iguanodonts (based on the Mantellodon specimen), one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{controlled}} the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance {{came in the}} 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper AgustÃ­n RodrÃ­guez. Further chances were created, but neither Terry McDermott or Dalglish were able to score. Real started to exert more of an influence after this, midfielder Juanito started to cause Liverpool problems with <b>his</b> <b>passing.</b> One pass found JosÃ© Antonio Camacho who beat Liverpool defender Alan Hansen but put his shot wide of the Liverpool goal. Despite their scoring opportunity, one problem Real had {{was to get the}} best out of their winger Cunningham. Not fully fit, he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Bearcats' offense {{came through}} the air, however. Cincinnati quarterback Tony Pike {{finished}} the game having completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts, resulting in 239 passing yards, 1 touchdown, and 4 interceptions. Pike also ran the ball five times for four yards. Pike's four interceptions were a career-high and marked {{only the second time}} he threw more than one interception in a game. For Virginia Tech, quarterback Tyrod Taylor finished the game with 13 completions from 22 pass attempts, resulting in 140 passing yards and 1 interception. In addition to <b>his</b> <b>passing,</b> Taylor ran with the ball 15 times, gaining 47 yards and a touchdown in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{acquired}} University of Michigan All-American quarterback Harry Newman {{and versatile}} free agent halfback Ken Strong before the 1933 season. New York finished 11â3, {{first in the}} new Eastern Division. Newman led the NFL in passes completed (53), passing yards (973), touchdown passes (11), and longest pass completion (78 yards), with <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> yardage total setting an NFL record. New York's resurgence was led {{by some of the}} league's best linemen, such as Ray Flaherty and future Hall of Famers Red Badgro, and Hein. They advanced to play in the league's first official championship game in Chicago's Wrigley Field versus the Bears, where they lost 23â21 in a game which had six lead changes.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Jamaica, Queens in New York City, Clinkscales rose to {{prominence}} as {{a basketball player}} at a young age, drawing attention from coaches around the country. After his freshman year at Springfield Gardens High School, he transferred to Shores Christian Academy in Ocala, Florida, where his team won the National Association of Christian Athletes title. Consequently, Clinkscales received interest from several major college basketball programs as a three-star recruit. He played with the DePaul Blue Demons from 2004 to 2008 and joined the BayHawks soon after. For his entire college career, Clinkscales had a limited impact as a scorer despite <b>his</b> <b>passing</b> ability, becoming the fifth freshman at DePaul to pass for 100 assists. While most of his statistics stagnated over the years, he led NCAA Division I in assist-to-turnover ratio as a senior. After previously announcing {{a break from the}} Hurricanes, Clinkscales affirmed in October 2016 that he would represent the team in the 2016â2017 season.|$|E
