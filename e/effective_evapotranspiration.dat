Three different experimental plots cultivated with maize were equipped with tensiometers and soil moisture probes to monitor every day the water movement in the unsaturated zone. Other relevant parameters of the various soil layers, as hydraulic conductivity and water retention curve, were obtained in laboratory experiments, while boundary conditions, as precipitations, temperature and root growth, were obtained on site. Inverse modeling was performed using HYDRUS- 1 D to assess the degree of uncertainty on model parameters. Results showed a good model fit of water content and head pressure at various depths, in each site, using Penman-Monteith formula for daily potential evapotranspiration calculation, but poor fit applying the Hargreves and Turk formulas. Best performance of model fit was observed for S-shaped equation employed to simulate the root water-uptake reduction with respect to Feddes equation. The soil parameters uncertainty was limited and remained within analytical errors, thus a robust estimation of cumulative infiltration and evapotranspiration has been derived.

40|$|Urban {{plants can}} help to improve air quality, and {{consequently}} human health. Due to the negative future prospects in 2050 for the urban environment caused by global climatic change [such as elevated ozone (O 3) concentration and drought]. There {{is a need to}} monitor and proactively manage urban forests, adjusting them to change and using them to help cities to adapt to change. Special attention must be paid to the species that populate environments characterized by above-optimal temperatures in summer, such as the Mediterranean ones. Under field conditions, the study of the response to environmental stresses is difficult because environmental factors can be synergistically or antagonistically modified. For these reasons, the aim of this work is the analysis of the impact of a combined stress (O 3 and drought) to simulate under controlled conditions the impact of a 2050 environmental scenario on the physiological performance of the Mediterranean Quercus cerris. Profiles related to leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and leaf water potential were analyzed in 2 -years old Q. cerris saplings exposed to O 3 (80 - 100 ppb, 4 h day- 1 for 12 consecutive weeks), to drought (daily irrigated with 30 % of <b>effective</b> <b>evapotranspiration)</b> and to O 3 combined with drought in order to improve the response to oxidative stress. At the end of the exposure, plants do not exhibit any foliar symptoms. Photosynthetic processes, however, were significantly changed. Since the first week of treatment, oxidative stress induced decrease in net photosynthesis (A), above all in drought-stressed plants (about 2 -fold), in comparison to controls. This trend unvaried {{until the end of the}} exposure due to a reduction of the stomatal conductance (gs). gs was lower in drought and combined-stressed plants during the whole exposure period (until a minimum about 5 -fold after 5 weeks when compared to controls). In O 3 -treated plants, intermediate A [8 vs 3 - 11 (other three thesis’ range) μmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1] and gs [0. 10 vs 0. 07 - 0. 22 (other three thesis’ range) mol H 2 O m- 2 s- 1, after 4 weeks] values were observed in comparison to the other three thesis explained by a gas avoidance mechanism activated by a stomata regulation causing a medium decrease of the net photosynthesis. Combined stresstreated plants did not show significant changes in comparison to drought stressed individuals in terms of photosynthetic status. Although intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci) significantly changed after every treatment. Although the variable and maximal fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) did not show significant change during the exposure, all the plants showed values inside the optimal range. A regulatory adjustment of photosynthetic processes was highlighted during the exposure by the higher values of no-photochemical quenching (qNP) of all plants in comparison to controls and therefore suggests a tendency to increase the efficiency of thermal energy dissipation within PSII. Measurements of predawn leaf water potential revealed a leaf drought stress (around - 2. 0 vs - 0. 5 MPa in controls) in plants grown under water deficit conditions especially in combined stress plants suggesting a synergistic effect on the hydric status. On this basis drought stress (single and combined) should be considered more harmful to Q. cerris than O 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of ozone (O 3) and drought, either singularly or jointly applied, on the physiological and biochemical traits of the Mediterranean tree species Quercus cerris. Three-year-old saplings were subjected to moderate drought (daily irrigated with 30 % of <b>effective</b> <b>evapotranspiration)</b> and/or fumigated with 100 ppb of O 3 (5 h d- 1) for 77 days, in order to simulate a 2050 environmental scenario. After 28 days and at the end of the stresses exposure the following parameters were analysed: i) leaf water status and membrane integrity; ii) diurnal courses of photosynthetic process; iii) osmolytes and accessories pigments content. Under drought (alone or in combination with O 3), 42 days from the beginning of the treatment, plants showed lateral and tip yellow-brown necrosis in the youngest fully expanded leaves. At the end of the fumigation, no O 3 leaf injury was observed, but all plants (with exception of controls) showed a marked phylloptosis. Drought stress (single and combined) impaired plants performances already after 28 days. Predawn leaf water potential (PDΨw), malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline levels were more affected by drought applied individually than in combination [more than 5 -fold vs 3 -fold lower in comparison to controls, + 11 vs + 4 %, + 112 vs + 45 %, respectively]. The circadian patterns of photosynthetic process were impaired similarly at the quali-quantitative level. Leaf carbon dioxide (CO 2) assimilation rate (A) decreased (- 65 % compared to control, as daily mean) due to both stomatal [- 67 % of stomatal conductance (gs) ] and biochemical limitations [intercellular CO 2 concentrations (Ci) showed unchanged or higher values during the whole day], same as the maximum (Fv/Fm) and effective (Y) quantum yields of photosystem II (- 9 and - 41 %, respectively). On the other hand, in O 3 -stressed plants, similar responses were observed only after 77 days of the exposure: - 80 % of PDΨw values (compared to controls, as daily mean); + 17 % of MDA concentrations; proline content from lower values (observed after 28 days) increased to constitutive levels; - 68 % of A and - 70 % of gs; Ci and Fv/Fm, unchanged; - 13 % of Y values, (only photoinhibiton was observed). Moreover, at the end of the treatment, the effects of coupled stresses were stronger than that of drought applied individually in terms of water status, lipid peroxidation and proline content while the circadian patterns of photosynthesis continued to be affected similarly at the quali-quantitative levels. Differential abscisic acid (ABA) evolutions, strictly twinned with its precursors (neo- and violaxanthin), were observed during the summer. After 28 days of treatment, the content of this phytohormone rose only in plants subjected to drought (+ 143 %), while an increase of neoxanthin was observed in O 3 and combined ones (+ 15 and + 31 %, respectively). At the end of the exposure, ABA concentration significantly increased in O 3 (single and in combination) stressed plants (+ 250 and + 64 %, respectively), while violaxanthin content decreased (- 32 and - 47 %, respectively). In conclusion, in Q. cerris: i) drought stress (single and combined) should be considered more harmful than O 3, although it should be mitigated by this pollutant for a limited time; ii) drought and combined stresses impaired similarly the diurnal pattern of photosynthetic processes at the quali-quantitative levels, and iii) the osmolytes (in particular ABA) could play a key role in the responses to environmental constrain...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate SWB applicability, hydrodynamic changes and water efficiency of forage cactus clones under irrigation. The clones ‘Orelha de Elefante Mexicana’ (OEM), ‘IPA Sertânia’ (IPA) and ‘Miúda’ (MIU) were submitted to irrigation depths (2. 5, 5. 0 and 7. 5 mm) and frequencies (7, 14 and 28 days), in Serra Talhada, PE, Brazil, between March 2012 and August 2013.

The aim was to investigate whether drought stress influences the responses of plants to acute episodes of O 3 exposure. In this study, the behavior of 84 Mediterranean evergreen Quercus ilex plants was evaluated in terms of crosstalk responses among signaling molecules. Half {{of the sample was}} subjected to drought (20 % of the <b>effective</b> daily <b>evapotranspiration,</b> for 15 days) and was later exposed to an acute O 3 exposure (200 nL L- 1 for 5 h). First, our results indicate that in well-water conditions, O 3 induced a signaling pathway specific to O 3 -sensitive behavior. Second, different trends and consequently different roles of phytohormones and signaling molecules (ethylene, ET; abscisic acid, ABA; salycilic acid, SA and jasmonic acid, JA) were observed in relation to water stress and O 3. A spatial and functional correlation between these signaling molecules was observed in modulating O 3 -induced responses in well-watered plants. In contrast, in drought-stressed plants, these compounds were not involved either in O 3 -induced signaling mechanisms or in leaf senescence (a response observed in water-stressed plants before the O 3 -exposure). Third, these differences were ascribable to the fact that in drought conditions, most defense processes induced by O 3 were compromised and/or altered. Our results highlight how Q. ilex plants suffering from water deprivation respond differently to an acute O 3 episode compared to well-watered plants, and suggest new effect to be considered in plant responses to environmental changes.

40|$|In {{this era}} of global warming it is {{necessary}} to understand the mechanisms that allow native plant species to tolerate these environmental constraints and the way such mechanisms interact. The main scope of this research work was to investigate the responses of oak species to single and combined abiotic stresses that are common in the Mediterranean urban environments (drought, O 3 and salinity). Firstly, three Mediterranean oak species (Querucs ilex, Q. pubescens and Q. cerris) with different features (drought tolerance, evergreen or deciduous species) were selected in order to assess their responses under a long period of moderate drought (30 % of the <b>effective</b> daily <b>evapotranspiration)</b> and/or O 3 stress (80 ppb of O 3 for 5 h d- 1 for 77 consecutive days). The chronic O 3 treatment had a minor impact compared to drought, highlighting that the plasticity of the species is dependent on the environment in which they live. Species that inhabit environments characterized by long periods of water deficiency (i. e. Q. ilex and Q. pubescens) are usually more plastic under the same stress compared with those that rarely face the same environmental constraint (Q. cerris). Furthermore, this dataset shows that biochemical and physiological adjustments may reduce the impact of O 3 when combined with the effect of drought. Following the results came out from this first experiment, and since the mitigative effect of drought against O 3 seems more consistent when plant is exposed to short and harsh period of severe drought rather than to longer O 3 exposure but under moderate drought, other two sets of experiments were performed. Firstly, the interactions of severe drought (20 % of the <b>effective</b> daily <b>evapotranspiration)</b> and O 3 (80 ppb, 5 h d- 1, for 28 consecutive days) were investigated in Q. cerris focusing on its hydric relations, synthesis/production of compatible solutes and lipophilic antioxidant compounds. Although, leaf-intrinsic adjustments occurred (stomatal limitations) and the synthesis of stress-associated metabolites was altered, plants were not able to delay or prevent the negative impact of drought. Furthermore, it was evident that drought alone induced fairly higher effects in comparison to O 3, whereas when O 3 was applied together with drought it showed some “mitigating effects” against limited water availability. In fact, plants of Q. cerris exposed to both drought and O 3 seemed able to partially adjust and optimize their photosynthetic activity. This response could be interpreted as a photosynthetic acclimation leading to a premature senescence of fully-developed leaves as a strategy to respond to multiple stress conditions, likely addressed to alert younger leaves. Later, physiological and biochemical responses of Q. ilex (evergreen, isohydric species) were compared to those of the sympatric Q. pubescens (deciduous, anisohydric species) under the same environmental constrains of the previous experiment. This study confirms the higher ability of evergreen species to counteract the effect of drought and O 3 when compared to deciduous species in Mediterranean environment. This ability of evergreens seems to be correlated with the stronger necessity of these species, which inhabits usually unfavorable environments, to protect their long-lived leaves from several negative environmental factors. This peculiarity seems less relevant for highly-demanding, fast-growing deciduous species characterized by shorter leaf lifespan, which have superior fitness than evergreens in non-limiting environment. Then, the response of Q. ilex (the most studied oak species, as well as the species that has been shown the higher tolerance and plasticity in the first experiment) to drought (20 % of the <b>effective</b> daily <b>evapotranspiration)</b> and/or an acute O 3 -exposure (200 ppb, 5 h) was also investigated. This study, which focused on the interaction between reactive oxygen species (ROS), phytohormones and signalling molecules to evaluate if the response of Q. ilex resembles the biotic defense reactions, shows that: (i) in well-watered conditions, O 3 induced a signalling pathway similar to that triggered by a pathogen only in terms of ROS pattern (showing an O 3 -sensitive behavior); (ii) different trends and consequently different roles of phytohormones and signalling molecules were observed in relation to the leaf hydric status and O 3 (applied both singularly and consequently), and (iii) these differences were ascribable to the fact that in drought conditions most defense processes induced by O 3 were compromised/altered. Furthermore, the response of Q. ilex was also investigated also under salinity and O 3. Q. ilex saplings were firstly exposed to salinity (150 mM NaCl, 15 days), and the effect on photosynthesis, hydric relations and ion partitioning were evaluated (Experiment I). Then, salt-treated plants were exposed to 80 ppb of O 3 for 5 h (Experiment II). The results of the first experiment indicate that evergreen sclerophylls such as Q. ilex, with their long-lived leaves have a low photosynthetic efficiency on a mass basis because these species invest preferentially in vascular and cell wall formation. This induces these species to decrease intercellular spaces and increase cell wall thickness, increasing CO 2 drawdown but also maintaining high foliar RWC and osmotic stress tolerance. These mechanisms are consistent with a conservative strategy adopted by Q. ilex to preserve its long-lived leaves against different abiotic stresses. Furthermore, the dataset of the second experiment shows that O 3 did not exacerbate the oxidative stress observed in salt-treated plants although a further relevant enhancement of the Halliwell-Asada cycle was necessary to counteract the O 3 -induced damage when the leaf status was already negatively affected by a previous salt exposure. This harmonic response is an extra burden for plants, and growth can suffer as a result in the long-term, if these single O 3 episodes take place repeatedly. Assessing the impact of climate change and air pollution on ecosystems is still a challenging task and the development of adequate monitoring techniques is necessary for assessing vegetation status. Thus, a final study was performed showing that reflectance spectroscopy can be an alternative method for monitoring leaf water potential and also making a posteriori measurements of pre-dawn leaf water potential (PDΨW) on tropical live oak Q. oleoides sampled in four Central American populations (Belize, Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico) and grown under differential water availability. This study confirms that spectroscopic approaches are quick and non-destructive, providing the possibility to screen more samples in the field and over multiple time periods. In addition, this dataset demonstrates that spectroscopic retrievals of PDΨW in response to environmental variation (e. g. water availability) {{can be used as a}} surrogate for standard approaches...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Southern Great Plains are {{characterized}} by a fine-scale mixture of different land-cover types, predominantly winter-wheat and grazed pasture, with relatively small areas of other crops, native prairie, and switchgrass. Recent droughts and predictions of increased drought in the Southern Great Plains, especially during the summer months, raise concern for these ecosystems. We measured ecosystem carbon and water fluxes with eddy-covariance systems over cultivated cropland for 10 years, and over lightly grazed prairie and new switchgrass fields for 2 years each. Growing-season precipitation showed the strongest control over net carbon uptake for all ecosystems, but with a variable effect: grasses (prairie and switchgrass) needed at least 350 mm of precipitation {{during the growing season}} to become net carbon sinks, while crops needed only 100 mm. In summer, high temperatures enhanced evaporation and led to higher likelihood of dry soil conditions. Therefore, summer-growing native prairie species and switchgrass experienced more seasonal droughts than spring-growing crops. For wheat, the net reduction in carbon uptake resulted mostly from a decrease in gross primary production rather than an increase in respiration. Flux measurements suggested that management practices for crops were <b>effective</b> in suppressing <b>evapotranspiration</b> and decomposition (by harvesting and removing secondary growth), and in increasing carbon uptake (by fertilizing and conserving summer soil water). In light of future projections for wetter springs and drier and warmer summers in the Southern Great Plains, our study indicates an increased vulnerability in native ecosystems and summer crops over time...|$|R

Fish pond water demand and oil palm plantations is used as a reduction of the value of intake discharge, which then the rest of discharge will be used as a main rate of flow for fulfilling plants water needs. In March, May and July crop water requirement is greater than the mainstay discharge, then a simulation done by allocation of planting schedule that is 5 group for rice planting and 3 group for crops planting. The results showed that planting schedule can reduce the value of the maximum water deficit in the existing condition that is 0. 36 m 3 / s to 0. 041 m 3 / s or decreased 88. 61 %, but the deficit is still occurs. So it is necessary to do a Long Storage planning with 2000 m long, width 5 m and 5 m depth with a land area of 1. 2 hectares which function as water reservoir {{that can be used to}} fulfilling the crops water needs on dry meteorological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Models {{for safety}} {{assessment}} of radioactive waste repositories need accurate {{values of the}} soil-to-plant transfer of radionuclides. In oxidizing environments, 99 Tc is expected to occur as pertechnetate (99 TcO 4 −). Due to its high mobility, leaching of this element in the field might be important, potentially affecting the reliability of estimated transfer parameters of 99 Tc as measured in closed experimental systems such as hydroponics or pot experiments. The aim of this experiment was to measure the leaching of 99 Tc in undisturbed irrigated soil cores under cultivation as well as plant uptake and to study the possible competition between the two transfer pathways. Undisturbed soil cores (50 × 50 cm) were sampled from a Rendzic Leptosol (R), a colluvial Fluvic Cambisol (F) and a Dystric Cambisol (D) using PVC tubes (three cores sampled per soil type). Each core was equipped with a leachate collector at the bottom, allowing the monitoring of 99 Tc leaching through the cores. Cores were placed in a greenhouse and maize (Zea mays L., cv. DEA, Pioneer®) was sown. After 135 d, maize was harvested and radioactivity determined in both plant and water samples. Results showed that during the growing period, leaching of 99 Tc was limited, due to the high evapotranspiration rate of maize. After harvest, leaching of 99 Tc went on because {{of the absence of}} <b>evapotranspiration.</b> <b>Effective</b> uptake (EU) of 99 Tc in leaves and grains was calculated. EU reached 70 % of the input in the leaves and was not significantly different among soils. These results confirmed those obtained from pot experiments, even though leaching was allowed to occur in close-to-reality hydraulical conditions. As a consequence, it was concluded that pot experiments are an adequate surrogate for more complex ‘close-to-reality’ experimental systems for measuring transfer factors...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{stresses}} {{are putting}} great pressure on water resources systems. Population growth, cli mate change, prosperity, energy production, food crisis, and water governance {{are among the}} factors straining water resources. Decision makers from rich to poor countries and from commercial to non governmental organisations are struggling to devise schemes to adapt to these stressed water conditions. Better efficiency for water resources systems, and particularly irrigation systems, is recommended {{as one of the}} most important responses to climate change, unsustainable development, and water shortage. However, using certain effi ciencies such as Classical Efficiency caused systems not to perform according to decision makers' objectives. Effective Efficiency is a robust composite indicator that includes in its formulation both a flow weight, taking into account the leaching fraction, and reuse of return flows. Classical Efficiency is defined as the percentage of the diversion consumed beneficially, such as by crop <b>evapotranspiration.</b> <b>Effective</b> Efficiency, on the other hand, is defined as the ratio of beneficial consumptive use to total consumption, expressed as a percentage. In this paper, a normalised and non dimensional form of Effective Efficiency is developed and necessary con straints for its successful application are explained. These constraints express water balance, flow weights and their thresholds, water reuse, and total consumptive use. Basic guidelines are proposed for better decision making in determining possible interventions for improving Effective Efficiency. This is done by analysing its domain through analytical and graphical methods. Three real cases are considered, namely, Imperial Irriga tion District and Grand Valley irrigation systems in the United States and Nile Valley in upper Egypt. Three dimensional sensitivity analysis is performed on Effective Efficiency and its variables using the three cases. This leads to an examination of the validity of the analysis and to suggestions for better intervention options. Meanwhile, it is also shown why Classical Efficiency should be used with care.
