40|$|This review {{describes}} {{a group of}} diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which affect animals and humans. Examination of affected brain tissue suggests that these diseases are caused by the acquisition and deposition of prion protein (PrP). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most important form of TSE in humans with at least four different varieties of the disease. Variant CJD (vCJD), a new form of the disease found in the UK, has several features that differ from the classical forms including early age of onset, longer duration of disease, psychiatric presentation (for example, depression) and extensive <b>florid</b> <b>plaque</b> development in the brain. About 10 per cent of patients with CJD exhibit visual symptoms at disease presentation and approximately 50 per cent {{during the course of the}} disease. The most commonly reported visual symptoms include diplopia, supranuclear palsies, complex visual disturbances, homonymous visual field defects, hallucinations and cortical blindness. Saccadic and smooth pursuit movements appear to be more rarely affected. The agent causing vCJD accumulates in lymphoid tissue such as the spleen and tonsils. The cornea has lymphoid tissue in the form of corneal dendritic cells that are important in the regulation of the immune response in the anterior segment of the eye. The presence of these cells in the cornea has raised the possibility of transmission between patients via optical devices that contact the eye. Although such transmission is theoretically possible it remains highly improbable...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether {{in cases of}} variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the florid-type plaques are derived from the diffuse plaques or whether the 2 plaque types develop independently. Material: Blocks of frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal neocortex and cerebellar cortex from 11 cases of vCJD. Method: The density, distribution and spatial pattern of the <b>florid</b> and diffuse <b>plaques</b> were determined in each brain region using spatial pattern analysis. Results: The density of the diffuse plaques was significantly {{greater than that of}} the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> in most areas. The ratio of the diffuse to <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> varied between brain regions and was maximal in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The densities of the <b>florid</b> and diffuse <b>plaques</b> were positively correlated in the parietal cortex, occipital cortex, the inferior temporal gyrus and the dentate gyrus. Plaque densities were not related to disease duration. In the cerebral cortex, the diffuse plaques were more commonly evenly distributed or occurred in large clusters along the cortex parallel to the pia mater compared with the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> which occurred more frequently in regularly distributed clusters. Conclusion: The <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> may not be derived from the diffuse plaques, the 2 plaque types appearing to develop independently with unique factors involved in their pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that variations in {{the density of the}} florid prion protein (PrP) plaques in the brain of patients with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) were spatially related to blood vessels. In 81 % of areas of the cerebral cortex sampled and in 37 % of the remaining areas, which included the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cerebellum, there was a positive spatial correlation between the density of the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> and the larger blood vessel profiles. The frequency of the positive spatial correlations was similar in different anatomical areas of the cerebral cortex and in the upper compared with the lower cortical laminae. The data support {{the hypothesis that}} the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> cluster around the larger blood vessels in vCJD, the density of associated plaques increasing with vessel size. The development of <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> close to blood vessels may be due to factors associated with the blood vessels that enhance the aggregation of PrP to form the dense cores of <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> and is unlikely to reflect the haematogenous spread of PrP into the brain...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), raises the important question {{of the sources of}} human contamination. The possibility that sheep may have been fed with BSE-contaminated foodstuff raises the serious concern that BSE may now be present in sheep without being distinguishable from scrapie. Sensitive models are urgently needed given the dramatic consequences of such a possible contamination on animal and human health. We inoculated transgenic mice expressing the ovine PrP gene with a brain homogenate from sheep experimentally infected with BSE. We found numerous typical <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> in their brains. Such <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> are a feature of vCJD in humans and experimental BSE infection in macaques. Our observation represents the first description, after a primary infection, of this hallmark in a transgenic mouse model. Moreover, these mice appear to be a promising tool in the search for BSE in sheep...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} distribution of aggregate {{size of the}} diffuse and florid-type prion protein (PrP) plaques was studied in various brain regions in cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The size distributions were unimodal and positively skewed and resembled those of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS). The {{frequency distribution}}s of the PrP aggregates were log-normal in shape, but there were deviations from the expected number of plaques in specific size classes. More diffuse plaques were observed in the modal size class and fewer in the larger size classes than expected and more <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> {{were present in the}} larger size classes compared with the log-normal model. It was concluded that the growth of the PrP aggregates in vCJD does not strictly follow a log-normal model, diffuse plaques growing to within a more restricted size range and <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> to larger sizes than predicted. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was {{to test the hypothesis}} that the size frequency distributions of the prion protein (PrP) plaques in cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) follow a power-law function. The design was a retrospective neuropathological study. The patients were 11 cases of clinically and neuropathologically verified vCJD. Size distributions of the diffuse and florid-type plaques were measured in several areas of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus from each case and a power-law function fitted to each distribution. The size distributions of the <b>florid</b> and diffuse <b>plaques</b> were fitted successfully by a powerlaw function in 100 % and 42 % of brain areas investigated respectively. Processes of aggregation/disaggregation may be more important than surface diffusion in the pathogenesis of the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques.</b> By contrast, surface diffusion may be a more significant factor {{in the development of the}} diffuse plaques. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2006...|$|R
40|$|Vacuolation ('spongiform change') and {{prion protein}} (PrP) {{deposition}} were quantified in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, dentate gyrus and molecular {{layer of the}} cerebellum in 11 cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The density of vacuoles was greater in the cerebral cortex compared to the hippocampus, dentate gyrus and cerebellum. Within the cortex, vacuole density was significantly greater in the occipital compared to the temporal lobe and the density of surviving neurones was greatest in the occipital lobe. The density of the non-florid PrP plaques was greater in the cerebellum {{compared to the other}} brain areas. There were significantly more florid-type PrP plaques in the cerebral cortex compared to the hippocampus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. No significant correlations were observed between the densities of the vacuoles and the PrP plaques. The densities of vacuoles in the parietal cortex and the non-florid plaques in the frontal cortex were positively correlated with the density of surviving neurones. The densities of the florid and the non-florid plaques were positively correlated in the parietal cortex, occipital cortex, inferior temporal gyrus and dentate gyrus. The data suggest: (i) vacuolation throughout the cerebral cortex, especially in the occipital lobe, but less evident in the hippocampus and molecular layer of the cerebellum; (ii) the non-florid plaques are more common than the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> and predominate in the molecular layer of the cerebellum; and (iii) either the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> develop from the non-florid plaques or both types are morphological variants resulting from the same degenerative process...|$|R
40|$|We {{generated}} mice expressing cervid {{prion protein}} {{to produce a}} transgenic system simulating chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk. While normal mice were resistant to CWD, these transgenic mice uniformly developed signs of neurological dysfunction ∼ 230 days following intracerebral inoculation with four CWD isolates. Inoculated transgenic mice homozygous for the transgene array developed disease after ∼ 160 days. The brains of sick transgenic mice exhibited widespread spongiform degeneration and contained abnormal prion protein and abundant amyloid plaques, {{many of which were}} <b>florid</b> <b>plaques.</b> Transmission studies indicated that the same prion strain caused CWD in the analyzed mule deer and elk. These mice provide a new and reliable tool for detecting CWD prions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceL-type bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (L-BSE) is an atypical form of BSE that is transmissible to cattle and several lines of prion protein (PrP) transgenic mice, but not to wild-type mice. In this study, we examined the transmissibility of sheep-passaged L-BSE prions to wild-type mice. Disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) was detected in the brain and/or lymphoid tissues during the lifespan of mice that were asymptomatic subclinical carriers, indicating that wild-type mice were susceptible to sheep-passaged L-BSE. The morphological characteristics of the PrPSc of sheep-passaged L-BSE included <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> that were distributed mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of subsequent passaged mice. The PrPSc glycoform profiles of wild-type mice infected with sheep-passaged L-BSE {{were similar to those}} of the original isolate. The data indicate that sheep-passaged L-BSE has an altered host range and acquired transmissibility to wild-type mice...|$|R
40|$|All neuropathologically {{confirmed}} {{cases of}} variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), characterized by abundant <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> and type 4 disease-related prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain, have been homozygous for methionine at polymorphic residue 129 of PRNP. The distinctive neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD can be faithfully recapitulated in Prnp-null transgenic mice homozygous for human PrP M 129 but not V 129, where a distinct prion strain is propagated. Here we model susceptibility of 129 MV heterozygotes, {{the most common}} PRNP genotype, in transgenic mice and show that, remarkably, propagation of type 4 PrPSc {{was not associated with}} characteristic vCJD neuropathology. Depending on the source of the inoculum these mice can develop four distinct disease phenotypes after challenge with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions or vCJD (human-passaged BSE) prions. vCJD-challenged mice had higher attack rates of prion infection than BSE-challenged recipients. These data argue that human PRNP 129 heterozygotes will be more susceptible to infection with vCJD prions than to cattle BSE prions and may present with a neuropathological phenotype distinct from vCJD...|$|R
40|$|The {{histological}} {{features of}} cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are often distributed in the brain in clusters. This study investigated the spatial associations between the clusters of the vacuoles, surviving neurons, and prion protein (PrP) deposits in various brain areas in 11 cases of vCJD. Clusters of vacuoles and surviving neurons were positively correlated in the cerebral cortex but negatively correlated in the dentate gyrus. Clusters of the florid and diffuse type of PrP deposit were not positively correlated with those of either the vacuoles or the surviving neurons although a negative correlation was observed between the <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> and surviving neurons in some cortical areas. Clusters of the florid and diffuse deposits were either negatively correlated or uncorrelated. These data suggest: 1) that clusters of vacuoles in the cerebral cortex {{are associated with the}} presence of surviving neuronal cell bodies, 2) that the clusters of vacuoles are not spatially related to those of the PrP deposits, and 3) different factors are involved in the pathogenesis of the florid and diffuse PrP deposits...|$|R
40|$|Feline spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (FSE) {{is considered to}} be related to bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) and has been reported in domestic cats as well as in captive wild cats including cheetahs, first in the United Kingdom (UK) and then in other European countries. In France, several cases were described in cheetahs either imported from UK or born in France. Here we report details of two other FSE cases in captive cheetah including a 2 (nd) case of FSE in a cheetah born in France, most likely due to maternal transmission. Complete prion protein immunohistochemical study on both brains and peripheral organs showed the close likeness between the two cases. In addition, transmission studies to the TgOvPrP 4 mouse line were also performed, for comparison with the transmission of cattle BSE. The TgOvPrP 4 mouse brains infected with cattle BSE and cheetah FSE revealed similar vacuolar lesion profiles, PrP(d) brain mapping with occurrence of typical <b>florid</b> <b>plaques.</b> Collectively, these data indicate that they harbor the same strain of agent as the cattle BSE agent. This new observation may have some impact on our knowledge of vertical transmission of BSE agent-linked TSEs such as in housecat FSE, or vCJD...|$|R
40|$|The “hot cross bun ” sign {{refers to}} pontine {{cruciform}} hyperintensity on long TR sequences, {{which can be}} observed in multiple-system atrophy, spinocerebellar atrophy types 2 and 3, 1 and in parkinsonism secondary to vasculitis. 2 It has not been previously demonstrated in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), to our knowledge. A 16 -year-old girl, diagnosed with vCJD at age 14 years and de-scribed in detail elsewhere, 3 had progressive clinical deterioration, leading to a persistent vegetative state. MR imaging at 18 months after onset of the disease showed global brain atrophy and widespread re-stricted cortical diffusion (Fig 1 A). Pontine cruciform hyperintensity was seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Fig 1 B). It is believed that the “hot cross bun ” sign results from pontine nuclei neuronal loss and pontocerebellar tract degeneration, with preserved corticospinal tracts. In vCJD, cerebellar involvement is prominent, characterized by marked neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and <b>florid</b> <b>plaques.</b> 4 In addition, spongiform changes have been detected in pontine nuclei. 4 Secondary degeneration of pontocerebellar tracts is therefore likely to occur, thus supporting our observation. The presented case expands the differential diagnosis of neurodegenera-tive conditions in which the “hot cross bun ” sign can be found...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} in the cerebellum in variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) : (i) {{whether the}} pathology affected all laminae; (ii) the spatial topography of the pathology along the folia; (iii) spatial {{correlations between the}} pathological changes; and (iv) whether the pathology {{was similar to that}} of the common methionine/methionine Type 1 subtype of sporadic CJD. Methods: Sequential cerebellar sections of 15 cases of vCJD were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, or immunolabelled with monoclonal antibody 12 F 10 against prion protein (PrP) and studied using spatial pattern analysis. Results: Loss of Purkinje cells was evident compared with control cases. Densities of the vacuolation and the protease-resistant form of prion protein (PrPSc) (diffuse and <b>florid</b> <b>plaques)</b> were greater in the granule cell layer (GL) than the molecular layer (ML). In the ML, vacuoles and PrPSc plaques occurred in clusters regularly distributed along the folia with larger clusters of vacuoles and diffuse plaques in the GL. There was a negative spatial correlation between the vacuoles and the surviving Purkinje cells in the ML. There was a positive spatial correlation between the vacuoles and diffuse PrPSc plaques in the ML and GL. Conclusions: (i) all laminae were affected by the pathology, the GL more severely than the ML; (ii) the pathology was topographically distributed along the folia especially in the Purkinje cell layer and ML; (iii) pathological spread may occur in relation to the loop of anatomical connections involving the cerebellum, thalamus, cerebral cortex and pons; and (iv) there were pathological differences compared with methionine/methionine Type 1 sporadic CJD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} {{pathogenesis}} of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk, transgenic (tg) mice were generated that expressed the prion protein (PrP) of deer containing a glycine at amino acid (aa) 96 and a serine at aa 225 under transcriptional control of the murine PrP promoter. This construct was introduced into murine PrP-deficient mice. As anticipated, neither non-tg mice nor PrP ko mice were susceptible when inoculated intracerebrally (i. c.) or orally with CWD brain material (scrapie pool from six mule deer) and followed for 600 + days (dpi). Deer PrP tg mice were not susceptible to i. c. inoculation with murine scrapie. In contrast, a fatal neurologic disease occurred accompanied by conversion of deer PrPsen to PrPres by western blot and immunohistochemistry after either i. c. inoculation with CWD brain into two lines of tg mice studied (312 + 32  dpi [mean+ 2 standard errors] for the heterozygous tg line 33, 275 + 46  dpi for the heterozygous tg line 39 and 210  dpi for the homozygous tg line 33) or after oral inoculation (381 + 55  dpi for the homozygous tg line 33 and 370 + 26  dpi for the homozygous tg line 39). Kinetically, following oral inoculation of CWD brain, PrPres was observed by day 200 when mice were clinically healthy in the posterior surface of the dorsum of the tongue primarily in serous and mucous glands, in the intestines, in large cells at the splenic marginal zone that anatomically resembled follicular dendritic cells and macrophages and in the olfactory bulb and brain stem but did not occur in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex or hippocampus or in hearts, lungs and livers of infected mice. After 350  days when mice become clinically ill the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus became positive for PrPres and displayed massive spongiosis, neuronal drop out, gliosis and <b>florid</b> <b>plaques...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to quantify the neuropathology of the cerebellar cortex in cases of the prion disease variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Hence, sequential sections of the cerebellum of 15 cases of vCJD were stained with H/E, or immunolabelled with a monoclonal antibody 12 F 10 against prion protein (PrP) and studied using quantitative techniques and spatial pattern analysis. A significant loss of Purkinje cells was evident in all cases. Densities of the vacuolation and the protease resistant form of prion protein (PrPSc) {{in the form of}} diffuse and <b>florid</b> <b>plaques</b> were greater in the granule cell layer (GL) than the molecular layer (ML). In the ML, vacuoles and PrPSc plaques, occurred in clusters which were regularly distributed along the folia, larger clusters of vacuoles and diffuse plaques being present in the GL. There was a negative spatial correlation between the vacuoles and the surviving Purkinje cells in the ML and a positive spatial correlation between the clusters of vacuoles and the diffuse PrPSc plaques in the ML and GL in five and six cases respectively. A canonical variate analysis (CVA) suggested a negative correlation between the densities of the vacuolation in the GL and the diffuse PrPSc plaques in the ML. The data suggest: 1) all laminae of the cerebellar cortex were affected by the pathology of vCJD, the GL more severely than the ML, 2) the pathology was topographically distributed especially in the Purkinje cell layer and GL, 3) pathological spread may occur in relation to a loop of anatomical projections connecting the cerebellum, thalamus, cerebral cortex, and pons, and 4) there are differences in the pathology of the cerebellum in vCJD compared with the M/M 1 subtype of sporadic CJD (sCJD) ...|$|R
