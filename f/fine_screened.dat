40|$|Total {{antioxidant}} {{activity and}} total carotenoid levels were evaluated {{for more than}} 100 common potato (Solanum tuberosum, L.) cultivars grown in the United States, advanced breeding lines from several Western U. S. breeding programs, and 47 related, tuber-bearing species. An initial assessment of variability for antioxidant activity provided baseline information {{to be used for}} potential potato promotion and for the development of new varieties with greater human health benefits. Wide variability in antioxidant levels provided evidence of genetic control of this trait, indicating that it could be possible to breed for enhanced levels of antioxidant compounds in potato. Accessions, varieties, and advanced breeding lines identified in the broad screen as having high antioxidant activity and high total carotenoid levels, were <b>fine</b> <b>screened</b> via HPLC to determine specific phenolic and carotenoid compounds present in potato. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify parents for use in the Texas breeding program to develop potato varieties containing increased levels antioxidant compounds. In the broad screen for total antioxidant activity, the 47 related, tuber-bearing species showed a wider range of variability than the cultivated varieties and breeding lines. Based on the DPPH assay, antioxidant activity ranged from 103 - 648 uM trolox equivalents in the cultivated varieties and advanced breeding lines, while that of the wild species was 42 - 892. HPLC analysis revealed that the phenolic content of the species, and their cultivated counterparts, was primarily composed of caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Other phenolics identified were p-coumaric acid, rutin hydrate, vanillic acid, epicatechin, t-cinnamic acid, gallic acid, and salicylic acid. The highest phenolic content discovered in the accessions was five-fold higher than the highest of the cultivated genotypes. Carotenoid analysis revealed lutein in the accessions, but the yellow-flesh breeding lines were much higher in carotenoids. In addition to the work conducted on antioxidants, an attempt was made to separate intraclonal variants of the potato cultivar Russet Norkotah. Eleven microsatellite primers and 112 AFLP primer combinations failed to produce any reproducible polymorphisms. The inability to detect differences between the clones could be due to the tetraploid nature of the clones or epigenetic differences not detected by the procedures utilized in this study...|$|E

40|$|Screening is a {{well-known}} classification process in the minerals processing industry. The process involves separation of fine particles from coarse particles based on size and is applicable to both dry and <b>fine</b> <b>screening.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>screening</b> is normally carried out wet. Until recently, <b>fine</b> wet <b>screening</b> had been limited to relatively low throughput applications. Developments {{in the recent past}} have seen the evolution of <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> to high capacity applications. It has found application in operations such as closed circuits with a mill in place of hydrocyclones. However, even though developments are increasing, there has been a process model developmental lag. A <b>fine</b> wet <b>screen</b> model {{that can be used for}} unit simulation purposes to predict screen performance outcomes or integration into other models to simulate and predict process performance is necessary.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse <b>screens</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>screens.</b> Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse <b>screens.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Screens</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>screens</b> are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for <b>fine</b> <b>screens</b> are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very <b>fine</b> <b>screens</b> with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or <b>fine</b> <b>screens</b> can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{processing}} is {{the process}} that involves liberation and beneficiation of valuable constituents of an ore. Several physical beneficiation processes exist and one such process is classification. Screens are classification devices sometimes used in the classification stage of closed grinding circuits to separate mill product into different size classes. Poor classification of particles results in reduced throughput, high power consumption and over - grinding. Most {{of the research on}} screening has been done in scalping applications or classification at relatively large cut sizes. There is limited work done on screening at feed sizes of minus 150 μm and there are no robust models for wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> application for use in circuit simulation studies. The effect of feed flow rate, solids concentration and aperture size on wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> performance was evaluated in this study. The range of values of the factors investigated were the feed rate (9, 13, 19, 25, 30 and 35 t/h), screen aperture size (45, 75, 106 and 150 μm) and solids content (30, 40, 50 and 60 %). A pilot Derrick screen plant at Mintek in Johannesburg was used for the experiments on a UG 2 and chromite ore blend. Screen undersize and oversize samples were collected for particle size distribution analysis and mass balance calculations. The samples collected were filtered, de - lumped and split down to masses ranging between 200 and 300 grams for wet screening using the Malvern MasterSizer particle analyser. The results were used to analyse the effect of the investigated factors on the wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> performance. These results were used to develop a wet <b>fine</b> <b>screening</b> model. Results indicate that increased feed flow rate and solids concentration lead to finer cut sizes, reduced sharpness of separation and higher water recoveries to the oversize. An increase in aperture size increased the sharpness of separation and decreased the water recoveries to the oversize. The solids concentration appeared to have a higher effect on cut size than the feed flow rate. The highest cut size and sharpness of separation and lowest water recovery to oversize were attained at the lowest feed rate. The lowest solids concentration produced the best performance with regards to all partition curve properties. The cut size approached the aperture size at the lowest throughput and solids concentration for all aperture sizes. All the efficiency curves exhibited fish hooks at fine particle sizes with the fish hooks becoming more pronounced at higher feed flow rates and solids concentration and smaller aperture sizes. A wet <b>fine</b> <b>screen</b> model that includes multi component ores as well as changes in operating conditions was developed using the 2 - parameter Whiten screen model as a basis. The dimensional analysis approach was applied in developing the sub - models that relate the operating and design parameters to the Whiten model parameters. The dimensional analysis approach was further applied to develop the model that describes the fish hook effect for subsequent incorporation into the overall modified <b>fine</b> <b>screen</b> model. Generally, the modified model is capable of predicting the performance of the wet <b>fine</b> <b>screen</b> reasonably well with minor errors and accommodates for the data that exhibits the fish hook. The model also reduces the fitting process required in the original Whiten model...|$|R

40|$|The {{unbiased}} {{selection of}} the Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) configuration requires that the candidate engines be evaluated against a predetermined set of criteria which must be properly weighted to emphasize critical requirements defined prior to the actual evaluation. The evaluation and selection process involves the following functions: (1) determining if a configuration can satisfy basic STME requirements (yes/no); (2) defining the evaluation criteria; (3) selecting the criteria relative importance or weighting; (4) determining the weighting sensitivities; and (5) establishing a baseline for engine evaluation. The criteria weighting and sensitivities are cost related and are based on mission models and vehicle requirements. The evaluation process {{is used as a}} coarse screen to determine the candidate engines for the parametric studies and as a <b>fine</b> <b>screen</b> to determine concept(s) for conceptual design. The criteria used for the coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>screen</b> evaluation process is shown. The coarse screen process involves verifying that the candidate engines can meet the yes/no screening requirements and a semi-subjective quantitative evaluation. The <b>fine</b> <b>screen</b> engines have to meet all of the yes/no screening gates and are then subjected to a detailed evaluation or assessment using the quantitative cost evaluation processes. The option exists for re-cycling a concept through the quantitative portion of the screening and allows for some degree of optimization.
