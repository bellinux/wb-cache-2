5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo.

5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E

I have a guy flirting with me, and I flirt back.|$|E

500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation.

I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E

500|$|The teaser was {{presented}} to the network on May 2, 2007.

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it.
