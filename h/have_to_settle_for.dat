25|$|It was {{the first}} meeting between the divisional rivals that season. The Eagles were in third place in the NFC East, behind the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins; the Giants were in fourth. The teams went into the game in similar situations, but heading in {{different}} directions. They had playoff hopes, especially since this {{was the first}} 16-game NFL season, but likely would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a wild card berth due to the solid lead the powerful Dallas Cowboys had in the division. Given the similarity of their records, it was likely the outcome would have playoff implications, since the first tie-breaker for a wild card spot is the head-to-head record.|$|E
25|$|Penn State {{came out}} on the opening drive and scored on the fourth play of the game with a 68-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Adam Breneman from QB Christian Hackenberg. Wisconsin's first drive would result in a three–and–out. On the Nittany Lions next drive, they drove down to the Badgers 17-yard line but would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal attempt. The 34-yard field goal attempt by K Sam Ficken was blocked by the Badgers. Wisconsin would take over but after one first down, they would again punt. Penn State would punt they ball back to Wisconsin after their own three–and–out. The Badgers then were driving into Penn State territory as the first quarter came to an end. The Badgers continued their drive and would score on a 4-yard touchdown pass to TE Brian Wozniak from QB Joel Stave. Another three–and–out for the Nittany Lions would lead to another scoring drive for the Badgers. This was after an 11–play drive for the Badgers which was capped with a 20-yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. Penn State answered on their next drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to WR Eugene Lewis from Christian Hackenberg. Wisconsin then got to about midfield but were forced to punt. Penn State then ran one final play before halftime. The game was tied 14–14 at the half.|$|E
25|$|Wisconsin {{started the}} half {{with the ball}} and a big 61-yard {{completion}} to TE Jacob Pedersen from QB Joel Stave would get the Badgers down to the Hoosiers 2-yard line. Wisconsin was unable {{to get the ball}} into the endzone and they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 26-yard field goal by Jack Russell. Indiana then put together their best drive of the game, a 14 play, 70 yard drive but were unable to get into the endzone so they were forced to kick a 23-yard field goal. Once again both team exchanged punts. The Badgers got the ball back with less than a minute left in the third quarter. On the second play of the drive, Jared Abbrederis took a jet sweep handoff and ran 49 yards for his second rushing touchdown of the game. The Badgers led 37–3 {{by the end of the}} third quarter. A three–and–out for the Hooisers would then lead to another scoring drive for the Badgers, a 19-yard touchdown run by RB Corey Clement. Indiana's next drive would again stall right at midfield so they punted the ball back to Wisconsin. The Badgers started the drive at their own 17-yard line and they would use 9 plays (all running plays) to go 83 yards and score on a 21-yard touchdown run by Corey Clement. The Hoosier got the ball with less than two minutes left in the game. They ran the ball four times as time expired. Badgers would win 51–3.|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball. The Badgers put {{together}} a nice 11–play drive that would end with Wisconsin striking first with a 4-yard touchdown run by RB James White. The next two drives (one by each team) would all result in three–and–outs. The Badgers would get the ball back after an interception by quarterback turned safety Tanner McEvoy. BYU would take over after a catch and fumble by WR Kenzel Doe. BYU then put together their own nice 13–play drive but they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal. A Wisconsin three–and–out would give the ball back to BYU and the first quarter {{came to a close}} with Wisconsin leading 7–3. The Cougars would get the ball to the Badgers 32-yard line but they would put the ball rather than attempt a long field goal into the wind. Two plays later, the Badgers would again turn the ball over after an interception by QB Joel Stave. The Couguars would have very good field possession after the interception at their own 40-yard line but the Badgers defense would force a punt. Wisconsin would get down to the BYU 20-yard line but stalled there and settle for a 38-yard field goal by K Jack Russell, the first field goal of his career. The Badgers defense forced BYU to a three–and–out and Wisconsin would score just before halftime on a 5-yard touchdown pass to James White from Joel Stave. Wisconsin led 17–3 at the half.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball and move into Badgers territory. Indiana QB Nate Sudfeld then threw a deep pass that was intercepted by CB Sojourn Shelton at the Wisconsin 7-yard line. On the first play from {{scrimmage}} for the Badgers, RB James White ran 93 yards for the touchdown. On Indiana's second possession, a fumbled snap was recovered by OLB Brendan Kelly at the Indiana 14-yard line. The Badgers would score three plays later on a Melvin Gordon 1-yard touchdown run. Indiana was forced to punt and Wisconsin would settle for a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Another punt for the Hoosiers and the Badgers would again <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal, {{this time it was}} a 36-yard field goal by Jack Russell. Indiana would have the ball near midfield as the first quarter came to a close with Wisconsin leading 20–0. Indiana's drive stalled at about midfield and gave the ball back to Wisconsin. The Badgers would then be forced to punt for the first time of the game. After an Indiana three–and–out, Wisconsin took over at their own 7-yard line. The Badgers put together a very nice 9 plays 93 yard scoring drive that was capped with a 32-yard touchdown run by WR Jared Abbrederis. The Hoosier and Badgers would exchange punts as Indiana then closed out the half by running out the clock. The Badgers led 27–0 at halftime.|$|E

500|$|Producer Tonino Cervi, {{head of the}} {{production}} company Italy Film, {{was the first person}} to propose a film adaptation of the Diabolik comic strip. During this period, Andre Hunebelle's film Fantomas was popular. Cervi was ambiguous when describing his production, stating once that [...] "I think that with a few retouches [...] could turn into an extraordinary character for the silver screen." [...] In another interview, he acknowledged that [...] "nowadays a good film based on Flash Gordon would be a sensational success [...] but it would cost as much as Cleopatra. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> something more modest, so I'm doing Diabolik." [...] Cervi's initial intention was that Diabolik would allow him to finance an anthology film directed by Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, and Akira Kurosawa.|$|E

[...] Critics felt that fault was largely attributed to the developers' lack of experience with the Wii Remote. Jeremy Parish of the magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly compared the initial phase of control implementation to that of the Nintendo DS. Matt Casamassina of IGN also presumed that the first generation of Wii games were of an experimental stage and that potential for refinement had yet to be exploited.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 August 2003, Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson, both British {{university}} professors, legally {{married in}} British Columbia, Canada. However, on their return their marriage was not recognised under British law. Under the subsequent Civil Partnership Act, it was instead {{converted into a}} civil partnership. The couple sued for recognition of their marriage, arguing that it was legal {{in the country in}} which it was executed and met the requirements for recognition of overseas marriages and should thus be treated {{in the same way as}} one between opposite-sex couples. They rejected the conversion of their marriage into a civil partnership believing it to be both practically and symbolically a lesser substitute. They were represented by the civil rights group Liberty. The group's legal director James Welch said it was a matter of fairness and equality for the couple's marriage to be recognised and that they [...] "shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> the second-best option of a civil partnership." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} game {{starting}} middle linebacker Chris Borland was ruled out. The Badgers would start with the ball. On the third play of the game, Wisconsin QB Joel Stave was hit as he attempted a third down pass. The ball fluttered and was off target and was intercepted by Iowa at the Wisconsin 49-yard line. Iowas was unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover as they punted. The Badgers would go three-and-out and punt into the wind. The punt would only travel 23 yards and the Hawkeyes took over at the Wisconsin 39-yard line. Iowa would get down to the Wisconsin 11-yard line but would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 28-yard field goal by K Mike Meyer. Once again, Wisconsin would go three-and-out and punt a 27-yarder into the wind. Wisconsin's defense would force and Iowa three-and-out, Iowa would do the same and then again the Badgers. The first quarter would end with Iowa leading 3–0 in a defensive struggle. The Badgers would start the second quarter at their own 8-yard line. They would finally pick up their first first down of the game on the drive but would later punt. The Hawkeyes would put together a nice 13-play drive that chewed up almost six and a half minutes and got down to the Wisconsin 4-yard line but again Iowa would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 22-yard field goal. The Badgers would answer with a 44-yard touchdown pass to TE Jacob Pedersen from Joel Stave. The Hawkeyes would get the ball with less than two minutes until the half. They would be forced to punt and Wisconsin took over at their own 42-yard line with 1:17 left until half. The Badgers got to the Iowa 36-yard line with one second left. Wisconsin K Jack Russell came out to attempt a 54-yard field goal with the wind at his back. Just before the ball was snapped, Iowa called a timeout but Russell kicked the ball anyway and the kick would have been good. Iowa would use another two timeout to try and [...] "Ice" [...] the kicker. It worked as Russell attempt was short and the Badgers led 7–6 at halftime.|$|E
2500|$|His {{original}} {{portrayal of}} the character in The Silence of the Lambs has been labelled by the AFI as the number-one film villain. At {{the time he was}} offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in M. Butterfly. He had come back to Britain after living {{for a number of years}} in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, [...] "Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed.

2500|$|The British {{ambassador}} Sir Horace Rumbold who met Papen {{in early}} January 1933 expressed [...] "the wonder of an observer that the destinies {{of this great}} country should have been, even for a short time, {{in the hands of}} such a lightweight", commenting that everything Papen had to say was superficial in the extreme and that Papen seemed incapable of critical thinking. Hindenburg told Papen [...] "personally and in strict confidence" [...] that he had his support in attempting to form a new government that would bring in Hitler. As it became increasingly obvious that Schleicher would be unsuccessful in his maneuvering to maintain his chancellorship that would not be defeated by a vote of no-confidence, Papen worked to undermine Schleicher. On 18 January, Papen had lunch at Ribbentrop's house with Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Ernst Röhm where Hitler argued that because the Nazis had done well in a Lander election in Lippe on 15 January that it would be impossible for him to serve as Vice-Chancellor in another government headed by Papen. When Papen replied {{that he did not have}} enough influence with Hindenburg to have Hitler [...] appointed as Chancellor, and he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> being Vice-Chancellor, Hitler stated that he would stick to his [...] "all or nothing" [...] strategy even if it meant the ruin of the Nazi Party.|$|E
