5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} <b>delivering</b> <b>the</b> ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in <b>delivering</b> <b>the</b> ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
