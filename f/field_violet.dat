40|$|High soil {{phosphorus}} (P) {{concentration is}} frequently shown to reduce root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, but {{the influence of}} P on the diversity of colonizing AM fungi is uncertain. We used terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP) of 18 S rDNA and cloning to assess diversity of AM fungi colonizing maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycene max) and <b>field</b> <b>violet</b> (Viola arvensis) at three time points in one season along a P gradient of 10 – 280 mg l− 1 in the field. Percentage AM colonization changed between sampling time points but was not reduced by high soil P except in maize. There {{was no significant difference in}} AM diversity between sampling time points. Diversity was reduced at concentrations of P > 25 mg l− 1, particularly in maize and soybean. Both cloning and T-RFLP indicated differences between AM communities in the different host species. Host species was more important than soil P in determining the AM community, except at the highest P concentration. Our results show that the impact of soil P on the diversity of AM fungi colonizing plants was broadly similar, despite the fact that different plants contained different communities. However, subtle differences in the response of the AM community in each host were evident. ...|$|E

40|$|Semantic <b>field</b> of <b>violet</b> {{colors in}} the works of Stefan Żeromski The {{analyzed}} vocabulary material originates from the works of Stefan Żeromski. The <b>violet</b> <b>field</b> comprises therein the colors named: violet, of the violet, lilac – which are used in different grammatical forms of type and numbers. There are no derivative forms of adverbs and verbs and there is no the lila lexeme. The author considers the vocabulary of this thematic field in its textual usages and context functions – as the result of Żeromski’s message – in order to show, on the one hand, how the writer looks at the real world and, on the other hand, the writer’s creations of the presented world. On the basis of the fragment of expanded colors appearing in Żeromski’s works, the author examines the degree of the writer’s artistic sensitivity and his creative opportunities in the use of colors – of the chosen field of colors. The author also examines relations between linguistic and physical indicators of colors, which were fixed in a given national language (including, inter alia, prototypes of colors), and simultaneously were reflected in the collection of texts of this writer. The above composes the background of Żeromski’s masterly abilities in the paintbrush creation of pictures with the help of linguistic and stylistic means...|$|R

He has also {{published}} a collection of apophthegms of philosophers, generals, orators, and poets, drawn from the Ἰωνιά (his <b>field</b> of <b>violets)</b> of his father Michael, which he has published in Rome in 1519 whom Zacharias Calliergi completed. The volume also contains a small dialogue of its composition, between a bibliophile, a bookseller and the book personified. Many, then, simply attributed the collection to him (Christian Waltz reproduced it in Stuttgart in 1832 under the title Ἀρσενίου Ἰωνιά / Arsenii Violetum). He also left letters. Several texts, including a choice of letters, {{can be found in the}} Hellenic Bibliography of Émile Legrand (Paris, 1885).|$|R

40|$|Manipulation {{of surface}} {{architecture}} of semiconducting nanowires with a control in surface polarity {{is one of}} the important objectives for nanowire based electronic and optoelectronic devices for commercialization. We report the growth of exceptionally high structural and optical quality nonpolar GaN nanowires with controlled and uniform surface morphology and size distribution, for large scale production. The role of O contamination (~ 1 - 10 ^ 5 ppm) in the surface architecture of these nanowires is investigated with the possible mechanism involved. Nonpolar GaN nanowires grown in O rich condition show the inhomogeneous surface morphologies and sizes (50 - 150 nm) while nanowires are having precise sizes of 40 (5) nm and uniform surface morphology, for the samples grown in O reduced condition. Relative O contents are estimated using electron energy loss spectroscopy studies. Size-selective growth of uniform nanowires is also demonstrated, in the O reduced condition, using different catalyst sizes. Photoluminescence studies along with the observation of single-mode waveguide formation, as far <b>field</b> bright <b>violet</b> multiple emission spots, reveal the high optical quality of the nonpolar GaN nanowires grown in the O reduced condition.

40|$|Leaf {{morphology}} {{may vary}} considerably even within {{a branch of}} Passiflora suberosa plants. Leaves are of a typical green type in shaded areas, but in open <b>fields</b> turn into <b>violet,</b> and apparently have greater thickness and trichome density. The proximate causes and the adaptive meaning, if any, {{for the existence of}} the violet morph are still unknown. By cultivating P. suberosa clones under two light regimes (total and partial exposure to sunlight), we consecutively induced (first year) and then reversed (second year) the appearance of the violet morph. We evaluated the corresponding changes in morpho-anatomic and chemical leaf characteristics. Plants that were grown under partial sunlight had a greater size and did not alter their green color, but those grown under total sunlight changed into violet, were smaller in size and their leaves were tougher, thicker, and had a greater number of trichomes. The violet morph had increased anthocyanins and phenolic derivatives. It also showed cellular hypertrophy, a greater number of cell layers in the mesophyll, and a lignified pericycle. Since these morphs are interchangeable by changing light conditions, we inferred that they are not determined by genotypic diversity, but are mainly a result of a physiological response to light stress, and thus part of P. suberosa phenotypic plasticity...|$|R

When I was a girl--(I was once)--I used to delight in Pope's Homer. I do believe I rather enjoyed the killing and slaying, {{specially}} the splitting down the chine! But when I tried to read it again not very long ago, I got tired of this kind of thing. If you had only translated Homer! then I should have had a feast. When a school-girl, going each day with my bag of books into Manchester, I used to like Don Quixote and Sir Charles Grandison with my milk porridge. I must send you only this short letter to-day.

How sweetly the little limpid stream would tinkle to-day; and how the primroses are sitting listening to it and the little birds sipping it! I {{have come to the conclusion}} that bees go more by sight than by scent. As I stand by my peacock with his gloriously gorgeous tail all spread out, a bee comes right at it (very vulgar, but expressive); and I have an Alpine Primula on this window stone brightly in flower, and a bee came and alighted, but went away again at once, not finding the expected honey. I wonder what you do the livelong day, for I know you and idleness are not acquaintances. I am so sorry your favorite places are spoiled. But dear Brantwood will grow prettier and prettier under your care.|$|R
5000|$|The next day, while Charlotte {{rests in}} the pension, Lucy decides to spend a [...] "long morning" [...] in the Basilica of Santa Croce, led by another guest, Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who {{promises}} her an adventure. The older woman immediately takes away Lucy's Baedeker guidebook, which, she says, only touches the surface of things. She will show Lucy the [...] "true Italy." [...] But {{on the way to}} Santa Croce, chattering away, the two take a wrong turn and get lost. After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas, they finally make it back to the square in front of the church only to have the novelist abandon Lucy in pursuit of an old man who, she says, is her [...] "local colour box." [...] Inside the church, Lucy meets the Emersons again. Although their manners are awkward and they are deemed socially unacceptable by the other guests, Lucy likes them and continues to run into them in Florence. One afternoon Lucy witnesses a murder in Florence in the Piazza della Signoria. George Emerson happens to be nearby and catches her when she faints. Lucy asks George to retrieve some photographs of hers that happen to be near the murder site. George, out of confusion, throws her photographs into the river because they were spotted with blood. Lucy observes how boyish George is. As they stop to look over the River Arno before making their way back to the hotel, they have an intimate conversation. After this, Lucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings and partly to keep her cousin happy—Miss Bartlett is wary of the eccentric Emersons, particularly after a comment made by another clergyman, Mr. Eager, that Mr. Emerson [...] "murdered his wife in the sight of God." [...] Later on in the week, a party made up of Beebe, Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Miss Bartlett and Lucy Honeychurch make their way to Fiesole, in carriages driven by Italians. The driver is permitted to invite a woman he claims is his sister onto the box of the carriage, and when he kisses her, Mr. Eager promptly forces the lady to get off the carriage box. Mr. Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love. In the fields, Lucy searches for Mr. Beebe, and asks in poor Italian for the driver to show her the way. Misunderstanding, he leads her to a field where George stands. George is overcome by Lucy's beauty among a <b>field</b> of <b>violets</b> and kisses her, but they are interrupted by Lucy's cousin, who is outraged. Lucy promises Miss Bartlett that she will not tell her mother of the [...] "insult" [...] George has paid her because Miss Bartlett fears she will be blamed. The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy is able to say goodbye to George.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{responds to}} recent conversations on college readiness and precollege credit for writing alternatives. Specifically, this dissertation investigates {{the ways in}} which dispositions associated with college readiness are fostered within AP English Language and Composition courses at multiple locations within a single school district and illustrates the intersections between AP English Language and Composition and first-year writing at different locations to highlight the diversity of practices within AP English Language and Composition. Chapter one traces the histories and intersections of AP English Language and Composition and first-year writing. Chapter two describes the research methods utilized in this study. Chapter three examines {{the ways in which}} policies associated with AP English Language and Composition encourage learning environments focused on developing the dispositions identified in the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing. Chapter four explores the literacy experiences occurring in four AP English Language and Composition classes {{and the ways in which}} these experiences relate to dispositions identified in the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing. Chapter five provides a case study of AP English Language and Composition at <b>Violet</b> <b>Fields</b> High School and finds that the course is effectively serving as a site of first-year writing. Chapter six provides a case study of AP English Language and Composition at Blue Meadows High School and finds that, while the course is challenging, meets the outcomes outlined by the College Board, and covers a variety of material, this course lacks essential elements needed for it to successfully function as a site of first-year writing. Chapter seven provides a case study of AP English Language and Composition at Red River High School and finds the course functioning as a site of first-year writing and as a site of college preparation as the result of efforts to increase enrollment in AP courses through participation in Advance Kentucky. The conclusion addresses implications of the findings of this project for secondary and postsecondary teachers of writing in regards to policy and pedagogy in AP English Language and Composition...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{geochemistry}} {{is a major}} {{branch of}} regional geochemistry. In this thesis are presented the environmental geochemical investigation of Campania Plain and Naples and Salerno Gulfs in South Italy, concerning potential toxic elements and organic compounds distribution. Multivariate and univariate analysis are used to illustrate distribution and sources of elements and organic compounds, both on land and in sea sediments for Naples and Salerno Gulfs. Different pollution impact factors and risk assessment factors are estimated for soils and sediments that easily comes to contact with human beings. The results suggest that Naples city territory, and Naples and Pozzuoli Gulfs are characterized by highly incremental lifetime cancer risk. An attempt of applying in situ Raman spectroscopic detection of pollutants started {{with a series of}} laboratory experiments. With the help of capillary high pressure optical cell, following results are achieved: 1) methane diffusion coefficients in water under high pressure and wide temperature range, and the relationship of diffusion coefficients with temperature was established; 2) Raman intensity ratio of asymmetric stretching vibration (ν 3) and asymmetric bending overtone (2 ν 2) of methane were numerically described vs temperature, pressure and gas phase density; 3) reactions of goethite and magnetite with sulfide solutions under CH 4 and/or CO 2 atmospheres were monitored at room temperature. Pyrrhotite and mackinawite were observed in final products. A demanding of innovative approach to detect organic contaminants encourages various researches to improve in-situ techniques. A new substrate embedding silver nanoparticles into siloxane polymer is used as the platform to generate Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Polymer serves as supporting material of silver nanoparticles as well as a stationary phase. After a short period of extraction, certain partition of organic compounds from aqueous solution accumulates into polymer. When silver nanoparticles is in touch with organic compounds, enhanced Raman scattering is obtained with 104 ~ 106 orders of magnitude. Raman scattering is obtained. Because of these two-steps amplification, SERS, which is typical applied strictly at lab condition, could be compromised when applied for <b>field</b> survey. Crystal <b>violet</b> (CV) is chosen to evaluate extraction properties of polymer. Color “transferring” indicates effective extraction of crystal violet into polymer. Intensive Raman bands include SERS effects and resonance scattering of CV. Low concentration of 4 -nitrophenol (PNP) and 4 -nitroaniline (PNA) in solution (as low as 10 - 7 M) are dropped onto substrate and generate SERS fingerprint. After subtracting Raman bands of polymer and silver salts, clear evidence indicates availability of macro SERS spectra. Micro SERS testifies compounds penetrating as depth as 200 µm from the surface...|$|R
