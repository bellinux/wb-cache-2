50|$|The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is {{a central}} public {{administration}} agency falling {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Office of the Prime Minister, and is charged with the deliberation and determination of financial policies and other important matters of financial supervision - such as the supervision, examination, and sanctioning of financial institutions, and authorization and licensing of financial institutions. Pursuant to the relevant legal provisions, the FSC may direct and supervise the operations of the FSS. In addition to its inherent responsibilities of supervising and sanctioning financial institutions, the FSS supports the operations of the FSC and its adjoined Securities & Futures Commission, and executes those FSC duties which are entrusted by the FSC to the FSS. (Article 37, Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission) Prior to February 2008, the law provided that the Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (the predecessor to the Financial Services Commission) be concurrently appointed as the Governor of the FSS, with the FSS directly assisting the operations of the commission. The revision of the Act in February 2008 clearly distinguishes the policy-making function of the FSC and the supervisory enforcement function of FSS, and provides that different persons be assigned to head each organization to ensure more <b>effective</b> <b>checks</b> and balances (Article 29 (2) of the Act).

Annual data from 39 Latin American and OECD countries over the 1980 - 2005 period show that the aggregate budget surplus (our fiscal variable) and the rate of change of international reserves (our monetary variable) fall significantly before elections and rise afterwards only in Latin America, not in the OECD. Quarterly data allow to identify the electoral period much more precisely, suggesting the presence of cycles in the OECD. Moreover, our measure of institutional constraints on executive discretion turns out to be significant in explaining variations in electoral cycles across regions.

40|$|From a {{theoretical}} viewpoint, political budget cycles (PBC) arise in equilibrium when rational voters are imperfectly {{informed about the}} incumbent's competency and the incumbent enjoys discretionary power over the budget. This paper focuses on the second condition, examining how executive discretion {{is affected by the}} budgetary process under separation of powers. We specifically model PBC in the composition of government spending. The main result is that <b>effective</b> <b>checks</b> and balances in the budgetary process curb PBC. The institutional features of the executive-legislature bargaining game, namely, the actual agenda-setting authority, the status quo location and the degree of legislative oversight and control of the implementation of the budgetary law, play critical roles for the existence and the size of PBC. These results are consistent with recent empirical findings, which show that PBC are more pronounced in developing countries, where there are also less <b>effective</b> <b>checks</b> and balances.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} Arab {{world has}} witnessed uprisings and turmoil {{as a result}} of alleged power-overreaching by political elites. Consequently, people call for democracy with emphasis on constitutionalism, accountability and protection of human rights. Yet, the voice of the judiciary seems not to be heard in championing these values in many Muslim nations despite the clear roles Islam places on the judiciary regarding political matters. This paper therefore analyses the power of judicial review on political questions from the perspective of Islamic jurisprudence. It finds that the power of judicial review and its main institution existed in early Islamic periods after the demise of the Prophet (SAW). The paper concludes that failure to observe judicial review in many contemporary Muslim countries results in the absence of <b>effective</b> <b>checks</b> on the powers of the rulers by the judiciary...|$|E
40|$|In Latin America {{there is}} ample {{evidence}} of exchange rate depreciations after elections. Hence, we turn to the behavior of international reserves over the 1980 - 2005 period to investigate if exchange rates are temporarily stabilized before elections. Using annual, quarterly, and monthly data to define the election year, we find that international reserves fall significantly before elections, which indeed suggests a policy of stabilizing exchange rates. The patterns observed in the region are not replicated in OECD countries. However, once we control for legislative checks and balances on executive discretion in countries with strong compliance with the law, the behavior of both regions becomes remarkably similar. We find that lower <b>effective</b> <b>checks</b> and balances can explain why reserves fall before elections in Latin America. The electoral cycles in reserves and exchange rates in Latin America can be interpreted in terms of the fiscal dominance of monetary policy...|$|E
