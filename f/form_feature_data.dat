40|$|Abstract. Soft fault {{diagnosis}} and tolerance are two challenging problems in linear analog circuit {{fault diagnosis}}. To solve these problems, a phasor analysis based fault modeling method and its theoretical proof are presented at first. Second, to <b>form</b> fault <b>feature</b> <b>data</b> base, the differential voltage phasor ratio (DVPR) is decomposed into real and imaginary parts. Optimal feature selection method and testability analysis method {{are used to}} determine the optimal fault <b>feature</b> <b>data</b> base. Statistical experiments prove that the proposed fault modeling method can improve the fault diagnosis robustness. Then, Multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used for fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified by both simulated and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Investors {{are always}} looking for good stock market trading {{strategies}} to maximize their profit. Under the technical school of thought trading rules are developed by studying historical market data to find trends that investors can exploit. These market trends tend to appear when certain features (narrow range, DOJI, etc.) appear in the historical <b>data.</b> Unfortunately, these <b>features</b> often appear only in partial form, which makes trend analysis challenging. In the paper we co-evolve fuzzy trading rules from market trend features. We show how fuzzy membership functions naturally handle partial <b>form</b> <b>features</b> in historical <b>data.</b> The coevolutionary process is formulated as a zero-sum, competitive game to match how trading strategies are evaluated by brokerage firms. Our experimental results indicate the co-evolutionary process creates trading rule-bases that produce positive returns when evaluated using actual stock market data. I...|$|R

The scores {{recorded in the}} user's profile provide {{the basis of the}} training data for the personal mixed neural networks, i.e., the long-term and short-term ANN. The score record contains the music ID, score, and playing date. Through a database search using the music ID, the system first obtains the music features that are associated with it. These <b>features</b> <b>form</b> training <b>data</b> input, which include the basic music features that the user has assigned the score to. It is intuitive to say that the output is the associated score value. The date of the training data for the long-term ANN will be older. The training process uses supervised learning. The bias weight adjustment uses error back-propagation.|$|R

Neurochemical sensing of dopamine and its metabolites {{is provided by}} voltammetry. Five versions of the passive device were fabricated with platinum working electrode areas as small as 4 mm 2 and silver/silver chloride pseudo-reference electrodes. Living human neuron cultures survived and produced data on passive devices throughout a study period of seventy-five days. Calibration curves for dopamine taken in culture media with equipment optimized for the sensors suggests detection limits for dopamine below 100 nM. To minimize system noise, prototype devices incorporating active circuitry were developed. The active devices are formed by post-processing standard foundry-fabricated CMOS circuits from the MOSIS service to <b>form</b> the sensor-specific <b>features.</b> <b>Data</b> from these devices, and early results from in vivo electrochemical neurosensors, will be presented.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a knowledge-based process selection system for cold formed components with rotationally symmetric and rotationally non-symmetric geometries. The process knowledge base requires information and data related to formable geometric shapes, available cold forming operations, and formability rules and forming limits relating to material types. A <b>forming</b> <b>feature</b> representation has been developed to connect formable geometries with available forming operations. A conceptual classification of single and combined <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> has also been developed to represent both rotationally symmetric and rotationally non-symmetric components. A link between operations capable of producing single <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> and combined <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> are obtained using reasoning based on geometric considerations. Formability of <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> is assessed by formability rules and forming limits as a function of material type.

This paper {{focuses on the}} understanding of shape style represented by <b>form</b> <b>features</b> and explores the influence of <b>form</b> <b>features</b> on a style by the topological structure and geometric variation. The relationship between the geometry of the <b>form</b> <b>feature</b> and the style it characterised is analysized {{in terms of a}} number of remodelling processes of typical product shape chosen. Even though the influence of feature geometry on design style have been analysed based on two groups of objects, the essence explored could be applicable for the understanding of design style in a broad sense. The results of the present paper may help to the development of an advanced styling tool for product form giving and shape sculpting in industrial design.

To track persons with a camera and send the tracking data to another camera, the proposed system uses a hierarchical human model that comprises a head, a torso, and legs.

5000|$|The term [...] "feature" [...] implies {{different}} meanings in different engineering disciplines. This {{has resulted in}} many ambiguous definitions for feature. A feature, in computer-aided design (CAD), usually refers to a region of a part with some interesting geometric or topological properties. These are more precisely called <b>form</b> <b>features.</b> <b>Form</b> <b>features</b> contain both shape information and parametric information of a region of interest. They are now ubiquitous in most current CAD software, where they are used as the primary means of creating 3D geometric models. Examples of <b>form</b> <b>features</b> are extruded boss, loft, etc. <b>Form</b> <b>feature</b> {{is not the only}} type of feature that is discussed in CAD literature. Sometimes a part's functional or manufacturing features of the subject of attention. Although it is quite possible to see <b>form</b> <b>features</b> and manufacturing features are called by the same name, they are not exactly the same concepts. For example, one may either use the name [...] "pocket" [...] to refer to a swept cut on the boundary of a part model, or to refer to a trace left on the part boundary by a specific machining operation. The former is exclusively concerned with a geometric shape whereas the latter is concerned with both the geometric shape and a manufacturing operation, needing more parameters in its definition. As such, a manufacturing feature can be minimally defined as a <b>form</b> <b>feature</b> (if it has a form that can uniquely represent it), but not necessarily vice versa (forms can be interpreted differently in different manufacturing domains). Machining features are an important subset of manufacturing features. A machining feature can be regarded as the volume swept by a [...] "cutting" [...] tool, which is always a negative (subtracted) volume. Finally, there is also the concept of assembly feature, which encodes the assembly method between connected components.|$|R

They also defined a framework for mapping these domain independent features to a specific domain of interest.|$|R
