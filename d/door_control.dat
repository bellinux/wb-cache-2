25|$|The fleet {{has been}} {{refurbished}} several times, and several liveries have been used, the original livery used at opening was yellow and white. A mid-life refurbishment of the fleet, carried out in-house, {{took place between}} 1995 and 2000, and a red, green or blue livery was adopted. Another full refurbishment of the fleet took place between 2010 and 2015: known as the 'three-quarter-life' refurbishment, the Metrocars were refurbished by Wabtec Rail at its Doncaster facility, with the main goal being to extend their service life until 2025. Each car was stripped down to its frame and built back up again, {{with the addition of}} improved disabled access, new <b>door</b> <b>control</b> systems, and renewed interiors, seating and lighting. A new yellow and black livery was also adopted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the ScotRail {{sector of}} British Rail began a major {{refurbishment}} programme for 50 of the 25-year-old units. To conform to contemporary {{health and safety}} standards the asbestos insulation was removed. Among the many changes introduced were connecting doors between coaches and {{a new type of}} push button passenger <b>door</b> <b>control,</b> along with all-new interiors and new fluorescent lighting. Most units also received new [...] "hopper-style" [...] windows. The new seating was controversial - it was almost identical to that of the Class 314, albeit with a 2+2 configuration. This allowed for many more standing passengers, but with far fewer seats than previously. The original seating was deep sprung and (arguably) far more comfortable. [...] In addition, the original heating, which was provided by panelled in heaters beneath the seats, was replaced by heaters in longitudinal trunking along the lower bodyside, with the spaces under the new seats opened up. [...] This produced draughts and reduced passenger legroom in the window seats.|$|E
2500|$|The ATC {{system is}} derived from Deutsche Bahn's Linienzugbeeinflussung (LZB), with {{additional}} parts added for <b>door</b> <b>control</b> and other safety systems. It works by transmitting data from the train to the interlocking station through two cables installed in the track between the rails. About {{one year after the}} U3 line has entered service, it is intended to convert U2 line to full ATC operations; however, during the first year there will be mixed traffic of ATC-run driverless DT3 units on U3 courses and conventionally run DT1 and DT2 units on U2 and U21 courses between Rathenauplatz and Rothenburger Straße. This has not been done anywhere before and therefore the ATC system had to be specifically designed and developed to allow for this mixed operation mode. [...] All train operations will be automated, including normal operation, coupling and uncoupling of two DT3 units in storage tracks as well as at platforms, moving trains from and to storage tracks as well as reversing trains at platforms and in storage tracks.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, The IRT {{platforms}} could not handle a full ten car train. Thus, the manual <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> of the Deck Roof were reliable, as the side vestibule doors {{at either end}} of the train can be opened manually even if the entire car isn't on the platform. However, two conductors were required for ooperation of manual <b>door</b> <b>controlled</b> cars.|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of {{automotive}} electronics, <b>Door</b> <b>Control</b> Unit (DCU) is a generic term for an embedded system that controls a number of electrical systems associated with an advanced motor vehicle. An advanced motor vehicle consists {{of a number of}} ECUs (Electrical Control Units), and the <b>Door</b> <b>Control</b> Unit (DCU) is an important one among them.|$|E
50|$|The Class 614 has <b>door</b> <b>control</b> with {{selective}} {{door opening}} and door sensory systems. The doors, which on the 624/634 {{were not always}} easy to open, are assisted by compressed air. As part of modernisation in the mid-90s a warning tone device was retrofitted and - unlike the 624 - also an anti-jam system. Some of the vehicles also have warning lights {{in the area of the}} door. Shortly after the turn of the millennium several 614's were converted to TAV (technikbasierte Abfertigungsverfahren) automatic door operation. <b>Door</b> <b>control</b> computers were installed, door handles removed and replaced by door opening buttons and photoelectric beams. Because the new <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system was not very reliable and the vehicles were approaching the end of their service life the TAV installation programme was halted after a few years, even befhore the end of the remotoring programme.|$|E

50|$|From the 2010/2011 {{timetable}} {{change on}} 12 December 2010, the S 1 services were drawn by locomotives {{of the class}} 145. This should result in a four-minute reduction in travel time over the whole route. Since the locomotives do not have sufficient <b>door</b> <b>control</b> for the new double-deck carriages, the trains had attendants the train at each platform. Since the end of 2011, Siemens ES64U2 (class 182) locomotives have replaced the class 145 locomotives. The class 182 locomotives were taken over by DB Regio from DB Schenker and equipped with a local transport package (including a train destination display and side-selective <b>door</b> <b>control).</b>|$|E
50|$|Every set {{of doors}} {{has its own}} set of guard-operated <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> behind a {{lockable}} panel.

50|$|The fleet {{underwent}} a programme of refurbishment from 2017, {{with the first}} set, 5501, treated in April 2017. Refurbishment includes the addition of external passenger <b>door</b> <b>control</b> buttons, full-colour LED destination display panels, and a new blue livery.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s PKP needed {{locomotives}} {{for passenger}} service. Since the freight service declined, the ET22 {{could be used}} for passenger service. They were fitted with main reservoir pipes required for the automatic <b>door</b> <b>control</b> of the passenger coaches.|$|E
50|$|Since being introduced, {{the units}} have {{undergone}} works attention, {{which included the}} fitting of CCTV surveillance equipment. They have all undergone a further internal refurbishment which has seen them receive new flooring, new harder seating (though keeping the London Midland trim). All units are also now receiving new external <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{fleet of}} 83 ten-car E233 series sets was {{introduced}} on the Keihin-Tohoku and Negishi lines from autumn 2007, replacing the 209 series EMUs previously used from 1993 until 2010. The first set was delivered in August 2007. The main difference over the earlier E233-0 series {{is the absence}} of passenger <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R

25|$|Four four-car 6th-batch {{sets were}} {{introduced}} on 16 March 1996 {{for use on}} the Kawagoe Line and newly electrified southern section of the Hachikō Line. These sets (numbers 61 to 64) are based at JR East's Kawagoe depot. While visually similar to the original 209-0 sub-series, these sets differ in having passenger-operated <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1938, forty-eight {{of these}} cars were rebuilt when the District line was standardising its post-1923 stock and were {{reclassified}} as Q23 Stock. A {{major part of}} the Q Stock project was the replacement of the potentially dangerous manually operated sliding doors (which could be opened by passengers between stations) with air operated <b>doors</b> <b>controlled</b> by the guard.|$|R
50|$|One 4-car 103-3500 series set {{was formed}} in December 1995 from surplus 103-0 series cars to augment the fleet ahead of Hachikō Line {{electrification}} in March 1996. As with the 103-3000 series sets, passenger-operated <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> were fitted. The motor/trailer car configuration differed {{from that of the}} 103-3000 series sets. The set was withdrawn in March 2005.|$|R

50|$|In the 1920s the Hi-V fleet {{was being}} {{converted}} to multiple unit <b>door</b> <b>control,</b> {{with the exception}} of all 50 of the Deck Roofs and some Gibbs and Hedley cars. The Deckroofs were often placed {{at either end of the}} train so that ten car trains of Hi-Vs could run.|$|E
50|$|Great Western Railway High Speed Train sets have SDO {{at almost}} all door locations. These trains {{are of the}} slam door variety and fitted with the Central Door Locking system. The guard {{operates}} the SDO system from most <b>door</b> <b>control</b> panels throughout the train. The guard can then either de-select doors {{in front of that}} location or behind.|$|E
5000|$|The R15s were {{numbered}} 5953-5999 & 6200-6252. The {{cars were}} the first to feature round [...] "turtle-back" [...] roofs and have the conductors' <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> located inside the motorman's cabs, (as opposed to on the outsides as they were on the R12s and R14s). Additionally, the R15s featured porthole door windows, similar to those found on the R11s.|$|R
5000|$|The Victoria {{line was}} to be {{equipped}} for automatic operation, and the driver {{was replaced by a}} [...] "train operator", with responsibility for shutting the doors, and then pressing two buttons simultaneously to start the train, after which the train would move under automatic control until the next station was reached. However, a single controller to allow the trains to be driven manually in the depot or in emergency while in service was provided. This incorporated both traction <b>control</b> and braking. <b>Door</b> <b>controls</b> were provided in the cabs, and a facility to isolate either of the two units from the leading cab was also included. For the first time on tube stock, all control circuits were switched by cam-operated micro-switches. They were used on the traction and brake controller, the disconnecting units, the fault isolating switches, the <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> and other control equipment, and resulted in a significant reduction in the routine electrical inspection needing to be carried out.|$|R
