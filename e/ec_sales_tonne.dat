40|$|Poster Session 2 : no. POS 2 - 85 INTRODUCTION: Electronic {{cigarette}} (EC) {{is increasingly}} popular and may undermine support for tobacco control policies. We investigated if disagreement on EC regulation {{was associated with}} less support for stronger tobacco control policies in Hong Kong. METHODS: In 2015, 4517 subjects (males 48. 5 %; mean age 50. 4, SD 17. 7 years) with oversampling of current and ex-smokers were interviewed through landline random digit dialing. Disagreements on 4 proposed EC regulations on publicity, use in smokefree area, sales to minors, and nicotine- free <b>EC</b> <b>sales</b> were recorded. Support for 8 stronger tobacco control policies were assessed. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of support for stronger tobacco control in relation to disagreement (vs agreement) on EC regulation, adjusting for age, sex, family income, smoking status, smoking family members and knowledge on secondhand smoke. Data were weighted by the distribution of sex, age, and smoking status according to Hong Kong census data. RESULTS: Disagreement on EC regulation ranged from 6. 2 % to 28. 3 %. Each disagreement {{was significantly associated with}} lower AOR (0. 24 - 0. 53) for annual tobacco tax increase, smokefree area extension and banning tobacco display in retail stores. Commonly lower AORs (0. 26 - 0. 61) for banning smoking in all public outdoor areas, showing smoking related diseases, enlarging pictorial warning on cigarette packs, total ban on tobacco sales and use were observed in relation to disagreement. Compared with agreement on all 4 EC regulations, disagreement on any EC regulation was significantly associated with lower AORs of 5 supporting stronger tobacco control policies, i. e. increasing tobacco tax annually (0. 36), banning smoking in all public outdoor areas (0. 49), banning tobacco display in retail stores (0. 44), total ban on tobacco sales (0. 56) and use (0. 55). Similar pattern of lower AORs were observed for disagreement on all EC regulations compared with agreeing all. CONCLUSIONS: Disagreement on EC regulation was associated with less support for stronger tobacco control policy. Future research should assess whether advocacy for EC regulation could also garner public support for tobacco control...|$|R

40|$|Background: A major {{characteristic}} of the electronic cigarette (EC) market is {{the availability of a}} large number of different flavours. This has been criticised by the public health authorities, some of whom believe that diverse flavours will attract young users and that ECs are a gateway to smoking. At the same time, several reports in the news media mention that the main purpose of flavour marketing is to attract youngsters. The importance of flavourings and their patterns of use by EC consumers have not been adequately evaluated, therefore, the purpose of this survey was to examine and understand the impact of flavourings in the EC experience of dedicated users. Methods: A questionnaire was prepared and uploaded in an online survey tool. EC users were asked to participate irrespective of their current smoking status. Participants were divided according to their smoking status at the time of participation in two subgroups: former smokers and current smokers. Results: In total, 4, 618 participants were included in the analysis, with 4, 515 reporting current smoking status. The vast majority (91. 1 %) were former smokers, while current smokers had reduced smoking consumption from 20 to 4 cigarettes per day. Both subgroups had a median smoking history of 22 years and had been using ECs for 12 months. On average they were using three different types of liquid flavours on a regular basis, with former smokers switching between flavours more frequently compared to current smokers; 69. 2 % of the former subgroup reported doing so on a daily basis or within the day. Fruit flavours were more popular at the time of participation, while tobacco flavours were more popular at initiation of EC use. On a scale from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important) participants answered that variability of flavours was “very important” (score = 4) in their effort to reduce or quit smoking. The majority reported that restricting variability will make ECs less enjoyable and more boring, while 48. 5 % mentioned that it would increase craving for cigarettes and 39. 7 % said that it would have been less likely for them to reduce or quit smoking. The number of flavours used was independently associated with smoking cessation. Conclusions: The results of this survey of dedicated users indicate that flavours are marketed in order to satisfy vapers’ demand. They appear to contribute to both perceived pleasure and the effort to reduce cigarette consumption or quit smoking. Due to the fact that adoption of ECs by youngsters is currently minimal, it seems that implementing regulatory restrictions to flavours could cause harm to current vapers while no public health benefits would be observed in youngsters. Therefore, flavours variability should be maintained; any potential future risk for youngsters being attracted to ECs can be sufficiently minimized by strictly prohibiting <b>EC</b> <b>sales</b> in this population group...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of groundwater discharge to external influences such as rainfall is an often neglected part {{of water and}} solute balances in wetlands. Here we develop a new field platform for long-term continuous 222 Rn and electrical conductivity (<b>EC)</b> measurements at <b>Sale</b> Wetland, Australia to study the {{response of}} groundwater discharge to storm and flood events. The field measurements, combined with dynamic mass-balance modelling, demonstrate that the groundwater flux can increase from 3 to ~ 20 mmd- 1 following storms and up to 5 mmd- 1 on the receding limb of floods. The groundwater pulses are likely produced by activation of local groundwater flow paths by water ponding on the surrounding flood plains. While 222 Rn is a sensitive tracer for quantifying transient groundwater discharge, the mass-balance used to estimate fluxes is sensitive to parameterisation of gas exchange (k) with the atmosphere. Comparison of six equations for calculating k showed that, based on parameterisation of k alone, the groundwater flux estimate could vary by 58 %. This work shows that neglecting transient processes will lead to errors in water and solute flux estimates based on infrequent point measurements. This could be particularly important for surface waters connected to contaminated or saline groundwater systems...|$|R
40|$|The flora of the Swat Valley is {{composed}} of 1550 higher plant species of which a remarkable 350 are medicinally important (out of c. 6000 species with 700 of medicinal value {{for the whole of}} Pakistan). The diverse geographic, topographic and climatic conditions in the alpine and subalpine regions of Swat are responsible for its biodiversity richness. The present study on the medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) was conducted in the alpine and subalpine regions of the Swat Valley (2007 - 2009) in order to evaluate their current threats (both anthropogenic and natural), population density, indigenous uses (along with trade importance in the local economy) and impact of climate change. However, the fragility of these highland ecosystems makes this biodiversity vulnerable. The analysis revealed 177 species belonging to 70 families with major families of Rosaceae containing 18 species followed by Lamiaceae 16 species, Asteraceae 15, Ranunculaceae 12 and Polygonaceae with 9 species. The driving forces in the increasing decline of these species were found to be: overgrazing, overexploitation, timber logging, fuelwood collection and agriculture expansion. The root causes behind these driving forces are: the lack of economic development, population pressure, poverty, illiteracy and basic unawareness of sustainability and ecosystem importance. The dominant plant community types in these regions were recorded with their life form (biological spectrum), showing that the flora was of Hemicrypto-therophytic nature with 36. 72 % (hemicryptophytes) and 14. 68 % (therophytes). The leaf spectra analysis of these plants revealed that microphyll was dominant (100 species) followed by nanophyll (38 species) and mesophyll (30 species). The palatability analysis revealed that 88 % plants were palatable, 34 % were highly palatable and 6. 6 % were non-palatable. The impact of climate change under current and future scenarios were analysed and indicates that Viola canescens, Fragaria nubicola and Bistorta amplexicaulis would profoundly shift their distribution towards north in comparison to their present distribution while Juniperus communis and Betula utilis have not shown large shifting towards north because of their different climatic needs. Viola canescens would extend whereas Juniperus communis would reduce its distribution. The indigenous knowledge indicates that 93 species belonging to 49 families were of immense importance to the basic health needs of these communities including 19 species used as ethno- veterinary medicines. The market analysis of these plants shows that the most expensive plants are Aconitum heterophyllum, Morchella esculenta and Viola canescens with high demand in the local markets and sporadic exportation to the Middle East, especially to the UAE. The annual tonnage sale of 23 species in the local markets sampled was 196 tonnes per annum with an average amount of 8. 52 tonnes. Berberis Iyceum, Saussurea atkinsonii and Viola canescens are the most wanted plants in the area and are the top selling drugs in the local market reaching an annual mean <b>sale</b> of 1 <b>tonne</b> per retailer. Based on the findings of this research, the MAPs of these regions are declining sharply on an enormous scale due to habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and habitat loss. Government intervention along with the active involvement of local communities is needed in order to ensure sustainable utilisation without risking their local extinction. The study revealed an urgent need to conserve these valuable taxa in situ in the form of national parks, nature reserves and game reserves, and ex situ in the form of botanical gardens, seed banks and other germplasm collections. In addition to the above threat, improper and untimely government policies with poor implementation procedures, compounded by corruption and the illicit influence for resource-use patterns among local and national departments, are further sharply aggravating this decline.
