5|$|In 1937 Wilson {{settled for}} a while in the United States, {{teaching}} at the Curtis Institute of Music. He retired from singing and returned to the United Kingdom in 1942 where he began a second career as an administrator. He initially worked for the BBC, then after the war was appointed music director of the newly created Arts Council of Great Britain; in 1948 he was knighted for his services in that post. That same year he became the BBC's director of music, and infamously engineered the enforced retirement of the BBC Symphony Orchestra's chief conductor, Adrian Boult. The following year he became deputy <b>general</b> <b>administrator</b> of the Royal Opera House, in which post he secured the premiere staging of Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress in 1951. Unhappy with being subordinate to the Royal Opera's <b>general</b> <b>administrator,</b> David Webster, Wilson resigned from his post in June 1955 and started a campaign against homosexuals in the musical profession. Wilson ended his career as principal of the Birmingham School of Music, 1957–1960.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Sir David Webster, {{who ran the}} Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet {{companies}} at Covent Garden, invited Davis to succeed Sir Georg Solti as principal conductor of the opera. At about the same time, the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director, but Davis felt that if Covent Garden needed him, it was his duty {{to take on the}} post. Webster's vision was that Davis and the stage director Sir Peter Hall, formerly of the Royal Shakespeare Company, would work in equal partnership as musical director and director of productions. After early successes together, including the première of Michael Tippett's The Knot Garden in December 1970, Hall left to succeed Laurence Olivier as director of the National Theatre. Webster had retired by that time, leaving Davis, together with Webster's successor as <b>General</b> <b>Administrator,</b> Sir John Tooley, to run the Royal Opera.|$|E

Wilson was responsible for securing the premiere of Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress at the Royal Opera House in 1951. Wilson resented being subordinate to the <b>general</b> <b>administrator,</b> David Webster, and he resigned from his Royal Opera House post in June 1955. The following month {{it was announced that}} he was launching [...] "a campaign against homosexuality in British music" [...] and was quoted as saying: [...] "The influence of perverts in the world of music has grown beyond all measure.

2500|$|Though {{the revolutionary}} {{government}} on Samos wished {{to become part}} of Greece, this did not happen until late 1914 when a <b>General</b> <b>Administrator</b> was sent from Athens to take charge. [...] In the meantime, the Samian government issued several sets of stamps. [...] The first, issued on November 14, 1912, was a set of three depicting a map of Samos with the inscription ΠΡΟΣΩΡΙΝΟΝ ΤΑΧΥΔΡΟΜΕΙΟΝ ΣΑΜΟΥ (Provisional Post Office of Samos). [...] All were imperforate and printed locally by hand. [...] The second, depicting a profile of Hermes, was printed by Stangel & Co. and released in two batches. [...] The first batch, issued on November 26, consisted of five values (1 lepton, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta) with perforation 11½; the second, issued on December 22, was overprinted with ΕΛΛΑΣ in boldface type. [...] It included the values from the first batch plus a 1 drachma value. [...] This would be known as the [...] "Large ΕΛΛΑΣ" [...] overprint to distinguish it from a second, thinner overprint applied in February 1914 (the [...] "Thin ΕΛΛΑΣ"). A third set, the [...] "castles" [...] issue, was released on January 4, 1913. [...] Consisting of five values (1 drachma, 2, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae), it commemorated both an 1824 Greek victory over the Ottoman Empire at Gerontas Bay and the 1912 vote for union with Greece. [...] The stamps were printed at the shop of lithographer O.K. Travlos in Vathy and signed ΘΣ, the initials of Samian president Themistoklis Sophoulis. [...] Red ink was used for the signatures on all values except the 25 drachmae, on which black ink was used. [...] An illustrated postal card was issued along with the Hermes set; printed on one side was the 5 lepta value from that set and the Greek coat of arms, the other side depicted Vathy palace and portraits of Sophoulis and Lykourgos Logothetis, the island's leader in the Greek War of Independence. [...] All issues were replaced by the ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ and Campaign stamps when Greece assumed control of Samos. [...] In December 1914 some of the Hermes and [...] "castles" [...] stamps were re-issued as charity stamps, with the overprint Γενική Διοίκησις Σάμου (General Administration of Samos).|$|E
6000|$|Magnus was triumphantly {{received}} as King in Denmark. The only unfortunate thing was, that Svein Estrithson, the exile son of Ulf, Knut's Brother-in-law, whom Knut, as we saw, had summarily killed twelve years before, {{emerged from his}} exile in Sweden in a flattering form; and proposed that Magnus should make him Jarl of Denmark, and <b>general</b> <b>administrator</b> there, in his own stead. To which the sanguine Magnus, in spite of advice to the contrary, insisted on acceding. [...] "Too powerful a Jarl," [...] said Einar Tamberskelver--the same Einar whose bow was heard to break in Olaf Tryggveson's last battle ("Norway breaking from thy hand, King!"), who had now become Magnus's chief man, and had long been among the highest chiefs in Norway; [...] "too powerful a Jarl," [...] said Einar earnestly. But Magnus disregarded it; and a troublesome experience had to teach {{him that it was}} true. In about a year, crafty Svein, bringing ends to meet, got himself declared King of Denmark for his own behoof, instead of Jarl for another's: and had to be beaten and driven out by Magnus. Beaten every year; but almost always returned next year, for a new beating,--almost, though not altogether; having at length got one dreadful smashing-down and half-killing, which held him quiet for a while,--so long as Magnus lived. Nay in the end, he made good his point, as if by mere patience in being beaten; and did become King himself, and progenitor of all the Kings that followed. King Svein Estrithson; so called from Astrid or Estrith, his mother, the great Knut's sister, daughter of Svein Forkbeard by that amazing Sigrid the Proud, who burnt those two ineligible suitors of hers both at once, and got a switch on the face from Olaf Tryggveson, which proved the death of that high man.|$|E
