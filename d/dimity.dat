5|$|Maddison Gae Elliott {{was born}} on 3 November 1998 in Newcastle, New South Wales. She has right side {{cerebral}} palsy {{as a result of}} a neonatal stroke, and was diagnosed with the condition when she was four years old. In addition to swimming, she participated in athletics, and by 2010 held six Australian age group classification records. In 2016, she was living in Gillieston Heights, New South Wales, and a year 12 student at Bishop Tyrrell Anglican College. She has an older sister <b>Dimity</b> Elliott.|$|E

60|$|On the 15th, {{at eight}} o'clock in the morning, her trial began before the Revolutionary Tribunal. A murmur ran through the hall as she {{appeared}} in her gown of grey-striped <b>dimity,</b> composed and calm--always calm.|$|E
60|$|At last--we hurry {{down the}} slope of James' misfortunes--the real days of Houghton's Great Sales began. Houghton's Great Bargain Events were really events. After some years of hanging on, he let go splendidly. He marked down his prints, his chintzes, his <b>dimities</b> and his veilings with a grand and lavish hand. Bang went his blue pencil through 3/11, and nobly he subscribed 1/0-3/4. Prices fell like nuts. A lofty one-and-eleven rolled down to six-three, 1/6 magically shrank into 4-3/4d, whilst good solid prints exposed {{themselves}} at 3-3/4d per yard.|$|R

Maria's sister Pepita also starts at San Flamingo School (which viewers see the inside of for the first time), while Glimmer cooks apple pie and custard (his Aunt <b>Dimity's</b> very own recipe) but Scrap has got the pages of his {{cookbook}} mixed up and Limo has to put four more numbers (24, 38, 77 and 96) back into the number square.|$|R

6000|$|... --A nurse {{carrying}} No. 4 junior, who {{was sound}} asleep: {{and a huge}} basket containing saucepans, bottles of milk, parcels of infants' food, certain <b>dimity</b> napkins, a child's coral, and a little horse belonging to No. 4 senior.|$|E
60|$|Having {{changed into}} a gray-striped <b>dimity</b> gown--you observe this further manifestation of a calm so {{complete}} that it admits of no departure from the ordinary habits of life--she goes forth to deliver in person this second letter, the knife concealed {{in the folds of}} the muslin fichu crossed high upon her breast.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Petticoat influence' {{is a great}} reproach, [...] Which {{even those}} who obey would fain be thought [...] To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach; [...] But since beneath it upon earth we are brought, [...] By various joltings of life's hackney coach, [...] I for one venerate a petticoat-- [...] A garment of a mystical sublimity, [...] No matter whether russet, silk, or <b>dimity.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There! You {{will take}} no more roll? You are better, now, but {{you will not be}} sorry to go to your bed," [...] said Mrs. Aylward, taking up a candle, and guiding her along the passage up a long stair to a pretty room wainscoted and curtained with fresh white <b>dimity,</b> and the window showing the young moon pale {{in the light of the}} western sky.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{favourite}} {{science was}} the mathematical, [...] Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity, [...] Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all, [...] Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity; [...] In short, {{in all things}} she was fairly what I call [...] A prodigy--her morning dress was <b>dimity,</b> [...] Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin, [...] And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.|$|E
60|$|The {{little white}} <b>dimity</b> bed was as smooth and trim {{as on the}} day previous, when Betty's own hands had helped to make it. Two little trunks were corded in {{one end of the}} room; and on the table before the window--on the pincushion the great fat pincushion lined with pink inside, and twilled like a lady's nightcap--lay a letter. It had been reposing there {{probably}} all night.|$|E
60|$|Abby was {{a slender}} girl of fifteen, in a short-waisted gingham gown, with a muslin tucker, <b>dimity</b> apron, and morocco shoes {{on a pair}} of small feet demurely crossed before her. A blue-eyed, brown-haired little creature, with a broad brow, and a sweet mouth, evidently both {{intelligent}} and affectionate; for she heartily enjoyed the story, and answered her father's approving glances with a face full of the loving reverence so beautiful to see.|$|E
60|$|Loo smiled, {{nodded and}} disappeared, {{followed}} by Mrs Marrot, who went, like a sensible woman, {{to see that}} her alarmed domestic was all right. While she was away John went to the crib and kissed the rosy cheek of his sleeping boy. Then he bent over the bed with the white <b>dimity</b> curtains to Miss Gertie's forehead, for which purpose he had to remove a mass of curly hair with his big brown hand.|$|E
60|$|Talk of {{earthquakes}}! {{not all the}} earthquakes {{that have}} rumbled in Ecuador or toppled over the spires and dwellings of Peru could compare, {{in the matter of}} dogged pertinacity, with that earthquake which diurnally and hourly shocked little Gertie's dwelling, quivered the white <b>dimity</b> curtains of little Gertie's bed and shook little Gertie's frame. A graceful, rounded little frame it was; yet strong, and firmly knit--perhaps in consequence of its having been from infancy so constantly and so well shaken together.|$|E
60|$|And there sat by {{the empty}} fireplace, which {{was filled with a}} pot of sweet herbs, the nicest old woman that ever was seen, in her red petticoat, and short <b>dimity</b> bedgown, and clean white cap, with a black silk {{handkerchief}} over it, tied under her chin. At her feet sat the grandfather of all the cats; and opposite her sat, on two benches, twelve or fourteen neat, rosy, chubby little children, learning their Chris-cross-row; and gabble enough they made about it.|$|E
6000|$|At waking, lo! all {{was again}} changed. The light of high day {{surrounded}} me; not, indeed, a warm, summer light, but the leaden gloom of raw and blustering autumn. I felt sure now that I {{was in the}} pensionnat--sure by the beating rain on the casement; sure by the [...] "wuther" [...] of wind amongst trees, denoting a garden outside; sure by the chill, the whiteness, the solitude, amidst which I lay. I say whiteness--for the <b>dimity</b> curtains, dropped before a French bed, bounded my view.|$|E
60|$|His first {{adornment}} was the sleeveless <b>dimity</b> B.V.D. undershirt, {{in which}} he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard at a civic pageant. He never put on B.V.D.'s without thanking the God of Progress that he didn't wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments, like his father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second embellishment was combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a tremendous forehead, arching up two inches beyond the former hair-line. But most wonder-working {{of all was the}} donning of his spectacles.|$|E
60|$|Tilly and Prue sang, as {{they stepped}} to and fro, drawing out the {{smoothly}} twisted threads to the musical {{hum of the}} great spinning-wheels. The little girls chattered like magpies over their dolls and the new bed-spread they were planning to make, all white <b>dimity</b> stars on a blue calico ground, as a Christmas present to Ma. The boys roared at Eph's jokes, and had rough and tumble games over Bose, who didn't mind them in the least; and so the afternoon wore pleasantly away.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the cheerful}} blaze was welcome. It lit up a room clean and not uncomfortable. Feminine solicitude had {{fashioned}} a toilette-table for him, {{and there was}} a bunch of geraniums in a blue vase on its sparkling <b>dimity</b> garniture. [...] "I suppose you have in your bag all that you want at present?" [...] said Mr. Rodney. [...] "To-morrow we will unpack your trunks and arrange your things in their drawers; and after breakfast, if you please, I will show you your way to Somerset House." ...|$|E
60|$|They had {{not been}} in this {{apartment}} a couple of minutes, when a female bounced into the room, and, seizing Mr Squeers by the throat, gave him two loud kisses: one close after the other, like a postman's knock. The lady, who was of a large raw-boned figure, was about half a head taller than Mr Squeers, and was dressed in a <b>dimity</b> night-jacket; with her hair in papers; she had also a dirty nightcap on, relieved by a yellow cotton handkerchief which tied it under the chin.|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned to}} Mrs. Finch. She {{had found her}} handkerchief, and had put her {{overflowing}} baby to rights again. I respectfully handed back the novel. [...] "Thank you," [...] said Mrs. Finch. [...] "I find novels compose my mind. Do you read novels too? Remind me--and I'll lend you this one to-morrow." [...] I expressed my acknowledgments, and withdrew. At the door, I look round, saluting {{the lady of the}} house. Mrs. Finch was promenading the room, with the baby in one hand and the novel in the other, and the <b>dimity</b> bedgown trailing behind her.|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{enter the}} dark front-door. We feel {{our way to}} the right, where a solitary ray of light comes from the chink of a half-opened door. Here is the front room of the house, set apart as its place of especial social hilarity and sanctity,--the [...] "best room," [...] with its low studded walls, white <b>dimity</b> window-curtains, rag carpet, and {{polished}} wood chairs. It is now lit by the dim gleam of a solitary tallow candle, which seems in the gloom to make only a feeble circle of light around itself, leaving {{all the rest of the}} apartment in shadow.|$|E
60|$|As Mary Louise was {{ushered into}} the cosy sitting room {{she looked for}} the piano-player {{and the owner of}} the merry laugh and cheery voice. Near {{the center of the room}} was a wheeled chair in which sat a young girl of about her own age--a rather pretty girl in spite of her thin frame and pallid countenance. She was neatly dressed in figured <b>dimity,</b> with a bright ribbon at her throat. A pair of {{expressive}} brown eyes regarded Mary Louise with questioning earnestness. Over her lap lay a coverlet; her slender white fingers rested upon the broad arms of her chair.|$|E
60|$|Presently we came {{in sight}} of the house, long and low, {{like the one in}} Gloucester Street, with a new and {{unpainted}} wing just completed. That day the mist softened its outline and blurred the trees which clustered about it. Even as we swung into the circle of the drive a rounded and youthful figure appeared in the doorway, gave a little cry, and stood immovable. It was Patty, in a striped <b>dimity</b> gown with the sleeves rolled up, and her face fairly shone with joy as I leaped from my horse and took her hands.|$|E
60|$|Tommy was sleepy, {{and telling}} Demi to mind his own {{business}} and not ask questions, he was snoring in ten minutes, little dreaming {{what was going on}} under his bed. The cigar did not go out, but smouldered away on the straw carpet till it was nicely on fire, and a hungry little flame went creeping along till the <b>dimity</b> bedcover caught, then the sheets, and then the bed itself. The beer made Tommy sleep heavily, and the smoke stupified Demi, so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them, and they were in danger of being burned to death.|$|E
60|$|Isaac. Good lack, {{with what}} eyes a father sees! As I have life, {{she is the}} very reverse of all this: as for the <b>dimity</b> skin you told me of, I swear 'tis a {{thorough}} nankeen as ever I saw! for her eyes, their utmost merit is not squinting--for her teeth, where there is one of ivory, its neighbour is pure ebony, black and white alternately, just like the keys of a harpsichord. Then, as to her singing, and heavenly voice--by this hand, she has a shrill, cracked pipe, that sounds {{for all the world}} like a child's trumpet.|$|E
60|$|And {{there was}} only a plain little iron bed, uncurtained, and the floor was bare except for rugs at the hearth and bed-side, and the {{furniture}} was nothing but white <b>dimity.</b> The chimney ornaments and the washhand-stand looked like those in a nursery--as indeed they well might, for they had belonged to Miss Dora nearly all her life; they all had stories belonging to them, were keepsakes from dear friends, and she would not have given one, no, not the shell cat with an ear off, nor the little picture made of coloured sand, for Miss Robson's finest gilded box, unless indeed that had come in the same way.|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} {{uncovered}} a little sketch of what seemed {{at first sight}} only a confused cluster of roof tops, dormer windows, and chimneys, level with the sky-line. But it was bathed in the white sunshine of Paris, against the blue sky she knew so well. There, too, were the gritty crystals and rust of the tiles, the red, brown, and greenish mosses of the gutters, and lower down the more vivid colors of geraniums and pansies in flower-pots under the white <b>dimity</b> curtains which hid the small panes of garret windows; yet every sordid detail touched and transfigured with the poetry and romance of youth and genius.|$|E
