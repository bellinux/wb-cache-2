40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Gas turbine performance diagnostic is a method for detecting, isolating and quantifying faults of gas turbine gas path components. On-line precise fault diagnosis can promote great reliability and availability of gas turbine in real time operation. This work proposes a GUl-type on-line <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program</b> using SIMULINK and Fuzzy-Neuro algorithms for a helicopter turboshaft engine. During development of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program,</b> a look-up table type base performance module for reducing computer calculating time and a signal generation module for simulating real time performance data are used. This program is composed of the on-line condition monitoring program to monitor on-line measuring performance condition, the fuzzy inference system to isolate the faults from measuring data and the neural network to quantify the isolated faults. Evaluation of the proposed on-line <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program</b> is performed through application to the helicopter engine health monitoring. ksb 201...|$|R

Objectives: There is an increasing use of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3 D-RA) during catheterization of congenital heart disease. Dose-area-product (DAP) measured by the angiography system and computed-tomography dose index (CTDI) do not appear practical for dose assessment. Hence, we performed real dose measurements in an-thropomorphic phantoms. Methods: Three different anthropomorphic phantoms (10 kg, 19 kg and 73 kg bodyweight) equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used. We used a typical standard <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program</b> and a low-dose program. The effective dose (ED) was calculated according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 103. The 3 D distribution of radiation in the body was assessed. Results: ED for the male 10 kg phantom was 0. 192 mSv in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program</b> and 0. 050 mSv (male) in the low-dose program. The 19 kg phantom received an ED of 0. 205 mSv (male) in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program.</b> In the low-dose program the ED reached 0. 058 mSv (male). The male adult 73 kg phantom was exposed with an ED of 0. 730 mSv in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program</b> and 0. 282 mSv in the low-dose program. ED for the female phantoms was slightly higher for both acquisition-programs.

40|$|Excimer laser {{micromachining}} was a {{key process}} for producing features by removing parts of some photoresist layers. One hurdle was that the lower substrate layer was easily attacked or damaged in laser ablation of the upper photoresist layer. To overcome this, a real-time monitoring scheme of laser micromachining process was proposed {{on the basis of}} taking acoustic emissions arising from pulsed laser–material interaction as feedback signals and employing a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program.</b> It was showed that extracted features (e. g. the RMS values) from sensor signals were indicative of the process. In particular, the feature values tended to have an abrupt change when laser beam approached the interface of consecutive two layers.
