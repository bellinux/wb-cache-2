5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to burn through, lest the log break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year,</b> without warning.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{of testing}} and {{operating}} the Green Line left WMATA struggling financially. These costs (along with {{costs associated with}} extending and operating the Blue Line to Van Dorn Street) forced WMATA to cut 335 jobs as well as supplies, travel, overtime, and temporary employee budgets. Although ridership was projected to rise 3.8 percent to 260 million trips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year,</b> the increased revenue was not expected {{to cover the costs}} of operating the new lines and stations. Mount Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University, and U Street–Cardozo stations opened on Saturday, May 11, 1991.|$|E

5|$|An {{agreement}} on simulcasting of harness and quarter horse races was reached in August allowing Rosecroft to reopen on August 25, 2011. Rosecroft owed $1.24 million in unpaid disbursements under its previous simulcast license, and the parties were negotiating {{about how much}} of this debt Penn National would pay. Rosecroft drew 400 to 500 patrons on its opening day. Penn National also announced its intent to spend $1 million <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year</b> to renovate the property, which would include razing old horse barns, putting a new roof on the betting parlors, and upgrading the HVAC system.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year.</b> There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year.</b> He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E

5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year.</b> The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may {{also be seen as}} a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year.</b> Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year.</b> In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

5|$|The French Navy had {{suffered}} a series of one-sided defeats in the opening years of the war, suffering heavy losses at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and during the Croisière du Grand Hiver the following January. In late 1796, after prompting from representatives of the United Irishmen (a society dedicated to ending British rule of the Kingdom of Ireland), the French Atlantic Fleet launched a large scale attempt to invade Ireland, known as the Expédition d'Irlande. This too ended in disaster, with twelve ships lost and thousands of men drowned in fierce winter gales. Their ambitions frustrated, {{the representatives of the}} United Irishmen, led by Wolfe Tone, turned to the new Batavian state for support and were promised assistance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>year</b> by a united French and Dutch fleet. A plan was formulated to merge the French and Dutch fleets and attack Ireland together in the summer of 1797. Tone joined the staff of Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter on his flagship Vrijheid in the Texel and 13,500 Dutch troops were equipped in preparation for the operation, the fleet waiting only for the best moment to take advantage of easterly winds and sweep past the British blockade and down the English Channel.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} {{reason for}} waving the four species {{in all directions}} alludes {{to the fact that}} all these species require much water to grow. The lulav (date palm) grows in watered valleys, hadass and aravah grow near water sources, and the etrog requires more water than other fruit trees.
