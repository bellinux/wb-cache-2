25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

5000|$|In a long {{interview}} {{conducted by}} Alan Lomax in 1938, Jelly Roll Morton recalled {{that the first}} blues he had heard, probably around 1900, was played by a singer and prostitute, Mamie Desdunes, in Garden District, New Orleans. Morton sang the blues: [...] "Can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ You can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ Just to feed that hungry man of mine".

500|$|Holst {{was given}} a {{spectacular}} send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, [...] "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra {{for the whole of}} a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'." [...] There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.|$|E
500|$|Pechersky clandestinely {{met with}} Feldhendler {{under the guise}} of meeting Luka, a woman he was {{supposedly}} involved with. Luka is often described as an 18-year-old woman from [...] "Holland", but records indicate she was 28 and from Germany, her real name was [...] After the war, Pechersky insisted that the relationship was platonic. Her fate after the escape was never established and she was never seen alive again. During an interview with Thomas Blatt, Pechersky said the following regarding Luka: [...] "Although I knew her only about two weeks, I will never forget her. I informed her minutes before the escape of the plan. She has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> shirt. She said, 'it's a good luck shirt, put it on right now', and I did. It's now in the museum. I lost her in the turmoil of the revolt and never saw her again." ...|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} it was Evita's work with the {{foundation}} that played {{a large role in}} her idealization, even leading some to consider her a saint. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she [...] "...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism." [...] Poet , a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: [...] "I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense...." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly after, Byrom joined Northern Premier League First Division side Clitheroe on a {{short-term}} contract. He finished the 2006–07 season top scorer with 11 league goals despite only joining {{the club in}} January 2007, including a hat-trick against Kidsgrove Athletic. However, Byrom's Clitheroe contract expired and Conference North side Southport took him on non-contract terms {{for the start of}} the 2007–08 season, where he scored two goals in two games. Despite being offered a contract by Southport manager Peter Davenport, Byrom opted to re-join Clitheroe in August 2007. On signing a two-year deal with Clitheroe, Byrom said [...] "I thought about giving up football when I left Accrington, but I really enjoyed my time at Clitheroe, they've <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> new lease of life and a licence to do what I want on the park". Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said [...] "this is a big day for Clitheroe. This is one of the biggest signings the club has made. He's a special player and a special talent". In the first half of the 2007–08 season, Byrom scored six goals in all competitions for Clitheroe, which caught the attention of Conference National team Northwich Victoria. He played his last game for the Northern Premier League club in a 3–3 draw with local rivals Rossendale United, a game in which he captained the side for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{that time}} New York City was the {{cultural}} center for photography {{as an art}} form in America, and Alfred Stieglitz was the most influential figure in photography. Weston badly wanted to go to New York to meet with him, but he did not have enough money to make the trip. His brother-in-law gave him enough money to continue on from Middletown to New York City, and he spent most of October and early November there. While there he met artist Charles Sheeler, photographers [...] Clarence H. White, Gertrude Kasebier and finally, Stieglitz.

2500|$|I {{find that}} I am [...] "intermediate" [...] between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the {{creation}} of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E

Virgil commented [...] "Hogan has never <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> reason to believe he is a racist" [...] while Dennis Rodman said he [...] "most certainly is not a racist" [...] and Kamala added [...] "I do not think Hogan meant harm by saying that. Hogan is my brother until he decides not to be". Black wrestlers working in the WWE made different comments. Mark Henry said he was pleased by WWE's [...] "no tolerance approach to racism" [...] response, and that he was hurt and offended by Hogan's manner and tone.

2500|$|On 1 August 1914, a British {{offer to}} {{guarantee}} French neutrality was sent out and promptly accepted by Wilhelm. At 4:23p.m. a telegram from the German Ambassador to Britain {{arrived with a}} planned British proposal to guarantee the neutrality of France and thus limit the war to one fought in the east. Wilhelm then ordered German forces to strike against Russia alone, leading to fierce protests from Moltke {{that it was not}} technically possible for Germany to do so as the bulk of the German forces were already advancing into Luxembourg and Belgium. Wilhelm immediately accepted the proposal by telegrams at the ambassadorial and royal levels." [...] In keeping with this decision, Wilhelm II demanded his generals shift the mobilization to the east. Moltke, German Chief of General Staff, told him that this was impossible, to which the Kaiser replied [...] "Your uncle would have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> different answer!" [...] Instead, it was decided to mobilize as planned and cancel the planned invasion of Luxembourg. Once mobilization was complete, the army would redeploy to the east. In response to Wilhelm's order, a dejected Moltke complained that [...] "Now, it only remains for Russia to back out, too." [...] Moltke then proceeded to persuade the Emperor to continue the advance for [...] "technical reasons".|$|E
2500|$|L.V. Anderson of Slate {{states that}} [...] "ust as {{living in a}} world with {{abundant}} calories does not automatically make everyone fat, living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny. Some bodies, I daresay, would be even bigger than Lawrence's." [...] Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist. MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight [...] "misguided". One response pointed to Collins's physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads: [...] "I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> healthier body than most of those I see around me." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that [...] "he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on {{the court of public opinion}} and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate".|$|E
