5000|$|The {{effective}} {{diffusion coefficient}} (also {{referred to as}} the apparent diffusion coefficient) of a diffusant in atomic diffusion of solid polycrystalline materials like metal alloys is often represented as a weighted average of the grain boundary diffusion coefficient and the lattice diffusion coefficient. [...] Diffusion along both the grain boundary and in the lattice may be modeled with an Arrhenius equation. The ratio of the grain boundary diffusion activation energy over the lattice diffusion activation energy is usually 0.4 - 0.6, so as temperature is lowered, the grain boundary <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> increases. [...] Increasing temperature often allows for increased grain size, and the lattice <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> increases with increasing temperature, so often at 0.8Tmelt (of an alloy), the grain boundary component can be neglected.|$|E
50|$|In {{the theory}} of {{stochastic}} processes, {{a part of the}} mathematical theory of probability, the variance gamma process (VG), also known as Laplace motion, is a Lévy process determined by a random time change. The process has finite moments distinguishing it from many Lévy processes. There is no <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> in the VG process and it is thus a pure jump process. The increments are independent and follow a Variance-gamma distribution, which is a generalization of the Laplace distribution.|$|E

In more detail, majority carriers are {{pushed away from the}} junction, leaving behind more charged ions. Thus the depletion region is widened and its field becomes stronger, which increases the drift component of current and decreases the <b>diffusion</b> <b>component.</b> In this case, the net current is leftward in the figure of the p-n junction. The carrier density (mostly, minority carriers) is small and only a very small reverse saturation current flows.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a general {{methodology}} for control problems driven by the Brownian motion filtration including non-Markovian and non-semimartingale state processes controlled by mutually singular measures. The main result {{of this paper is}} the development of a concrete pathwise method for characterizing and computing near-optimal controls for abstract controlled Wiener functionals. The theory does not require ad hoc functional differentiability assumptions on the value process and elipticity conditions on the <b>diffusion</b> <b>components.</b> The analysis is pathwise over suitable finite dimensional spaces and {{it is based on the}} weak differential structure introduced by Leão, Ohashi and Simas jointly with measurable selection arguments. The theory is applied to stochastic control problems based on path-dependent SDEs where both drift and possibly degenerated <b>diffusion</b> <b>components</b> are controlled. Optimal control of drifts for path-dependent SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion is also discussed. We finally provide an application in the context of financial mathematics. Namely, we construct near-optimal controls in a non-Markovian portfolio optimization problem.

50|$|Forward bias (P {{positive}} {{with respect}} to N) narrows the depletion region and lowers the barrier to carrier injection (shown in the figure to the right). In more detail, majority carriers get some energy from the bias field, enabling them {{to go into the}} region and neutralize opposite charges. The more bias the more neutralization (or screening of ions in the region) occurs. The carriers can be recombined to the ions but thermal energy immediately makes recombined carriers transition back as Fermi energy is in proximity. When bias is strong enough that the depletion region becomes very thin, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> of the current greatly increases and the drift component decreases. In this case the net current is rightward in the figure of the p-n junction. The carrier density is large (it varies exponentially with the applied bias voltage), making the junction conductive and allowing a large forward current. The mathematical description of the current is provided by the Shockley diode equation. The low current conducted under reverse bias and the large current under forward bias is an example of rectification.|$|E

The team was the first in the world to isolate the subsurface scattering component (a specialized case of BTDF) using the simplest light stage, consisting on moveable light source, moveable high-res digital camera, 2 polarizers in a few positions and really simple algorithms on a modest computer. The team utilized the existing scientific knowledge that light that is reflected and scattered from the air-to-oil layer retains its polarization while light that travels within the skin loses its polarization. [...] The subsurface scattering component can be simulated as a steady high-scatter glow of light from within the models, without which the skin does not look realistic.

30|$|We further {{suggest that}} ADCuh {{may serve as}} a {{promising}} biometric for the early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, ADCuh was lower than the ADCst and ADClow values, which corresponds with the finding that the higher b-value in the scan, the lower the estimated ADC values in the kidney [16]. ADC contained information not only about diffusion but also about perfusion and flow effects. Some studies [17] suggested that diffusion signal intensity with low b-values is mainly contributed by a fast <b>diffusion</b> <b>component,</b> as ADClow is mainly illustrated by the fast blood perfusion in the kidney. Diffusion signal intensity with high b-values is dominated primarily by a slow <b>diffusion</b> <b>component,</b> as ADCst is related to the slow water diffusion. Thus, according to the relationship between the b-value and diffusion signal intensity, the ADCuh measured at ultra-high b-value might {{have something to do with}} a slower <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> because we observed a weak ADCuh in the present study. Moreover, our findings indicate that ADCuh measurement is more sensitive than ADClow and ADCst measurement to the energy metabolism or the tubular flow or reabsorption.|$|E

40|$|We derive a {{nonparametric test}} for the class of Ito ̂ semimartingales with non-vanishing <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> using {{high-frequency}} record of the process on an interval with fixed span. The test {{is based on the}} fact that the leading component of the high-frequency increments of Ito ̂ semi-martingales with non-vanishing <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> is a normally distributed random variable with unknown stochastic variance that is proportional to the length of the high-frequency in-terval. We form a nonparametric estimate of the local variance and scale the high-frequency increments by it. To remove the effect of “big ” jumps, we further discard the high-frequency increments exceeding a time-varying threshold determined by our estimate of the local variance. Our test is then based on comparing the distance between the empirical cdf of the rescaled high-frequency increments not exceeding the threshold and the cdf of a standard normal ran-dom variable. We show that the test has a good power against Ito ̂ semimartingales with no <b>diffusion</b> <b>component</b> as well as Ito ̂ semimartingales contaminated with noise...|$|E
