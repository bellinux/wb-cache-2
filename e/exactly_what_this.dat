[...] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was [...] "loads of fanboy fun" [...] and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> place is: its what and how. That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What you can see in that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent with everything else.|$|E
2500|$|Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. Although T. brevifolia is {{typically}} a tree as described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally {{occurs in the}} mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000ft (1000–1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north. [...] It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off {{to one side of the}} stem, usually the upper side. The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means “creeping, prostrate, and rooting,” which is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. [...] It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. [...] This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.|$|E
