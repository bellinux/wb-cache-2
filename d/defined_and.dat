5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Colin {{can be traced}} back to an {{elongated}} tropical wave that moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on July28. A nearly stationary trough separated from the wave as it continued westward. A larger tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa a few days later. A broad area of low pressure resulted from the consolidation of the two waves on August1, when it was situated about 750mi (1210km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Over the course of the next 24 hours, shower and thunderstorm activity became increasingly consolidated with the low, but the system lacked a well-defined circulation to be considered a tropical cyclone at the time. However, on the next day, an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass revealed that the circulation center had become sufficiently <b>defined,</b> <b>and</b> the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Four at 1200UTC on August2. Further organization occurred as the depression moved around the southern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge. Thunderstorm activity became increasingly <b>defined,</b> <b>and</b> it is estimated that the depression became Tropical Storm Colin at 0600UTC on August3 while centered 840mi (1350km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|A surface trough of low {{pressure}} with {{an area of}} convection persisted off the southeast coast of the United States on September 18. On the same day, a weak tropical wave which moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 8 approached the area. A cold front merged with the stationary area of disturbed weather on September 20, and on September 22 a circulation developed 200miles (325km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Organization continued as outflow became better <b>defined,</b> <b>and</b> the system developed into Tropical Depression Six later that day.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better <b>defined</b> <b>and</b> the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned {{more to the}} west toward Madagascar, despite a weakness in the ridge to the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. Around that time, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{developed on}} May2, 2002 near Sri Lanka, {{associated with a}} weak and broad circulation center. The system tracked west-northwestward through the Arabian Sea along a trough near the equator. Its thunderstorm activity was enhanced by a ridge to its north, though was also removed from the center. By May5, the circulation had become better <b>defined,</b> <b>and</b> concurrently the convection increased over the center. After further organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as Depression ARB01A on May6. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 01A, while located about 1300km (800mi) southeast of Salalah, Oman.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is <b>defined</b> <b>and</b> then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded {{the system to}} a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better <b>defined</b> <b>and</b> the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E

5|$|By 0900 UTC October 2, the eye {{started to}} become less defined. Based on this, {{the storm was}} {{downgraded}} into a category 3 hurricane. Although an eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery, the storms had displayed very deep convection, thus the NHC initially maintained the intensity at 120mph (195km/h). Virgil's eye continued to become less <b>defined,</b> <b>and</b> was downgraded to Category 2 intensity {{at the time of}} landfall on October 4. It rapidly weakened over land, and was a dissipating tropical depression by the time it moved offshore.|$|E
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, though on July 12 the overall convection became more concentrated {{as it turned}} to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further <b>defined,</b> <b>and</b> the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Characterized with disorganized convection, a broad surface trough {{formed in}} {{association}} with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development. Initially, upper-level winds were only marginally favorable, and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized, the NHC estimated a 50%chance for development by early on October12. The next day, the system became better <b>defined,</b> <b>and,</b> the NHC noted that the system {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone. Although operationally not classified until 2100UTC on October 13, a post-season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1200UTC, while positioned about 645mi (1040km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
