40|$|The {{hospitality}} industry {{is one of}} the data-rich industries that receives huge Volumes of data streaming at high Velocity with considerably Variety, Veracity, and Variability. These properties make the data analysis in the {{hospitality industry}} a big data problem. Meeting the customers' expectations is a key factor in the hospitality industry to <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> customers' <b>loyalty.</b> To achieve this goal, marketing professionals in this industry actively look for ways to utilize their data in the best possible manner and advance their data analytic solutions, such as identifying a unique market segmentation clustering and developing a recommendation system.

We implement the existing big data clustering algorithms and provide a quantitative comparison of the performance of different clustering algorithms for different scenarios. We also present our insights and recommendations regarding the suitability of different big data clustering algorithms for different use cases. These recommendations will be helpful for hoteliers in selecting the appropriate market segmentation clustering algorithm for different clustering datasets to improve the customer experience and maximize the hotel revenue...|$|R
