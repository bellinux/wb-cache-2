As direct material costs are billed separately, and labor costs are fixed, only a negligible proportion of the job costs is variable at this company. A key finding is that allocated fixed job costs are significant in explaining variations in short run prices even after controlling for job volume and quality requirements. The results also indicate that pricing behavior changed following the change in the job costing system. After the change, prices depend more on the full costs calculated based on the new system than on the full costs based on the old system, although neither cost estimate was reported to marketing managers when bidding for jobs.

It is necessary to apply the correct cost-accounting method for the production of products, works, services for a more rational calculation of the cost price. This will allow management personnel to receive timely objective information about their cost price, identify the feasibility of production and sales, justify the assortment, plan profits. The procedure for determining the cost price of the project products (works, services) in the theory and practice of the state enterprise of the Astrakhan region “Kasprybproekt” is investigated in the work. With the existing practice of planning in design organizations, the planned cost price of design and survey works for established cost items is planned in the cost estimate for production by the design organization as a whole and by the types of work: design, survey and others, without subdividing it by orders (projects). According to this, accounting of the actual costs for work in the design organizations is based.
