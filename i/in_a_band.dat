5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from abroad, Laurer held several different jobs: a cocktail waitress in a strip club, singer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band,</b> and a 900-number chat line worker. In her mid-to-late 20s, {{while living in}} the Florida Keys, she took a six-week class to train to be a flight attendant. On {{the way to her}} first flight, she was in a car accident and spent four days in the hospital. After recovering from the accident, Laurer's sister Kathy helped her get a job selling pagers, and both women also worked as belly dancers.|$|E

From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band,</b> but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E

5|$|The Andes prevent rain-bearing clouds {{from the}} Pacific Ocean from moving in, while its {{latitude}} puts it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping the region dry. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged.

Most of the precipitation falls during the summer due to the stronger interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic High.|$|E
5|$|After {{replacing}} drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990, Meshuggah {{signed a}} contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full-length album, Contradictions Collapse. The LP, originally entitled (All this because of) Greed, was released in 1991. The album received positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. Soon after, Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals, and rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström, who had already played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> with Haake when they were in sixth grade, was recruited. The new lineup recorded the EP None at Tonteknik Recordings in Umeå in 1994 for release later that year. A Japanese version was also released, including lyrics printed in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Born in Jakarta {{of mixed}} Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became {{interested}} in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia {{and then went back}} to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy.|$|E

5|$|By September 1963, Waters and Mason {{had lost}} {{interest}} in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} Regent Street Polytechnic.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> called Chapter 11. Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, {{and they were going to}} use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{was born}} and raised in Moers, a city on the left bank of the Rhine. His father, Achim, is a drummer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band,</b> and he has a sister named Katrin. Ehrhoff first played hockey at the age of six, {{deciding}} to play the sport after watching an NHL game on television. As his hometown did not have a hockey program, he played minor hockey 20 kilometres away in the Krefeld Penguins' system. He won a national championship with the club around the age of 12; Ehrhoff has recalled scoring in the final on a penalty shot. Following the NHL growing up, Ehrhoff has singled out Wayne Gretzky, Pavel Bure and Uwe Krupp as his childhood heroes. He was inspired to play in the style of an offensive defenceman after watching a video of Bobby Orr as a 10-year-old.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay in the bar area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Franken and Tom Davis were {{recruited}} {{as two of}} the original writers (and occasional performers) on Saturday Night Live (SNL) (1975–1980, 1985–1995). In Season 1 of SNL, as apprentice writers, the two shared a salary of $350 per week. Franken received seven Emmy nominations and three awards for his television writing and producing while creating such characters as self-help guru Stuart Smalley. Another routine proclaimed the 1980s the Al Franken Decade. Franken and Davis wrote the script of the 1986 comedy film One More Saturday Night, appearing in it as rock singers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> called Bad Mouth.

5|$|In Las Vegas Rachel {{falls in}} {{with a group of}} skaters who live {{together}} and play <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band,</b> after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. Mr. Will finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they can look for the man on the tape, who Rachel thinks is the father of her child. When Clyde and Rachel break into his parents' house looking for food and money, Clyde's father calls the police and Mr. Will is arrested while Rachel flees. Remembering one of her mother's bedtime stories, she impulsively follows a red Mustang and discovers that its owner, Tim, is the man who recorded the tape, and is, in fact, her biological father.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Deacon was {{introduced}} to Taylor and May by a friend at a disco who told him that they were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> that had just lost its bassist. A {{couple of days later}} he auditioned in a lecture room at Imperial College London and became the last member of Queen to join. Since the band's last bassist drew attention away from Mercury, Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen's bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon. Deacon played his first show with Queen at the College of Estate Management in Kensington in June.|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which {{took a long time to}} dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E
