Activation energy (1) catalyzes the reaction to occur in a spontaneous manner. The progress of the reaction is shown by the line. The change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) in an <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> (that takes place under constant pressure and temperature conditions) is a negative value because energy is lost (2).|$|E

5000|$|In endergonic <b>reactions</b> and <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions</b> it is {{the sign}} of the Gibbs free energy that determines the {{equilibrium}} point, and not enthalpy. The related concepts endergonic and exergonic apply to all physical processes.|$|R
50|$|Reagents can {{be pulled}} through an endergonic {{reaction}}, if the reaction products are cleared rapidly by a subsequent <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction.</b> The {{concentration of the}} products of the endergonic reaction thus always remains low, so the reaction can proceed.|$|E
50|$|Notably, the ﬁnal {{steps of}} ATP {{hydrolysis}} include the fast release of phosphate {{and the slow}} release of ADP.The release of a phosphate anion from bound ADP anion into water solution may be considered as an <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> because the phosphate anion has low molecular mass.|$|E
50|$|More generally, {{the terms}} exergonic and endergonic {{relate to the}} free energy change in any process, not just {{chemical}} reactions. An example of an <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> is cellular respiration. This relates to the degrees of freedom {{as a consequence of}} entropy, the temperature, and the difference in heat released or absorbed.|$|E
40|$|Thermogenesis is an {{obligatory}} {{consequence of}} cellular metabolism and {{is identified as}} a unique property of homeotherms which have to maintain constant their body temperature in a cold environment. Physiologically, thermogenesis is made of basal metabolism, post-prandial thermogenesis, exercise-induced thermogenesis and adaptive thermogenesis induced by changes in the environmental temperature. Biochemically, thermogenesis comes from <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions</b> from a loose coupling between endergonic and <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions.</b> In cells, respiration and oxidations occur in mitochondria which ensure the coupling of oxidative energy to ATP synthesis. Identification of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP allowed further understanding of the mechanism of coupling or uncoupling of respiration to ADP phosphorylation.

The reaction pathways are tracked by monitoring the vibrational energy redistribution in the product after charge separation and subsequent charge recombination. For moderately <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions,</b> both donor and acceptor are found to be vibrationally hot, pointing to an even redistribution of the energy dissipated upon charge separation and recombination in both reaction partners. For highly <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions,</b> the donor is very hot, whereas the acceptor is mostly cold. The asymmetric energy redistribution is due to the formation of the donor cation in an electronic excited state upon charge separation, confirming one of the hypotheses for the absence of the Marcus inverted region in photoinduced bimolecular charge separation processe...|$|R

50|$|An <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction where {{the change in}} the free energy is negative (there is a net release of free energy), indicating a spontaneous reaction. For processes that take place under constant pressure and temperature conditions, the Gibbs free energy is used whereas the Helmholtz energy is used for processes that take place under constant volume and temperature conditions.|$|E
5000|$|An endergonic {{reaction}} is an anabolic chemical reaction that consumes energy. [...] It {{is the opposite}} of an <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction.</b> It has a positive ΔG because it takes more energy to break the bonds of the reactant than the energy of the products offer, i.e. the products have weaker bonds than the reactants. Thus, {{endergonic reaction}}s are thermodynamically unfavorable. Additionally, endergonic reactions are usually anabolic.|$|E
5000|$|Pyrophosphatase (or {{inorganic}} pyrophosphatase) is {{an enzyme}} (...) that catalyzes {{the conversion of}} one molecule of pyrophosphate to two phosphate ions. This is a highly <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction,</b> and therefore can be coupled to unfavorable biochemical transformations in order to drive these transformations to completion. The functionality of this enzyme plays {{a critical role in}} lipid metabolism (including lipid synthesis and degradation), calcium absorption and bone formation, and DNA synthesis, as well as other biochemical transformations.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>exergonic</b> <b>{{reaction}}s</b> {{are said}} to occur spontaneously, this {{does not imply that}} the reaction will take place at an observable rate.

They mention the <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions</b> in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. Colín-García et al. (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis.|$|R
50|$|Electro{{chemiluminescence}} or electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) {{is a kind}} of luminescence {{produced during}} electrochemical reactions in solutions. In electrogenerated chemiluminescence, electrochemically generated intermediates undergo a highly <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> to produce an electronically excited state that then emits light upon relaxation to a lower-level state. This wavelength of the emitted photon of light corresponds to the energy gap between these two states. ECL excitation can be caused by energetic electron transfer (redox) reactions of electrogenerated species. Such luminescence excitation is a form of chemiluminescence where one/all reactants are produced electrochemically on the electrodes.|$|E

50|$|Endothermic (and exothermic) {{analysis}} only {{accounts for}} the enthalpy change (∆H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (∆G), which includes an entropy (∆S) and temperature term {{in addition to the}} enthalpy. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction)</b> even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.|$|E
50|$|Though the {{reaction}} catalysed by PPDK is reversible, PEP is favoured {{as the product}} in biological conditions. This {{is due to the}} basic pH in the stroma, where {{the reaction}} occurs, as well as high concentrations of adenylate kinase and pyrophosphatase. Because these two enzymes catalyse <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions</b> involving AMP, and disphosphate, respectively, they drive the PPDK-catalysed reaction forward. Because PPDK consumes ATP, the C4 pathway is unfavourable for plants in environments with little access to light, as they are unable to produce large quantities of ATP.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{catalyst}} {{changes the}} course of a reaction without affecting the relative thermodynamic stability of substrates and products, and a catalytic <b>reaction</b> must be <b>exergonic</b> in order to obtain high yields of the product and to attain reasonable reaction rates. In the case that the desired reaction is in equilibrium or is endergonic, devices for making products thermodynamically more stable than substrates are needed. In this review, the transition-metal-catalyzed synthesis of organosulfides using a substitution reaction is summarized, where metal inorganic and organic co-substrate/co-product methods are used in developing <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{chemical}} thermodynamics, an {{endergonic reaction}} (also called a heat absorb nonspontaneous reaction or an unfavorable reaction) is a chemical reaction {{in which the}} standard change in free energy is positive, and energy is absorbed. In layman's terms, {{the total amount of}} energy is a loss (it takes more energy to start the reaction than what you get out of it) so the total energy is a negative net result. For an overall gain in the net result see <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Another way to phrase this is that energy is absorbed from the surroundings into the workable system.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is often}} how {{biological}} reactions proceed. For example, {{on its own}} the reactionmay be too endergonic to occur. However {{it may be possible}} to make it occur by coupling it to a strongly <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> - such as, very often, the decomposition of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate ions, ATP → ADP + Pi, so thatThis kind of reaction, with the ATP decomposition supplying the free energy needed to make an endergonic reaction occur, is so common in cell biochemistry that ATP is often called the [...] "universal energy currency" [...] of all living organisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} {{of a chemical}} reaction influence several aspects of the reaction. If the products are lower in energy than the reactants, then the reaction will give off excess energy making it an <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Such reactions are thermodynamically favorable and tend to happen on their own. If the kinetics of the reaction are high enough, however, then the reaction may occur too slowly to be observed, or not even occur at all. This {{is the case with}} the conversion of diamond to lower energy graphite at atmospheric pressure, in such a reaction diamond is considered metastable and will not be observed converting into graphite.|$|E

Additionally, dU ≈ 0 suggests that the increased mitochondrial or cellular temperatures must be balanced and compensated by selected intra-mitochondrial or intracellular energy changes, such as <b>exergonic</b> <b>reactions</b> of NADH (52.6  kcal/mol) and FADH 2 (43.4  kcal/mol), which were also experimentally supported by NADH and FADH 2 consumption during BA thermogenesis (Xie et al. 2017 b).|$|R

5000|$|An <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction</b> is a {{spontaneous}} chemical reaction that releases energy. [...] It is thermodynamically favored, indexed by a negative value of ΔG (Gibbs free energy). Over {{the course of}} a reaction, energy needs to be put in, and this activation energy drives the reactants from a stable state to a highly energetically unstable transition state to a more stable state that is lower in energy (see: reaction coordinate). The reactants are usually complex molecules that are broken into simpler products. The entire reaction is usually catabolic. [...] The release of energy (called Gibbs free energy) is negative (i.e. -ΔG) because energy is released from the reactants to the products.|$|E
5000|$|Marcus’ formula shows a {{quadratic}} {{dependence of}} the Gibbs free energy of activation on the Gibbs free energy of reaction. It is general knowledge from the host of chemical experience that reactions usually are the faster the more negative is &Delta;G0. In many cases even a linear free energy relation is found. According to the Marcus formula the rates increase also when the reactions are more exergonic, however {{only as long as}} &Delta;G0 is positive or slightly negative. It is surprising that for redox reactions according to the Marcus formula the activation energy should increase for very <b>exergonic</b> <b>reaction,</b> i.e. in the cases when &Delta;G0 is negative and its absolute value is greater than that of &lambda;o. This realm of Gibbs free energy of reaction is called [...] "Marcus inverted region". In Fig. 2 it becomes obvious that the intersection of the parabolas i and f moves upwards in the left part of the graph when &Delta;G0 continues to become more negative, and this means increasing activation energy.
