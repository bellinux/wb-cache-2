40|$|Abstract. One of the {{characteristics}} of longitudinal development of <b>extensive</b> air <b>showers</b> is the number of charged particles and depth of <b>shower</b> maximum in <b>extensive</b> air <b>showers</b> as a function of primary energy, which is often used to reconstruct the elemental composition of primary cosmic rays. Studying of <b>extensive</b> air <b>shower</b> characteristics was performed by investigating the longitudinal development parameters depending on Heitler model for different primary particles. The simulation of the number of charged particles and depth of shower maximum (N and Xmax) in <b>extensive</b> air <b>showers</b> of particle cascades was performed using AIRES code for SIBYLL hadronic model for different primary particles like electron, positron, gamma quanta and iron nuclei at the energy range 1014 - 1019 eV. The comparison between the simulated longitudinal development of N and Xmax using SIBYLL hadronic model with two hadronic models (QGSJET 99 ans SIBYLL 16) has shown an opportunity for determination of cosmic ray cascade interactions in <b>extensive</b> air <b>showers.</b> 1...|$|R
