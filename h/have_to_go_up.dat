The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
500|$|The Field House {{increased}} attendance capacity further, to 9,500. [...] It {{was named}} after Henry L. Williams, the former Minnesota Golden Gophers football coach in 1950, and {{was named after}} him when it was remodeled and expanded in 1950, bringing the arena to a capacity of 18,025, which was {{the largest in the}} country for twenty years and significantly larger than the capacity of Williams Arena today. [...] Gophers fans refer to Williams Arena as the Barn. [...] Consequently, the student section is known as The Barn. [...] Williams Arena was remodeled in 1993 again, to create a new facility for the women's team to use. [...] The team continues to play there to this day, {{making it one of the}} longest used arenas of any college basketball team and the oldest arena in the Big 10. [...] Williams Arena is also one of the few remaining arenas with a raised court, in which players <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> stairs to reach the playing surface.|$|E
2500|$|... when I {{speak of}} a Disarmament Convention I do not mean {{disarmament}} {{on the part of}} this country and not on the part of any other. I mean the limitation of armaments as a real limitation...and if we find ourselves on some lower rating and that some other country has higher figures, that country has to come down and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> until we meet.|$|E

2500|$|USA Today critic Robert Bianco {{praised the}} series, {{particularly}} Spacey's and Wright's lead performances, stating [...] "If you think network executives are nervous, imagine the actors who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> against that pair in the Emmys." [...] Tom Gilatto of People Weekly lauded {{the first two}} episodes, calling them [...] "cinematically rich, full of sleek, oily pools of darkness." [...] In [...] The Denver Post, critic Joanne Ostrow said the series is [...] "Deeply cynical about human beings as well as politics and almost gleeful in its portrayal of limitless ambition." [...] She added: [...] "House of Cards is a wonderfully sour take on power and corruption." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rav Hisda {{taught that}} one should use {{mnemonic}} devices to learn the Torah. And the Gemara taught that this agrees with Abdimi bar Hama bar Dosa, who interpreted [...] to mean {{that if it were}} [...] "in heaven," [...] one would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> after it, and if it were [...] "beyond the sea," [...] one would have to go overseas after it. Rather, people can learn the Torah using the tools that they find where they are. Rava (or some say Rabbi Johanan) interpreted [...] "it is not in heaven" [...] to mean that the Torah is not to be found among those who believe that their insight towers as high as the heavens. And Rava interpreted [...] "neither is it beyond the sea" [...] to mean that it is not to be found among those whose self-esteem expands as the sea. Rabbi Johanan (or some say Rava) interpreted [...] "it is not in heaven" [...] to mean that the Torah is not to be found among the arrogant. And Rabbi Johanan interpreted [...] "neither is it beyond the sea" [...] to mean that it is not to be found among traveling merchants and business people.|$|E

In temperate regions, as in Switzerland or in most parts of America, you would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> so high; and farther north, near the pole, it is only necessary to go up a very little way." ...|$|E

50|$|The Shamrock Mall and Cinder Alley {{were not}} linked. <b>To</b> <b>go</b> from one mall to the other, one <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the {{fountain}} area to cross over.

50|$|Juxtaposition and {{contrasting}} {{images are}} used highly effectively in stanza four. Emily uses a metaphor of Augusta’s heart ‘sinking’ when the morning ‘rose’. This creates {{an image that}} when one thing goes down something else <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> This could therefore suggest that to compensate for God’s gift of the snow falling, Anne’s life <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be a gift back to God.|$|R

50|$|Kaydyacha Bola (काय द्याच बोला)is a Marathi movie {{released}} on 4 November 2005. It {{is inspired by}} the Hollywood movie My Cousin Vinny.

50|$|There {{are plans}} to {{construct}} a gondola running from Göschenen {{to the top of}} Naetschen.
