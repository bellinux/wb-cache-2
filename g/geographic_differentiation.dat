40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of different evolutionary factors on the patterns of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic diversity within sub-Saharan Africa, and between Africa, Europe, and East Asia. This is done by comparing the significance of several statistics computed on equivalent population data sets tested for two HLA class II loci, DRB 1 and DPB 1, which strongly differ from each other by the shape of their allelic distributions. Similar results are found for the two loci concerning highly significant correlations between geographic and genetic distances at the world scale, high levels of genetic diversity within sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and low within Europe, and low genetic differentiations among the three broad continental areas, with no special divergence of Africa. On the other hand, DPB 1 behaves as a neutral polymorphism, although a significant excess of heterozygotes is often observed for DRB 1. Whereas the pattern observed for DPB 1 is explained by <b>geographic</b> <b>differentiations</b> and genetic drift in isolated populations, balancing selection {{is likely to have}} prevented genetic differentiations among populations at the DRB 1 locus. However, this selective effect did not disrupt the high correlation found between DRB 1 and geography at the world scale, nor between DRB 1 and linguistic differentiations at the African level...|$|R

50|$|Ammopiptanthus is {{the only}} genus of {{evergreen}} broadleaf shrub in the northwest desert of China and both species are dominant in the local vegetation, so this genus {{plays an important role}} in fixing moving sands and delaying further desertification. The biological property of Ammopiptanthus evergreen broadleaf has been viewed as an ancestral trait that identifies it as a Tertiary relict taxon. The vegetation in northwest China was dominated by evergreen and/or deciduous broadleaf forests in the early Tertiary period according to the fossil evidence. When subsequent changes made the climate colder and drier from the early Miocene (24-16 Ma) in Central Asia 8, the forests were gradually replaced by steppe and then by desert. Today, their habitats are stony and/or sandy deserts where the climate is arid (annual precipitation ranges from 100-160 mm) and the temperature varies from below -30 °C in the winter to +40 °C in the summer. Because of low seed germination rates in the harsh environments and increasing anthropogenic pressures in their natural range, both A. mongolicus and A. nanus have been categorized as ‘endangered’ species. As a relict survivor of the evergreen broadleaf forest in this region from the Tertiary period, Ammopiptanthus has acquired the strong ability to adapt to the dry and extremely cold environments. The characteristics described above have recently attracted scientific attention to their anatomy, cold and drought stress resistance 11-13, and genetic diversity and <b>geographic</b> <b>differentiation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Intraspecific clinal {{systems are}} ideal for {{investigating}} the how divergence occurs {{in the presence of}} gene flow because they represent a balance between selection and gene flow prior to speciation. High dispersal marine species with clinal variation are particularly informative to test for divergent selection because selection likely is strong enough to counteract high gene flow. The degree of population structure varies considerably among loci, such that the genome acts as a sieve allowing gene flow at neutral loci and impeding it at selected loci, creating a genomic mosaic of differentiation. In this study, I examine genomic and <b>geographic</b> patterns of <b>differentiation</b> among parapatric populations of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) along their contact zone in Florida estuaries. The planktotrophic larval phase of this species gives it the potential for regular long-distance dispersal and genetically homogeneous populations. However Florida populations at the center of its range exhibit a sharp step cline at some loci, suggesting a role for divergent selection. Using 217 AFLP loci, including seven candidate loci for differential selection between the two populations, I genotyped 1, 011 spat over two seasons and 274 adults at sites along the contact zone. I examined: (1) whether genome scans can detect divergent selection in a clinal system, (2) the genomic and <b>geographic</b> patterns of <b>differentiation</b> along the cline at neutral and selected loci, and (3) regional patterns of differentiation and genotypic distributions among the life stages. Results demonstrated: (1) candidate loci for regionally divergent selection, (2) a genomic and <b>geographic</b> mosaic of <b>differentiation,</b> (3) regional and localized selection at a non-trivial portion of loci, (4) lower recruitment and some mortality {{in the center of the}} cline, and (5) strong exogenous, post-settlement viability selection against intermediate and non-native-like genotypes. While a combination of neutral and adaptive processes likely shape genomic and <b>geographic</b> patterns of <b>differentiation,</b> this study revealed evidence for divergent selection in an estuarine species with high potential for gene flow. Overall, these results point to a major role for post-zygotic, environment-dependent selection in the maintenance of the contact zone between Atlantic and Gulf-type oyster populations...|$|R

METHODS: We examined <b>geographic</b> <b>differentiation</b> in P. falciparum populations {{on the basis of}} 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 genes encoding drug resistance determinants, 5 SNPs in 2 genes encoding antigens, and a set of 17 putatively neutral SNPs dispersed on 13 chromosomes. We sampled 326 parasite isolates representing 7 P. falciparum populations from regions with varied levels of malaria transmission (Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mayotte, Haiti, and the Philippines). RESULTS: Frequencies of drug resistance alleles varied considerably among populations (mean F(ST), 0. 52). In contrast, allele frequencies varied significantly less for antigenic and neutral SNPs (mean F(ST), 0. 16 and 0. 24, respectively). This contrasting pattern was more pronounced when only the African populations were considered. Signature of selection was detected for most of the resistant SNPs but not for the antigenic SNPs. CONCLUSION: These data further validate the utility of <b>geographic</b> <b>differentiation</b> for identifying loci under strong positive selection, such as drug resistance loci.

40|$|Understanding {{supply chain}} {{resilience}} and robustness is increasingly important for supply chain managers.

In addition, it utilizes supply base complexity as a moderating factor. Survey data collected from 264 UK manufacturing plants suggest that supply chain connectivity and information sharing resources lead to a supply chain visibility capability which enhances resilience and robustness.

Of these, the Tsukuba group was geographically isolated {{from all the}} others, whereas the N- and S-Tohoku groups, and the S-Tohoku and SW-Honshu groups, respectively, were nearly parapatric, without distinct geographic barriers. The magnitude of genetic distances between the four groups, except for between the N- and S-Tohoku groups, was as large as that normally found among different hynobiid species.

Despite their vast presence, ATM prices have risen substantially {{over the last several}} years. The rise in prices together with the inherent <b>geographic</b> product <b>differentiation</b> for ATMs imply that the current market structure may not be optimal.

In the present study, we investigate the population genetic structure and historical demographic change of P. altivelis at a population level in East Asia. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based on 244 mitochondrial control region DNA sequences clearly showed that as the sampling scope extended to a larger <b>geographic</b> area, genetic <b>differentiation</b> began to become significant, particularly among Northeastern populations. A series of hierarchical AMOVA could detect the genetic relationship of three closely located islands between Korea and Japan {{that might have been}} tightly connected by the regional Tsushima current. Neutrality and mismatch distribution analyses revealed a strong signature of a recent population expansion of P. altivelis in East Asia, estimated at 126 to 391 thousand years ago during the late Pleistocene. Therefore it suggests that the present population of P. altivelis traces back to its approximate demographic change long before the last glacial maximum. This contrasts our a priori expectation that the most recent glacial event might have the most crucial effect on the present day demography of marine organisms through bottleneck and subsequent increase of effective population size in this region...|$|R
