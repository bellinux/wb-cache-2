This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.|$|E

The high rate of snow in the mountains surrounding both the Chikuma and Shinano Rivers make them attractive places for snow sports {{with a number of}} ski resorts scattered throughout the mountains. The 1998 Winter Olympics, which were held in Nagano, indicate the large number of locations for snow sports in the area.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting {{commonly}} inhabits shallow sandy substrates in bays, estuaries and surf zones {{where it}} preys on polychaete worms, small crustaceans and bivalve molluscs.

Young fish inhabit shallow sand flats, both along the coast and well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> reaches of estuaries.|$|E

5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E

5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> and lower portions. The upper park {{is dominated by the}} mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E

5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E
5|$|In the mid {{and late}} 1840s, {{immigrants}} from Ireland and Germany streamed into the city, swelling {{the population of}} Philadelphia and its suburbs. In Philadelphia, as the rich moved west of 7th Street, the poor moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> class' former homes, which were converted into tenements and boarding houses. Many small row houses crowded alleyways and small streets, and these areas were filthy, filled with garbage {{and the smell of}} manure from animal pens. During the 1840s and 1850s, hundreds died each year in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts from diseases such as malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, related to poor sanitation and diseases brought by immigrants; the poor suffered the most fatalities. Small rowhouses and tenement housing were constructed south of South Street.|$|E
5|$|Its {{northern}} boundary (Roosevelt Road) {{marks the}} end of consecutively named east-west streets. East-west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except between State Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton St (20th Street) & Cermak Road (22nd Street) are two of the few named east-west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.|$|E

5|$|Since 1969, the Hyatt {{plant has}} worked in tandem with an {{extensive}} pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively known as the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito Diversion Dam on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito's lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. The Hyatt and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2.2 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year, {{about half of the}} total power produced by the SWP's eight hydroelectric facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kaiapit was {{an action}} fought in 1943 between Australian and Japanese forces in New Guinea during the Markham and Ramu Valley – Finisterre Range {{campaign}} of World War II. Following the landings at Nadzab and at Lae, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> Markham Valley, starting with Kaiapit. The Japanese {{intended to use}} Kaiapit to threaten the Allied position at Nadzab, {{and to create a}} diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD started {{construction}} in 1936 {{on a new}} road that rerouted US2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between Brevort and Moran, US2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US31 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Peninsula. The new routing took US2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M‑122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls.|$|E

5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the caudal fin, {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which the spine extends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column, are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E
5|$|There were minor {{differences}} between the original text and the version published by Princeton. In the Princeton publication, first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations. In response to public concerns about radioactivity, Groves had text added to paragraph 12.18 explaining how {{the height of the}} explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> atmosphere. He also had a one-sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in the production reactors redacted. This deletion was soon noticed by the Russian translators, and only served to highlight its importance to the Soviet atomic bomb project.|$|E
5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E
