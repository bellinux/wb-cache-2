50|$|The cell {{was set up}} in a long-necked {{glass bottle}} with a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> located between two carbon plates. The {{electrolyte}} and depolarizer were mixed. The mixture would dissolve the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> even when the cell was not in use, so there was a mechanism for lifting the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> out of the liquid and storing it in the neck of the bottle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} and innovation {{of this process}} over lithography {{was the use of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> rather than stone ones. <b>Zinc</b> <b>plates</b> were lighter and easier to transport, could produce more prints, and were far less brittle than the stone plates originally used. The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> was also the origin of the name photozincography, which Sir Henry James claims to have invented.|$|R
40|$|Zinc electrodeposits {{are widely}} used to protect iron and steel from corrosion. Zinc {{coatings}} are presently obtained from chloride, sulfate, mixed chloride and sulfate, cyanide and non-cyanide alkaline baths. Atmospheric corrosion {{is associated with the}} use of chloride electrolytes. The use of additives, low cathode efficiency and the costly effluent treatment discourage the use of non-cyanide alkaline <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> baths. Hence, a better quality <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> electrolyte is necessary. In this paper, the authors present a detailed investigation of <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> from non-cyanide based acetate electrolytes and the effect of thiamine hydrochloride and gelatin as additives to produce quality bright deposits. The bath and deposit characteristics of acetate-based <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> was studied and the results are presented...|$|R

Again, when {{a charge}} {{consisting}} of 200 water, 4-1/2 oil of vitriol, and 4 nitric acid was used, each <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> lost 2.16 equivalents; when the charge {{with the same}} battery was 200 water, 9 oil of vitriol, and 8 nitric acid, each <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> lost 2.26 equivalents.|$|R
40|$|A <b>zinc</b> <b>plate,</b> charged {{negative}} {{and connected to}} an electrometer that measures the charge on the plate, can be discharged by the photoelectric effect using the setup of Figure 1. Ultraviolet photons from the arc lamp have sufficient photon energy to eject electrons from the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate.</b> When a glass plate is inserted into the light {{in front of the}} arc lamp, the ultraviolet radiation is removed, leaving less energetic visible photons striking the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate,</b> and the photoelectric discharge ceases, as illustrated in the video. If the plate is charged positive, shining any light on the plate has no effect...|$|R
40|$|Zinc electrodeposits {{are widely}} used to protect iron and steel from {{corrosion}} which are relatively inexpensive. Zinc coatings are nomlally ohtained from chloride and nOD-cyanide alkaline baths. The environmental corrosion along with the electrolytes sensitivity towards metallic impurities limit the use of chloride electrolyte. The use of additive, less cathode efficiency and the emuent treatment do not {{permit the use of}} non-cyanide <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> baths to a greater extent. Hence, the need for the search for a better <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> electrolyte is necessary. In this paper the authors present the details of <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> from an acetate based electrolyte and the result of Hull Cell studies are presented in thi~ paper...|$|R
