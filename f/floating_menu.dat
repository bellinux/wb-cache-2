One category of VRUI is the 3 D floating menus that can be manipulated by users in free space. These menus can contain various controls such as buttons, sliders, and text. This article presents an experimental study that aims at testing the impact of five spatial reference frames on human performance with VRUI. Fifteen subjects participated in the study. Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) and tracking hardware, {{they were asked to}} move a slider on a <b>floating</b> <b>menu</b> in a 3 D virtual space. The menus were completely virtual such that no physical surface was providing haptic feedback to the user. Main results show that the reference frame has a determinant impact on task execution time, positional accuracy and user preference. We also found a link between the number of degrees of freedom shared between these reference frame and user performance. Results also show that user preference can greatly differ from experimental results obtained by measuring task completion times and positional accuracy.

40|$|Interfaces for {{system control}} tasks in {{three-dimensional}} virtual environments (VEs) {{have not been}} extensively studied. This paper focuses on various types of menu systems {{to be used in}} such environments. We describe the design of the TULIP menu, a menu system using Pinch Gloves^TM, and compare it to two common alternatives: <b>floating</b> <b>menus</b> and pen and tablet menus. These three menus were compared in an empirical evaluation. The pen and tablet menu was found to be significantly faster, while users had a preference for TULIP. Subjective discomfort levels were also higher with the <b>floating</b> <b>menus</b> and pen and tablet...|$|R

The proof-of-concept implementation we present shows {{the potential of}} handheld devices as powerful interfaces to Virtual Reality applications. This technique eliminates the display of <b>floating</b> <b>menus</b> and other widgets over the simulation screen. A brief discussion on {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using a handheld for 3 D interaction is presented as well. 1. Introduction: Interactiv...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} for pen-based systems to improve legibility of handwritten text, e. g. smoothing the strokes composing {{the characters and}} words. A very challenging solution is the smooth morphing approach: handwritten strokes are transformed gradually into perfectly legible characters provided by a previously executed handwriting recognition process. In this paper we present our approach to a smooth real-time metamorphosis of handwritten characters into clean typography. Our main contributions are a new hybrid algorithm for character mapping, heuristics for splitting and joining strokes, and finding a stroke mapping {{with the use of}} radial distances. We implemented our methods in a whiteboard application that provides intuitive to use editing operations due to <b>floating</b> <b>menus</b> and stroke gestures. The implementation is based on the Microsoft Tablet PC SDK and the handwriting recognizer provided with the Tablet PC operating system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{performed}} a comparative evaluation to show the effectiveness of two interface tools, one a <b>floating</b> text-based <b>menu</b> (Floating-Menu) {{and the other a}} more interactive iconic tool (Interactive-Icon). We evaluated the use and human performance of both tools within one highly interactive visual analytics system. During task performance we tracked completion times, task errors, and captured coarsegrained interactive behaviors. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{new video}} starts with him {{sitting in a}} chair, then {{flipping}} up a screen on his chair, then selects a video from a little <b>menu</b> <b>floating</b> in the air. Then the videos from there shows more people playing DotA, and several shots {{of a young woman}} dancing. He can also be seen playing as the hero Tiny, where he purchases an item, Butterfly. The tune to the new video is actually DotA remix.|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} a framework for creating interactive 3 D environments for applications in design, education, and the communication of information and ideas [3]. Our most recent work focuses on providing a useful and powerful interface to such a complex environment. To this end we have developed 3 D widgets, objects that encapsulate 3 D geometry and behavior, to control other objects in the scene [2]. We build 3 D widgets as first-class objects in our real-time animation system. Because our system allows rapid prototyping of objects, we hope to enlarge today’s surprisingly small vocabulary of 3 D widgets that includes <b>menus</b> <b>floating</b> in 3 D, gestural picking, translation and rotation, cone trees, and perspective walls. As a way to focus on issues of 3 D widget design, we have developed widgets to perform a particular task: applying high-level deformations to 3 D objects [1]. The complexity of these operation...|$|R
