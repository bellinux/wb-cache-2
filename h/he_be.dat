5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E

50|$|The soul, asserts the text, {{existed before}} the Soma and Surya.

5|$|At Hogwarts, the first-years are {{assigned}} by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suit their personalities. While Harry is being sorted, the Hat suggests that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry objects, the Hat sends him to Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|E

5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E

Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> buried in such a manner that no one would know exactly where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been a fan}} of Kōji Yakusho's acting, Miike made it a {{priority}} that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> cast in the leading role. In addition, he sought younger actors to play the assassins, in particular Sousuke Takaoka and Takayuki Yamada, with whom Miike had worked in his two films, Crows Zero (2007) and its sequel Crows Zero 2 (2009). The film's screenplay was written by Daisuke Tengan, who had also written the screenplay for Miike's film Audition (1999).|$|E

5|$|In May 1947 {{the artistic}} {{collaboration}} between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument.

That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1944, Derrick {{was posted}} to an officer cadet {{training}} unit in Victoria. He requested that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> allowed {{to rejoin the}} 2/48th Battalion {{at the end of}} the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units. An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying. While at this unit, Derrick shared a tent with Reg Saunders, who later became the Army's first Indigenous Australian officer.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1978, 10 {{months after}} being sworn in, White {{resigned}} {{his position on}} the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 was not enough to support his family. Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and <b>he</b> <b>be</b> reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.|$|E
5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} <b>he</b> <b>be</b> {{listed on the}} rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E

50|$|The renouncer has {{realized}} that his inner state is an ocean of total bliss, but one punctuated by waves that rise and fall because of winds of Maya (changing reality, illusion).

5|$|Police visited Brady {{in prison}} again {{and told him}} of Hindley's confession, which at first he refused to believe.

5|$|Rather than {{allowing}} {{himself to}} be paroled, Hogun requested <b>he</b> <b>be</b> taken prisoner, and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel's Point on Point Pleasant, located {{in what is now}} Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, across from Sullivan's Island. Hogun's decision was based, in part, on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British, who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the British West Indies. The British, however, held only the officers at Haddrel's Point, deciding to house the enlisted men in barracks in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} the mood of the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism.

Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>be</b> allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E
