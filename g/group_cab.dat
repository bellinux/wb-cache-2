40|$|Volvo <b>Group’s</b> <b>cab</b> {{plant in}} Umeå {{produces}} cab bodies {{and consists of}} three operating areas; the Stamping and parts production, the Body in White and the Paint shop. Today the plant produces around XXX cabs/week, but {{the goal is to}} reach the invested capacity of XXX cabs/week. In order to increase the production capacity, the efficiency of both the manual and the automated processes need to be improved. Unlike the manual processes in where the capacity can be increased by enlarged workforce, the automated processes need to be optimized. Today the cabs are produced in the same order as the orders are received. The cab plant wants to investigate if the capacity of the automated segment in the Body in White unit can be increased by changing the order in the production sequence. This culminates in the following problem definition:  Is there untapped potential of the Body in White that can be achieved by an optimization of the production sequence? If so, how can Volvo <b>Group’s</b> <b>cab</b> plant in Umeå utilize this knowledge in the production planning process? The objective of the project was achieved by combining discrete event simulation with a heuristic optimization approach. The results shows that long batches in the production sequence limit the throughput of the system. By spreading the unfavorable subsequences of batches evenly over the production sequence, the total throughput of the Body in White can be increased by 52 cabs/week. Volvokoncernens hyttfabrik i Umeå producerar förarhytter och är uppdelad i tre driftsområden; pressning och detaljtillverkning, hyttsammansättning och ytbehandling. Idag producerar fabriken ca XXX hytter/vecka, men möjlighet finns att nå upp till den investerade kapaciteten på XXX hytter/vecka. För att kunna öka produktionskapaciteten behöver både de manuella och de automatiserade processerna effektiviseras. Till skillnad från de manuella processerna, där kapaciteten kan ökas genom att öka antalet operatörer, behöver de automatiserade processerna optimeras. Idag produceras hytterna i samma ordning som beställningarna kommer in. Hyttfabriken vill undersöka om det finns en möjlighet att öka kapaciteten för den automatiserade processen i Body in White genom att optimera produktionssekvensen. Detta leder fram till följande problemformulering: Finns det outnyttjad potential i Body in White som kan uppnås genom att optimera produktionssekvensen? Hur kan Volvokoncernens hyttfabrik i Umeå utnyttja denna kunskap vid planering av produktionen? Målet med projektet har uppnåtts genom att kombinera diskret händelsesimulering med optimering genom heuristiker. Resultatet visar att stora batcher av samma variant i produktionen begränsar genomströmningen i processen. Genom att bland annat sprida ut de ogynnsamma delsekvenserna jämnt över produktionssekvensen kan den totala genomströmningen i Body in White ökas med 52 hytter/vecka. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 49) Eleven light-regulated pea genes, {{grouped into}} five different categories {{based on their}} photophysiological characteristics, are analyzed genetically. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are used to detect variation for these genetic loci and to compare the variation observed {{with an assortment of}} genetic markers using F 2 progeny arrays. Linkage relationships are then determined that establish the intrachromosomal assignments of all but three of the genes examined. The study reveals that of the six putative Cab genes characterized, three are located near the Cab multigene complex previously assigned to chromosome 7, two are linked to one another are not associated with the Cab multigene cluster, and one is isolated from both of these gene sets. The first three genetic loci do belong to the same photophysiological <b>group</b> as <b>Cab</b> however, the latter belong to three different groups, and only one of these is the <b>group</b> containing <b>Cab.</b> Two of the other phytochrome-regulated genetic loci, one purported to encode cytochrome and the other seed lectin, differ in both function and light regulation, but map in relative proximity on chromosome 2.

40|$|Transportation–related problems, like road congestion, parking, and {{pollution}} are increasing in most cities. In {{order to reduce}} traffic, recent work has proposed methods for vehicle sharing, for example for sharing <b>cabs</b> by <b>grouping</b> “closeby” <b>cab</b> requests and thus minimizing transportation cost and utilizing cab space. However, the methods proposed so far do not scale to large data volumes, which is necessary to facilitate large scale collective transportation systems, e. g., ride–sharing systems for large cities. This paper presents highly scalable “trip grouping ” algorithms, that generalize previous techniques and support input rates that can be orders of magnitude larger. The following three contributions make the grouping algorithms scalable. First, the basic grouping algorithm is expressed as a continuous stream query in a data stream management system to allow for very large flows of requests. Second, following the divide–and–conquer paradigm, four space–partitioning policies for dividing the input data stream into sub– streams are developed and implemented using continuous stream queries. Third, using the partitioning policies, parallel implementations of the grouping algorithm in a parallel computing environment are described. Extensive experimental {{results show that the}} parallel implementation using simple adaptive partitioning methods can achieve speed–ups of several orders of magnitudes without significantly effecting the quality of the grouping...|$|R
40|$|Train {{drivers in}} heavy haul {{rely on a}} complex mental model of the railway environment. This ensures {{that they can use}} the {{appropriate}} driving styles for long and heavy trains, but also accurately apply the correct driving strategies. The use of driving strategies is powered by route knowledge, which links dynamic task demands with remedial actions and behaviours. Despite the importance of driving strategy, very little research has sought to examine how train drivers in heavy haul structure and apply their strategies, and how this relates with the way route knowledge is formalised. Data were collected from train drivers (n = 25) in two heavy hail rail operators (coal, iron ore) using an innovative approach that incorporated scenario simulation and task verbalisation into focus <b>groups</b> and <b>cab</b> rides. Analysis of these data identified train management as the dominant component of driving style, and routes were formalised according to different aspects of the railway’s centreline coordinates. These ranged from focusing on the Gradient Profile, through to the complete 3 D landform. This paper disaggregates the ingredients of driving strategy and formalisms that were found to underpin train driving in heavy haul, and identifies synergies between different strategy elements. The outcomes of this study are discussed in the context of implications on training, recruitment and “driverless trains,” and aim to help inform a more standardised development of driving skills...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Cabergoline (CAB) is {{conventionally}} {{started at}} {{a dose of}} 0. 25 - 0. 5 mg once a week with dose escalation at 1 to 3 months intervals. Previously, we and others have shown that rapid escalation and high doses of CAB can lead to normalization of serum PRL as early as 8. 2 weeks in 93 % of the patients. We hypothesize that rapid escalation of CAB doses, may help in both the earlier normalization of PRL and also significant shrinkage of tumor mass. Study Design: Randomized, prospective, interventional trial. Subjects and Methods: Forty two patients (male or female) with macroprolactinoma were randomized to conventional (group A) or rapid escalation (<b>group</b> B) of <b>CAB</b> dosing. In <b>group</b> B, <b>CAB</b> was started at a dose of 0. 5 mg twice a week followed by a weekly hike of 1 mg/week, based on serum PRL and then monthly. The end point {{of the present study}} was a composite of normoprolactinemia and tumor shrinkage ≥ 50 % from baseline. PRL and visual field analysis (weekly), other hormonal work up periodically and magnetic resonance imaging (sella) was performed monthly. Results: A total of 19 patients in each group completed a minimum follow-up of 6 months. There was a reduction of 72. 7 ± 26. 2 % in group A and 84. 1 ± 15. 0 in group B (P = 0. 24) within a week of CAB therapy. The duration of CAB treatment to normalize PRL was 10. 2 ± 9. 2 week(2 - 36) in group A and 7. 2 ± 6. 2 weeks(1 - 24) in group B (P = 0. 28). There was no difference in the tumor shrinkage in either of the groups (92. 3 % [46. 7 - 100 %] in group A and 90. 5 % [66. 6 - 100 %] reduction in group B). The composite end point was achieved in 14 patients in group A (73. 6 %) and 16 patients in group B (84. 2 %) (P = 0. 69). The composite end point was achieved in 13. 1 ± 9. 5 weeks (group A) versus 16. 5 ± 14. 1 weeks (group B) (P = 0. 61). Discussion: This is first head to head comparative trial showing that a rapid hike of CAB dose is not associated with earlier normalization of PRL or reduction in tumor volume as compared to conventional monthly hike. There is no difference in the number of patients or duration required to achieve the composite end point. We obtained much earlier PRL normalization (8. 4 weeks) as compared to previous studies (36 - 72 weeks), probably because PRL was not assessed as frequently as in the present study. Rapid escalation of CAB was well tolerated. Conclusion: A weekly or a conventional 4 weekly escalation of CAB have a similar efficacy with regards to the achievement of normoprolactinemia and significant tumor shrinkage for macroprolactinoma...|$|R

40|$|Four {{different}} {{alpine meadow}} communities were studied {{to examine the}} effects of plant-soil-enzyme interactions on plant composition and diversity. Enzyme activities differed by meadow type, and in general were higher in the upper soil layers (0 – 10 and 10 – 20 [*]cm) than in the 20 – 40 [*]cm layer. Community differences in plant composition or functional group composition were reflected in plant biomass distribution. The identity of a species (or a functional group) was a greater determinant of ecosystem function than the number of plant species. A significant correlation was found between the coverage per functional group and the aboveground biomass of functional groups in four alpine meadows. Soil microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and enzyme activity were each affected by both functional <b>group</b> biomass and <b>CAB</b> in the different meadow types. The negative correlation between diversity and CAB in the KTS may be influenced by a high soil nutrients input as a result of a higher litter input because of high aboveground biomass.

Mean survival rates were 78. 9 % in group 1 and 52. 3 % in group 2 (p= 0. 055). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in adverse events between the 2 groups (p= 0. 304). The International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF- 5) score before treat-ment was 19. 3 ± 5. 9 in group 1 and 18. 3 ± 5. 8 in group 2 (p= 0. 487). The IIEF- 5 score after treatment was 17. 1 ± 6. 3 in group 1 and 14. 0 ± 6. 1 in group 2, which was a statistically significant difference (p= 0. 036). Conclusions: The PSA change, mean survival rate, and adverse events in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with bicalutamide 150 -mg and CAB did not differ significantly. However, sexual function was better in the bicalutamide 150 -mg group. Therefore, bicalutamide 150 -mg monotherapy could be considered as a treat-ment for locally advanced prostate cancer in patients concerned about sexual function...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Observational studies {{suggested}} that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) {{is associated with}} an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. They all compared ADT-treated cancer patients to non-treated patients or non-cancer subjects. Our aim was to evaluate whether CV risk differs by type of ADT. METHODS: Through nationwide population-based claims reimbursement database linked to hospital discharge database, we identified adult men with prostate cancer who initiated ADT (gonadotrophin releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist or antagonist, antiandrogen [AA], combined androgen blockade [CAB]) or had orchiectomy (OT) between 1 st July, 2010, and the 31 st December, 2011, and followed them up to 31 st December, 2013. The main analysis followed an 'on-treatment' approach that censored all patients at the time of first therapeutic modification; it used Cox regression analysis to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for hospitalisations for ischaemic events (myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, whichever came first), adjusted on age, baseline co-morbidities and taking into account death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Among the 35, 118 new ADT users, 71 % received GnRH agonist (reference <b>group),</b> 12 % <b>CAB,</b> 13 % AA, 3. 6 % GnRH antagonist and 0. 6 % had OT. CAB was {{associated with an increased}} risk (adjusted HR [95 % confidence interval _CI_], 1. 6 [1. 3 - 2. 0]) and AA with a decreased risk (adjusted HR [95 % CI], 0. 6 [0. 4 - 0. 9]) of ischaemic events when compared to GnRH agonist. No significant association was found with GnRH antagonist (adjusted HR [95 % CI], 1. 2 (0. 7 - 2. 1)). CONCLUSION: CV risk appeared different across ADT modalities. The probability of a clinically meaningful difference when comparing GnRH antagonists to agonists appears rather low. In a context where better overall and cancer specific survival without worsening quality of life is a challenge for clinicians, a potential heterogeneity in CV morbidity becomes crucial when choosing an ADT...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Conventional anti-androgen regimens {{were widely}} {{used as an}} {{initiation}} or combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy in advanced prostate cancer patients. Currently, new androgen pathway inhibitors such as abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide had been proven effective in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In this study, we attempt to analyze the role of conventional anti-androgen drugs as deferred CAB therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Materials and Methods: From 2012 to 2017, 48 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients who received sequential treatments with primary androgen blockade, oral anti-androgen regimens, and docetaxel followed by AA treatment were included. We defined effective deferred CAB as any decline of PSA after add-on antiandrogen after CRPC. Patients were separated into effective and ineffective deferred CAB. Comparison between two groups in the first line androgen deprivation therapy duration, CRPC PSA level, pre-AA PSA level, chemotherapy dosages, duration, and patients progression free survival and overall survival after AA treatment were analyzed. Results: Twenty-three patients (47. 9 %) achieved PSA decline after deferred CAB. Among total 48 patients, 24 patients experienced PSA decline more than 50 % after AA treatment. The median PSA progression-free survival and overall survival after AA treatment in the total cohort of 48 patients were 4. 4 and 24. 3 months, respectively. The effective deferred <b>CAB</b> <b>group</b> showed significantly lower PSA level, lower percentage of PSA progression, higher total follow-up duration, higher percentage of surviving patients, better progression free survival, and overall survival estimate after AA treatment. Of the eight variables analyzed, effectiveness in deferred CAB showed positive association to progression free survival (HR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 12 – 0. 67, p = 0. 004) and overall survival (HR 0. 24, 95 % CI 0. 07 – 0. 81, p = 0. 022). First line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) duration also showed positive association to overall survival (HR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 91 – 0. 99, p = 0. 023). Conclusions: Effectiveness of deferred CAB therapy was positively associated with progression free survival and overall survival of AA treatment after docetaxel. It {{can be used as}} a pre-treatment predictor...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{use of a}} Community Advisory Board (CAB) is {{one method}} of {{ensuring}} community engagement in community based research. To identify the process used to constitute CABs in Zambia, this paper draws on the perspectives of both research team members and CAB members from research <b>groups</b> who used <b>CABs</b> in Lusaka. Enabling and restricting factors impacting on {{the functioning of the}} CAB were identified. Methods: All studies approved by the University of Zambia Bioethics Research Committee (UBNZABREC) from 2008 – 2012 were reviewed to identify those studies that were likely to include a CAB. Eight teams with studies that included a CAB were identified. For each of these studies, consent was obtained to conduct an informal interview with a research team member and to obtain contact details for one CAB member. In total 14 interviews were conducted with 8 research team members and 6 CAB members from 12 – 30 August 2013. Results: Identification of potential CAB members from the community and their participation in developing the terms of reference for CABs was perceived to have contributed {{to the success of the}} CAB. Due to the trust that the community had in members of their community the CABs were then in a stronger position to influence community participation in the research. Training of CAB members was identified as a factor that enhanced the functioning of a CAB. Lack of commitment and low literacy levels of CAB members posed a threat to the role of the CAB. Although compensation in the form of a stipend was not provided, CAB members were provided with transport reimbursements for attending meetings. Conclusions: Selection of CAB members from within the community contributed to community confidence in the CAB, enhancing its ability to act as an effective link between study team and community. This contributed positively to the conduct of the study and enhanced community awareness and acceptance of the research. However, establishment of study specific CABs has the potential to compromise CAB independence due to support provided by the research team in the form of transport reimbursements and other forms of support. Consideration should be given to establishing community wide Community Advisory Boards that could function across a range of studies to increase independent objective decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Physiological Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Bi-directional {{communication}} {{exists between}} HPA-axis activation and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). However, the relative contribution of centrally versus peripherally secreted IL- 6 remains unclear, especially under psychological stress conditions. We hypothesised that the HPA response to mild psychological stress {{is dependent on}} IL- 6, both centrally and peripherally. 120 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups, depending on whether they received an anti-IL- 6 antibody (Ab) (2 μg/ml/kg body weight) or a placebo (sterile saline) injection {{and whether or not}} they were subjected to 1 hour of restraint stress for 1, 2 or 3 days. Rats were euthanized 24 hours after stress exposure. Plasma corticosteroid (GC) levels remained significantly increased 24 hours after a single stress exposure (control placebo (CP) versus stress placebo (SP) : p < 0. 05). The undetectable plasma IL- 6 levels evident across all groups may be explained by the short half-life of IL- 6. Plasma IL- 1 β levels decreased when IL- 6 was blocked in unstressed animals (CP versus CAb: p < 0. 05), suggesting a role for IL- 6 in the maintenance of IL- 1 β levels under tonic physiological conditions. At tissue level, pituitary gland mass increased significantly at time point 2, independently of stress when blocking IL- 6 (CAb: p < 0. 05). This suggests that when normal homeostasis is threatened, immediate adaption or at least compensation may occur. It was observed that GR, IL- 1 β, IL- 1 βR, IL- 6, IL- 6 R and GABAARα 1 showed no response to stress alone in the pituitary. It is therefore more likely that resistance to adaptation exists centrally. IL- 1 β and IL- 1 βR (p < 0. 05) and GABAARα 1 (p < 0. 005) expression increased in the <b>CAb</b> <b>group</b> in the pituitary, again suggesting a role for IL- 6 under control conditions. In terms of the adrenal, blocking IL- 6 resulted in decreased glandular mass at time point 1, independent of stress (CAb and SAb: p < 0. 005). The up-regulation in GR expression seen in CAb and SAb (p < 0. 05) may be the effect of a compensatory mechanism to increase IL- 6 dependent bioactivity of GCs. The fact that expression of IL- 6, IL- 6 R, IL- 1 β and IL- 1 βR consistently increased in the Ab groups, and mostly in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis, suggests that lack of local direct negative cytokine feedback occurred in response to very low plasma IL- 6 levels and that this contributes more than GCs in the down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine release. In conclusion, consistent effects of the Ab were apparent in the tissues investigated, even in control conditions, suggesting that IL- 6 plays a role in the maintenance of basal homeostasis, including its regulation of the response to psychological stress. We found differential regulation in terms of cytokines and GCs when comparing peripheral versus central effects of stress and Ab, as well as the levels of cytokines in the blood compartment, compared to within tissues. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Daar bestaan twee-rigting kommunikasie tussen HPA-as aktivering en interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), allhoewel die relatiewe bydrae van sentraal versus perifeer afgeskeide IL- 6 nog onduidelik is, veral gedurende sielkundige strestoestande. Ons hipotese is dat die HPA reaksie tot sielkundige stres afhanklik van IL- 6 is, beide sentraal en in die periferie. 120 manlike Wistar rotte is in vier groepe verdeel, afhangende van of hulle ‘n anti-IL- 6 teenliggaampie (Ab) (2 μg/ml/kg liggaamsgewig) of ‘n plasebo (steriele soutoplossing) inspuiting gekry het, en of hulle onderworpe was aan 1 uur van vaskeer-stres vir 1, 2 of 3 dae. Rotte is 24 uur na blootstelling aan stres aan genadedood onderwerp. Bloed kortikosteroïed (GC) vlakke het beduidend toegeneem binne 24 uur na ‘n eenmalige stres blootstelling (kontrole plasebo (CP) versus stres plasebo (SP) : p < 0. 05). Die onmeetbaar lae vlakke van IL- 6 regoor al die groepe, kan verduidelik word na aanleiding van die kort half-leeftyd van IL- 6. Bloed IL- 1 β vlakke het afgeneem in kontrole rotte wanneer IL- 6 geblok is (CP versus CAb: p < 0. 05). Dit kan beteken dat IL- 6 noodsaaklik is vir die onderhoud van IL- 1 β vlakke gedurende basale toestande. Op weefselvlak het die hipofise massa toegeneem by tydpunt 2 toe IL- 6 geblok is, onafhanklik van stres (CAb: p < 0. 05). Dit dui aan dat wanneer normale homeostase bedreig word, daar onmiddelike aanpassing of kompensasie plaasvind. Dit is opvallend dat GR, IL- 1 β, IL- 1 βR, IL- 6, IL- 6 R en GABAARα 1 geen respons in terme van stres alleen in die hipofise getoon het nie. Na aanleiding daarvan is dit meer waarskynlik dat weerstand tot aanpassing sentraal bestaan. IL- 1 β and IL- 1 βR (p < 0. 05) en GABAARα 1 (p < 0. 005) uitdrukking in die hipofise het toegeneem in die CAb groep, wat weereens ‘n rol vir IL- 6 onder kontrole toestande uitwys. In terme van die bynier, het die blok van IL- 6 ‘n afname in massa veroorsaak by tydpunt 1, wat weer onafhanklik van stres was (CAb en SAb: p < 0. 005). Die opregulering in die CAb en SAb groepe (p < 0. 05), kan wees as gevolg van ‘n kompensasie meganisme om IL- 6 afhanklike GC aktiwiteit te verhoog. Die feit dat die uitdrukking van IL- 6, IL- 6 R, IL- 1 β and IL- 1 βR in die Ab groepe deurlopend verhoog was, en meeste in die zona fasciculata en zona reticularis, stel voor dat daar ‘n tekort aan plaaslike, direkte sitokien negatiewe terugvoering was, as gevolg van die merkwaardige lae bloed IL- 6 vlakke en dat dit meer bydra as GCs in die afregulering van inflammatoriese sitokien vrystelling...|$|R
