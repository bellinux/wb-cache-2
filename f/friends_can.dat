5|$|Peter is {{put under}} house arrest for assault and soon begins to miss his friends. Peter has {{a vision of the}} Pawtucket Patriot, a fictional ale mascot, from his ale can label and on his advice opens a bar in his {{basement}} so that his <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> come to visit. The basement bar soon becomes a local hotspot. Lois is upset about this, until she gets a chance to sing on stage before an appreciative crowd. As she savors the spotlight over the next few days, Peter becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the attention she is getting, especially from the male patrons. Peter demands that she quit singing, but she refuses.|$|E

25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> be crucial for social development.|$|E

25|$|No Man's Sky is {{primarily}} {{designed as a}} single-player game, though discoveries can be shared to all players via the Steam Workshop, and <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> track {{each other on the}} game's galactic map. Hello Games' Sean Murray stated that one might spend about forty hours of gametime to reach the centre of the galaxy if they did not perform any side activities, but he also fully anticipated that players would play the game in a manner that suits them, such as having those that might try to catalogue the flora and fauna in the universe, while others may attempt to set up trade routes between planets. Players can track friends on the galactic map and the system maps. Due to limited multiplayer aspects, Sony does not require PlayStation 4 users to have a PlayStation Plus subscription to play the game online.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the need}} for secrecy during the two months of filming, all {{candidates}} are made to sign a confidentiality agreement which prohibits all, but a few confidants nominated by them, to be told of where they will be during that time, which remains active after filming until the series has started broadcast, with all {{contact with the outside world}} restricted to a high level; each candidate gets a limited phone call once a week, and all have no access to newspapers, television or internet, while any electronic communication equipment they have (i.e. mobiles) is handed in before they begin. In addition, all candidates are made to remain in their accommodation throughout filming except when they must head out for a task, and can only take a day off if they are supervised by a chaperone from the production crew. As a result, the persistent presence of the cameras, the closeness of rivals in the competition and the lack of contact with families & <b>friends,</b> <b>can</b> cause considerable pressure and stress for a candidate between entering the process, to leaving it.|$|E
25|$|Z-Link and Kaza both pride {{themselves}} on horizontal integration of their in-house management, where the artists are given full control over all steps of the publication of their product – from creation, to editing, publishing and distribution. Z-Link goes even further, working to foster new talent until it can gain a truly public following: traditional calls for submission are supplemented by scouting of unpublished works on blogs, Facebook pages and other collective platforms used by fan communities online. Aspiring artists are encouraged {{to reach out to}} an audience, so that budding amateurs, who previously created for <b>friends,</b> <b>can</b> develop a wider fanbase and become published artists. Typically, new artists first publish short installments in Z-Link's monthly manga and gaming magazine, Laabstore, before being commissioned to produce a small print run (500–1,000 copies) of an independent volume. This structure permits Z-Link to reconfigure the traditional publishing channels and capitalize on its position between conventional publication and self-production. It provides the infrastructure for autonomous artists to achieve local print runs at a reasonable cost. Since their creation, Z-Link and Kaza have developed an enthusiastic and loyal following. Their catalogs, however, remain limited in number and difficult to procure, as the works are still distributed through a capillary network including a few bookstores in Algiers, Oran and Constantine.|$|E

500|$|Chrono Trigger DS {{added two}} new {{scenarios}} to the game. In the first, Crono and his <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> help a [...] "lost sanctum" [...] of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to Triggers sequel, Chrono Cross. In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an {{army in the}} town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia. The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the Time Devourer—a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in Chrono Cross. A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Chris Martins {{praised the}} album, stating that [...] "perhaps most {{impressive}} is that Tyler, The Creator takes a noticeable step {{back so that}} his <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> enjoy the spotlight. When he does show up—standouts include the hulking G-funk mutation “Hcapd” and the grungy, bass-addled “P”—both his beats and raps thrill: All of the twisted jokes, tough introspection, and rabble-rousing that fans have come to expect, {{with none of the}} unfortunate rape references his detractors rightly called him on." [...] Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer [...] "Oldie" [...] epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as [...] "hype warranted." [...] Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that [...] "it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler’s Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype’s BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G’s Ali and Domo’s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior." [...] He described the album as something that [...] "mainly sounds like a bunch of dudes in a dank basement cooking up the wildest smack talk possible, with one-upping each other being the primary objective." ...|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E

500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E
500|$|In chapter five, Lucas, Duster and Kumatora {{recover the}} egg, and meet a Masked Man. In chapter 6 Lucas meets {{the ghost of}} his dead mother Hinawa in a {{sunflower}} field. Lucas tries to jump out to her but falls into a stack of hay in Tazmily. In chapter seven, separated from Duster and Kumatora, Lucas and his dog, Boney, learn about the seven Needles kept by seven Magypsies that quell a sleeping dragon underneath the earth. A prophecy foretold that a [...] "chosen one" [...] would come to pull the Needles and wake the dragon and determine {{the fate of the}} world. Racing the Masked Man in search of these Needles, Lucas battles through a laboratory of chimeras, reunites with Kumatora and Duster, and meets Mr. Saturn. In chapter eight, Pig King Master Porky, who returned from Mother 2, invites Lucas and his cohorts to New Pork City, where Tazmily residents have relocated. Lucas learns that the islands are protected by the dragon, that the egg contains the destructive mindsets of the outside world, that Porky is after the needles and its subsequent power, and that both Porky's Masked Man and Lucas have each pulled three of the seven Needles. Lucas and his cohorts fight Porky, and are able to defeat him. However, to protect himself, Porky seals himself within his absolutely safe capsule, which Lucas and his <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> not harm. However, Porky himself can not harm them, and is revealed to be unable to ever leave the capsule. Later, Lucas reunites with Flint. As they prepare to pull the final Needle, Lucas's party is hurt by the Masked Man, who is revealed as Claus, and immediately engages them in battle. Hinawa's spirit attempts to talk to Claus, while Flint badly injures himself to protect Lucas. The fight continues until Claus, now having regained his sense of self, tragically commits suicide by deliberately reflecting one of his attacks off Lucas' Franklin Badge. Lucas pulls the final Needle, awakening the Dragon and destroying the Nowhere Islands. In an epilogue set in darkness, the game's cast reveals that they have survived (although Porky is still trapped inside the Absolutely Safe Capsule); the world has been rebuilt without Porky's influence. In the final frame, the Mother 3 logo is shown without its metal, as restored to nature.|$|E

2500|$|In Judaism, {{one must}} go to those he has harmed {{in order to be}} {{entitled}} to forgiveness. [...] This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from God for wrongs the person has done to other people.

2500|$|... "Writing's on the Wall" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison {{from his}} 1981 album Somewhere in England. It was also the B-side of the album's lead single, [...] "All Those Years Ago", which Harrison wrote {{as a tribute to}} his former Beatles bandmate John Lennon. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the transient nature of life and the importance of recognising a spiritual purpose. Although the song was written long before Lennon's murder in New York in December 1980, the lyrics' reference to how easily <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> be shot down and killed led listeners to interpret it as a further comment on Lennon's death.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{early in her}} career, Grant stated, [...] "I have a healthy {{sense of right and}} wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among <b>friends</b> <b>can</b> be good for a laugh." [...] The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: [...] "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded {{it in such a way}} that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'" ...|$|E
