5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear <b>drag</b> <b>link,</b> which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E

However, at the air show held on opening day in 1959 there were two significant incidents. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Sunderland flying boat scraped its keel along the runway during a low pass in turbulent conditions; it returned to its base at Hobsonville and was beached for repair. A Royal Air Force Avro Vulcan bomber aborted its landing when it touched down short of the runway, rupturing its left main landing gear <b>drag</b> <b>link,</b> the wing attachments and engine fuel lines; the aircraft flew to Ohakea air base where it was stranded for several months being repaired.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} the <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> is {{connected}} via the Pitman arm and steering gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.|$|E
50|$|The Pitman arm is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) sector shaft, it converts the angular motion of the sector shaft into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} sector shaft and supports the <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> or center link with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or center) link, causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|E
5000|$|The term is {{commonly}} used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts rotation of a pitman arm to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod links which pivot the wheels to be steered.

Two <b>drag</b> <b>links</b> attached under the rear axle with a single compression link connected to the upper rear transmission case automatically regulating the hydraulic suspension's height. This allowed lighter implement to be used, with no attached wheels or separate manual controls. By assisting the tractor to maintain traction from a combined drag and rotary force to the axle, which kept the rear driving wheels on the ground, the front steering wheels had improved contact with the ground. Consequently, the [...] "rearing and bucking" [...] of overloaded tractors was reduced, making tractors much safer for the operator.|$|R
500|$|On 1 October 1956, Vulcan B.1 XA897, {{the first}} to be delivered, crashed at London Heathrow Airport during Operation Tasman Flight, a flag-waving trip to Australia and New Zealand.

The impact probably broke the <b>drag</b> <b>links</b> on the main undercarriage, allowing the undercarriage to be forced backwards and damaged the wing's trailing edge. After the initial impact, XA897 rose back in the air. The pilot, Squadron Leader D. R. Howard, and co-pilot Air Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, AOC-in-C Bomber Command, both ejected and survived, the other four occupants (including a spare pilot and an Avro representative) were killed when the aircraft hit the ground again and broke up.|$|R

50|$|W&E {{felt that}} the maximum payload for their {{three-wheeled}} float was 30 cwt, and such a model {{was known as the}} Major. Bigger payloads required a four-wheeled float, and the Freighliner was showcased at the 1966 Royal Dairy Show. It came as a 50 cwt model and twin tyres were fitted on the rear axle. In order to retain the manoeuvrability of the three-wheeled vehicles, the front springs and steering <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> were placed inside the frames, which allowed a kerb-to-kerb turning circle of 30 ft to be achieved. The wheelbase was 7.75 ft, with the cab located in front of the front wheels, to give easy access to the driving position. Three models were available, with top speeds of 14 mph, 17 mph and 20 mph.

5000|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{a repeat of the}} post First World War economic recession, GM started the [...] "Chevrolet Cadet" [...] project (a compact car intended to sell for less than [...] ), that ran from 1945 to 1947, to extend the Chevrolet range downwards in the U.S. new car market. Chevrolet head of engineering Earle S. MacPherson was in charge of development. It had a unibody structure, an over-square over head valve engine, a strut-type front suspension, small-diameter road wheels, a three-speed gearbox, brake and clutch pedals suspended from the bulkhead rather than floor-mounted, and integrated fender/body styling. It was light and technically advanced, but GM's management cancelled it, stating that it was not economically viable. The anticipated post Second World War U.S. car market recession hadn't materialised. The MacPherson strut, probably the world's most common form of independent suspension, evolved in the GM Cadet project by combining long tubular shock absorbers with external coil springs, and locating them in tall towers that directed the vertical travel of the wheels and also formed the [...] "king pin" [...] or [...] "swivel pin axis" [...] around which the front wheels could turn. It was elegantly simple, with just three links holding the wheel in place - the strut itself, the single-piece transverse lower arm, and the anti-roll bar that doubled as a <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> for the wheel hub. MacPherson took his ideas to Ford instead. They were first used in the French 1948 Ford Vedette. Next in the 1950 British Ford Consul and Zephyr (British mid-size cars, {{the same size as the}} Cadet), which owed more to the Cadet than just the MacPherson strut suspension, and caused a sensation when they were launched. In 1953, a miniaturised economy car version, the Anglia 100E was launched in Britain.|$|E
