40|$|The {{utility of}} a {{handheld}} device is often {{constrained by the}} battery life, particularly with recent usage patterns where the device {{is likely to be}} powered on at all times. The display component in these devices is a major consumer of battery energy and reducing its energy consumption can significantly enhance its utility. This primary research explores the impact of emerging technologies that provide energy-saving display modifications on perceived ease of use, quality, and overall user acceptance, and seeks to understand the tradeoffs between energy reduction and user acceptance for future interfaces. For our study, twelve handheld users reviewed energy-adaptive and standard display interfaces during five scenarios representing frequently performed tasks. The results show good acceptance of energy-aware user interfaces. While displays for tasks involving notifications and menus were deemed acceptable, primarily due to enhanced contrast levels, displays for longer tasks involving greater informational context need additional work.

The {{goal is to}} maximize <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> in the <b>display</b> system by means of dynamic backlight dimming subject to a user-specified tolerance on the video distortion. The video distortion itself comprises of (i) an intraframe (spatial) distortion component due to frame-sensitive backlight scaling and transmittance function tuning and (ii) an inter-frame (temporal) distortion component due to large-step backlight dimming across multiple frames and modulated by the physiological characteristics of the human visual system. The proposed backlight scaling technique is capable of efficiently computing the flickering effect online and subsequently using {{a measure of the}} temporal distortion to appropriately adjust the slack on the intra-frame spatial distortion. The proposed technique has been implemented on the Apollo Testbed II hardware platform.

40|$|Abstract: Liquid Crystal Displays have {{appeared}} in applications ranging from medical equipment to automobiles, gas pumps, Laptops and handheld portable computers. These display components present a cascaded energy attenuator to the battery of handheld device {{which is responsible for}} about half of energy drain at maximum display intensity. As such, the display components become the main focus of every effort for maximization of embedded system’s battery life-time. This paper proposes an approach for pixel transformation of the displayed image to increase the potential <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> of the backlight scaling method. The proposed approach takes advantage of human visual system (HVS) characteristics and tries to minimize distortion between the perceived brightness values of the individual pixels in the original image and those of the backlight-scaled image. This is in contrast to previous backlight scaling approaches which simply match the luminance values of the individual pixels in the original and backlight-scaled images. Furthermore, this paper proposes a temporally-aware backlight scaling technique for video streams. The goal is to maximize <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> in the <b>display</b> system by means of dynamic backlight dimming subject to a video distortion tolerance.
