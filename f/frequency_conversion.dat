UV diode lasers have been demonstrated using Ce:LiSAF crystals (cerium-doped lithium strontium aluminum fluoride), a process developed in the 1990s at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

25|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>conversion</b> {{involves}} the use of transverters that convert the operating frequency of the 802.11b/g device from 2.4GHz to another band entirely. Transverter is a technical term and is rarely used to describe these products which are more commonly known as frequency converters, up/down converters, and just converters. Commercially available converters can convert a 2.4GHz 802.11b/g signal to the 3.4GHz (9cm) band which is not authorized for unlicensed Part 15 users.|$|E
25|$|Usually the {{intermediate}} frequency {{is lower than}} the reception frequency fRF, but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a higher IF frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10kHz to 30MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4MHz, so the primary images are far away. The first IF stage uses a crystal filter with a 12kHz bandwidth. There is a second <b>frequency</b> <b>conversion</b> (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4MHz first IF with 80MHz to create a 1.4MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not a major problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second mixer is fixed tuned.|$|E

40|$|Selection {{for higher}} and lower meiotic <b>conversion</b> <b>frequencies</b> was {{investigated}} in the fungus Ascobolus immersus. Strains carrying the same known gene conversion control factors, which have major effects on <b>conversion</b> <b>frequencies</b> at their specific target locus, sometimes gave significant differences in <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency.</b> Selection for high or low <b>conversion</b> <b>frequencies</b> at the w 1 - 78 site was practiced for five generations, giving significant responses in both directions. These responses were due to polygenes, or genes of minor effect, not to new conversion control factors of major effect. Crosses of selected strains to strains with other mutations showed that the genes' effects were not specific to w 1 - 78, but could affect <b>conversion</b> <b>frequencies</b> of another mutation, w 1 - 3 C 1, at that locus and of two other loci, w-BHj and w 9, which are unlinked to w 1 or to each other. The proportional changes in gene <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> due to selection varied according to the locus and site involved {{and according to the}} conversion control factor alleles present. There were differences of >/= 277 % in <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> between ``high'' and ``low'' strains.

During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of TRW confirmed {{that there was no}} way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added <b>frequency</b> <b>conversion</b> to 351nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency. In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, filters {{employed}} in the <b>frequency</b> <b>conversion</b> processes of the transmitter and receiver all contribute to gain and phase variations across the system passband, especially near to band edges. [...] In particular, major contributors to overall non-linear phase characteristics are the low-pass filters preceding the A/D converters, which are usually sharp-cut filters chosen to ensure maximum bandwidth while minimizing aliased noise.

Vacuum-tube tetrodes, using a screen grid, exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes.

The <b>frequency</b> of <b>conversion</b> decreased from left to right in the locus. The disparity steadily increased from left to right and then reached a plateau. Twenty-two frameshift mutants giving more 6 + 2 m than 2 + 6 m aberrant asci (type A) and closely linked to three type B mutants were also studied; they showed the same <b>frequency</b> of <b>conversion</b> and the same disparity (but in the opposite direction) as the type B mutant to which they are linked. The polar variation of both the <b>frequency</b> of <b>conversion</b> and {{the disparity}} as a function of position were expected {{on the basis of a}} previous study of 15 mutants giving postmeiotic segregations and located in locus b 2.

40|$|AbstractWe {{used the}} GENCONV method to {{characterize}} the gene conversions that occurred amongst the 1434 protein coding human gene families with three or more genes. Conversions occur at a frequency of 0. 88 % (483 conversion events/ 55, 050 gene pairs compared) and have an average length of 371 ± 752  bp (±standard deviation). Both the size and the <b>frequency</b> of <b>conversions</b> are positively correlated with the similarity of the sequences involved in these <b>conversions.</b> The <b>frequency</b> of <b>conversions</b> and the local recombination rate are also positively correlated. Intrachromosomal conversions are almost 5 times more frequent than interchromosomal <b>conversions</b> and the <b>frequency</b> of intrachromosomal <b>conversions</b> increases as the distance between genes decreases. However, the higher <b>frequency</b> of <b>conversions</b> between nearby genes with the same transcriptional orientation {{is due to the}} fact that most functional duplicated genes are found next to one another and in the same transcriptional orientation. The average length of a conversion spanning only an intron region is significantly smaller than conversions spanning both exons and introns or only exons. This suggests that the smaller degree of sequence similarity of introns limits the size of conversions between duplicated human genes. The significant excess of conversions at the 3 ′-end of human genes suggests that incomplete cDNA molecules are often involved in conversions with chromosomal gene copies...|$|R
