It first includes gasification, following {{a line of}} development from the Winkler gasifier until the most recent designs. The most important fuel converters are circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers, whose design is becoming mature and the increment in size is the presently most important task. The very new aspects of these conversion devices are related to CO 2 removal. Methods with this purpose involving fluidized bed: oxyfuel combustion, chemical looping combustion, and calcium looping cycle, are briefly surveyed with some emphasis on CFB.

40|$|A summary {{is given}} on the {{development}} of fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>conversion</b> (combustion and gasification) of solid fuels. First, gasification is mentioned, following the line of development from the Winkler gasifier to recent designs. The combustors were initially bubbling beds, which were found unsuitable for combustion of coal because of various drawbacks, but they proved more useful for biomass where these drawbacks were absent. Instead, circulating fluidized bed boilers became the most important coal converters, whose design now is quite mature, and presently the increments in size and efficiency are the most important development tasks. The new modifications of these conversion devices are related to CO 2 capture. Proposed methods with this purpose, involving fluidized bed, are single-reactor systems like oxy-fuel combustion, and dual-reactor systems, including also indirect biomass gasifiers. Key words: fluidized bed; combustion; gasification; chemical looping; oxy-fuel; calcium looping. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} informs on the FBC Implementing Agreement, its {{field of}} interest, its activities and membership countries. In short, the activities consist of two meetings per year where information on fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>conversion</b> (mainly combustion and gasification) is exchanged between the participants from 15 different countries. The last meeting {{took place in}} the Czech Republic in March 2013. Initially, a few decades ago, the focus was on the design of coal-fired FB combustors. This was followed by an engagement in the behavior of various fuels, environmental and operational issues, which still remains a topic of interest. This includes both small and large FB conversion devices, combustors and gasifiers. At present, an important route of development goes in the direction of CO 2 removal, where FBC shows itself to be an extremely useful technology: co-combustion and gasification, oxy-fuel combustion, calcium looping cycle and chemical looping combustion. Such topics, and related environmental and operational problems, including the behavior of different fuels, are within the range of interest of the activities, depending on the selection of topics made by the members of the implementing agreement...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale plasma spout-fluid bed {{has been developed}} to calcine concentrated vanadium ore to extract vanadium {{in the form of}} sodium metavanadate. A 20 -kW d. c. plasma torch was used with argon and nitrogen as the plasma gases. Air, the main fluidizing gas, permitted the fluidization of the vanadium concentrate within the bed and provided the oxygen for the roasting reaction. In addition, air injected tangentially into the spout region lowered the plasma gas temperatures to within the required roasting temperatures. The bed stability and degree of vanadium recovery were analyzed as a function of bed temperature, time, and concentrate-to-salt ratio. It was shown that heating and reaction in the reactor occur primarily as the particles pass through the plasma spout. If spout temperatures are too high, melting and agglomeration of the particles occurs, leading to defluidization of the <b>bed.</b> <b>Conversion</b> during batch operation, with sodium carbonate as the salt, was rather unsuccessful due to elutriation of the salt during heat-up. The highest conversions were observed in the fused and agglomerated particles of the bed. Simulated continuous operation of the bed however resulted in significantly higher conversion rates...|$|R
40|$|Far-reaching {{energy savings}} in {{equilibrium}} reactions requires development {{not only of}} better catalysts but also processes with higher conversions in the reactor; wherever possible, so high that recirculation of residual gases is unnecessary. With this aim in mind, two new processes {{have been developed for}} methanol production and this paper represents the first report about the second of these processes. The two new reactor concepts are based on the gas/solid/solid-trickling film reactor GSSTFR and the reactor with intermediate product removal RSIPR. In the case of the GSSTFR, the product formed at the catalyst is removed directly from the reactor with a solid adsorbent which moves down through the catalyst <b>bed.</b> <b>Conversions</b> of 100 % are achieved in the simplest way - recirculation becomes unnecessary. Savings in investment costs, energy, and raw materials are discussed and compared with the Lurgi process. With the RISPR, high conversions are achieved by selective absorption of the methanol at the temperature of reaction. Tetraethylene glycoldimethylether, TEGDME, is selected as solvent for this purpose. A possible flow scheme is also shown for this process and savings are estimated. Possible savings are so promising that further development on a semi-industrial scale is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to verify the {{possibility}} of using a simple physical adsorption technique to improve enzyme efficiency in performing lactose hydrolysis. Immobilization experiments of ÃŸ-galactosidase on zeolite pellets showed that this process is fairly slow and can be accomplished with contact times shorter than few hours. Comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrolysis experiments in mixed batch reactors indicates that the enzyme distribution within the zeolite pellets is concentrated in a thin shell under the pellet surface. Continuous conversion experiments were carried out on a purposelybuilt fluidization column. Results were fitted with a mathematical model for fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>conversion</b> without the use of any further adjustable parameter than those used in the heterogeneous batch conversion. Furthermore, no change of the parameter values was necessary. Scale-up predictions given by the model showed that fluidized columns few meters high of pellets supporting b-galactosidase are sufficient for an industrially suitable process of lactose hydrolysis. which can be performed on columns of few meters and, therefore, these are applicable to relatively small process scales as those found in traditional Italian cheese making factories.

In addition, limestone adversely affected thermal conversion efficiency and increased the conversion of fuel-nitrogen. The low calorific value (LCV) fuel gas, produced by the AFBG, was combusted in a cyclone combustor at atmospheric pressure. Stable combustion of the LCV fuel gas was possible down to a calorific value of 1. 57 MJ/m(n) (3). The combustion efficiency in the atmospheric topping combustor varied between 98. 72 and 99. 96 %.

For the alumina-supported catalyst, the conversion of ethyl acetate, ethanol and propane was promoted by the addition of SO 2, while the conversion of propene was inhibited. The effect of SO 2 was reversible, i. e. the conversion of the reactants returned towards the initial values when SO 2 was turned off. However, this recovery was quite slow. The oxidation of propane was inhibited by water, both in absence and presence of SO 2. For the silica-supported catalyst no significant effect of SO 2 could be observed on the conversion of ethyl acetate, ethanol or propane, whereas the conversion of propene was inhibited by the presence of SO 2. In situ FTIR measurements revealed the presence of surface sulphates on the Pt/gamma -Al 2 O 3 catalyst with and after SO 2 addition.

Room air tritium clean systems can be used to handle tritium that has been lost to the room from primary or secondary containment. Such a system called the Experimental Tritium Cleanup (ETC) systems is installed at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The ETC consists of (1) two compressors which draw air from the room, (2) a catalyst <b>bed</b> for <b>conversion</b> of tritium to tritiated water, and (3) molecular sieve beds for collection of the water. The exhaust from this system can be returned to the room or vented to the stack.

Until now, it was believed that in humans, this process was restricted to the liver, but we provide compelling evidence of production of Tyr from Phe in the kidney. To determine whether the human kidney produces Tyr, we measured Tyr balance, the Tyr appearance rate, and the Phe-to-Tyr conversion in 12 healthy human subjects by using [15 N]Phe and [2 H 4]Tyr as tracers. Renal plasma flow was measured by using paraaminohippurate, and sampling from the femoral artery and renal veins was performed. The results were compared with those obtained in 12 control subjects undergoing hepatic vein catheterization and infusion of identical tracers. In all 12 subjects, there was a net uptake of Phe by the kidney (2. 2 Â± 1. 2 Î¼mol/min), whereas Tyr was released (5. 3 Â± 1. 5 Î¼mol/min). In contrast, there was a net uptake of both Phe (9. 5 Â± 1. 2 Î¼mol/min) and Tyr (14. 3 Â± 1. 3 Î¼mol/min) by the splanchnic <b>bed.</b> Phe <b>conversion</b> to Tyr occurred at a rate of 5. 2 Â± 1. 2 Î¼mol/min in kidney and 3. 0 Â± 0. 7 Î¼mol/min in the splanchnic bed.

40|$|Fluidized beds {{comprise}} {{a quantity of}} solid particles that is suspended by an upward flowing gas. They are used {{for a variety of}} processes in the chemical industry, such as catalytic reactions, drying, coating and energy conversion. A major problem in industrial practice is the occurrence of unwanted agglomeration, i. e. solid particles adhering to each other and forming larger agglomerates. The formation of agglomerates is a consequence of the presence of a liquid phase that results in increased particle stickiness. If this effect is not detected and counteracted it can eventually result in defluidization of the bed and subsequent costly shut-down of the whole installation. In energy conversion processes, typically combustion and gasification, agglomeration is often one of the main bottlenecks in the course of switching from fossil fuel to biomass as a regenerative energy source. This work aims at identification and application of suitable methods for the early detection of and counteraction against agglomeration in fluidized <b>bed</b> energy <b>conversion</b> processes. The attractor comparison method has been developed previously for monitoring multiphase hydrodynamics. This method is based on a relative comparison of the state-space projections of pressure fluctuation measurements and indicates significant changes in the hydrodynamics. In this work, the method is investigated for its suitability to detect agglomeration and small changes in particle size in circulating fluidized beds. The method has shown to be sensitive to agglomeration on lab-scale and sensitive to small particle size changes on both lab-scale and industrial scale. It is therefore considered a cost-saving tool for industrial practice. Moreover, a screening methodology has been developed that allows the efficient identification of signal analysis methods that are sensitive for and selective to agglomeration. This screening methodology has been successfully applied to identify suitable methods for several case studies in different scale bubbling and circulating fluidized beds.

40|$|Ni/Al 2 O 3 {{catalysts}} with nickel loadings from 10 to 40 wt. % {{prepared by}} wet impregnation {{have been tested}} for the thermocatalytic decomposition of propane in the temperature range from 700 to 1100 Â°C in a fixed <b>bed</b> reactor. Full <b>conversion</b> of propane was observed in all cases. The hydrogen yield was found to increase at higher reaction temperature, at lower temperatures significant quantities of CH 4 were observed in the product gas. The Ni loading determined stability of the catalyst. After performing the catalytic decomposition reaction for a certain time, the carbon formed on the catalyst surface was removed by combustion with air. During this regeneration process carbon monoxide was always the main product. Repeated cycles of decomposition and regeneration were carried out. By using an automated control device, {{it was possible to}} ensure a continuous operation of the reactor for 65 h. For this period, stable H 2 yield was observed with a catalyst containing 40 wt. % Ni supported by Al 2 O 3. Fresh and spent catalysts were analyzed by BET, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Carbon formed by the decomposition reaction was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and SEM...|$|R
40|$|Methanol steam {{reforming}} (MSR) {{was carried out}} in a catalytic packed bed reactor under electrical and microwave heating using the two most common catalysts for this process CuZnO/Al 2 O 3 and PdZnO/Al 2 O 3. Significant two-dimensional temperature gradients were found, especially in the latter case. Our results show that for the same average <b>bed</b> temperature, methanol <b>conversion</b> is higher under microwave heating (> 10 %). On the other hand, the product distribution is not affected by the heating mode. We demonstrate that even in cases where the maximum temperature along the entire height of the bed is significantly higher under electrical heating, conversion is either higher in the microwave case or approximately the same between the two heating modes. Finally, our experimental data indicate that a given methanol conversion can be achieved with lower net heat input to the reactor under microwave heating. This does not mean lower total energy consumption in the microwave process due to the limitations in the magnetron efficiency and the reflected power. However, it may be an implicit indication of higher temperature at metal sites than in bulk phase (microscale hot spot formation) due to the selective heating principle.

40|$|Adiabatic fixed-bed reactor {{has proven}} commercially {{successful}} in large scale production of catalytic dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether. A one dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model of an industrial reactor of dimethyl ether synthesis has been established. To verify the proposed model, the simulation {{results have been}} compared to available data from an industrial reactor. A good agreement has been found between them. The distribution of the catalyst bed temperature and concentration of each component was obtained under conditions of inlet temperature 260 Â°C, reaction pressure 1. 2 MPa and gaseous hourly space velocity 950. 7 h- 1. With inlet catalyst bed temperature 240 - 280 Â°C, operating pressure 0. 6 - 1. 8 MPa and gaseous hourly space velocity 831. 8 - 1069. 5 h- 1, the influence of these reaction conditions on temperature distribution of the reactor catalytic <b>bed,</b> outlet methanol <b>conversion</b> and the dimethyl ether yield were calculated. The results show that, {{with the rise of}} inlet temperature (240 - 280 Â°C) and operating pressure (0. 6 - 1. 8 MPa), the outlet conversion of methanol, the hot spot temperature and the DME yield increased. The increase of gaseous hourly space velocity (831. 8 - 1069. 5 h- 1) leads to a decrease in the hot spot temperature of catalytic bed and the outlet conversion of methanol. But the DME yield rise initially and then descend...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{facilities}} use {{many varieties}} of contact bedding, including wood chips, paper products, and corncob, {{each with its}} own advantages and disadvantages. Corncob bedding, for example, is often used because of its high absorbency, ability to minimize detectable ammonia, and low cost. However, observations that mice eat the corncob lead to concerns that its use can interfere with dietary studies. We evaluated the effect of corncob <b>bedding</b> on feed <b>conversion</b> (change in body weight relative to the apparent number of kcal consumed over 7 d) in mice. Four groups of mice (6 to 12 per group) were housed in an individually ventilated caging system: (1) low-fat diet housed on recycled paper bedding, (2) low-fat diet housed on corncob bedding, (3) high-fat diet housed on recycled paper bedding, and (4) high-fat diet housed on corncob bedding. After 4 wk of the high-fat diet, feed conversion and percentage body weight change both were lower in corncob-bedded mice compared with paper-bedded mice. Low-fat-fed mice on corncob bedding versus paper bedding did not show statistically significant differences in feed conversion or change in percentage body weight. Average apparent daily feed consumption did not differ among the 4 groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that corncob bedding reduces the efficiency of feed conversion in mice fed a high-fat diet and that other bedding choices should be favored in these models...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to estimate and characterize heterogeneous mass transfer coefficients in bench- and pilot-scale fluidized bed processes by the means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A further objective is to benchmark the heterogeneous mass transfer coefficients predicted by fine-grid Eulerian CFD simulations against empirical data presented in the scientific literature. First, a fine-grid two-dimensional Eulerian CFD model with a solid and gas phase has been designed. The model is applied for transient two-dimensional simulations of char combustion in small-scale bubbling and turbulent fluidized beds. The same approach is used to simulate a novel fluidized <b>bed</b> energy <b>conversion</b> process developed for the carbon capture, chemical looping combustion operated with a gaseous fuel. In order to analyze the results of the CFD simulations, two one-dimensional fluidized bed models have been formulated. The single-phase and bubble-emulsion models were applied to derive the average gas-bed and interphase mass transfer coefficients, respectively. In the analysis, the effects of various fluidized bed operation parameters, such as fluidization, velocity, particle and bubble diameter, reactor size, and chemical kinetics, on the heterogeneous mass transfer coefficients in the lower fluidized bed are evaluated extensively. The analysis shows that the fine-grid Eulerian CFD model can predict the heterogeneous mass transfer coefficients quantitatively with acceptable accuracy. Qualitatively, the CFD-based research of fluidized bed process revealed several new scientific results, such as parametrical relationships. The huge variance of seven orders of magnitude within the bed Sherwood numbers presented in the literature could be explained by the change of controlling mechanisms in the overall heterogeneous mass transfer process with the varied process conditions. The research opens new process-specific insights into the reactive fluidized bed processes, such as a strong mass transfer control over heterogeneous reaction rate, a dominance of interphase mass transfer in the fine-particle fluidized beds and a strong chemical kinetic dependence of the average gas-bed mass transfer. The obtained mass transfer coefficients can be applied in fluidized bed models used for various engineering design, reactor scale-up and process research tasks, and they consequently provide an enhanced prediction accuracy of the performance of fluidized bed processes...|$|R
