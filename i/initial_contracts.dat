40|$|Do {{contracts}} provide {{reference points}} that affect ex post behavior? We address {{this question in}} a canonical buyer-seller relationship with renegotiation. Our paper provides causal experimental evidence that an <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> has a highly significant and economically important impact on renegotiation behavior {{that goes beyond the}} effect of contracts on bargaining threatpoints. We compare situations in which an <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> is renegotiated to strategically equivalent bargaining situations in which no ex ante contract was written. The ex ante contract causes sellers to ask for markups that are 45 percent lower than in strategically equivalent bargaining situations without an <b>initial</b> <b>contract.</b> Moreover, buyers are more likely to reject given markups in renegotiations than in negotiations. We do not find that these effects are stronger when the <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> is concluded under competitive rather than monopolistic conditions...|$|R

40|$|In a {{long-term}} relationship between two parties, one party's threat of a unilateral violation of an <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> may induce a renegotiation of the contract. As a renegotiation may result in one party capturing some of the return from the other's investments, this possibility may lead to underinvestment. I show {{that if there is}} uncertainty associated with the outcome of a renegotiation, and if players are risk averse, there will be an interval for the <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> so that it is not renegotiated. By an appropriate choice of the <b>initial</b> <b>contract,</b> underinvestment can thus be avoided. ...|$|R
