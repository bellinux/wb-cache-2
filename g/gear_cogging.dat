5000|$|Even Less Gears: The only 3x3 type of Gear Cube with a {{total of}} four gears. It takes another four gears out and replaces them with {{standard}} edges. As the amount of gears get fewer and fewer, the difficulty level rises. So four sides can make 90° turns whereas the fifth and sixth sides are using the <b>gear</b> <b>cogs</b> giving only one option being a 180° turn.|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic Machine Elements, which {{encompass}} elastomeric elements (rubber-like components), fluidic elements (lubricating squeeze films) {{and their}} combinations, {{are used for}} absorbing vibration, reducing friction and improving energy use. Examplesinclude pneumatic tyres, oil and lip seals, compliant bearings and races, and thin films. This book sets out to show that these elements can be incorporated in machine analysis, {{just as in the}} case of conventional elements (e. g. <b>gears,</b> <b>cogs,</b> chaindrives, bearings).

5000|$|Gear Cube Extreme: Unlike the {{original}} Gear Cube with 12 total gears, the Gear Cube Extreme (also {{known as the}} Anisotropic Cube) has only eight Gears. The top and bottom rows remain <b>gear</b> <b>cogs,</b> whereas the middle layer edge cogs have been removed. Taking away the middle layer cogs and replacing them with standard edges allows for different movement between rows. Due to the added straight edges, the cube can now make 90° turns on two rows and as well as 180° turns on four rows.|$|R
5000|$|The Gear Cube has {{a design}} {{like no other}} because the puzzle is made almost {{completely}} out of gears. The cube has 12 edge pieces, four on every layer, which are all <b>gear</b> <b>cogs.</b> Each edge piece has two different colors on it, {{the colors of the}} two sides it lies between. It also has eight corners, four on the top layer and four on the bottom layer. Each corner connects three different sides and possesses those three colors. Also, the cube has a total of 41,472 possible permutations.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of a dual clutch transmission is analogous to two traditional manual transmissions, {{each with its own}} clutch, operating in parallel and alternating shifts. The Ford unit is a six-speed with one clutch acting on first, third and fifth gear, and the other used for second, fourth and sixth gear. As first gear is engaged, the 2-4-6 clutch is disengaged and the second <b>gear</b> <b>cogs</b> are engaged. At the appropriate time, the 1-3-5 clutch is disengaged and the 2-4-6 clutch is engaged. While in second gear, the other side shifts from first to third. The process is repeated with quick smooth shifts and none of the efficiency loss normally associated with torque converters.|$|R
50|$|Bicycles for velodromes have no brakes. They {{employ a}} single fixed rear <b>gear,</b> or <b>cog,</b> {{that does not}} freewheel. This helps {{maximise}} speed, reduces weight, and avoids sudden braking while nevertheless allowing the rider to slow by pushing back against the pedals.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1952 the Mercedes-Benz 170 Sb {{replaced}} the 170 S model. The car now received a works {{number of its}} own, becoming known internally as the “Mercedes-Benz W 191”. Both cabriolet versions had been withdrawn in November 1951, cabriolet buyers now being catered for by the cabriolet versions of the 6-cylinder Mercedes-Benz W187 220 model. The 170 Sb was therefore available only with a four-door sedan/saloon body. Other changes included in the 1952 upgrade included {{the replacement of the}} floor-mounted gear lever with a then fashionable column mounted gear lever. There was now a starter button on the dashboard and the heater was improved. Under the bonnet/hood the camshaft was now driven via a chain rather than via <b>gear</b> <b>cogs,</b> a hypoid differential was fitted and the rear track was increased by 15 mm.|$|R
50|$|The windshaft {{also carries}} the brake wheel which has 70 cogs. This drives the conical lantern pinion wallower (38 staves)at {{the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives four pairs of millstones. Two pairs are used for making flour and two pairs are used to produce pearl barley. The flour stones are each driven by a stone nut with 30 staves and the pearl barley stones are each driven by a stone nut with 20 staves. A lantern pinion with 35 staves drives carries the drive to the saw via a shaft. At the {{opposite}} end of this shaft, a <b>gear</b> with 35 <b>cogs</b> drives a wallower with 44 cogs. This drives a <b>gear</b> with 26 <b>cogs</b> which drives another <b>gear</b> with 51 <b>cogs</b> on the axle of the frame saw.|$|R

40|$|Gears {{are found}} rarely in animals {{and have never}} been {{reported}} to intermesh and rotate functionally like mechanical gears. We now demonstrate functional gears in the ballistic jumping movements of the flightless planthopper insect Issus. The nymphs, but not adults, have a row of cuticular <b>gear</b> (<b>cog)</b> teeth around the curved medial surfaces of their two hindleg trochantera. The gear teeth on one trochanter engaged with and sequentially moved past those on the other trochanter during the preparatory cocking and the propulsive phases of jumping. Close registration between the gears ensured that both hindlegs moved at the same angular velocities to propel the body without yaw rotation. At the final molt to adulthood, this synchronization mechanism is jettisoned. Many insects jump prodigiously by rapidand powerful movements of their hind-legs. Two arrangements of the hindlegs are found; those of grasshoppers and fleas move in separate planes {{at the side of}} the body; those of the champion jumping insects, froghoppers and planthoppers, move counterrotationally in approx-imately the same near-horizontal plane beneat...|$|R
5000|$|The {{house this}} season {{was the same}} as the one used in the {{previous}} season, though features a dramatic makeover. The newly redesigned house was revealed through Global on March 20, 2015. The new house was designed by Pete Farragher, who described its decor as having a [...] "steampunk vibe". Farragher cited the British version of the series as an influence on his design, with the goal being to make the HouseGuests feel uncomforable. The layout of the house remained the same as the year prior, with the entrance, bathroom, and bedrooms located upstairs. The walls were covered in exposed <b>gears,</b> <b>cogs,</b> pipes, and valves to add to the industrial feel. The Head of Household room was compared to the parlor of the Nautilus from the science-fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870). Faraggher described the main bedroom, which featured blue and white themes, as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "dreamy", with the intention of making the HouseGuests feel [...] "safe". The kitchen table was designed to look like a large bicycle chain with cogs and a sprocket running underneath it.|$|R

50|$|The title {{sequence}} {{was inspired}} by the maps of Westeros that precede each novel in the series (and maps in fantasy novels in general). The creators decided to place the map on the inner surface of a sphere with a Copernican armillary at the center. The camera would then visit different parts of the map, while illustrations on the astrolabe covered some of the backstory to the series. The turning <b>gears</b> and <b>cogs</b> were meant to be reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.|$|R

50|$|Additional to the 'separate gearbox' Bullet the Royal Enfield Redditch factory {{produced}} approximately 250 'unit construction' (integral gearbox) Bullets bikes {{known as}} 'New Bullets'. Produced in five batches of fifty between 1963 and 1965 these models were essentially a 350 Crusader. However, unlike their 'one piece cranked' smaller sibling the New Bullet had a built up crank {{and the traditional}} Bullet bore and stroke dimensions under a Crusader cylinder head. These bikes are difficult to identify as being different from the Crusader. Look for a ten finned barrel on a Crusader {{and you will have}} found a New Bullet. By necessity the tool box air intake slot is also a little higher. Other variations from the unit 250 include a 46 tooth rear sprocket, an outrigger bearing on the primary side crankcase a four plate clutch and wider <b>gear</b> <b>cogs.</b> The petrol tank is similar to the earlier unit range item (not the Clipper tank) but has a larger cut out on the underside to clear the taller motor making it 1/4 gallon light on capacity. A New Bullet was modelled for sale to the army and carried panniers and a 'speedo-only' style of caskette. According to RE data 232 of these bikes were produced making them a very rare and desirable machine today.|$|R
40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} assembly tasks require fine compliant motion and fast, accurate positioning. Conventional robots perform poorly in these tasks {{because of their}} large mass, friction and backlash in <b>gears,</b> <b>cogging</b> in drive motors and other deleterious effects. Even robots equipped with special control systems enabling compliant operation offer only partial solutions. It is difficult or impossible to automate many product assemblies requiring fine, compliant motion. This problem can be greatly alleviated by dividing the manipulation system into coarse and fine domains. In this scenario, a standard industrial robot {{can serve as a}} coarse positioner which in turn carries a six degrees of freedom fine motion wrist. Thus the robot can access a workspace measured in meters at low bandwidth and low resolution while the wrist can move over millimeters at high bandwidth and high resolution during the final phase of the assembly operation. Work indicates that fine motion wrists using Lorentz levitation can greatly augment the accuracy and dexterity of robots because they are frictionless, have high bandwidths and have a single back drivable moving part. Also, since there is no contact between the moving and stationary parts, wear and contamination can be eliminated. The use of six Lorentz force actuators in combination with real time position and orientation sensing offers several important advantages over magnetic bearing approaches...|$|R

5000|$|A {{magnetic}} gear resembles in part, the traditional mechanical <b>gear.</b> All <b>cogs</b> of each <b>gear</b> component of {{magnetic gear}}s {{act as a}} magnet with periodic alternation of opposite magnetic poles on mating surfaces. Gear components are mounted with a [...] "cushioned" [...] backlash capability similar to other mechanical gearings with no cushioning effect.

The magnetically coupled gear can transmit force into a hermetically sealed enclosure without using a radial shaft seal, which may leak. Hermetically sealed processes are not contaminated or chemically affected by the magnetic gear. This can be an advantage in explosive or otherwise hazardous environments where leaks constitute a real danger.|$|R

The influence of slot opening on the magnetic <b>gearing</b> effect, <b>cogging</b> torque and torque ripple is analyzed. The results show that the magnetic gearing effect makes a non-ignorable contribution to the average torque when a large slot opening stator is used.
