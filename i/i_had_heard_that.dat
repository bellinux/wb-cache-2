500|$|Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous {{influence}} inclined {{his grandson}} toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, {{was from a}} Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge {{that by the time}} they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, [...] "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had [...] "become loco-foco", he said, [...] "I felt as I would have done if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> my daughter had been dishonored." [...] On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding {{where to begin}} practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842â€“1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt as I would have done if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E

Bhansali also met the singing legend Lata Mangeshkar, whom he had revealed {{to be the source}} of inspiration to him, to seek her blessings before he fully embarked on filming Guzaarish.During the meeting, Mangeshkar told that she was a big fan of Bhansali's films and that she was fortunate to be the source of inspiration behind such a talented director's film. She told the media members that [...] "..Even <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> he makes his singers hear my songs over and over again before making them sing. I've always been a big fan of Sanjay's films, specially Black. I remember watching the Filmfare Awards in the year of Black. Every time the nominations were announced I prayed for Black to win. And it did. If I'm a source of inspiration to him then I count myself fortunate".Bhansali candidly admitted that he was very much afraid of meeting Lata since [...] "..one doesn't hobnob with one's god". He added that once he reached her home, he [...] "... just wanted to sit and gaze at her. I realized in person she's as magical as she is in her singing. There's something other-worldly about her, a quality I haven't encountered in anyone else in my life".|$|E
