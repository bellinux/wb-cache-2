40|$|AbstractIn this paper, some {{characterizations}} of median and quasi-median graphs are extended to general isometric subgraphs of Cartesian products using {{the concept of}} an <b>imprint</b> <b>function</b> as introduced by Tardif. This extends the well known concepts of medians in median graphs as well as imprints in quasi-median graphs. We introduce absolute C-median graphs in analogy to absolute retracts, and derive a connection with the canonical isometric embedding of graphs into Cartesian products. Absolute C-median graphs strictly include classes of irreducible graphs and absolute (weak) retracts as well as many median-like classes, such as weakly median graphs, pre-median graphs, and weakly modular graphs. New {{characterizations of}} quasi-median graphs and of median graphs are obtained along the way. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the amalgamation procedure for absolute C-median graphs, and prove the fixed box theorem for this class modulo the conjecture...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany genes {{subject to}} genomic <b>imprinting</b> <b>function</b> {{in a number}} of endocrine/paracrine {{pathways}} that are important for normal mammalian development. Here, we show that an endocrine/paracrine pathway involving thyroid hormone metabolism is also regulated by imprinting. Thyroid hormone action depends on thyroid hormone receptors and their predominant ligand, 3, 5, 3 ′-triiodothyronine (T 3). In vivo, thyroid hormone levels are maintained within the physiological range through the interaction of three iodothyronine deiodinases, D 1, D 2, and D 3. D 3 inactivates thyroxine (T 4) and T 3 by 5 -deiodination, and the gene for this enzyme, Dio 3, lies in the imprinted domain on human chromosome 14 q 32 /distal mouse chromosome 12. Here, we report the imprinting of Dio 3, which is expressed preferentially from the paternal allele. No differentially methylated region was identified in the CpG-island promoter, which is completely unmethylated. Localization of transcripts suggests that Dio 3 may be exerting its function in both endocrine and autocrine/paracrine manners. An assay was developed for T 3, and we show that its levels in maternal and paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) 12 fetuses are reciprocally affected. These results demonstrate that disruption of the imprinting status of Dio 3 results in abnormal thyroid hormone levels and may contribute to the phenotypic abnormalities in UPD 12 mice and UPD 14 humans...|$|R

40|$|Transcriptional {{silencing}} of {{the human}} inactive X chromosome is induced by the XIST gene within the human X-inactivation center. The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes. In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted (the paternal X chromosome is always inactive), the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene. However, {{it remains to be}} seen whether this antisense transcript protects the future active X chromosome during random inactivation in the embryo proper. We recently identified the human TSIX gene and showed that it lacks key regulatory elements needed for the <b>imprinting</b> <b>function</b> of murine Tsix. Now, using RNA FISH for cellular localization of transcripts in human fetal cells, we show that human TSIX antisense transcripts are unable to repress XIST. In fact, TSIX is transcribed only from the inactive X chromosome and is coexpressed with XIST. Also, TSIX is not maternally imprinted in placental tissues, and its transcription persists in placental and fetal tissues, throughout embryogenesis. Therefore, the repression of Xist by mouse Tsix has no counterpart in humans, and TSIX is not the gene that protects the active X chromosome from random inactivation. Because human TSIX cannot imprint X inactivation in the placenta, it serves as a mutant for mouse Tsix, providing insights into features responsible for antisense activity in imprinted X inactivation...|$|R

40|$|Genetic linkage {{analysis}} of two Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome families in our lab has been conducted. The closest linkage to SGBS was observed for the chromosome Xq 26 locus HPRT. SGBS-Xq marker recombinations map the disease locus to the Xqcen-DXS 425 -SGBS-DXS 1123 -Xqter interval on Xq 25 -q 27. The close linkage between the disease locus and the HPRT locus {{strongly suggests that}} the causative gene for SGBS {{is located in the}} chromosome Xq 26 region and is disrupted by the translocation. SGBS shows significant clinical overlap with another overgrowth disorder called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Both disorders demonstrate an increased risk for developing embryonal tumours. Two genes from the BWS linked chromosome 11 p 15 region, IGF 2 and H 19, are known to normally undergo parental imprinting. Relaxation of this imprinting has recently been demonstrated in some BWS cases as well as in some instances of isolated Wilms' tumour (WT). Since SGBS and BWS have been postulated to result from distinct defects in a common pathway, we have studied the methylation pattern and transcriptional activity of IGF 2 and H 19 in isolated SGBS +/$-$WT tissue. No consistent methylation abnormalities were observed in genomic DNA isolated from SGBS leucocytes, placenta, skin fibroblasts or cleft lip tissues. Genotyping of H 19 cDNA polymorphisms showed biallelic expression in both SGBS and normal placentas and monoallelic expression in one SGBS fibroblast. However monoallelic expression of IGF 2 was seen in control placenta and fibroblast but biallelic expression of IGF 2 was shown in one SGBS placenta, and two SGBS fibroblasts tissues.

40|$|Imprinted genes, {{defined as}} genes showing monoallelic {{expression}} depending upon their parental origin, {{have been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in growth and development. More recent work has suggested that imprinted genes may also influence brain and behavioural phenotypes. In particular, it has been shown that the neuropsychological profile of Turner’s syndrome subjects (karyotype 45,XO) varies according to whether their single X chromosome is inherited paternally (45,X P O) or maternally (45,X m O). This finding has been explained in terms of the existence of X-linked imprinted genes impacting upon specific aspects of cognition. The Turner’s syndrome data has attracted substantial criticism, not least as a result of the confounds inherent in the human model, most notably the presence of cryptic mosaicism. In this thesis, I have utilised a 39,XO mouse model (39,X P O vs. 39,X m O), free from many of the confounds inherent in the Turner’s syndrome work, to test the hypothesis that putative X-linked imprinted genes may affect brain and behavioural phenotypes. A comprehensive initial screen demonstrated that 39,X P O and 39,X m O female mice were equivalent to 40,XX normal females across a wide range of physical, physiological and behavioural functions and that the data were unlikely to be compromised by the specific means of producing the 39,XO mice (via two separate crosses). Overall, these results concur with the work done in Turner’s syndrome subjects and add to the emerging data implicating <b>imprinted</b> gene <b>functioning</b> (and specifically putative X-linked <b>imprinted</b> gene <b>functioning)</b> in brain and behavioural phenotypes. The present data are discussed in terms of their possible relevance for Turner’s syndrome, cognitive sexual dimorphism (whereby males experience a relative lack of paternal gene product) and in the light of evolutionary theories of imprinting.

Human chromosome 11 p 15, and the syntenic region on mouse distal chromosome 7, contain several imprinted genes, including p 57 KIP 2 (CDKN 1 C) and IGF 2. These two genes, which {{are separated by}} > 700 kb, are both implicated in the pathogenesis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We have shown previously that an Igf 2 /H 19 transgene is expressed appropriately and can imprint at ectopic chromosomal locations.

50|$|Neuronatin (Nnat) is {{a protein}} coding gene {{involved}} in mammalian brain development. It {{is located on}} Chromosome 20 in humans and is only expressed from the paternal allele in normal adults. It encodes the protein neuronatin, a proteolipid, that functions in the control of ion channels during brain development. Neuronatin begins the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into cells with a neural fate by increasing their calcium levels. Neuronatin expression in neural tissues throughout the brain contributes to development of the nervous system. It is also expressed in several tissues outside of the brain. For example, expression in skin cells controls the differentiation of keratinocytes. Neuronatin expression functions not only in development, but other processes throughout the body. It also plays a direct and indirect role in diabetes. Increased expression in pancreatic islet beta cells causes the beta form of the protein to build an aggregate structure. This causes the cells to undergo apoptosis, thus leading to diabetes mellitus. Its effects on glycogen metabolism through the dephosphorylation and activation of the enzyme glycogen synthase may also play an indirect role in contributing to the disease. A different type of malformation in the gene also {{has the potential to}} cause a variety of cancers. Contained within the promoter region of the gene are three CpG islands.

Nap 1 l 5 and Peg 13 are located, respectively, within the introns of the non-imprinted genes Herc 3 and the Tularik 1 (T 1) /KIAA 1882 homologue in two separate microimprinted domains on mouse chromosomes 6 and 15. These ‘host’ genes are highly expressed in brain and consequently we were interested in assessing their expression patterns in parallel to the imprinted genes. The brain expression of all four genes appeared to be mainly neuronal. The detailed expression profiles of Nap 1 l 5 and Peg 13 were generally similar with widespread expression that was relatively high in the septal and hypothalamic regions, the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. In contrast, there was some degree of dissociation between the imprinted genes and their non-imprinted hosts, in that, whilst there was again widespread expression of Herc 3 and the T 1 /KIAA 1882 homologue, these genes were also particularly highly expressed in Purkinje neurons and piriform cortex.

These cells display both {{the features of}} anergy induced by continual engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR), such as high expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (pERK) and reduced lifespan, and of virus-specific exhaustion such as CD 21 low phenotype and defective response to ligation of BCR and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9). Usually MC regresses after eradication of HCV with interferon, whose immunomodulatory activity might contribute to this effect. We investigated phenotypic and functional changes in clonal B cells of MC patients with sustained virologic responses to direct-acting antivirals (DAA), which lack immunomodulatory properties. We found that high pERK expression and accelerated apoptosis revert within 4 weeks after beginning therapy, whereas clonal B cells unresponsive to TLR 9 stimulation persist for at least 24 weeks although they may partially rescue normal CD 21 expression. Thus, similar to mouse models, features of anergy in MC B cells rapidly revert after disengagement from HCV, whereas virus-specific exhaustion imparts a durable inhibitory <b>imprint</b> on cell <b>function.</b> Treatment of HCV+ MC with DAA provides a valuable tool for untangling the molecular mechanisms of anergy and exhaustion in human B cells...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} strongly {{determine the}} exchange of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. These exchanges are influenced by environmental conditions (e. g., local meteorology, soils), but generally mediated by organisms. Often, mathematical descriptions of these processes are implemented in terrestrial biosphere models. Model implementations of this kind should be evaluated by empirical analyses of relationships between observed patterns of ecosystem functioning, vegetation structure, plant traits, and environmental conditions. However, {{the question of how}} to describe the imprint of plants on ecosystem functioning based on observations has not yet been systematically investigated. One approach might be to identify and quantify functional attributes or responsiveness of ecosystems (often very short-term in nature) that contribute to the long-term (i. e., annual but also seasonal or daily) metrics commonly in use. Here we define these patterns as “ecosystem functional properties”, or EFPs. Such as the ecosystem capacity of carbon assimilation or the maximum light use efficiency of an ecosystem. While EFPs should be directly derivable from flux measurements at the ecosystem level, we posit that these inherently include the influence of specific plant traits and their local heterogeneity. We present different options of upscaling in situ measured plant traits to the ecosystem level (ecosystem vegetation properties – EVPs) and provide examples of empirical analyses on plants’ <b>imprint</b> on ecosystem <b>functioning</b> by combining in situ measured plant traits and ecosystem flux measurements.

30|$|Approaches to {{the study}} of {{connectivity}} within complex systems have often addressed structure (network architecture) and function (dynamical processes) separately. Structural connectivity (SC) measures of a system are used to quantify the level of configuration or arrangement of a network, whilst the functional connectivity (FC) of a system describes dynamical processes operating within a structurally connected network. SC thus derives from the system’s anatomy, whereas FC is inferred from the system’s process dynamics which are represented by fluxes and transformations of energy, matter or information between structural units. Structure always affects function (Strogatz, 2001), and often (but not always) function affects structure, although the timescales of the reciprocity/feedback may differ. Many connectivity-based approaches separate SC and FC in order to simplify their study. However, this separation is challenging because the degree of connectivity and feedbacks between SC and FC will depend on the spatial and/or temporal scale(s) at which the system is studied: as spatial scale increases connectivity becomes an internal process that cannot be represented or quantified explicitly. For example, in Ecology connectivity amongst different patches cannot be explicitly represented when studying the system at a higher level or organization. In many (if not most) systems, SC evolves over time. For example, in Neuroscience, although the structure of the child’s brain appears {{similar to that of the}} adult brain, its size, orientation within the cranium and details of the anatomical connectivity changes appreciably over the next few years and some areas of the brain, especially in the frontal lobe, only mature after adolescence. Capturing this evolution is a fundamental advance provided by complexity-based approaches compared to more traditional systems-based concepts. At different timescales the relation between SC and FC may look very different. Thus, a key issue when separating SC and FC is determining the timescale at which a change in SC becomes dynamic (i.e., functional), and this in turn may depend on the fundamental unit. System memory – the <b>imprint</b> that <b>function</b> leaves on the structure of a system or network – also affects the interplay of SC and FC, and therefore a further consideration is how to incorporate memory into quantitative descriptions of the structural-functional evolution of connectivity. The separation of SC from FC is artificial and is thus subjective. A key challenge in separating SC and FC is weighing up the gains that can be made by making these separations, versus the losses in our potential understanding of the system that arise due to these separations. These gains and losses depend on the timescale of interest compared to the rate of evolution of system structure.|$|R

Zonal chromatography was performed to establish the optimal selectivity, expressed as imprinting factor (IF), under chromatographic conditions more aqueous than those described {{so far in the}} literature. Frontal analysis (FA) was performed on columns packed with these polymers, using an optimized mobile phase composed of methanol/phosphate buffer (50 / 50, v/v), to extract adsorption isotherm data and retrieve binding parameters from the best isotherm model. Surprisingly, the template had comparable and strong affinity for both MIP (K = 3. 8 × 104 M− 1) and NIPA (K = 1. 9 × 104 M− 1), although there was a marked difference in the saturation capacities of selective and non-selective sites, as one would expect for an imprinted polymer. NIPB acts as a true control polymer {{in the sense that it}} has relatively low affinity for the template (K = 8. 0 × 102 M− 1). This work provides the first frontal chromatographic characterization of such a polymer in a water-rich environment over a wide concentration range. The significance of this work stems from the fact that the chromatographic approach used is generic and can be applied readily to other analytes, but also because there is an increasing demand for well-characterised <b>imprinted</b> materials that <b>function</b> effectively in aqueous media and are thus well-suited for analytical science applications involving, for example, biofluids and environmental water samples...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Maternal {{prenatal}} stress {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} fetal growth restriction and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, which may be mediated by impaired placental <b>function.</b> <b>Imprinted</b> genes control fetal growth, placental development, adult behaviour (including maternal behaviour) and placental lactogen production. This study examined whether maternal prenatal depression {{was associated with a}}berrant placental expression of the imprinted genes paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG 3), paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG 10), pleckstrin homology-like domain family a member 2 (PHLDA 2) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 C (CDKN 1 C), and resulting impaired placental human placental lactogen (hPL) expression. METHOD: A diagnosis of depression during pregnancy was recorded from Manchester cohort participants' medical notes (n = 75). Queen Charlotte's (n = 40) and My Baby and Me study (MBAM) (n = 81) cohort participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale self-rating psychometric questionnaire. Villous trophoblast tissue samples were analysed for gene expression. RESULTS: In a pilot study, diagnosed depression during pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction in placental PEG 3 expression (41 %, p = 0. 02). In two further independent cohorts, the Queen Charlotte's and MBAM cohorts, placental PEG 3 expression was also inversely associated with maternal depression scores, an association that was significant in male but not female placentas. Finally, hPL expression was significantly decreased in women with clinically diagnosed depression (44 %, p < 0. 05) and in those with high depression scores (31 % and 21 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that maternal prenatal depression is associated with changes in the placental expression of PEG 3, co-incident with decreased expression of hPL. This aberrant placental gene expression could provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the co-occurrence of maternal depression, fetal growth restriction, impaired maternal behaviour and poorer offspring outcomes...|$|R
40|$|New genomic {{platform}} technologies {{enable the}} study of complex genomes and proteomes for improved target identification and validation. This leads to high-density datasets, {{on the order of}} millions of data points per day. Turning data into knowledge {{will be one of the}} biggest challenges of the 21 st century. Here we describe concisely the role of liver-enriched transcription factors in regulatory gene networks and focus on liver development function and disease. This knowledge will prove to be indispensable for interpretation of high-density genomic datasets that are being produced in pharmaco- and toxicogenomics. Numerous studies have established the pivotal role of liver-enriched transcription factors in organ development and cellular function, and there is conclusive evidence for transcription factors acting in concert in liver-specific gene expression. During organ development and in progenitor cells the timely expression of certain transcription factors is necessary for cellular differentiation, and there is overwhelming evidence for hierarchical and cooperative principles in a networked environment of transcription factors. The search for molecular switches that control stem-cell <b>imprinting</b> and liver-specific <b>functions</b> has led to the discovery of many interactions between such different molecules as transcription factors, coactivators, corepressors, enzymes, DNA, and RNA. Many of these interactions either repress or activate liverspecific gene expression. Six families of liver-enriched transcription factors have been characterized so far: HNF- 1, HNF- 3, HNF- 4, HNF- 6, C/EBP, and D-binding protein (DBP). The analysis of the tissue distribution of these factors and the determination of their hierarchical relations have led to the hypothesis that cooperation of liver-enriched transcription factors with the ubiquitous trans-activating factors is necessary, and possibly even sufficient, for the maintenance of liver-specific gene transcription. HNFs (hepatocyte nuclear factors) are a heterogeneous class of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that contain several families of liver-enriched transcription factors (HNF- 1, HNF- 3, HNF- 4, and HNF- 6) that are required for hepatocellular differentiation as well as in hepatic carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism (Schrem et al., 2002). Major regulatory functions in the liver, including cell cycle control, carcinogenesis, circadian gene regulation, liver regeneration, and apoptosis, are controlled by C/EBPs (CAAT/enhancer binding proteins) (see also Figure 14. 2) and DBP (Schrem et al., 2004). In this chapter we highlight striking examples of relevant network interactions of liver-enriched transcription factors with a significant impact on liver biology to further an understanding of the molecular events linked to liver disease and drug-induced toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Maternal or {{neonatal}} {{administration of}} antibiotics alters offspring intestinal barrier and defense systems in rodents, suggesting an {{implication of the}} microbiota(1). The microbiota is suspected {{to be involved in}} the onset of metabolic diseases and obesity later in life, possibly through a phenomenon of metabolic imprinting(2). However, specific knowledge on early programming and <b>imprinting</b> of gut <b>function</b> is scarce(3). We have recently shown that in a swine model of peripartum antibiotic treatment, offspring display alterations in various aspects of gut function in the short and (or) long terms(3). The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that early probiotic administration to offspring born to antibiotic-treated sows is able to restore some of these altered functions, as already shown in rodents submitted to neonatal stress and treated simultaneously with probiotics. Gestating sows (n= 23) received amoxicillin (40 mg/kg BW/d) orally around parturition (day, d- 10 to d 21) (EU Interplay project No. 227549, study carried out in 2012 and complying with institutional/national ethical rules). Offspring from 12 litters were given orally Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 16698 (PROB, 109 CFU/pig /dose) at birth and 3 times a week until d 21. Offspring from the other litters (n= 11) received the culture medium alone in the same conditions as PROB pigs. Piglets were slaughtered randomly at d 14 and d 42 (short term). The remaining offspring were reared in the same condition until 5 months of age when they continued to be fed the growing diet (LF) or were offered the same diet enriched in fat (HF=LF+ 11 % palm oil) for 4 weeks (long term). Homogenous pairs of pigs of a given sex (1 LF, 1 HF; n= 10 per treatment) within litters were slaughtered. Gut tissues were collected at slaughter and were analysed for villus-crypt architecture by histology and inducible heat shock proteins by western blotting. Data were analysed with SAS using MIXED models. Probiotic administration did not influence offspring growth performance in the short or long terms nor ileal or colonic villus-crypt architecture in the short term (ongoing analysis for long term). At d 14 and d 42, HSP 27 and HSP 70 protein relative levels were lower in the ileum of PROB piglets (P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 05, respectively; no treatment by time interaction) (ongoing analysis for colon HSPs). In the long term, only HSP 27 in the colon was lower in PROB pigs (P< 0. 01) (no effects of diet or treatment by diet interaction). To conclude, early oral administration of L. amylovorus seems to reduce, according to HSP- and site-dependent patterns, microbiota-induced stress(4) on the ileum (short term) and colon (long term) in offspring born to antibiotic-treated sows and displaying alterations in intestinal barrier and cell protection systems. Although long term effects of the probiotic suggest an imprinting of colonic HSP 27, ongoing microbiota analysis will allow us to determine if it is the result of an early microbiota-mediated programming or if probiotic levels and (or) microbiota composition are durably modified by early probiotic administration...|$|R
40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) play {{a central}} role in the {{initiation}} and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and have increasingly been applied as vaccines for cancer patients. Ex vivo generation and antigen loading of monocyte-derived DCs allows a controlled maturation, with the aim of <b>imprinting</b> different DC <b>functions</b> that are essential for their subsequent induction of a T cell-mediated anti-tumor response. A better understanding of how DCs control T cell immunity is important for the design of novel DC-based cancer vaccines with improved clinical efficiency. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate how different maturation conditions used for generation of clinical grade DC-based cancer vaccines affect their capacity to assist type- 1 polarized immune responses, important for elimination of cancer. Monocyte-derived DCs from healthy blood donors and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients were matured using two different types of cocktails; the “standard” maturation cocktail for human DC-based cancer vaccines consisting of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and PGE 2 (PGE 2 DCs) and the more recently established α-type 1 -polarized DC cocktail consisting of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IFN-γ, IFN-α, and p-I:C (αDC 1 s). Recent data from mouse models indicate that the ability of vaccine DCs to induce a desirable type 1 -polarized immune response is strongly dependent on their ability to induce a CXCR 3 -dependent recruitment of IFN-γ-producing natural killer (NK) cells into vaccine-draining lymph nodes. We found that αDC 1 s from healthy blood donors secrete substantial amounts of the CXCR 3 ligands (CXCL 9 /CXCL 10 /CXCL 11). In contrast, no measurable production of these chemokines was found in PGE 2 DCs. Functional studies revealed that supernatants from mature αDC 1 s recruited NK cells and further, αDC 1 s induced IFN-γ production in autologous NK cells, but only if concurrent CD 40 ligation was provided. Despite previous reports of dysfunctional DCs in CLL patients, we found that αDC 1 s generated from CLL patients also produced substantial amounts of CXCR 3 -ligands in a sustained fashion. Functional studies demonstrated that αDC 1 s from CLL patients were superior recruiters of NK cells and potential CD 40 ligand-expressing NKT cells compared to PGE 2 DCs. Importantly, loading of αDC 1 s with necrotic CLL cells had no negative impact on chemokine production. It has most recently been shown that autologous DC vaccines indirectly prime naïve T cells in vivo by acting as immune adjuvant that transfer antigens to recruited endogenous DC-precursors. In our final study we investigated the ability of allogeneic (foreign) DCs to recruit and differentiate “bystander” monocytes into functional DC-like cells in vitro. We found that allogeneic DC 1 s efficiently recruited monocytes and Th 1 -associated lymphocytes from CLL patients. Finally, monocytes primed in such αDC 1 but not PGE 2 DC-induced environment seem to undergo maturation toward Th 1 -deviating DCs. In conclusion, this thesis supports the therapeutic use of DC 1 -based vaccines in the traditional autologous setting and further indicates that allogeneic DC 1 s could be used as a source of adjuvant and a vehicle for tumor antigen delivery to evoke Th 1 -polarized immune responses against human cancers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{next-generation}} sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the fields of molecular biology, genetics and genomics by enabling cost-effective and quick generation of DNA sequence data with exquisite accuracy and resolution. The technical strategy of the NGS technology is straightforward: the sequencing throughput is boosted by miniaturizing the sequencing chemical reactions such that millions of those reactions can take place. The amount of data produced by the NGS technologies has been truly astonishing: about every seven months this produced data is doubled and {{it is expected that}} their sequencing capacities will continue to grow very rapidly over the next ten years. This allows for answering several new research questions while new kinds of experiments can be performed as the NGS technology is used creatively to sequence the genome, transcriptome and their interactions with the proteome. Investigations that were, for most, unreachable luxuries {{just a few years ago}} are now being increasingly enabled, at a rapid pace. Two different applications that use the current advantages of NGS in biology and which were the main focus of my PhD thesis, are the enlarging of the human Y chromosomal phylogeny and the detection of genomic imprinting in social insects. Publically available NGS data are used to validate and improve the existing human Y chromosomal phylogeny which represents the evolutionary relationship among the studied human Y chromosomes. The human genome can be sequenced with NGS in a time- and cost-efficient manner and therefore, more and more human genomes will become publically available in the coming years. By using Y chromosomal NGS data, a more detailed genealogical history of the evolutionary change of the Y chromosome can be reconstructed. We created two software packages, AMY-tree and PENNY, to deal with NGS data to improve the phylogeny. AMY-tree is created to determine the Y chromosomal lineage of a sample while also detecting Y-SNP recurrent mutations and wrongly reported Y-SNP conversions and reporting Y-SNPs which are not yet reported in scientific publications. As there are still many false positive SNP calls in NGS data, PENNY was developed to deal in silico with the huge number of newly reported Y-SNPs before adding them to the phylogeny. Both programs are validated based on a dataset of DNA samples sequenced on different NGS platforms and with different sequencing depths. This resulted in a new Y chromosomal phylogeny, however, the practical use of this phylogeny is becoming increasingly complex and therefore, also a minimalized version of the Y phylogeny has been constructed. The second application developed during my PhD project, is the use of NGS in a complex experimental design to find genomic imprinting in bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon whereby alleles are expressed based on their inheritance from one specific parent and since it only effects a small amount of genes, it definitely benefits from the use of NGS technologies. NGS makes it possible to determine the genetic variation in the parents first before the transcriptome of the offspring is sequenced to find the parent-of-origin specific gene expression. Without NGS finding new imprinted genes is almost unfeasible as only targeted genes can be tested. A large number of samples is required to distinguish parent-of-origin effects from other effects specific for the family, lineage and individual and the falling cost of NGS technologies make it possible to study imprinting in a genome-wide manner in this social bumble bee. Our extensive experiment was designed such that parent-of-origin effects on gene expression could be discriminated from other effects and this resulted in the detection of 93 genes with a parent-of-origin bias which all expressed the patrigene more than the matrigene. The found number of imprinted genes accords with the percentages found in other species, however, no known <b>imprinted</b> genes or <b>functions</b> found. As the experimental design is complex it was crucial that all technical requirements regarding the NGS were fulfilled to successfully detect parent-of-origin gene expression. Our results do not support David Haig's kin conflict theory as an adaptive basis of genomic imprinting in bees. Instead, both our results from bumblebees and a recently published study on genomic imprinting in the honeybee show that genomic imprinting is used to tune and reduce the phenotypic variance at specific loci. For decades it was laborious to get an adequate amount of DNA and RNA data but with the upswing in NGS technologies the challenges have been shifted onto the interpretation of the huge amounts of data that can be generated shown by the complexity to detect genomic imprinting in B. terrestris. Furthermore, the efforts that make it possible to answer research questions are also challenges resulting from the increasing use of NGS methods as shown by updating the human Y chromosomal phylogeny. By updating the phylogeny the discrimination power of samples increases such that other fields using this Y chromosomal phylogeny can answer their research questions more accurately. nrpages: 214 status: publishe...|$|R
