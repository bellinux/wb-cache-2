5|$|Considerable damage {{occurred}} as the tornado moved through Cordova. Buildings in downtown {{had already been}} damaged by an EF3 tornado <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> and received further damage from this tornado. East of Cordova, the tornado crossed the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River three times (along with the Sipsey Fork once, just north of its confluence with the Mulberry Fork). It intensified further into a violent EF4 in northeastern Walker County, as it completely leveled a site-built home and obliterated two nearby mobile homes. South of Sipsey, additional homes and mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 to EF3 strength.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Turgut Reis shelled Bulgarian troops around Tekirdağ. On 17 November, she {{supported}} the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking Bulgarian forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though {{it provided a}} morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. By 17:00, the Bulgarian infantry had largely been forced back to their starting positions, {{in part due to}} the psychological effect of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, Turgut Reis sortied from the Bosporus to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye, which had been torpedoed by a Bulgarian torpedo boat <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned {{a distance from}} the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences. Gradually, the German posts around the fortifications fell to the attacking platoons of the battalion. As on the northern side of the town, machine-gun fire from the ramparts prevented any further advance. One party reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several hours. By midday, the situation had settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but this approach was rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{school is}} over, Yumi's classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi {{to show her}} that she took a {{photograph}} of Yumi's meeting with Sachiko <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> Yumi asks if she can have the photo, but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions: one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival, and two being that Yumi get Sachiko's permission to do so as well. Yumi agrees to this, which sets in motion {{a series of events}} involving the entire Yamayuri Council. A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko, Yumi accepts Sachiko's rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sœur. This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and Shimako Tōdō—the petite sœurs of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō, respectively. Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council, Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E

25|$|On 27 August 1941, U-570 {{spent much}} of the morning submerged. She had been four days at sea and this was to give respite to a crew that was {{suffering}} acutely from seasickness (several had been incapacitated). <b>Earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> a Lockheed Hudson bomber of 269 Squadron, flown by Sergeant Mitchell and operating from Kaldaðarnes, Iceland, had attacked her. The attack failed when the Hudson's bomb-racks failed to release its depth charges.|$|E

She had been beaten over the head with a blunt instrument, later found to be an empty liquor bottle, and very likely raped. The last time she was known for certain to be alive was much <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> when she went to bed after returning from a local nightclub with her roommate.|$|E
25|$|After {{less than}} a year {{following}} the New York Draft Riots, it was feared that another riot might result from the story. That same morning, a crowd began to gather outside of the office of the Journal of Commerce on the corner of Wall and Water Streets. Many of these were merchants suspicious of the story and finally General George B. McClellan arrived at the office to investigate the matter. The editors, concerned of a likely confrontation with the mob, insisted the proclamation was real and showed a dispatch from Associated Press which they had received <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{a status}} hearing held on August 9, 2006 {{pertaining}} to the January charges, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge David Fais increased Clarett's bond to $1.1 million. This was due to Clarett's arrest <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> (see below). On August 10, 2006, Fais ordered an additional status hearing which was held on August 11, 2006. This hearing had not been requested by either the prosecution or Clarett's defense team but was requested by Fais himself. At the hearing, Fais delayed the trial until September 18, 2006, revoked the $1.1 million bond {{in the case and}} ordered Clarett to undergo a mental health evaluation.|$|E

25|$|They took Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns, encountering some {{problems}} taking firearms {{on a commercial}} aircraft. Also on the flight were Minister of Police John Banks, the Commissioner, and Julie Holden, who described Aramoana to the ATS. A large number of reporters met the flight on arrival at Dunedin. A bus took the ATS to Port Chalmers, which was choked with vehicles, where residents from Aramoana briefed the group about the township and Gray. ATS members took a reconnaissance flight over the township in an RNZAF UH-1H Iroquois helicopter. The helicopter initially flew high as it had no armour from small arms fire; Gray had shot at a private news helicopter <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> Nationalists Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Gregorio Hernández and Manuel Torres Medina {{who were}} {{assigned}} to attack La Fortaleza, met in the San Juan sector of Martín Peña, {{at the house of}} Raimundo Díaz Pacheco - the Nationalist leader and Commander of the Cadets of the Republic. At 11 A.M. they boarded a blue Plymouth and headed towards Old San Juan to accomplish their mission. The men arrived at La Fortaleza at noon and stopped their car 25 feet from their objective's main entrance They {{got out of the car}} with a submachine gun and pistols in hand and immediately began firing towards the mansion. Díaz Pacheco headed towards the mansion while the others took cover close to their car and fired with their pistols from their positions.|$|E
25|$|Before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{had been}} in only one shootout and Morgan {{had never been in}} any gun battles. Billy Claiborne {{had been in}} one gunfight prior to the shootout and was {{the only member of the}} Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting {{experience}} (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had no documented gunfights to his credit, other than a couple of drunken brawls, and only his own tales of fights with unnamed men he claimed to have shot. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from having been pistol-whipped by the Earps <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} meet this Union threat, Longstreet {{developed}} a plan, whereby he would command the gap from the high ground on either side and then outflank the Union position on the eastern ridge. The 9th Georgia from Col. George T. Anderson's brigade was sent to Chapman's Mill {{on the east side}} of the gap to repulse a Federal attack by the 11th Pennsylvania, who ironically, to reach the gap, had to remove the trees felled by Wyndham <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> The impediment allowed Anderson to send half of his brigade up to the slope to the north of the gap to occupy the high ground while still having sufficient men to repulse the 11th Pennsylvania. To the south of the gap, the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments from Henry Benning's brigade raced up the slopes on the west against the 13th Massachusetts, climbing up the east side. The Georgians won out and drove the 13th Massachusetts back down the steep slopes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} of a four-game road series against the Marlins on September 22, the Braves put up six runs, {{including}} two homers from Kemp totaling three runs, in a 6-3 victory over the Marlins. In the second game of the series, the Braves rallied back from a two-run deficit to score three unanswered runs and beat the Marlins 3-2. In the third inning, Kemp was ejected, and so was manager Snitker, for arguing with the home plate umpire over a 3-1 pitch call. Despite Freeman's adding to his 28-game hit streak with two hits and a homer, the Braves couldn't overcome Blair surrendering six hits, five runs and three walks in 3 1/3 innings pitched, and fell 6-4 {{for only the second time}} at Marlins Park in 2016 in the third game of the series. The final game of the series was cancelled following the news that Marlins pitcher José Fernández died in a boating accident <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> The game was never made up as the season was nearly ending and both teams were out of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|While {{battle was}} raging {{on the western}} side of the battlefield, some 10 {{kilometers}} to the east, Maréchal Davout was preparing his attack, the manoeuvre with which Napoleon intended to win the battle. In order to gain a foothold on the plateau before him, Davout had to drive back the forces of Rosenberg's Austrian IV Korps. The two forces had already clashed during the abortive night attacks the day before and again <b>earlier</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> between 05:00 and 06:00, when Rosenberg made a surprising attack, which the French managed to repulse. Due in part to the fact that Austrian Corps on other sectors of the battlefield failed to attack at the same time, Rosenberg was forced to draw his troops back to their initial positions, occupying the plateau and the strategic village of Markgrafneusiedl, situated just below the escarpment. This village was the key position, which Davout had to take at all costs, in order for his manoeuvre to succeed. Despite his vast numerical superiority, Davout's mission was not easy, as the Austrians had a numerous cavalry and artillery available to support their infantry. Furthermore, the defensive position was solid, with the village of Markgrafneusiedl formed of sturdy stone houses and a number of large buildings, such as a disused stone church with a tall, conspicuous tower, a monastery and a mill, all of which constituted easily defendable structures. The only weakness of Rosenberg's position was its left side, where the plateau formed a gentle slope, descending northeast.|$|E
