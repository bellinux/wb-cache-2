40|$|Previous {{experimental}} studies into {{the dynamics of}} a ball–racket impact have recorded ball velocities and trajectories {{in one or two}} dimensions. These studies were limited in terms of possible <b>impact</b> <b>positions</b> and the ability to represent realistic impact conditions. As the number of dimensions in an experiment increases, it becomes difficult to isolate single variables and to monitor their effect on the output. This paper describes a method of accurately assessing the effect of specific independent variables in impact experiments with a large number of variables. A total of 900 impacts on a Head Ti-S 6 tennis racket were recorded within bespoke impact apparatus. The impact velocity, the impact angle, the impact position, and a restrictive torque about the handle were varied between each impact. Each test was recorded with two Phantom high-speed video cameras at 600 [*]frames/s; the use of two cameras allowed the ball trajectory to be tracked in three dimensions. A multi-variate fit based on a second-order polynomial was used to establish trends within the data. It was found that applying a torque about the handle reduced the angular deviation for all <b>impact</b> <b>positions</b> along the racket's transverse axis. In a standard forehand shot, a firm grip reduces the flight time and angle of trajectory of the ball after impact, suggesting that a firm grip is beneficial during competitive play...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{design for}} an {{inexpensive}} depth of interaction capable detector for gamma rays, suitable for nuclear medical applications, especially Positron Emission Tomography, has been developed. The design {{takes advantage of}} the strong correlation between the width of the scintillation light distribution in continuous crystals and the depth of interaction of the gamma-ray. For measuring the distribution width, an inexpensive modification of the commonly used charge dividing circuits that allows analogue and instantaneous computation of the 2 nd moment has been developed and is presented in this work. The method has been tested with a detector made of a continuous LSO-scintillator of dimensions 42 x 42 x 10 cubic mm and optically coupled to the compact large area position sensitive photomultiplier H 8500 from Hamamatsu. The mean resolution in all non-trivial moments was found to be smaller than 5 % but their direct use as estimates for the three-dimensional photoconversion position turned out to be unsuitable. Standard polynomial interpolation in higher dimensions has been adopted to reconstruct the <b>impact</b> <b>positions</b> of the gamma-rays from the measured moments. When using the reconstructed <b>impact</b> <b>positions,</b> the intrinsic mean spatial resolution of the detector was found to be 1. 9 mm for the transverse components and 3. 9 mm for the depth of interaction. Using directly the bare moments as position estimate, the intrinsic mean spatial resolution of the detector was found to be 3. 4 mm and 4. 9 mm, respectively.

Foot <b>impact</b> <b>position</b> was measured with force transducers at each corner of the treadmill. Required longitudinal positions were indicated by three lines of light ("target-lines"), projected transversely across the treadmill plate. Test runs were conducted until exhaustion at speeds exceeding the aerobic threshold (mean endurance time about 9 min; mean belt speed 12 km/h, mean inclination 6. 9 %). During running, required foot positions were, at irregular intervals and during periods of 7 steps each, temporarily switched from the most posterior target-line (TL 3) to one of the two more anterior ones (TL 2 or TL 1). The first change of foot <b>impact</b> <b>position</b> took place within about 175 - 225 ms after a switch from TL 3 to TL 2 /TL 1; this initial small change was in a direction opposite to that required.

40|$|A {{model has}} been derived that determines the ball, stringbed and racket frame motion for an impact between a tennis ball and racket. This paper {{describes}} the model and methods used to verify it experimentally. The model incorporated parameters such as racket mass, moment of inertia and ball stiffness. The work was conducted to produce a tool {{that could be used}} to identify the importance of each of the parameters on the impact. The ball was modelled as simple spring and damper in parallel while the stringbed was modelled as a spring in series with the ball. The values of these spring and damper parameters were determined experimentally. It was assumed that the racket frame was a rigid body to simplify the analysis. Two different methods of supporting the racket were modelled, and the balls were always projected perpendicular to the string plane. Firstly, the racket was head-clamped and all the balls impacted at the geometric string centre of the racket. Good agreement was found between the experiment and model data for both ball rebound velocity and maximum stringbed deflection during impact. The second method of support involved freely suspending the racket at the tip on a small pin. Three different <b>impact</b> <b>positions</b> along the longitudinal axis of the racket were tested. Good agreement between the experiment and model data was found for the ball rebound velocity for impacts at the geometric string centre of the racket. The model over-predicted the experimental racket rebound velocity (generally by less than 5 per cent) for all <b>impact</b> <b>positions.</b> A qualitative analysis assigned this small difference to the assumption that the frame was a rigid body and therefore vibration losses were not accounted for. </p...|$|E

The problem is to determine optimal adjustments, {{in order to maximize}} the probability of target destruction within a given number of rounds. It is shown that seemingly different adjustment procedures are equivalent, if viewed in appropriate coordinate systems.

Properties of the optimal sequential adjustment procedure, including some related to stochastic approximation, are reviewed.
