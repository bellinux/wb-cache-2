The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

5|$|Official {{efforts to}} protect this area started in 1960, when Senator Augusto Guzmán Robles {{presented}} a bill to the Peruvian Congress {{for the creation of}} Huascarán National Park. In 1963, the Forestry and Hunting Service (Servicio Forestal y de Caza) presented a preliminary project for the delimitation of the Cordillera Blanca National Park, covering an area of 321,000 <b>hectares.</b> On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging and hunting of native species {{in the area of the}} Cordillera Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in Yungay. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, Peace Corps volunteers, formulated delimitation proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of Huaraz established the vicuña and queen-of the-Andes surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 <b>hectares.</b> Finally, on July 1, 1975 Huascarán National Park was created by decree No. 0622-75-AG, with an extension of 340 000 <b>hectares.</b>|$|E

In addition to the yield level, the conditions under which products have been sold have the decisive influence on the achieved results. In this regard, storage and deferred sale, as well as the collection of crops with lower moisture content, can significantly increase the value of production, and consequently the producer's revenue...|$|R
