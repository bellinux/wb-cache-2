25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well <b>either.</b> <b>I</b> ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E

[...] Garson Kanin, a friend of Tracy's for 25 years, described him as [...] "a true believer" [...] who respected his religion. At periods in his life, Tracy attended Mass regularly.

500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where <b>either</b> <b>I</b> saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it <b>either.</b> <b>I</b> think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|Bosh has {{traditionally}} played the power forward position, including {{during his first}} season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6ft 11in (2.11m) and 235pounds (107kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. He is particularly noted {{for his ability to}} drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: [...] "We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work <b>either.</b> <b>I</b> don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth." [...] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his [...] "arrival" [...] to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot [...]343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to [...]400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|... 30 years-old at {{the time}} of her audition, O'Hara {{consequently}} imbued Belle's voice with a mature, [...] "womanly quality" [...] despite the character's young age. Woolverton appreciated the fact that O'Hara sounded more mature than traditional Disney heroines. Additionally, O'Hara identified with her character because they were both ostracized by their peers throughout their childhood because of their unconventional interests, explaining, [...] "I was odd growing up myself. I mean, I was into musical theater and Gershwin and Rodgers and Hammerstein while people were going to Led Zeppelin concerts. So I understood that ... I wasn't the norm <b>either.</b> <b>I</b> was very focused on my career, on my performing all through my childhood and my teens ... I had a one-track mind, and I think that Belle was like that a lot." [...] O'Hara also shares Belle's interest in reading. Wise was pleased with the quality of O'Hara's voice, which reminded him of Garland. O'Hara initially found it challenging to control her speaking volume due to having been trained to project as a stage actress. O'Hara told The Guardian that to solve this she [...] "softened and used the microphone." [...] As per the filmmakers' encouragement, the actress would occasionally ad-lib her own dialogue, none was included in the final film because it sounded [...] "too modern". The animators would videotape O'Hara daily while she recorded to incorporate her [...] "quirky" [...] mannerisms, expressions and gestures into the character, among them her hair constantly falling into her eyes. O'Hara and American actor Robby Benson, who provides the voice of the Beast, asked Disney to allow the co-stars to record together as opposed to the traditional method of being isolated in a recording booth, to which the studio agreed despite its costliness. O'Hara credited the filmmaker's decision with developing both the film and Belle and the Beast's relationship. O'Hara and Benson became the first Disney voice actors to record together. In total, the recording process took over two years to complete. O'Hara had already been friends with co-star Richard White, who voices Gaston, for 15 years. Despite her successful stage career, O'Hara was virtually unknown to Hollywood audiences when she was cast in Beauty and the Beast; she was one of the last obscure actresses to be cast in a feature-length Disney animated film before the studio began casting better known talent in subsequent animated projects.|$|E

I don’t like {{them in my}} everyday life, <b>either.</b> <b>I</b> would have gone for surgery even if I hadn’t been a sportswoman." [...] She also experienced back pain.

2500|$|An object (or {{semiotic}} object) is {{a subject}} matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet. All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the universe of discourse to which the partial or special object belongs. For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object <b>either</b> (<b>i)</b> is immediate to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a dynamic object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded [...] "as on bedrock".|$|E
2500|$|That same year, Robyn {{returned}} home to Sweden and discovered the electronic music brother-and-sister duo The Knife while browsing through a record store.

She was free from her contract, but {{did not want to}} sign with another major label because she felt that [...] "it was totally illogical. Why would I do that? I felt like <b>either</b> <b>I</b> quit making music or I start my own record company". Six months after leaving Jive Records, Robyn founded her own record label, Konichiwa Records, and began recording songs for her fourth album.|$|E
