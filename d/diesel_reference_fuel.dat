40|$|Experimental {{results were}} {{obtained}} by testing two different alcohol-derived biodiesel fuels: methyl ester and ethyl ester, both obtained from waste cooking oil. These biodiesel fuels were tested pure and blended (30 % and 70 % biodiesel content, volume basis) with a <b>diesel</b> <b>reference</b> <b>fuel,</b> which was tested too, in a 2. 2 l, common-rail injection diesel engine. The operation modes were selected to simulate the European Driving Cycle. Pure biodiesel fuels, compared to the reference fuel, resulted in {{a slight increase in}} fuel consumption, in very slight differences in NOx emissions, and in sharp reductions in total hydrocarbon emissions, smoke opacity and particle emissions (both in mass and number), despite the increasing volatile organic fraction of the particulate matter. The type of alcohol used in the production process was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the total hydrocarbon emissions and on the particulate matter composition. As the alcohol used was more volatile, both the hydrocarbon emissions and volatile organic fraction of the particulate matter were observed to increase...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of diesel fuel by ultra-carbofluids was perceived {{to offer the}} potential to decrease the emissions of environmental pollutants such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (HC's) and smoke. Such ultracarbofluids consist of a suspension of coal in fuel oil and water generally in the ratio of 5 : 3 : 2 plus {{a small amount of}} stabilising additive. The literature relating to the economies of coal and fuel oil production, and the production and properties of charcoal and vegetable oils has been critically reviewed. The potential use of charcoal and vegetable oils as replacements for coal and fuel oil are discussed. An experimental investigation was undertaken using novel bio-ultracarbofluid formulations. These differed from an ultracarbofluid by having bio-renewable charcoal and vegetable oil in place of coal and fuel oil. Tests were made with a Lister-Petter 600 cc 2 -cylinder, 4 -stroke diesel engine fitted with a Heenan-Froude DPX 1 water brake dynamometer to measure brake power output, and Mexa- 321 E and Mexa- 211 E analysers to measure exhaust pollutants. Measurements were made of engine brake power output, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and smoke emissions over the speed range 1000 to 3000 rpm at 200 rpm intervals. The results were compared with those obtained with a standard <b>diesel</b> <b>reference</b> <b>fuel.</b> All the bio-ultracarbofluid formulations produced lower brake power outputs (i. e. 5. 6 % to 20. 7 % less brake power) but substantially improved exhaust emissions of CO 2, CO, HC's and smoke. The major factor in the formulation was found to be the type and amount of charcoal; charcoal with a high volatile content (27. 2 %) and present at 30 % by mass yielded the best results, i. e. only slightly lower brake power output and significantly lower exhaust pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{simulations}} of ignition and combustion of a diesel spray were conducted. The {{primary goal of}} the work was to compare two different CFD codes: OpenFOAM, an object-oriented C++ based code, and KIVA- 3 V. The spray is modelled by the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach in both codes, with several common submodels. Some important sub-models implemented include inter alia a Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH/RT) model for spray break-up, an improved spray collision model, and a Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) model for turbulence-chemistry interaction. Both CFD codes solve the chemical reaction equations in a fully coupled manner. A cubic-shaped Cartesian mesh {{was used in the}} KIVA- 3 V simulations, while a polyhedral mesh including a combination of hexagonal and prism-shaped cells was constructed for the OpenFOAM computations. The effects of high EGR and ambient temperature on the ignition and flame lift-off processes of a diesel spray were investigated. Sandia experiments conducted in a high-pressure and high-temperature constant-volume vessel were chosen for the simulations and validations. A single spray was injected into the vessel, and EGR was mimicked by reducing the oxygen concentration. The <b>diesel</b> <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> (n-heptane) was considered. For the study, a medium-size mechanism involving 83 species and 338 reactions was employed. The mechanism was validated using the CHEMKIN II package and the reaction rate constants were adjusted on the basis of measurements of auto-ignition delays of n-heptane/air mixtures in shock-tube experiments (with equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 4 at 50 bar, and from 0. 5 to 2. 0 at 13. 5 bar and 41. 0 bar), laminar flame speeds (1 atm and 3 atm), and flame structure in burner-stabilized premixed flames (1 atm). The simulations demonstrate that both CFD codes are capable of spray ignition and combustion studies, though both show strong grid-dependence. The numerical results show that the ignition delay, flame lift-off and combustion temperature of the spray are strongly influenced by EGR and ambient gas temperature. These predictions are in agreement with measurements. Nevertheless, differences are observed between the results predicted by OpenFOAM and those from KIVA- 3 V, for example, the flame predicted by the former is thinner and longer than that by the latter, which requires further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{oxygenation}} {{capability of}} ethanol-diesel fuel blends {{referred to as}} e-diesel significantly reduces particulate matter and reduces toxic gases like CO and NOx during combustion. However, a major drawback with e-diesel is that ethanol is immiscible in diesel {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. In this study, the use of soybean based biodiesel (soybean methyl esters) as an amphiphile to form a stable ethanol-biodiesel-diesel microemulsion was investigated. Ternary phase diagrams were developed to represent the phase behavior of the ethanol-biodiesel-diesel pseudo three-component system. Effects of different components and physical properties of selected blends also were studied. The instantaneous phase behavior indicated that stable microemulsions are formed over a wide area in the phase triangle, revealing that biodiesel could be successfully used as an amphiphile in an ethanol-biodiesel-diesel (EB-diesel) fuel blend. In order to formulate a stable microemulsion, the ratio of biodiesel to ethanol in the system should be greater than one. Studies revealed that the blend concentration that had the highest stability to low temperatures and moisture was ethanol: biodiesel: diesel = 3. 75 %: 25 %: 71. 25 % and 4. 00 %: 20 %: 76. 00 % with low sulfur (0. 05 %) <b>diesel</b> <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> and ultra low sulfur (1. 2 ppm) diesel fuel as the diesel component in the blends respectively. Analyses of fuel properties of the selected blends suggested that for both diesel fuel types, the blend energy contents were not significantly different when compared to their pure diesel forms. When # 2 low sulfur diesel was used in the ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blend, the lubricity of this EB-diesel was 2. 3 times better with a sulfur content reduction of 34 % when compared to # 2 low sulfur reference diesel fuel. When # 2 ultra low sulfur diesel fuel was used in the blend, the lubricity was over four times better than reference ultra low sulfur diesel fuel. However, the blend sulfur content increased from 1. 2 ppm to 18 ppm. The cetane numbers and flash points of the EB-diesel blends with both diesel types were reduced slightly in comparison to their pure forms. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is the three phase development of an Early Entrance Coproduction Plant (EECP) which uses petroleum coke to produce at least one product from {{at least two of}} the following three categories: (1) electric power (or heat), (2) fuels, and (3) chemicals using ChevronTexaco's proprietary gasification technology. The objective of Phase I is to determine the feasibility and define the concept for the EECP located at a specific site; develop a Research, Development, and Testing (RD&T) Plan to mitigate technical risks and barriers; and prepare a Preliminary Project Financing Plan. The objective of Phase II is to implement the work as outlined in the Phase I RD&T Plan to enhance the development and commercial acceptance of coproduction technology. The objective of Phase III is to develop an engineering design package and a financing and testing plan for an EECP located at a specific site. The project's intended result is to provide the necessary technical, economic, and environmental information needed by industry to move the EECP forward to detailed design, construction, and operation. The partners in this project are Texaco Energy Systems LLC or TES (a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco), General Electric (GE), Praxair, and Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) in addition to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). TES is providing gasification technology and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technology developed by Rentech, GE is providing combustion turbine technology, Praxair is providing air separation technology, and KBR is providing engineering. Each of the EECP subsystems was assessed for technical risks and barriers. A plan was developed to mitigate the identified risks (Phase II RD&T Plan, October 2000). Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 identified as potential technical risks to the EECP the fuel/engine performance and emissions of the F-T diesel fuel products. Hydrotreating the neat F-T diesel product reduces potentially reactive olefins, oxygenates, and acids levels and alleviates corrosion and fuel stability concerns. Future coproduction plants can maximize valuable transportation diesel by hydrocracking the F-T Synthesis wax product to diesel and naphtha. The upgraded neat F-T diesel, hydrotreater F-T diesel, and hydrocracker F-T diesel products would be final blending components in transportation diesel fuel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully carried out fuel lubricity property testing, fuel response to lubricity additives, and hot-start transient emission tests on a neat F-T diesel product, a hydrocracker F-T diesel product, a blend of hydrotreater and hydrocracker F-T diesel products, and a Tier II California Air Resources Board (CARB) -like <b>diesel</b> <b>reference</b> <b>fuel.</b> Only the neat F-T diesel passed lubricity inspection without additive while the remaining three fuel candidates passed with conventional additive treatment. Hot-start transient emission tests were conducted on the four fuels in accordance with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Federal Test Procedure (FTP) specified in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 86, and Subpart N on a rebuilt 1991 Detroit Diesel Corporation Series 60 heavy-duty diesel engine. Neat F-T diesel fuel reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}), total particulate (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) by 4. 5 %, 31 %, 50 %, 29 %, and 35 %, respectively, compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. The hydrocracker F-T diesel product and a blend of hydrocracker and hydrotreater F-T diesel products also reduced NO{sub x}, PM, HC, CO and SOF by 13 %, 16 % to 17 %, 38 % to 63 %, 17 % to 21 % and 21 % to 39 % compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. The fuel/engine performance and emissions of the three F-T diesel fuels exceed the performance of a Tier II CARB-like diesel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully met the lubricity property testing and F-T diesel fuel hot-start transient emissions test objectives. The results of the testing help mitigate potential economic risks on obtaining a premium price for the F-T diesel fuel in the marketplace. The F-T diesel fuel superior properties of low sulfur, low aromatics, and high cetane resulted in lower emissions yields if compared to conventional diesel fuels...|$|E

40|$|The Ignition Quality Tester (IQTTM) is a {{constant}} volume combustion chamber based device {{which is used to}} determine the derived cetane number of diesel fuel oils when used in conjunction with ASTM D 6890. During a test, the fuel sample is injected into heated, pressurised gas where it combusts. Suitable measurements are made during the combustion event to determine the ignition delay of the fuel and the latter is used with a correlation to determine the derived cetane number of the sample. The IQT offers improved repeatability and reproducibility when compared with the conventional method of determining cetane number, namely ASTM D 613. Despite these advantages, the device features a fuel injection system not indicative {{of the state of the}} art, in terms of direct injection diesel components and associated fuel spray behavior.

The functional unit is defined as ‚ÄúOne MJ of fuel input‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne kilometre distance driven‚Äù. The modelling is performed using SimaPro 8. 05 life cycle assessment software using Recipe mid-point hierarchist methodology for calculating characterisation results and Recipe end-point hierarchist methodology for calculating single score results. The fuel life cycle emissions reported in this study are: air emissions (including greenhouse gas emissions and criteria air contaminants); emissions to water and emissions to soil in Œºg/MJ.

LII images were acquired at time intervals of 1 CA throughout the soot formation period, {{for a range of}} injection pressures up to 160 MPa, and in-cylinder pressures (ICP) up to 9 MPa. The data collected shows that although cycle-to-cycle variations in soot production were observed, the LII signal intensities converged to a constant value when sufficient cycles were averaged. The amount of soot produced was not significantly affected by changes in in-cylinder pressure. Soot was observed distributed in definite clusters, which were linked to slugs of fuel caused by oscillations in the injector needle. The highest injection pressure exhibited lower soot productions and more homogeneous soot distributions within the flame. Despite diffusion flames lasting longer with lower injection pressure, it appeared that the extended oxidation time was insufficient to oxidize the excess production of soot. In addition, soot particles were detected closer to the nozzle tip with higher injection pressures. The recording of LII sequences at high temporal resolutions has shown that three distinct phases in soot formation can be observed. First, high soot formation rates are observed before the establishment of the diffusion flame. Second, a reduced soot formation rate is apparent from the start of diffusion flame until the end of injection.

Often research conducted on HCCI uses research grade fuels to study combustion. The {{goal of this}} paper is to investigate the effects of partially refined and transportation fuels on HCCI combustion. Tested fuels include partially refined gasoline and Jet B. An experimental comparison of the fuels is conducted on a single cylinder test engine operating at a compression ratio of 12 : 1. Each fuel is tested in HCCI operation and compared to the same tests done with a primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> blend of comparable octane number. The resulting data is useful in characterizing the differences between the transportation grade fuels and the primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article, {{the heat and}} power supply system based on the {{distributed}} cogeneration and created {{as part of the}} APEC Summit and development of the southern Far East is considered. A brief review of the experience of operating the gas turbine units of the Co-generation plant in the Russky Island is given. The output of the heat energy over 2015 reached 142. 228 thousands Gcal which is larger than that in 2014 by 18. 8 %. The specific <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption for electric supply was 272. 4 g/(kW*h) while for heat supply ‚Äì 195. 8 kg/Gcal.

40|$|Project Title: Comparison of Characterization Methods for Anisotropy and Microstructure of TRISO Particle Layers This INERI {{was created}} to support a {{comparative}} study between the newly developed two modulator generalized ellipsometry microscope (2 -MGEM) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the more traditional optical polarimeter (RAPAX) at the Commissariat l' nergie Atomique (CEA). These two systems are {{used to measure the}} anisotropy of the pyrocarbon layers in tri-isotropic (TRISO) coated particle fuel, which is an important parameter related to fuel performance. Although this project was only just started in June 2007, good progress has already been made. A kickoff meeting was held at ORNL on July 30 - 31, 2007 to present early progress and discuss details of the proposed work plan. This meeting was of great benefit to the participants, offering an opportunity to overcome the language barrier and more thoroughly communicate project relevant information. Each technical lead gave a presentation explaining the analysis techniques used in his task and presented data on early measurements of the German <b>reference</b> <b>fuels.</b> Plans were finalized regarding what work needed to be done and how to proceed with the comparative study. Possibilities for the inclusion of other coated particle samples, in addition to the two German <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> originally proposed, were also discussed. A list of these additional sample has now been generated and approved. Coating fragments from this series of different TRISO particle fuels have been sent from ORNL to the CEA and TEM analysis is in progress. Comparisons have already been made between the microstructure of the two German <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> which are the primary samples for this project. Specimens have also been prepared from the German <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> for comparative analysis between the 2 -MGEM and RAPAX devices and initial measurements performed. Plans are to exchange specimens of the various fuel types in early FY 08 for comparative analysis...|$|R

40|$|Ignition {{delay times}} of four {{different}} primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> (PRF), mixtures of n-heptane and iso-octane, were measured behind reflected shock waves in a high-pressure shock tube facility. The PRFs were formulated {{to match the}} RON of two high-octane gasolines (RON 95 and 91) and two prospective low-octane naphtha fuels (RON 80 and 70). Experiments were carried out {{over a wide range}} of temperatures (700 ‚Äì 1200 K), pressures (10, 20, and 40 bar) and equivalence ratios (0. 5 and 1). Kinetic modeling predictions from four chemical kinetic mechanisms are compared with the experimental data. Ignition delay correlations are developed to reproduce the measured ignition delay times. Brute force sensitivity analyses are carried out to identify reactions that affect ignition delay times at specific temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio. The large experimental data set provided in the current work will serve as a benchmark for the validation of chemical kinetic mechanisms of primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> blends...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} numerical and experimental studies to find correlations of octane rating with fuel properties. This thesis {{was based on}} the hypothesis that quenching characteristics at ignition locations impact the flame development. Conversely, determination of quenching characteristics might serve as an effective measure to determine the fuel mixture octane number. This hypothesis was tested with premixed flame experiments using primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> (iso-octane and n-heptane) and commercial grade gasoline. Premixed flame experiments were conducted on a flat flame burner. Primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> of different ratios were taken and correlated to their respective thermal quenching condition by introducing co-flowing inert gasses at room temperature with fuel-air mixture. The inert gasses that were used in the experiment are nitrogen and helium and the results are analyzed using a camera and an imaging spectrometer. The experimental results support the hypothesis that flame quenching can be correlated to fuel mixture octane number, and holds potential as an alternative method to determine the octane number...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of biocrude produced from the liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse in ethanol was observed. The degradation characteristics of biocrude and <b>reference</b> <b>fuels,</b> such as <b>diesel,</b> waste cooking oil biodiesel, and their blends, were studied under three different storage environments and temperatures over 24 weeks, namely, hot (43 ¬∞C), cold (4 ¬∞C), and outdoor (variable temperature) conditions. Higher Heating Values of biocrude had only small changes for all storage conditions,and this {{was similar to}} the behavior of the <b>reference</b> <b>fuels.</b> Density changes were significant in hot conditions for biocrude oil compared with outdoor and cold conditions. The change in chemical composition reflects changes in densities. Upon different storage conditions, the chemical composition of waste cooking oil biodiesel and biocrude changed considerably over the time period, whereas diesel and biodiesel blend B 20 remained relatively stable. The in{{stability of}} the biocrude was mainly due to oxygenated compounds, especially phenols forming cyclic and aromatic compounds. The degradation rate of biocrude was the slowest in cold conditions...|$|R
40|$|High-speed imaging, {{spectroscopy}} and thermodynamical characterization {{are applied}} to an optically accessible, heavy-duty diesel engine in order to compare sooting and chemiluminescence behaviour of bio-derived, oxygenated <b>fuels</b> and various <b>reference</b> <b>fuels.</b> The fuels concerned include the bio-derived fuels Jatropha oil (pure), Jatropha-methylester (JME) and rapeseed-methylester (RME), all containing ?? 10 %mass oxygen, and fossil oxygenated fuels tripropyleneglycolmonomethylether (TPGME) and cyclohexanone, both mixed with synthetic fuel to have similar total oxygen content. Commercial diesel, model fuel IDEA, a Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuel (FT) and a blend containing cyclohexane serve as <b>reference</b> <b>fuels.</b> The start of hot combustion is derived from OH* and CH* chemiluminescence as observed through a spectrograph. Both species occur {{at about the same}} time, CH* signal being weaker. Soot incandescence is observed two-dimensionally at 0. 3 crank angle resolution (200 images/cycle). Ignition delays derived from soot incandescence and chemiluminescence are compared to those determined from heat release. The heat release rate and exhaust NO concentrations are used as indicators of average and peak temperatures, respectively, which are combined with soot incandescence signal to get a relative measure for a fuel's sooting propensity. Both the fuel molecular structure and its oxygen content are found to be important for soot abatemen...|$|R
