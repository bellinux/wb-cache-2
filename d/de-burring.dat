40|$|In manufacturing, and {{industrial}} robot {{is often used}} to manipulate objects (work pieces) either in free or constrained environments. The latter is more critical since it involves significant interaction of forces between the robot's end-effector, object and its surrounding which can directly affect the performance (accuracy) ofthe robot. Typical robotic tasks include <b>de-burring,</b> machining, contour/profile tracking, welding assembly, polishing and pick-and-transfer operations. Thus, the study of robot force control is a potential area ofresearch to address the problems as it seeks ways to counteract them effectively and robustly. The proposed research is aimed at investigating and analyzing the effects of changing various parameters including the different loading and operating conditions in a robotic control system. A rigorous simulation study was conducted particularly on the trajectory tracking performance of a two-link planar robot that is assumed to execute grinding and deburring processes. Active force control with intelligent elements was used in the study. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme was verified and also compared with the conventional proportional-plus- derivative (PD) counterpart...|$|E
40|$|Multi Axis Robots have {{traditionally}} been used in industry for pick and place, <b>de-burring,</b> and welding operations. Increasing technological advances have broadened their application and today robots are increasingly being used for higher precision applications in the medical and nuclear sectors. In order to use robots in such roles {{it is important to}} understand their performance. Thermal effects in machine tools are acknowledged to account for up to 70 % of all errors (Bryan J., 1990) and therefore need to be considered. This research investigates thermal influences on the accuracy and repeatability of a six degree of freedom robotic arm, which forms an integral part of a smoothing cell. The cell forms part of a process chain currently being developed for the processing of high accuracy freeform surfaces, intended for use on the next generation of ground based telescopes. The robot studied was a FANUC 710 i/ 50 with a lapping spindle the end effector. The robot geometric motions were characterised and the structure was thermally mapped at the latter velocity. The thermal mapping identified the key areas of the robot structure requiring more detailed analysis. Further investigation looked into thermal variations in conjunction with geometric measurements in order to characterise the robot thermal performance. Results showed thermal variations of up to 13 ºC over a period of six hours, these produced errors of up to 100 μm over the 1300 mm working stroke slow. Thermal modelling carried out predicted geometric variation of 70 μm to 122 μm for thermal variations up to 13 ºC over a period of six hours. The modelling was 50 % to 75 % efficient in predicting thermal error magnitudes in the X axis. With the geometric and modelling data a recommendation for offline compensation would enable significant improvement in the robots positioning capability to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In manufacturing, automation has replaced many dangerous, mundane, arduous and routine manual operations, for example, transportation of heavy parts, stamping of large parts, repetitive welding and bolt fastening. However, skilled operators still carry out critical manual processes in various industries such as aerospace, automotive and heavy-machinery. As automation technology progresses through more flexible and intelligent systems, the potential for these processes to be automated increases. However, the decision to undertake automation is a complex one, involving consideration of many factors such as return of investment, health and safety, life cycle impact, competitive advantage, and resources and technology availability. A key challenge to manufacturing automation {{is the ability to}} adapt to process variability. In manufacturing processes, human operators apply their skills to adapt to variability, {{in order to meet the}} product and process specifications or requirements. This thesis is focussed on understanding the ‎variability involved in these manual processes, and how it may influence the automation solution. ‎ Two manual industrial processes in polishing and <b>de-burring</b> of high-value components were observed to evaluate the extent of the variability and how the operators applied their skills to overcome it. Based on the findings from the literature and process studies, a framework was developed to categorise variability in manual manufacturing processes and to suggest a level of automation for the tasks in the processes, based on scores and weights given to the parameters by the user. The novelty of this research lies in the creation of a framework to categorise and evaluate process variability, suggesting an appropriate level of automation. The framework uses five attributes of processes; inputs, outputs, strategy, time and requirements and twelve parameters (quantity, range or interval of variability, interdependency, diversification, number of alternatives, number of actions, patterned actions, concurrency, time restriction, sensorial domain, cognitive requisite and physical requisites) to evaluate variability inherent in the process. The level of automation suggested is obtained through a system of scores and weights for each parameter. The weights were calculated using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) with the help of three experts in manufacturing processes. Finally, this framework was validated through its application to two processes consisting of a lab-based peg-in-a-hole manual process and an industrial process on welding. In addition, the framework was further applied to three processes (two industrial processes and one process simulated in the laboratory) by two subjects for each process to verify the consistency of the results obtained. The results suggest that the framework is robust when applied by different subjects, presenting high similarity in outputs. Moreover, the framework was found to be effective when characterising variability present in the processes where it was applied. The framework was developed and tested in manufacturing of high value components, with high potential to be applied to processes in other industries, for instance, automotive, heavy machinery, pharmaceutical or electronic components, although this would need further investigation. Thus, future work would include the application of the framework in processes in other industries, hence enhancing its robustness and widening its scope of applicability. Additionally, a database would be created to assess the correlation between process variability and the level of automation...|$|E

Oilblotter, trade name of the Anderson Cob Mills' new anti-pollution product, is an absorbent of vegetable origin for removing oil from water and other surfaces quickly and efficiently. According to David I. B. Vander Hooven, Executive Vice-President of the mills, Oilblotter has been undergoing research and develop­ment since early 1969 and has been successfully demon­strated for federal, state and marine industry officials in both fresh and salt water and under both hot and cold temperature conditions in Canada, Texas and Florida. Mr. Vander Hooven flew to Kentucky to personally oversee the demonstration of the product which is used after a slick is contained by means of a floating boom. O ilblotter, which is non-toxic and subject to normal organic decomposition, absorbs oil immediately upon contact and is then skimmed off for burning or other means of disposal. Affiliated with The Andersons of Maumee, the Ander­son Cob Mills, Inc., are primary producers of a versatile, tough-textured natural cellulose grit derived from corn cobs, which is used in a number of manu­facturing processes including <b>de-burring,</b> burnishing and finishing metal parts, blast cleaning, and as carriers of agricultural chemicals. Grit-O-Cobs and Lite-R-Cobs, registered trade names, are also used by foundries, fur cleaners and cosmetic manufacturers. DWARF APPLE TREES Techniques for dwarfing apple trees have produced modern orchards that cost no more to get into pro­duction than standard trees, but give growers more apples per tree. Michigan State University horticulturists are testing and improving these techniques. FAT RATS STUDIED Sterility is a common condition in overweight animals and human beings. To find out why this is true, Michigan State University foods and nutrition research­ers are. conducting basic studies of fat rats to determine why obesity affects reproduction and sex hormones. CHEMICAL MAY HELP CHERRY HARVEST A Michigan State University horticulturist has found a chemiool that coutd make mechanical harvesting practical for sweet cherries. By applying the experiment­al chemical, 2 -chloroethylthosphonic acid, as a foliar spray 7 to 10 days before harvest, the force needed to remove the fruit is cut in half. Thus, the chemical might make it possible to mechanically harvest sweet cherries with very little damage to the fruit. Annual Sugar Beet Field Tour Held Recently In Oh io Areas The Farmers' and Manufacturers' Beet Sugar Associ· ation of Saginaw, Michigan, held its annual sugar beet field tour i. n the Fremont and Findlay, Ohio areas recently, reports Glenn E. Maddy, county extension agent. They visited the sugar beet fields of Melvin Schulte, Woodville; Carl and Theodore Kaiser of Graytown; Wilson Damschroder, Lindsey; Rollin Turnow, Curtice; Harold Draeger, Lindsey; Emil Webert, Elmore, and toured the new additions to the Fremont factory of the Northern Ohio Sugar Company. The main items observed were the planting of beets to a stand-that is, the farmer planted beets at the rate of four seeds per foot with no blocking done. The weed control material was Pyramin+ TCA. Then in many of the cases, they had labor removing the weeds with long· handled hoes. This is a very common practice in Michigan, the planting of beets to stand without using labor. The Kaiser Brothers used a John Deere electronic thinner to remove their excess beets. The beets were planted at two inches apart, and then were reduced to approximately one foot apart. This thinning mach­ine can do two acres per hour. The machine covers six rows at a time.
