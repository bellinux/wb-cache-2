40|$|Effect of {{increased}} dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> on peritoneal fluid and solute transport. It {{has recently been}} recommended that the peritoneal dialysate volume should in general be increased to increase the peritoneal small solute clearances. However, the net ultrafiltration volume may decrease due to higher intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) and higher peritoneal fluid absorption induced by higher <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> In the present study, we investigated the effects of increasing the <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> on peritoneal fluid and solute transport. A four-hour dwell study with frequent dialysate and blood sampling was performed in 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats using 16 ml, 25 ml, 30 ml or 40 ml (8 rats in each group) of 3. 86 % glucose solution with 131 I albumin as an intraperitoneal volume marker. The peritoneal transport of fluid, glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, phosphate and total protein as well as IPP with different <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> were evaluated. The IPP and peritoneal fluid absorption rate (as estimated from the 131 I albumin elimination coefficient, KE) significantly increased with increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> (P < 0. 05), whereas the direct lymphatic absorption did not change with increasing <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> There was {{a strong correlation between}} IPP and KE. However, the net ultrafltration volume was significantly higher in the high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> groups compared to the low <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> groups, mainly due to a better maintenance of the dialysate to plasma glucose concentration gradient in the high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} the diffusive mass transport coefficients (KBD) and sieving coefficients for any of the investigated solutes, although KBD values tended to be lower in the 16 ml group. The clearances for small solutes increased with increased <b>fill</b> <b>volume,</b> although these increases were slightly smaller than predicted from the increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> We conclude that: (1) An increase in dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> using 3. 86 % glucose solution results in higher intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure and higher peritoneal fluid absorption, but, on the other hand, a higher net ultrafiltration; (2) The increase in net ultrafiltration with increased <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> is mainly due to a better maintenance of glucose concentration in the dialysate, inducing an increased transcapillary ultrafiltration rate; (3) Solute clearances increase although not quite to the same extent as predicted from the increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> Our results indicate that decreased net ultrafiltration volume associated with higher dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> (due to higher IPP and higher peritoneal fluid absorption) could be avoided if hypertonic glucose solutions are used...|$|E

A four-hour dwell study with frequent dialysate and blood sampling was performed in 26 male Sprague-Dawley rats with 131 I albumin as the intraperitoneal volume marker. Each rat was injected intraperitoneally with 25 ml (group Con 25, N = 6) or 40 ml (group Con 40, N = 7) of 1. 36 % glucose dialysis solution alone or 25 ml (group HA 25, N = 6) or 40 ml (Group HA 40, N = 7) of 1. 36 % glucose dialysis solution with 0. 01 % hyaluronan. The peritoneal transport of fluid, glucose, urea, and total protein as well as the intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) with different fill volumes were evaluated. We found that IPP and peritoneal fluid absorption rate significantly increased with the increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> (P < 0. 01), and therefore the net ultrafiltration volume was significantly lower in the Con 40 group compared to the Con 25 group despite a higher transcapillary ultrafiltration rate in the Con 40 group. The addition of hyaluronan to dialysate significantly (P < 0. 01) decreased the peritoneal fluid absorption rate (by 22 % in HA 25 vs. Con 25 and by 29 % in HA 40 vs. Con 40) and thus significantly increased the net peritoneal fluid removal. The diffusive mass transport coefficients for glucose, urea and total protein did not differ between the Con 25 and Con 40 groups or between the two hyaluronan groups as compared to their respective control groups. The peritoneal clearance of urea increased significantly in the high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> group (by 58 % in Con 40 vs. Con 25) and in the two hyaluronan groups (by 21 % in HA 25 vs. Con 25 and by 16 % in HA 40 vs. Con 40). We conclude that: (1) An increase in dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> using 1. 36 % glucose dialysis solution results in higher intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure and higher peritoneal fluid absorption rate, and therefore lower net ultrafiltration. (2) Intraperitoneal addition of hyaluronan significantly decreases the peritoneal fluid absorption rate, and the decreasing effect is even more marked when a high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> is used. (3) Small solute clearances increase markedly with increases in <b>fill</b> <b>volume,</b> and then further increase by adding hyaluronan to the dialysate due to the increase in drainage volume.

A telephone survey of tertiary Paediatrics Intensive Care units (PICUs) in England was performed in September 2013. Recom-mended CVC lock volumes were recorded.

40|$|Background: It is {{well known}} that the {{efficiency}} of peri-toneal dialysis (PD) varies with the duration of the dwell and with the prescribed <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> Automated PD (APD) is classically given as a series of recurrent exchanges, each having the same dwell time and fill volume—that is, con-ventional APD (APD-C). We propose a new way of giving PD, using a modified version of APD-C. This method first uses a short dwell time with a small <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> to promote ultra-filtration (UF) and subsequently uses a longer dwell time and a larger <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> to promote removal of uremic toxins from the blood. We use the term “adapted APD ” (APD-A) to describe this modified form of PD. ♦ Methods: We designed a multicenter prospective random-ized crossover trial {{to assess the impact of}} APD-A in compari-son with APD-C on the efficacy of dialysis. The parameters investigated were overnight UF; weekly peritoneal Kt/Vurea; weekly peritoneal creatinine clearance corrected to 1. 73 m 2 body surface area (Kcreat); and phosphate (PDR) and sodium dialytic removal (SDR) in millimoles per session, corrected for glucose absorption, which provides an estimate of meta-bolic cost.

We studied 12 patients on regular continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at our center from January to October 2008.

We employed this model in an attempt to mimic actual clinical scenarios. Using our sigmoid fitting method, we confirmed previous two major findings regarding the relationship between balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> and geometric volume and surrounding pressure [14, 15]. First, the balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> is determined by the geometric volume of the balloon (Fig. 3): the larger the geometric volume, the larger the balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> that is needed to reflect surrounding pressure. Second, the balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> required for accurate measurement increases as the balloon surrounding pressure increases (Fig. 4). The latter finding is of clinical significance during esophageal monitoring in passive patients under controlled ventilation. Because pleural pressure increases during inspiration, the balloon volume suitable for measuring during the end-expiratory phase may not be adequate for measurement during the end-inspiratory phase. Fortunately, this did not occur in our bench model with simulated pleural pressures ranging from 5  cmH 2 O during end-expiratory occlusion to 20  cmH 2 O during end-inspiratory occlusion. An optimal volume range existed that enabled accurate measurement at both phases (Fig. 6).|$|R
