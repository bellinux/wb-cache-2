25|$|Xu & Chun (2009) {{propose the}} neural-object file theory, which posits {{that the human}} visual system {{initially}} selects a fixed number of roughly four objects from a crowded scene based on their spatial information (object individuation) before encoding their details (object identification). Under this framework, object individuation is generally controlled by the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), while object identification involves the superior IPS and higher-level visual areas. At the object individuation stage, object representations are coarse and contain minimal feature information. However, once these object representations (or object-files, to use the theory's language) have been 'set up' during the object individuation stage they can be elaborated on over time during the object identification stage, during which additional featural and <b>identity</b> <b>information</b> is received.|$|E
25|$|Many {{statements}} {{have been}} made concerning the relationship between transsaccadic memory and visual short-term memory. Researchers have noted several similar characteristics between the two systems, leading several to believe that transsaccadic memory is in fact visual short-term memory or a part of visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory has a limited capacity of three to four items, a slow decay rate and maskable characteristics. Basically, transsaccadic memory can hold three to four items for each saccade, and the retention of items decays or disappears from consciousness slowly after {{the presentation of the}} stimulus. However, once a mask stimulus, such as a blank screen, is presented immediately after the stimulus, the items retained prior to the mask can be replaced and/or eliminated faster by the mask. All of these factors are typical characteristics of visual short-term memory. The content stored in transsaccadic memory are less-image like, more abstract and are sparse representations of the objects, which is found to be similar to the type of representations in visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory is different from visual short-term memory in that it takes into account the changes of the target's location due to the eye moving to new saccades. The information retained between saccades do not take into account positional information very well. Nevertheless, relational and <b>identity</b> <b>information</b> are well retained. Prime and colleagues (2006) hypothesize, transsaccadic memory utilizes egocentric mechanisms, like selective attention, to reduce the visual search of the target and allow for spatial information between saccades to be retained and updated by incorporation of information across saccades.|$|E
