In 1995, United States Pharmacopoeia and European Pharmacopoeias reduced the particulate limit for injectables by 40 %, based on general safety concerns. Wyeth attempted to control sporadic batch failures (associated with increased particulate formation) by shortening product expiration dating from 36 to 24 months and optimizing the stopper siliconization process. These modifications did not correct the problem completely. Wyeth reformulated Zosyn by incorporating two stabilizing functional excipients, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid <b>disodium</b> salt (<b>EDTA</b> <b>disodium)</b> and sodium citrate, which solved the particulate formation problem.

40|$|Calcium, but not other {{divalent}} cations, {{is required}} for optimal uptake of intrinsic factor-bound 57 Co-labeled cyanocobalamin (IFB 12) by microvillous membranes isolated from hamster ileal-absorptive cells.
