50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{economizer}} setups for these compressors, flash and subcooling. The latter works under the same principle as the two staged booster displays with subcooling. The flash economizer is different because it doesn’t use a heat exchanger to produce the subcooling. Instead, it has a flash chamber or tank, in which <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> is produced to lower the temperature of the liquid before the expansion. The <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> that is produced in this tank leaves the liquid line and goes to the economizer entrance of the screw compressor.|$|E

50|$|Muzzle flash is {{the light}} emitted in the {{vicinity}} of the muzzle by the hot propellant gases and the chemical reactions that follow as the gases mix with the surrounding air. Before projectiles exit a slight pre-flash may occur from gases leaking past the projectiles. Following muzzle exit the heat of gases is usually sufficient to emit visible radiation - the primary <b>flash.</b> The <b>gases</b> expand but as they pass through the Mach disc they are re-compressed to produce an intermediate <b>flash.</b> Hot combustible <b>gases</b> (e.g. hydrogen and carbon-monoxide) may follow when they mix with oxygen in the surrounding air to produce the secondary flash, the brightest. The secondary flash does not usually occur with small-arms.|$|R
5000|$|More {{realistic}} modelling techniques encompass variable {{conditions that}} can occur on-site during petroleum processing by using sample analysis software at the flash site, e.g. ProMax Software, which is able to predict emissions and losses due to flash, i.e. working and standing losses. [...] Other techniques {{that are used to}} make calculations of flash losses (without sampling and analysis) are referred to as chemical process simulators, e.g. WinSim, Designer II, HYSIM, and VMG. These programs can also have the ability to incorporate data from site-specific samples to give more accurate results. Alternatively, a captured liquid or gas sample can be analyzed in a laboratory setting to determine the composition and dissolved gas-oil-ratio (GOR) using precise measurement techniques. However, this only provides insight on the sample of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> and does not account for real time fluctuations of all on-site sources of <b>flash</b> <b>gas,</b> including working and standing losses.|$|E
50|$|Vapor {{recovery}} towers (VRT) {{have been}} posed {{as a potential}} solution for vapor loss via thief hatches. VRTs are a {{way to reduce the}} vapor loading on storage tanks by removing some of the <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> before it gets to the oil tanks. The VRT can improve safety by reducing the potential for issues relating to high vapor evolution from the oil tanks.|$|E
50|$|Calculation of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> {{content is}} {{often based on}} the {{principle}} of vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) and combines theories like Raoult’s Law with component mass/energy balances, similar to those used in distillation unit operations. Since the mixture is of multiple components, more complex equations like the Rachford-Rice equation are applicable in ideal situations and have frequently been used in chemical plants and refineries. It {{is important to note that}} these equations are based on the ideal gas law and liquids at thermodynamic equilibrium, while hydrocarbons in oil and gas production are considered to be non-ideal or real, and may not be in equilibrium. Additional relationships, such as the Van Der Waals equation and other equations of state (EOS) can be applied to account for these discrepancies and can be used to provide a better estimation of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> content. Higher molecular weight hydrocarbons show even further deviation from ideal behavior and need additional computational adjustments, such as Sutton’s modification to Steward et al.|$|E

50|$|Greenhouse gases are {{classified}} by {{their ability to}} absorb and emit radiation energy in atmosphere. This process of energy capture and release is what allows for the greenhouse effect, when energy trapped within the gas causes a resulting warming of the atmospheric temperature. Greenhouse gases are necessary for keeping our atmosphere warm enough to sustain life but {{also serve as a}} medium for over-heating to occur, a phenomenon referred to as global warming. GHGs are produced both directly and indirectly during many production phases of the oil and gas industry.It is estimated that 90% of GHG emissions from fossil fuels is due to its combustion. As of 2009, energy-related CO2 emissions made up more than 80% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Flare and <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> both contain GHGs and therefore contribute to their release into the atmosphere, estimates of their emission levels during petroleum production vary due to largely unmeasured release of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> and other forms of fugitive emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Vapor {{recovery}} towers {{are also}} used in {{the oil and gas}} industry to provide <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> recovery at near atmospheric pressure without the potential of oxygen ingress from the top of the storage tanks. The ability to create the vapor flash inside the vapor recovery tower often reduces storage tank emissions to less than 6 tons per year, exempting the tank battery from Quad O reporting requirements.|$|E

50|$|Heater treaters {{are often}} used in {{industry}} for the following: To break up emulsions to separate the oil from produced water, stabilize the crude oil or condensate by separating volatile, lighter hydrocarbon fractions, (C1-C8) from the heavy, less volatile fraction (C9+) for safety reasons. Vent gas from heater treaters {{is known as a}} significant source of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> and consequential VOCs. It is possible to re-route this vent gas to a VRU to capture some of the stream or other processing units in order to reduce emissions and make additional revenue.|$|E
50|$|When {{preventing}} <b>flash</b> <b>gas,</b> {{one must}} take into account all the other features of the system and how they are affected. Increasing the pipeline diameter may have incidence on the oil circulation and affect the gas compressor. A column of refrigerant creating weight pressure in the liquid line can be a solution for flash-gas, but may have incidence in the expansion and evaporation. If the evaporator floods and liquid arrives to the gas compressor, serious complications will show up, most likely destroying the compressor (especially if the compressor is below the level of the receiver).|$|E
50|$|Three phase {{separators}} {{are used}} in {{oil and gas production}} to separate water, oil, and gas into isolated streams. A separator, in general, is a pressurized vessel that is used to divide a product based on principles of chemical separation such as phase and density. These vessels are also known as de-liquidizers or degassers because they either remove liquid from the bulk gas stream or remove gas from the bulk liquid stream during processing. Pressure optimization based on sample compositions taken upstream can provide a solution to inefficient separations and can help to reduce the overall amount of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> produced.|$|E

40|$|Vigorous {{hydrothermal}} activity interspersed by sequences of phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions occur at Whakaari (White Island volcano), New Zealand. Here, we investigate {{the influence of}} sample type (hydrothermally altered cemented ash tuffs and unconsolidated ash/lapilli) and fragmentation mechanism (steam <b>flashing</b> versus <b>gas</b> expansion) on fragmentation and ejection velocities {{as well as on}} particle-size and shape. Our rapid decompression experiments show that fragmentation and ejection speeds of two ash tuffs, cemented by alunite and amorphous opal, increase with increasing porosity and that both are significantly enhanced in the presence of steam flashing. Ejection speeds of unconsolidated samples are higher than ejection speeds of cemented tuffs, as less energy is consumed by fragmentation. Fragmentation dominated by steam flashing results in increased fragmentation energy and a higher proportion of fine particles. Particle shape analyses before and after fragmentation reveal that both steam <b>flashing</b> and pure <b>gas</b> expansion produce platy or bladed particles from fracturing parallel to the decompression front. Neither fragmentation mechanisms nor sample type show a significant influence on the shape. Our results emphasize that, under identical pressure and temperature conditions, eruptions accompanied by the process of liquid water flashing to steam are significantly more violent than those driven simply by gas expansion. Therefore, phase changes during decompression and cementation are both important considerations for hazard assessment and modeling of eruptions in hydrothermally active environments...|$|R
40|$|Inertia welding {{is widely}} used to join cylindrically shaped objects such as disks and shafts in turbine engines, turbochargers, etc. Flash control {{in many of these}} {{applications}} is not critical because the excess material is on external surfaces and can readily be removed by machining. Internal flash on hollow vessels, however, may be difficult or impossible to remove and may be either controlled by the use of flash traps or the part can be used as welded. Both internal flash and flash traps reduce internal volume and the conditions are not always acceptable. To address this short-coming, several innovative methods have been tested to determine their effect on flash control in inertia welding of hollow vessels. The methods include introduction of high pressure inert gas and incorporation of an expendable mandrel to divert the <b>flash.</b> Both <b>gas</b> and internal mandrels appear promising methods for diverting flash...|$|R
50|$|Thief hatch, {{also known}} as a gauge hatch, is a term given to a close-able {{aperture}} on a tank or vessel used in the oil and gas industry. These hatches are placed in atmospheric or low pressure tanks in order to allow for level or sample measurements and to provide vacuum relief to the vessel. Thief hatches are also used in gauge tanks and in transport vehicles where they must be opened to the atmosphere to take measurements and samples. <b>Flash</b> <b>gas</b> is readily leaked whenever these hatches are opened and therefore they can pose a problem in terms of emissions. There have also been reports of fatalities caused by manual tank gauging and sampling via thief hatches.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>gas</b> is the {{emissions}} from flash evaporation, breathing emissions, and working emissions. Breathing, or standing emissions, occur naturally as liquid {{sits in a}} vessel and undergoes normal evaporation into the atmosphere. Working emissions are created when the liquid is agitated, such as during transportation, emptying/filling of tanks, sampling, etc. Contained within all of these emissions are materials that have been deemed hazardous to humans and the environment by regulatory agencies and scientific bodies worldwide. The complex nature of chemical interactions in flare, flash, and other production vapors have spawned many efforts to describe and control how these hydrocarbons interact with other materials in the atmosphere to create air pollution. The study of these interactions is encompassed by the field of atmospheric chemistry.|$|E

Uses of NGLs vary, from other combustible fuels like autogas and natural gasoline, to the manufacturing of plastics. The apparent value of these materials has put the level of products developed from NGLs {{at an all-time high}} in the United States in 2015. Despite its value and use, many of the components that make up NGL and LPG become considered “waste gas” during production and are flared on-site or vented into the atmosphere as <b>flash</b> <b>gas.</b> This can be {{due to a lack of}} infrastructure to capture and store and/or transport these liquids to market.

50|$|The {{bombardier beetle}} has a device which {{allows it to}} shoot {{corrosive}} and foul-smelling bubbles at its enemies. The beetle produces and stores hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, in two separate reservoirs in the rear tip of its abdomen. When threatened, the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through valved tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and a mixture of catalytic enzymes. When combined, the reactants undergo a violent exothermic chemical reaction, raising the temperature to near the boiling point of water. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a <b>gas</b> (<b>flash</b> evaporation) and is expelled through an outlet valve with a loud popping sound.|$|R
50|$|Transitional {{ballistics}} is {{a complex}} field that involves a number of variables that are not fully understood; therefore, {{it is not an}} exact science. When the bullet reaches the muzzle of the barrel, the escaping gases are still, in many cases, at hundreds of atmospheres of pressure. Once the bullet exits the barrel, breaking the seal, the gases are free to move past the bullet and expand in all directions. This expansion is what gives gunfire its explosive sound (in conjunction with the sonic boom of the projectile), and is often accompanied by a bright <b>flash</b> as the <b>gases</b> combine with the oxygen in the air and finish combusting.|$|R

The test program includes procedures for obtaining the following basic flow data pertinent to the plant power cycle design: (1) Effluent steam and brine flows, pressures and temperatures; (2) Noncondensable and dissolved gas contents in steam and brine; (3) H{sub s}S content in gases formed; and (4) Solids content and chemical analysis of steam and brine...|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of the gas that is flashed is dependent on many factors, therefore {{it is suggested that}} all extractions be analyzed to determine accurate compositional values. As a generality, this definition applies to the nature of flashing hydrocarbons (HC) that make up oil and natural gas, “If the saturated liquid is a multi-component liquid (for example, a mixture of propane, isobutane and normal butane), the flashed vapor is richer in the more volatile components than is the remaining liquid". Although the flashed portion will be primarily components with higher volatilities (lighter HC), heavier HC will also flash into the vapor phase to some extent. Composition of <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> is highly dependent on temperature and pressure and can therefore be manipulated using these control variables to become a usable resource (natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL’s), alternative fuels, etc.) if proper infrastructure and sponsorship is in place.|$|E
50|$|The Liquid Nitrogen Wash is {{especially}} favorable {{when combined with}} the Rectisol Wash Unit. The combination and advantageous interconnections between a Rectisol Wash Unit and a Liquid Nitrogen Wash lead to smaller equipment and better operability. The gas coming from the Rectisol Wash Unit {{can be sent to}} the Liquid Nitrogen Wash at low temperature (directly from the methanol absorber without being warmed up). Since part of the purified gas is reheated in the Rectisol Wash Unit, small fluctuations in flow and temperatures can easily be compensated leading to best operability. To improve the hydrogen recovery, an integrated hydrogen recycle from the Liquid Nitrogen Wash to the Rectisol Wash Unit can be installed, which uses the already existing recycle compressor of the Rectisol Wash Unit to recycle the hydrogen-rich <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> from the Liquid Nitrogen Wash back into the feed gas of the Rectisol Wash Unit. This leads to extremely high hydrogen recovery rates without any further equipment.|$|E
50|$|Vapor Recovery Units (VRU’s) have {{commonly}} {{been used}} to capture vented gas and other waste gas (vapor recovery) during petroleum production, it was originally created to capture hydrogen sulfide from oilfield stock tanks. A VRU works by compressing the <b>flash</b> <b>gas</b> that is produced in storage tanks and other units {{to be put into}} a pipeline. A basic VRU is made up of a scrubber, compressor, and a switch. Once the pressure in the tank reaches the set-point, the switch kicks on the compressor and sends the vapor to a scrubber where the liquid portion is separated out. The gas portions can be used to fuel on-site operation, be transported to storage tanks for further separation, can be piped out directly to another facility, or be injected into a compressor; the liquid portions (NGLs) that commonly form are normally sent to the water tank. If they are sent to oil storage they will re-vaporize and go through the VRU, creating an endless cycle.|$|E

Py-GC/MS results support the presence of hydrocarbon markers of plant cuticles. The high abundances of C 1 and -C 2 alkylphenols and C 1 and -C 2 alkylbenzenes in pyrolysates are likely derived from maturing lignin or lignin-like biomacromolecules.
