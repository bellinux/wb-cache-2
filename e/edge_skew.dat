40|$|Data-intensive, {{graph-based}} computations are {{pervasive in}} several scientific applications, and {{are known to}} to be quite challenging to implement on distributed memory systems. In this work, we explore the design space of parallel algorithms for Breadth-First Search (BFS), a key subroutine in several graph algorithms. We present two highly-tuned par- allel approaches for BFS on large parallel systems: a level-synchronous strategy that relies on a simple vertex-based partitioning of the graph, and a two-dimensional sparse matrix- partitioning-based approach that mitigates parallel commu- nication overhead. For both approaches, we also present hybrid versions with intra-node multithreading. Our novel hybrid two-dimensional algorithm reduces communication times by up to a factor of 3. 5, relative to a common vertex based approach. Our experimental study identifies execu- tion regimes in which these approaches will be competitive, and we demonstrate extremely high performance on lead- ing distributed-memory parallel systems.

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{problem when}} producing newsprint are web breaks, which result in down-time and wear on machine parts and hence a decreased yield. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to identify production parameters that correlate to web breaks on paper machine 5 (PM 5) at Ortviken paper mill in Sundsvall. The focus is on findings from previous {{studies that have been}} considered to be important for the occurrence of web breaks. These are: • Variations of release angle at the open draw from press to dryer • The impact of skew paper web profiles on web breaks • Multivariate analysis of production parameters • Velocity fluctuations of the driver dryer rolls in the dryer • The impact of defects in the paper web on web breaks The thesis authors have applied the D. M. A. I. C method in the problem solving process. This method is applied within the Six Sigma improving program. The analysis of the profiles showed skewness in the machine. This skewness results in web feeding problems along with an increased risk of web breaks due to a skew web tension profile. Suggested improvements to solve this problem consisted of different calibrations and adjustments of the head box (distributes the pulp on the wire cloth), press, dryer and moisture profiles. No approximation of cost savings where measured. The velocity study of the dryer rolls in the dryer revealed a slack in the web break signal. This resulted in extra downtime and additional web breaks caused by debris swirling around in the machine. Machine components were also damaged due to this delay. The yearly cost savings of these problems was approximated to 400 000 SEK. A solution to this problem is under development as this thesis is being finalized and will be implemented during the spring of 2009. No correlations between defects in the paper and web breaks could be found. However, the analysis showed a higher density of defects {{at the edges of the}} paper web. High variations of edge actuators in the steam box, causing moisture variations at the edges, might generate these defects at the edges causing web breaks. It was also found that most web breaks started from the front side (FS) of the machine (facing the operators). Several of these web breaks could be explained by a non satisfactory solution for cutting the paper <b>edges.</b> <b>Skew</b> TSO and TSI profiles indicating a higher web tension on the front side, could also contribute to more web breaks on that side.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} an enhancement algorithm of skew and slant {{orientation of}} the Jawi images. A simple and quick algorithm that uses a gradient orientation histogram, {{similar to the one}} proposed by Sun and Si(1997) for the Latin text is suggested to overcome this skew and slant problem in Jawi text. This algorithm starts by carrying out the image gradient operation, followed by determining the orientation histogram and smoothing algorithm with a median filter. The histogram's maximum value is generated to obtain the skew angle followed by the correcting procedure of the early value obtained by using polynomial function. The angle is calculated analytically and finally converting the image accordingly. The slanted Jawi text uses the same approach as the above to get the slant angle. This image is sheared {{in order to get the}} right image. The outputs of this study show promising and convincing results.

The live-load test included driving trucks at 2. 24 [*]m/s (5 [*]mph) along predetermined load paths and measuring the corresponding strain and deflection. The measured data was used to validate a finite-element model (FEM) of the bridge. The model showed that the integral abutments were behaving as 94 % of a fixed-fixed support. Live-load distribution factors were obtained using this validated model and compared to those calculated in accordance to recommended procedures provided in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (2010). The results indicated that if the bridge was considered simply supported, the AASHTO LRFD Specification distribution factors were conservative (in comparison to the FEM results). These conservative distribution factors, along with the initial simply supported design assumption resulted in a very conservative bridge design. In addition, a parametric study was conducted by modifying various bridge properties of the validated bridge model, one at a time, in order to investigate the influence that individual changes in span length, deck thickness, <b>edge</b> distance, <b>skew,</b> and fixity had on live-load distribution.

40|$|Buckling {{strength}} predictions {{are presented}} {{for a wide}} range of thin isotropic skew plates. The key studied parameters include the aspect ratio, skew angle, and rotational restraint stiffness on the different edges of the plate. The buckling strengths are evaluated both for isolated plates and for plates that are continuous with other parts of the structure. The assumed loading is uniform, uniaxial compression. The buckling predictions are presented in the form of dimensionless buckling curves, which permit a ready adoption into the “data sheets” commonly used in current design. The buckling predictions demonstrate the effect of introducing symmetrical combinations of elastic restraints against rotation on the <b>edges</b> of isolated <b>skew</b> plates. Further, they are presented in a manner that allows the benefits of continuity over skew bays to be evaluated. The curves also illustrate the complex character of the buckling mode changes that take place with a change in aspect ratio in skew plate structures.

The new proposed eigenvalue problem presents no poles, so the roots of the problem can be found by any suitable iterative numerical method. By avoiding a standard formulation for the DSM, the local mode shapes are directly calculated and any extension to the beam theory can be easily incorporated.

Such drawings are constructed by {{a framework of}} algorithms which operates in four phases: cycle removal, leveling, crossing reduction, and coordinate assignment. However, there are situations where cycles should be displayed as such, e. g., distinguished cycles in the biosciences and scheduling processes repeating in a daily or weekly turn.

One of the periodic tests conducted on this bridge was a live-load test. The live-load test included driving trucks across the bridge, as well as parking trucks along different lanes of the bridge, and measuring the deflection and strain. The data collected from these tests was used to create and calibrate a computer model of the bridge. The model was afforded the same dimensions and characteristics as the actual bridge, and then the boundary conditions (how the bridge is being supported) were altered until the model data and the live-load data matched. Live-load distribution factors and load ratings were then obtained using this calibrated model and compared to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The results indicated that in all cases, the AASHTO LRFD Specification distribution factors were conservative by between 55 % to 78 % due to neglecting to take the bridge fixity (bridge supports) into account in the distribution factor equations. The actual fixity of the bridge {{was determined to be}} 94 %. Subsequently, a variable study was conducted by creating new models based on the original bridge for changes in span length, deck thickness, <b>edge</b> distance, <b>skew</b> (angle of distortion of the bridge), and fixity to see how each variable would affect the bridge. Distribution factors were then calculated for each case and compared with the distribution factors obtained from the AASHTO LRFD Specifications for each case.

Both parameters provided ranges between 10 % non- conservative and 56 % conservative.
