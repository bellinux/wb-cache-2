25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was dated Spring 1953, and was edited by Jack O'Sullivan. [...] The cover, by Alexander Leydenfrost, was reprinted from a 1942 issue of Planet Stories. [...] The fiction {{included}} [...] "Black Friar of the Flame" [...] by Isaac Asimov, and [...] "The Million Year Picnic", by Ray Bradbury—the {{first of his}} [...] "Martian Chronicles" [...] stories. [...] Interior art included some of Kelly Freas' earliest work. [...] The issue was only modestly successful, and {{on the advice of}} his distributor, who told Reiss that they were <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> the magazine distributed, Reiss decided to switch to the digest format for the second issue: digests were starting to become more popular than the pulps, which would be almost completely gone from the market within only a couple more years. [...] The second issue was dated Fall 1953; the cover, by Freas, illustrated [...] "Lorelei of the Red Mist", by Bradbury and Leigh Brackett. [...] Freas also did the interior illustrations for the story, and later commented that he was delighted by the results but felt he was [...] "never quite able to repeat it. [...] A hex, of course." [...] Interior artists for the second issue also included Emsh; the fiction included stories by Fredric Brown and Horace Gold. [...] However, this issue received only limited distribution, and Reiss decided against continuing with the magazine.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1966, Hunt met Mike Ratledge of Soft Machine. Hunt was <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> a visa {{extension}} {{to stay in}} England and proposed to Ratledge. Ratledge and Hunt were married on April 15, 1967. The Soft Machine were heavily booked {{and there was no}} time for a honeymoon, but Ratledge and Hunt were able to spend two months together before the band headed for France later that year. Hunt said in 1991 that she and Ratledge never held hands and never kissed, but that [...] "...he comes for Easter. But that's what we called married." [...] While the two have remained good friends, Hunt says the secret to a happy marriage is to [...] "separate immediately." [...] When Hunt and Ratledge reached their 40th wedding anniversary, Hunt called Ratledge up and said, jokingly, [...] "We should renew our vows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Medical tourism {{may raise}} broader ethical {{issues for the}} {{countries}} {{in which it is}} promoted. For example, in India, some argue that a [...] "policy of 'medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses' will lead to a deepening of the inequities" [...] already embedded in the health care system. In Thailand, in 2008 it was stated that, [...] "Doctors in Thailand have become so busy with foreigners that Thai patients are <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> care". Medical tourism centered on new technologies, such as stem cell treatments, is often criticized on grounds of fraud, blatant lack of scientific rationale and patient safety. However, when pioneering advanced technologies, such as providing 'unproven' therapies to patients outside of regular clinical trials, it is often challenging to differentiate between acceptable medical innovation and unacceptable patient exploitation.|$|E

We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked up and said, {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of the}} soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 Kelly was {{approached}} by Lindsay Fields, the guitarist and backing vocalist for John Farnham, to perform a Christmas-themed song or carol for a various artists charity record, The Spirit of Christmas, {{to raise money for}} the Salvation Army. Kelly originally selected [...] "Christmas Must Be Tonight" [...] by Robbie Robertson (The Band) however that had already been performed by James Blundell on The Spirit of Christmas 1994, so he told Fields that he would have a go at writing one instead. Kelly later recalled, [...] "I had a rough tune I'd been kicking around with the band at sound check, but was <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> started on the words. Kelly's inspiration for the lyrics was subsequently drawn from Irving Berlin's White Christmas, where [...] "Irving intensifies the feeling of Christmas by not being there". He advised Fields, [...] "I have a Christmas song but it doesn't have a chorus and it's set in a prison". Fields was overcome with emotion when he first heard it and convinced the Salvation Army's selection group to accept it for the collection.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{the record}} a more {{developed}} and mature set of songs, [...] "Subject to Change" [...] also {{proved to be}} The Faith's swan song, as the group disbanded {{by the summer of}} 1983. Drummer Ivor Hanson announced he would soon leave for college. Finding a replacement was not an option. According to guitarist Mike Hampton, the rest of the band was <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> along. [...] "It was a good time to stop, but I suppose it’s a shame that we flamed out before getting a solid tour set up and executed, but it’s also a wonder and a success that we did what we did." [...] Alec declared that it was getting more difficult to be productive and creative together, although the end was also a beginning. After The Faith broke up, guitarist Eddie Janney formed Rites of Spring with Guy Picciotto; while Hampton, Bald, and Hanson went on to join Embrace with Ian MacKaye on vocals. When Embrace broke up in early 1986, Chris Bald rejoined Alec MacKaye in Ignition (with Alec on vocals;) meanwhile, Janney reunited with Michael Hampton for One Last Wish following Rites of Spring's breakup (later reformed as Happy Go Licky.) Finally, Hampton and Hanson reunited in Manifesto in 1991, while Alec MacKaye sang with The Warmers during the mid-'90s.|$|E
