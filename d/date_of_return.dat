5000|$|However, {{when the}} {{expedition}} arrived in Hispaniola on 5 September {{the followers of}} Christopher Columbus were angry because they considered that Ojeda was infringing upon Columbus’ exploring privileges. This resulted in brawls and fights between both groups, which left a number of dead and wounded. Ojeda took many captives back to Spain whom he sold as slaves. Even so, the voyage was not financially successful, netting some fifteen thousand maravedis in profit to be divided among the fifty-five crewmembers surviving from the original three hundred.

5000|$|In May 2014, a court {{decision}} from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice invalidated the five-year limit as an unconstitutional restriction {{on the right}} to vote, in violation of Section Three, leading to a period of fourteen months during which all Canadian expatriates could apply to be on the register of electors. However, the decision was reversed 2-1 on appeal at the Court of Appeal for Ontario on July 20, 2015, in a judicial opinion citing Canada's history of using a residence-based electoral district system and a justification based on social contract theory, which held that the five-year limit was a permissible limitation of the constitutional right to vote under Section One. As of August 2015, Elections Canada has implemented changes to its registration process to comply with the latest court ruling, and will require expatriates already on the register to declare an intended <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> [...] The decision from the Court of Appeal was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which announced on April 14, 2016 that it would hear the appeal.|$|E

50|$|The 110 {{foot patrol}} boats {{proved to be}} an {{effective}} addition to the drug and immigration enforcement, search and rescue, and fishery law enforcement. The Island-class cutter design is approaching a period of time where the remaining 110 foot cutters are aging and will either not be maintained adequately or will not be replaced by something newer. A Coast Guard committee found this situation unacceptable and wanted immediate action to avoid any loss in the Coast Guard's operational readiness or national maritime security. The Coast Guard ended the Deepwater Conversion plan early enough to save upwards of $80,000,000 originally planned to be spent altering these vessels. While the Coast Guard has sped up the development associated with the Fast Response Cutter and Sentinel class cutter, with the 123 foot conversion program idled, there are fewer small patrol craft due to the absence of the converted patrol boats being taken out of service. The fact that six 110 foot cutters are absent due to supporting the Global War on Terror is further complicating the ability of the Coast Guard to have adequate underway patrol coverage domestically. The six deployed cutters have no expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> from overseas duty.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} selection in nature to understand how populations adapt to their environment; however, the temporal dynamics of selection are rarely investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the temporal variation in selection by comparing the mode, direction and strength of selection on fitness-related traits between two cohorts of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Specifically, we quantified individual reproductive success and examined selection on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and body length in a wild population at Big Beef Creek, Washington (USA). Results Reproductive success and the mode, direction and strength of selection on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and body length differed between two cohorts sampled in 2006 and 2007. Adults of the first brood year had greater success over those of the second. In 2006, disruptive selection favored early and late returning individuals in 2 -year-old males, and earlier returning 3 -year-old males had higher fitness. No evidence of selection on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was detected in females. In 2007, selection on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was not observed in males of either age class, but stabilizing selection on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was observed in females. No selection on body length was detected in males of both age classes in 2006, and large size was associated with higher fitness in females. In 2007, selection favored larger size in 3 -year-old males and intermediate size in females. Correlational selection between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and body length was observed only in 2 -year-old males in 2006. Conclusions We found evidence of selection on body length and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to the spawning ground, both of which are important fitness-related traits in salmonid species, but this selection varied over time. Fluctuation in the mode, direction and strength of selection between two cohorts was likely to be due to factors such as changes in precipitation, occurrence of catastrophic events (flooding), the proportion of younger- versus older-maturing males, sex ratio and densities of spawners. </p...|$|E
