40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 's {{a range of}} {{applications}} of fractal geometry, {{for the analysis of}} the built environment, have been proposed. One of these, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot's "box counting" approach, was developed by Carl Bovill who demonstrated a manual method for determining an approximate fractal dimension of architectural plans and elevations. Since that time, a computational variation of the method has been developed and tested providing a mathematical determination of the characteristic visual complexity of a building. The present chapter records research into the changing formal strategies employed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the design of houses. Wright designed many houses during his almost 70 year professional career. Historians have defined three <b>distinct</b> <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> in his housing oeuvre; the Prairie style (generally {{the first decade of the}} 201 century), the "Textile Block" era (the 1920 s) and the Usonian era (the 1930 s to the 1950 s). This chapter undertakes the first mathematical analysis of visual complexity in the domestic architecture of Wright. The research analyzes five houses from each of these three eras using the computational fractal approach to measuring visual properties of architecture. In this way it is possible to provide a mathematical determination of the relationship between the three major stylistic periods in Wright's work...|$|E
40|$|Fractal {{geometry}} {{was first}} used as a quantifiable method for analyzing the visual complexity of a building in the mid 1990 ’s. Since then the method has been repeated many times – by scholars using both its manual and computational variations – to mathematically analyse architectural elevations. As {{a result of this}} practice, a large amount of comparative data describing the visual complexity of the exterior facades of famous buildings has become available. However, very little research has been undertaken into the fractal analysis of architectural plans and even less into the relationship, if any, that exists between visual complexity in plans and elevations. In order to test whether there is any pattern to the relationship between visual complexity in plans and associated elevations, this paper undertakes a comparative fractal analysis of 15 houses by Frank Lloyd Wright. Importantly, these houses are drawn from three <b>distinct</b> <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> in Wright’s work. This suggests that, if the relationship between plan and elevation is significant, then clear trends should be discernable for each period. This paper describes the standard method of fractal analysis along with its computational variation that is used to calculate the present results. A description of each of the houses is then provided, followed by the presentation of the fractal dimension results. Finally, the paper analyses these results in detail and provides a conclusion regarding the proposed relationship between the visual complexity of plans and elevations in Wright’s domestic architecture...|$|E

40|$|Little {{scholarship}} exists {{about the}} extent of musical nationalism in the works of twentieth-century Italian composer Alfredo Casella (1883 - 1947). Casella’s output, which is divided into three <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> – 1902 - 1913, 1914 - 1920, and 1921 - 1946 – display varying styles and influences, such as an extension of French, German, and Russian romanticism and Schoenbergian atonality. Yet nationalistic expression simultaneously pervades each stylistic period: The first period portrays nationalism through the use of folk material and forms, as does the second, which also uses programmatic elements in an atonal context. The third <b>stylistic</b> <b>period,</b> to which previous scholars have given the most attention, expresses nationalism by alluding to past Italian Baroque and Classical composers and forms. This thesis explores how Casella’s nationalistic tendencies pervade all three <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> and evolved {{over the course of his}} career, culminating in his third <b>stylistic</b> <b>period.</b> A close reading of Casella’s own writings – which will explore how his ideologies reflected the political and cultural views in Italy at the time – and score analysis of representative works from each period will reveal in Casella’s works “a music unquestionably Italian in idiom 2 ̆ 2 (Alfredo Casella, 21 + 26, 41) ...|$|R

The architects of the 17 th- 19 th centuries expressed their creative and filosofic position choosing some concrete example of the great theorists of the past when constructing moulds and orders. We should note that the negative attitude to Classicism theory reasoned in the lack of investigations of the architectural details of the buildings of the 18 th- 19 th centuries, in particular the ones in Saint Petersburg. At the present moment the interest to studying the architectural theories and forms is reappearing both in Russia and in Europe. The article considers the architectural moulds {{of the eighteenth century}} buildings of St. Petersburg, examples of their construction in each <b>stylistic</b> <b>period.</b> The analysis shows the significant differences of the Russian moulds drawings from the recommendations of classical treatises of the Renaissance and educational counterparts.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{computational}} {{variation of the}} “box-counting method” has been developed that can produce objective and quantitative determinations of the visual complexity of buildings. Ongoing research to test the validity of this computational method has produced more than 30 sets of consistent data representing the work of several historically significant architects including Eileen Gray, Le Corbusier, Kazuyo Sejima and Peter Eisenman. These {{results suggest that the}} box-counting method is potentially significant and that its computational variation merits further testing and exploration. Past research using this method has typically focused on sets of works, produced as part of a consistent <b>stylistic</b> <b>period</b> in an architect’s career. This research typically showed significant clustering of the characteristic complexity, or fractal dimension, of various architect’s designs. If this is true, then the method may be useful for differentiating particular <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> in an architect’s career. In order to test this possibility, the present paper undertakes a comparison between the visual complexity of five of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Triangle-Plan Usonian houses and five of Wright’s Prairie houses. Through this comparison of the fractal dimensions of both the elevations and plans of these ten buildings {{it may be possible to}} quantify the formal differences between these two periods in the architect’s oeuvre...|$|R
