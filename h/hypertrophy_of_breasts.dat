40|$|Background: Reduction mammoplasty is an often-performed {{procedure}} by plastic sur-geons {{and increasingly}} by general surgeons. The {{question has been}} posed in both general surgical literature and plastic surgical literature as to whether this procedure should re-main the domain of surgical specialists. Some general surgeons are trained in breast reductions, whereas all plastic surgeons receive training in this procedure. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project provides {{a unique opportunity to}} compare the 2 surgical specialties in an unbiased manner in terms of preoperative comorbidities and 30 -day postoperative complications. Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improve-ment Project database was queried for the years 2005 – 2012. Patients were identified as having undergone a reduction mammoplasty by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Results were refined to include only females with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code of 611. 1 (<b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>breasts).</b> Information was collected regarding age, surgical specialty performing procedure, body mass index, and other preoperative variables. The outcomes utilized were presence of superficial surgical site infection, presence of deep surgical site infection, presence of wound dehiscence...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> (JHB) is an uncommon, benign {{disorder}} and typically occurs in peri-pubertal females. The etiology of JHB is uncertain. It may represent an end-organ hypersensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> to normal levels of sex steroids. Clinically, it {{is characterized by}} rapid enlargement <b>of</b> <b>breasts,</b> either unilateral or bilateral. The definitive diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination. Treatment recommendations include surgery and hormonal therapy, although hormonal manipulation is still controversial in pediatric patients. Here we report a 13 -year-old girl with unilateral JHB who did not require surgery or medical treatment. Key words: juvenile <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast,</b> adolescent, management. Juvenile <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> (JHB, synonyms: virginal <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast,</b> juvenile gigantomastia) is an uncommon, benign {{disorder and}} typically occurs in peri-pubertal females 1 - 5. This entity was first described by Durston in 1669, although the patient reported was more consistent with the diagnosis <b>of</b> gravid <b>hypertrophy</b> instead <b>of</b> JHB 1, 2, 6. The etiology of JHB is uncertain 1 - 5. JHB usually develops sporadically, but familial cases have also been reported 1, 9. It occurs more commonly in girls between 8 to 16 years of age, and is clinically characterized by rapid enlargement <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> 1 - 3. The overgrowth <b>of</b> the <b>breasts</b> is usually bilateral, although unilateral JHB has been described 4, 5, 10, 11. It can cause several clinical problems such as breast pain, back and neck pain, dilatation of superficial veins, and skin ulcerations. It may also cause some serious psychological and cosmetic disturbances. We present a patient with unilateral JHB who did not require any treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background. Gestational gigantomastia {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} without clear etiology or well-established risk factors. Several pathogenic mechanisms {{contributing to}} the disease process have been proposed, {{all of which can}} lead to a similar phenotype <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> Case. A 28 -year-old Guinean woman presented at 37 weeks of gestation with bilateral gigantomastia, mastalgia, peau d’orange, and back pain. Prolactin levels were 103. 3 [*]μg/L (with a normal reference value for prolactin in pregnancy being 36 – 372 [*]μg/L). The patient was treated with bromocriptine (2. 5 [*]mg twice daily), scheduled for a repeat cesarean, and referred to surgery for bilateral mammoplasty. Conclusion. Gestational gigantomastia is a rare disorder, characterized by enlargement and <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> tissue. Our patient presented with no endocrine or hematological abnormalities, adding to {{a review of the literature}} for differential diagnoses, workup, and management of cases of gestational gigantomastia with normal hormone levels...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> (JHB) {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{leading to}} gigantomastia unilaterally or bilaterally in peripubertal females. The pathology is limited usually to the breast, with otherwise normal growth and development and without any other deformities. The rapid bilateral or unilateral growth <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> in adolescent girls leads to severe physical and psychological problems. The etiology remains elusive, but it is believed to represent an end-organ hypersensitivity {{during a period of}} intense endocrine regulatory stress. The best treatment is surgical whereas the younger patients better treated with mastectomy to anticipate the high recurrency rate, while older women is best treated with reduction mammaplasty. We report one case of a woman who had a unilateral JHB. The growth <b>of</b> the left <b>breast</b> started in her pubertal age and kept growing for one year. She was treated surgically with Wise pattern based design. After two years, she had no recurrent enlargement and aesthetically, the symmetry <b>of</b> both <b>breasts</b> is achieved with a satisfying scar.

50|$|Some {{asymmetric}} breast {{growth is}} normal in early adolescence, but asymmetry {{may be caused}} by trauma, fibroadenoma, or cysts. Most non-pathological asymmetry resolves spontaneously by the end of puberty; if it does not, surgical intervention is possible. Some adolescents may develop tuberous breasts, wherein the normal fat and glandular tissue grows directly away from the chest due to the adherence <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> fascia to the underlying muscle. Hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives are used to encourage outward growth <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> base. <b>Hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> tissue {{may or may not be}} a problem for an individual adolescent; back pain, kyphosis, shoulder pain, and psychologic distress may be cause for breast reduction surgery after development is complete. On the opposite end <b>of</b> the spectrum, <b>breast</b> tissue may not develop for a variety of reasons. The most common cause is low levels of estrogen (hypoestrogenism), which may result from chronic disease, radiation or chemotherapy, Poland syndrome, extreme physical activity, or gonadal dysgenesis. Amastia, which occurs when a child is born without glandular breast tissue, is rare.|$|R
50|$|Breast {{hypertrophy}} {{is a rare}} {{medical condition}} <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> connective tissues in which the breasts become excessively large. The condition is often divided based on the severity into two types, macromastia and gigantomastia. <b>Hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> tissues {{may be caused by}} increased histologic sensitivity to certain hormones such as female sex hormones, prolactin, and growth factors. Breast hypertrophy is a benign progressive enlargement, which can occur in both breasts (bilateral) or only in one breast (unilateral). It was first scientifically described in 1648.|$|R
40|$|Macromastia is a {{condition}} of abnormal enlargement <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> in excess <b>of</b> the normal proportion. It can be unilateral or bilateral and generally manifest at puberty when secondary sexual characters start appearing. Other patients may develop this condition {{at the time of}} pregnancy (Gestational macromastia). We present a case of young unmarried girl having unilateral macromastia due to polymastia. Unique feature in this case has been presence of two nipple areola complexes over right breast mound, one at normal site and another just superior to the inframammary crease in the line of embryonic milk line. The affected breast was almost double the size <b>of</b> contra lateral <b>breast.</b> Besides she also had bilateral <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> axillary <b>breasts.</b> Vertical scar reduction mammaplasty along with excision <b>of</b> axillary <b>breasts</b> was successfully carried out with gratifying results...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> {{can affect}} the breasts equally, but usually affects one breast more than the other, thereby causing asymmetry, when one breast {{is larger than the}} other. The {{condition}} can also individually affect the nipples and areola instead of or in addition to the entire breast. The effect can produce a minor size variation to an extremely large breast asymmetry. Breast hypertrophy is classified in one of five ways: as either pubertal (virginal hypertrophy), gestational (gravid macromastia), in adult women without any obvious cause, associated with penicillamine therapy, and associated with extreme obesity. Many definitions of macromastia and gigantomastia are based on the term <b>of</b> [...] "excessive <b>breast</b> tissue", and are therefore somewhat arbitrary.|$|R
40|$|A case <b>of</b> massive <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breasts</b> in {{pregnancy}} {{was seen in}} our institution, which is a tertiary referral centre for the United Arab Emirates region with a delivery rate of 7000 /year. It is a very rare condition (1 in 100000) and the only case seen in our hospital over the past 20 years. No similar case has been reported from the United Arab Emirates or Gulf regions, to our knowledge. The patient presented at a gestational age of 18 weeks on account of progressive swelling <b>of</b> the <b>breasts</b> which started at 14 weeks’ gestation. In pregnancy she was managed conservatively with analgesics, bromocriptine and breast support. She had bilateral reduction mammoplasty 1 year after delivery.

40|$|Mammary-digital-nail {{syndrome}} {{is a novel}} phenotypic association consisting of anonychia onychodystrophy with hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges in males and females, accompanied by juvenile <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> in affected females. This newly described genetic trait presents an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, with either reduced penetrance or germ-line mosaicism. Analysis of the pedigree, linkage studies followed by a genome-wide screen and by haplotype analysis defined the locus for the phenotype within a 12 [*]cM (4. 3 [*]Mb) interval on chromosome 22 q 12. 3 - 13. 1. This chromosomal region has not been implicated before in genetic disorders of the mammary tissue or limbs. These data suggest a possibly novel signaling pathway affecting the organogenesis of limbs and mammary glands in humans...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> (JHB) is a {{rare and}} {{relentless}} disease affecting women in the peripubertal period. We present a 13 -year-old girl with massive bilateral JHB, successfully treated with a breast reduction and free nipple graft technique. A total of 7300 grams <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> tissue had been removed, accounting for 14. 9 % of the patient’s total body weight. Prophylactic hormonal therapy was not commenced. During the 5 -year follow-up period, there was no recurrence and the patient remains satisfied with the aesthetic outcome. A recent meta-analysis study indicates that subcutaneous mastectomy is associated with reduced risk of recurrence, {{but it is more}} deforming and the aesthetic result is inferior to a reduction mammaplasty. In patients treated with the latter technique, some evidence exists suggesting that the use of a free nipple graft is associated with a less frequent risk of recurrence than a pedicle technique. This present case is unique as it demonstrates the clinical course of this patient at a considerably longer follow-up period than most reported studies. We adhered to the limited available evidence and highlight the long-term reliability <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> reduction with free nipple grafting as the first line surgical option in JHB, eliminating the need for repeated surgeries...|$|R
50|$|Flying in the V {{formation}} {{has been}} the subject of study by researchers. The front position is rotated since flying in front consumes the most energy. Canada geese leave the winter grounds more quickly than the summer grounds. Elevated thyroid hormones, such as T3 and T4, have been measured in geese just after a big migration. This is believed because of the long days of flying in migration the thyroid gland sends out more T4 which help the body cope with the longer journey. The increased T4 levels are also associated with increased muscle mass (<b>hypertrophy)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> muscle, also because of the longer time spent flying. It is believed that the body sends out more T4 to help the goose's body with this long task by speeding up the metabolism and lowering the temperature at which the muscles work. Also, other studies show levels of stress hormones such as corticosterone rise dramatically in these birds during and after a migration.|$|R
40|$|Gestational gigantomastia (GGM) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of pregnancy. Management usually is initiated with bromocriptine. If this is unsuccessful, surgery may be required. The surgical management may be by breast reduction or by mastectomy and delayed reconstruction. A 24 -year-old woman (G 1 P 0) presented at 24 weeks gestation with massive <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> her <b>breasts.</b> A decision to operate was made by a multidisciplinary team. At 30 weeks gestation, bilateral mastectomies were performed, with removal of more than 8 kg per side. Reconstruction was started 10 months after delivery using tissue expanders followed by definitive implants. GGM can be successfully reconstructed.

25|$|The {{inferior}} pedicle (central mound) {{features a}} blood vessel supply (arterial and venous) for the nipple-areola complex (NAC) from an inferior, centrally-based {{attachment to the}} chest wall. The skin pedicle maintains the innervation and vascular viability of the NAC, which produces a reduced, sensitive breast with full lactational capability and function. The volume and size reduction <b>of</b> <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>breasts</b> is performed with a periareolar incision to the nipple-areola complex, which then extends downwards, following the natural curve <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> hemisphere. After cutting and removing the requisite quantities of tissue (glandular, adipose, skin), the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere; thereby the inferior pedicle technique produces an elevated bust with breasts that are proportionate to the woman's person. Nonetheless, breast-reduction with an inferior pedicle, occasionally produces breasts that appear squared; yet, the technique effectively reduces the very enlarged <b>breasts</b> <b>of</b> macromastia and gigantomastia.|$|R
40|$|A hipertrofia maciça das mamas na gestação é uma situação rara, com poucos casos descritos na literatura. Apesar de a etiologia ser desconhecida, parece tratar-se de resposta exagerada dos receptores da mama aos hormônios gravídicos. Embora possa ocorrer em qualquer gravidez apresenta alta taxa de recorrência nas gestações subseqüentes. O rápido e descomunal aumento mamário determina, além da dor, o comprometimento do esqueleto e musculatura das espáduas. O excessivo crescimento pode provocar necrose da pele com formação de úlceras, favorecendo grave infecção das glândulas. Os autores relatam um caso ocorrido em secundigesta, expondo a conduta durante a gravidez e a inibição da lactação com uso da bromocriptina imediatamente após o parto, com enfaixamento das mamas elevadas. Realçam também a importância da mamoplastia redutora poucos meses após o parto.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{histopathology}} results <b>of</b> surgically excised <b>breast</b> specimens with the diagnosis of gynecomastia (GM). Gynecomastia is a term used to describe benign <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> in men; it is a common, mostly transient, phenomenon in adolescents, but may also be seen in older men. Breast enlargement can lead to psychological problems; if it persists it can be surgically corrected. The obtained breast tissue specimens are routinely submitted for pathological examination. We performed this study to assess the prevalence of pathological findings after surgical management of GM. Pathology reports {{were obtained from the}} nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA). The reports <b>of</b> 5113 <b>breasts</b> were analyzed for the prevalence of pathologies in different age groups. The average age of the patients was 35. 3 ± 18. 3 years (range, 1 - 88 years). The most common finding was GM followed by pseudo-GM. The overall prevalence of invasive carcinomas was 0. 11 % and of in situ carcinomas was 0. 18 %. The youngest patient with invasive cancer was 65 years old and the youngest patient with carcinoma in situ was 24 years old. The overall prevalence of atypical ductal hyperplasia was 0. 4 %; in patients younger than 20 years, it was 0. 23 %. The youngest patient with atypical ductal hyperplasia was 16 years old. Pathological findings were found more often in unilateral procedures. The prevalence of malignancies in GM resection specimens is low; however, it increases with patient age.

A bilateral reduction mammaplasty with free nipple grafts was performed. 6 kg <b>of</b> the right <b>breast</b> and 6.5 kg <b>of</b> the left <b>breast</b> removed, resulting in a removal of 12.5 kg of tissue in all (24% of the total body weight).|$|R
50|$|Often {{associated}} with aging and age-related diseases in vivo, senescent cells {{can be found}} in many renewable tissues, including the stroma, vasculature, hematopoietic system, and many epithelial organs.

Senescent fibroblasts in models <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> epithelial cell function have been found to disrupt milk protein production due to secretion of matrix metalloproteinases.Similarly, senescent pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells caused nearby smooth muscle cells to proliferate and migrate, perhaps contributing to <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>of</b> pulmonary arteries and eventually pulmonary hypertension.|$|R
50|$|Estrogen levels also rise {{significantly}} during pregnancy.
