Tent camping is available at all campgrounds within the park. Whirlpool Lake campground is designated as a tenting only campground. There are also 22 wilderness campsites located in the back country of the park. These sites are equipped with firewood, pit privies, picnic tables and food storage containers.|$|E

25|$|Flue-cured tobacco was {{originally}} strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier-poles in curing barns (Aus: kilns, also traditionally called 'oasts'). These barns have flues run from externally fed <b>fire</b> <b>boxes,</b> heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature {{over the course}} of the curing.

60|$|They {{lost all}} regard for {{personal}} appearance, {{and for that}} matter, common decency. The cabin became a pigpen, and never once were the beds made or fresh pine boughs laid underneath. Yet they could not keep to their blankets, {{as they would have}} wished; for the frost was inexorable, and the <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> consumed much fuel. The hair of their heads and faces grew long and shaggy, while their garments would have disgusted a ragpicker. But they did not care.

50|$|The chip heater {{consisted}} of a cylindrical unit with a <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> and flue, through which a water pipe was run. Water was drawn from a cold water tank and circulated through the <b>fire</b> <b>box.</b> When heated, the water was drawn off to the area where it was used, typically in a bath or shower. There often was an ash box under the <b>fire</b> <b>box,</b> which allowed air under the fire, as well as various dampers in the flue.|$|E
50|$|This more {{traditional}} method uses a two-box system: a <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> and a food box. The <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> is typically adjacent {{or under the}} cooking box, and can be controlled to a finer degree. The heat and smoke from the <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> exhausts into the food box, where {{it is used to}} cook and smoke the meat. These may be as simple as an electric heating element with a pan of wood chips placed on it, although more advanced models have finer temperature controls.|$|E
50|$|Biomass, such as wood chips, {{can be used}} as {{the fuel}} for a thermal oxidizer. The biomass is then gasified and the stream with {{hazardous}} gases is mixed with the biomassgas in a <b>firing</b> <b>box.</b> Sufficient turbulence, retention time, oxygen content and temperature will ensure destruction of the VOC's. Such biomass fired thermal oxidizer has been installed at Warwick Mills, New Hampshire. The inlet concentrations are between 3000-10.000 ppm VOC. The outlet concentration of VOC are below 3 ppm, thus having a VOC destruction efficiency of 99.8%-99.9%.|$|R

2500|$|Each {{address in}} the city is {{assigned}} a box number, based on the closest street, special building or highway box. The term [...] "box" [...] refers to the <b>Fire</b> Alarm <b>Boxes,</b> which at one time lined street corners {{and in front of}} certain buildings. Each <b>Fire</b> Alarm <b>Box</b> was given a specific number by the FDNY's Bureau of Communications. Even if the physical <b>fire</b> alarm <b>box</b> is no longer at a specific address or street corner, the address or street corner is still assigned that <b>fire</b> alarm <b>box's</b> number. Box numbers can be duplicated in different boroughs, which is why they are always identified by borough name or numerical prefix on the computer (66 for Bronx and Manhattan, 77 for Brooklyn, 88 for Staten Island and 99 for Queens). If there is also a street address given to the dispatchers, the responding apparatus will get this information in the firehouse, over the air, and via their mobile data terminals in the rigs, in addition to the Box number. At present there are about 16,000 physical <b>fire</b> alarm street <b>boxes</b> in New York City, with many additional special building boxes and highway boxes, as well as [...] "dummy boxes" [...] used for special response assignments. In addition there are two airport crash boxes, one in the LaGuardia Tower, (Queens Box 37), and one in the JFK Tower, (Queens Box 269), which can only be activated by the personnel in these towers. When either box is sounded it brings an automatic second alarm (2–2) response of equipment, along with various special units.|$|R
