500|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of red-billed tropicbirds are prey for both brown and black rats {{in places like}} Abrolhos Archipelago, where these rats are {{invasive}} species. Feral cats are also predators of breeding tropicbirds, with the birds providing about 3% of the diet of the cats in locations such as the Caribbean island Saba. On Saba, the problem has only arisen since about 2000. On Ascension Island, {{the effect of the}} eradication of feral cats was the increase of the red-billed tropicbird population there by about 1.6% in a year. [...] On the Galapagos Islands, the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) [...] occasionally eats young birds. Toxoplasma gondii, an <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite,</b> can be found in this bird. About 28% of red-billed tropicbirds produce antibodies for T. gondii.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{microbes}} are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using {{organic compounds}} as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as commensals or parasites) or find in {{dead organic matter}} of all kind (saprophages). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many eukaryotic microorganisms are heterotrophic by predation or parasitism, properties also found in some bacteria such as Bdellovibrio (an <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as Myxococcus (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most pathogenic bacteria {{can be viewed as}} heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic polymers such as cellulose, chitin or lignin which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide (mineralization) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes. [...] There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products. [...] Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in bioremediation.|$|E

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi are obligate <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> that {{multiply}} until lysis of host cells. The {{present study}} was undertaken to evaluate the effect of hydroxyurea (an inhibitor of cell division at the G 1 /S phase) on the multiplication of L. amazonensis, T. gondii, and T. cruzi in infected host cells. Infected cells were treated with hydroxyurea (4 mM) for 48 h. Hydroxyurea arrested intracellular multiplication of all infective forms of the parasites tested. In treated cultures, the percent of infected host cells decreased (50 - 97 %) and most <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> were eliminated. Ultrastructural observations showed no morphologic change in host cells while <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> presented drastic morphologic alterations or disruption.

40|$|Proteins {{containing}} repetitive {{amino acid}} domains are widespread in all life forms. In parasitic organisms, proteins containing repeats play important roles such as cell adhesion and invasion and immune evasion. Therefore, extracellular and <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> {{are expected to}} be under different selective pressures regarding the repetitive content in their genomes. Here, we investigated whether there is a bias in the repetitive content found in the predicted proteomes of 6 exclusively extracellular and 17 obligate <b>intracellular</b> protozoan <b>parasites,</b> as well as 4 free-living protists. We also attempted to correlate the results with the distinct ecological niches they occupy and with distinct protein functions. We found that <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> have higher repetitive content in their proteomes than do extracellular parasites and free-living protists. In <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites,</b> these repetitive proteins are locatedmainly at the parasite surface or are secreted and are enriched in amino acids known to be part of N- and O-glycosylation sites. Furthermore, in <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites,</b> the developmental stages that are able to invade host cells express a higher proportion of proteins with perfect repeats relative to other life cycle stages, and these proteins have molecular functions associated with cell invasion.
