5|$|Hamurabi in {{particular}} is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as The Sumer Game. Dyment created it as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented <b>FOCAL</b> programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the <b>FOCAL</b> and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in <b>FOCAL,</b> referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
5|$|However, the <b>focal</b> {{point of}} the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's <b>focal</b> center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, {{the crook of his}} arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the <b>focal</b> fountain, made of Verona {{aggregate}} {{that had}} deteriorated over time, {{was replaced with}} an exact reproduction of Botticino marble, sculpted by Nicola Stagetti in Pietrasanta, Italy.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold III, {{imprisoned in}} the in Laeken Castle, became a <b>focal</b> point for passive resistance, despite having been {{condemned}} by the government-in-exile for his decision to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include <b>focal</b> neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and <b>focal</b> changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) {{classification}} uses Glasgow coma score (GCS) and <b>focal</b> neurological {{deficit to}} gauge severity of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm <b>focal</b> length but is fairly insignificant as the <b>focal</b> length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter <b>focal</b> lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the <b>focal</b> length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all <b>focal</b> lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer <b>focal</b> lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E
5|$|By {{combining}} the wide angle <b>focal</b> lengths with narrow apertures, the lens provides strong {{depth of field}} rather than making blurred backgrounds. The lens is constructed with a hybrid aspherical lens that when combined with two glass mold elements provides excellent correction for distortion as well as astigmatism.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aftershocks}} {{occurred at}} significantly greater depths than the mainshock and {{are dominated by}} strike-slip <b>focal</b> mechanisms. This suggests that the mainshock triggered later movement on {{a complex set of}} right and left lateral strike-slip faults within the basement, together accommodating north-south shortening beneath the Hormuz salt layer.|$|E
5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag bellows. A scissor {{mechanism}} held the bellows in its expanded state until {{the photo was}} taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6cm×9cm on a photographic plate, at a <b>focal</b> length of 85mm.|$|E
5|$|Póvoa de Varzim {{developed}} a cosmopolitan style {{and became a}} service-sector city. It is one of northern Portugal's main urban centres. Póvoa is the <b>focal</b> point of a larger area, which includes Vila do Conde and Esposende.|$|E
5|$|The Grade II* listed Orangery {{was once}} the {{architectural}} <b>focal</b> point of the kitchen garden complex. But when the Trust bought the property, the Orangery {{was in such a}} precarious state of deterioration that it was on English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register in the highest priority category, A.|$|E
5|$|The Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building, {{commonly}} known as Tech Tower, is a historic building and <b>focal</b> point of the central campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, Georgia, US.|$|E
5|$|The author Jim Butcher {{uses the}} coins in his Dresden Files series, {{in which each}} coin is the <b>focal</b> point of a fallen angel. This group of angels {{is known as the}} Order of the Blackened Denarius, or the Denarians.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the symptoms, for example the combination of headache, signs of raised intracranial pressure and <b>focal</b> neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and neurological abnormalities, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been excluded.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instrument}} is a refractor of 12.4inches clear aperture and of 15ft. <b>focal</b> length. The optics are by John A. Brashear of Pittsburgh and the mechanical parts by the Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland. Eyepieces provide magnification ranging from 130 to 720 power.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both <b>focal</b> and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for <b>focal</b> seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
25|$|A device which {{produces}} converging or diverging light rays due to refraction {{is known as}} a lens. Lenses are characterized by their <b>focal</b> length: a converging lens has positive <b>focal</b> length, while a diverging lens has negative <b>focal</b> length. Smaller <b>focal</b> length indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The <b>focal</b> length of a simple lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>focal</b> length f is {{positive}} for converging lenses, and negative for diverging lenses. The reciprocal of the <b>focal</b> length, 1/f, is the optical {{power of the}} lens. If the <b>focal</b> length is in metres, this gives the optical power in dioptres (inverse metres).|$|E
25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large <b>focal</b> length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its <b>focal</b> point which is adjusted to be at the <b>focal</b> point of an eyepiece of a much smaller <b>focal</b> length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the <b>focal</b> length of the objective divided by the <b>focal</b> length of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|E
25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{also affects}} electron microscopy, although instead {{of different colors}} having different <b>focal</b> points, different electron energies may have different <b>focal</b> points.|$|E
25|$|<b>Focal</b> non-epileptiform {{abnormal}} {{activity may}} occur over {{areas of the}} brain where there is <b>focal</b> damage of the cortex or white matter. It often consists of an increase in slow frequency rhythms and/or a loss of normal higher frequency rhythms. It may also appear as <b>focal</b> or unilateral decrease in amplitude of the EEG signal.|$|E
25|$|In the outmost zone of attraction, {{which extends}} {{as far away}} from the <b>focal</b> fish as it is able to sense, the <b>focal</b> fish will seek to move towards a neighbour.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{principles}} of <b>focal</b> ratio are always the same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the <b>focal</b> ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) {{is a function of}} absolute aperture area only, independent of <b>focal</b> length. The <b>focal</b> length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the <b>focal</b> plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.|$|E
25|$|Incoming {{parallel}} {{rays are}} focused by a converging lens onto a spot one <b>focal</b> length from the lens, {{on the far}} side of the lens. This is called the rear <b>focal</b> point of the lens. Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from the lens than the <b>focal</b> distance; the closer the object is to the lens, the further the image is from the lens.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{a positive}} or converging lens in air focuses a collimated beam travelling along the lens axis {{to a spot}} (known as the <b>focal</b> point) at a distance f from the lens. Conversely, a point source of light placed at the <b>focal</b> point is converted into a collimated beam by the lens. These two cases are examples of image formation in lenses. In the former case, an object at an infinite distance (as represented by a collimated beam of waves) is focused to an image at the <b>focal</b> point of the lens. In the latter, an object at the <b>focal</b> length distance from the lens is imaged at infinity. The plane perpendicular to the lens axis situated at a distance f from the lens is called the <b>focal</b> plane.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{power of}} {{corrective}} lenses {{is measured in}} diopters, a value equal to the reciprocal of the <b>focal</b> length measured in metres; with a positive <b>focal</b> length corresponding to a converging lens and a negative <b>focal</b> length corresponding to a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for astigmatism as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, {{and one for the}} angle of orientation of the astigmatism.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>focal</b> dystonias {{have been}} proven treatable through {{movement}} retraining in the Taubman approach, {{particularly in the case}} of musicians. However other <b>focal</b> dystonias may not respond and may even be made worse by this treatment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>focal</b> length {{value is}} not {{required}} when comparing two lenses of the same <b>focal</b> length; a value of 1 can be used instead, and the other factors can be dropped as well, leaving area proportion to the reciprocal square of the f-number N.|$|E
25|$|There were {{frequent}} {{changes and}} updating of the equipment, including {{the installation of}} 12-inch <b>focal</b> length KA-82 and 24-inch <b>focal</b> length KA-83 cameras. The infrared equipment was useful in spotting Viet Cong river traffic at night along the Mekong Delta southeast of Saigon.|$|E
25|$|Unlike DSLRs, most {{digital cameras}} lack {{the option to}} change the lens. Instead, most compact digital cameras are {{manufactured}} with a zoom lens that covers {{the most commonly used}} fields of view. Having fixed lenses, they are limited to the <b>focal</b> lengths they are manufactured with, except for what is available from attachments. Manufacturers have attempted (with increasing success) to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of <b>focal</b> length on models known as superzooms, some of which offer far longer <b>focal</b> lengths than readily available DSLR lenses.|$|E
25|$|With {{the plus}} sign, the {{derivative}} is everywhere positive, so {{that for a}} background object, the blur disk size increases with <b>focal</b> length. With the minus sign, the derivative is everywhere negative, so that for a foreground object, the blur disk size decreases with <b>focal</b> length.|$|E
25|$|Geometric unsharpness {{is caused}} by the X-ray {{generator}} not creating X-rays from a single point but rather from an area, as can be measured as the <b>focal</b> spot size. Geometric unsharpness increases proportionally to the <b>focal</b> spot size, as well as the estimated radiographic magnification factor (ERMF).|$|E
