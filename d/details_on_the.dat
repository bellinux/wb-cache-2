5|$|As {{computers}} {{offered more}} advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows.

Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{knowledge}} of the region helped him to become {{an expert on the}} West's natural history. Over the years he welcomed travelers, including those interested in natural history, to his home overlooking the Ohio River. Clark supplied <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> area's plant and animal life to John Pope and John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley's native tribes to Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related to the Mound Builders to John P. Campbell.|$|E
5|$|Jones spent 1797 {{surveying}} Pickering, Glanford, Oxford and Blenheim. His survives {{duties in}} 1798 included Burford, Lake Shore Road, the Humber River, the Grand River, Uxbridge, Gwillumbury and the de Puisaye settlement. In 1799, Jones conducted a census {{of the residents}} of Hope Township, Hamilton Township, Haldimand Township, Cramahe Township and Percy Township. The census include the names of all residents and <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conditions of their lots. That year, he also surveyed the Humber Mill Reserve, Yarmouth, Gore, Newark and Stamford.|$|E
5|$|Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all {{visited the}} tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off.

His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fate of the tomb are hazy.|$|E

5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed ureter {{and closed}} {{secondary}} ureter, the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, and the basic condition of the nervous and retractor muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E

5|$|Deparaja, {{a member}} of the royal family, {{authored}} Amaruka and a collection of romantic stories called the Sobagina Sone (1410), written {{in the form of a}} narration by the author to his wife. However, according to Kotraiah, Sobagina Sone was actually written by King Deva RayaII. The writing contains interesting <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> king's hunting expeditions and on the professional hunters who accompanied him. In 1525, Nanjunda Kavi, a feudatory prince wrote on local history, published a eulogy of prince Ramanatha (also called Kumara Rama) titled Ramanatha Charite (or Kumara Rama Sangatya) in the sangatya metre. The poem is about the prince of Kampili and his heroics at the dawn of the Muslim invasion into southern India. This work combines folk and epic literature. The protagonist rejects the advances of his stepmother, only to be condemned to death. He is rescued by a minister, but eventually achieves martyrdom fighting Muslim invaders at the capital.|$|E
5|$|<b>Details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion {{may not have been}} prompted by pressing military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{retreat of}} Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} {{than in most}} other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that {{since the collapse of}} Communism there has been a large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E

5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recommended system specifications.|$|E
5|$|The church also {{established}} ties with {{local and national}} institutions, such as administrative courts, municipalities and tax authorities. In 1996 it asked Alain Gest, {{a member of the}} French Parliamentary Commission on cults, the reason for its cult designation. In his response Gest did not provide <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> content of the work by the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux used for the report, but advised Kennel to ask the Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes for more information. On 4June1997 the church's representatives met the president of the Observatoire, prefect Antoine Guerrier de Dumast, who advised the movement to integrate the FPF to clarify the situation. The church also appealed to the European Center of Law and Justice, a Christian-oriented organization, to protect its freedom of religion and belief before the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E
