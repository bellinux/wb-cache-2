5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Aladdin, Jasmine appears in the film's two direct-to-video sequels, in both of which Larkin reprises her role as the character, with Liz Callaway {{replacing}} Salonga as her singing voice. The first, The Return of Jafar (1994), features Jasmine as she begins to question her trust in Aladdin after he defends Jafar's former pet parrot, Iago, who escapes Jafar's lamp and rescues Aladdin from bandits, hoping to make amends with the royal family. However, Iago manages to convince the princess that she still very much trusts Aladdin. Jasmine eventually befriends Iago after he helps mend her and Aladdin's relationship, frees the Genie, and ultimately risks his life to defeat Jafar, who has returned seeking vengeance. In the second, Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), Jasmine's long-awaited wedding to Aladdin is interrupted by the Forty Thieves. The Oracle, which the thieves are attempting to steal, reveals that Aladdin's father Cassim is still alive and their leader. Encouraging Aladdin to pursue his father, Jasmine agrees to postpone the wedding but can't help but worry for him during his absence. When Aladdin finally returns to Agrabah with Cassim and introduces him, Jasmine and the Sultan take an immediate liking to him. However, Cassim is soon imprisoned by the Sultan after he attempts to steal the Oracle again. Aladdin frees Cassim and accepts punishment for his actions until Jasmine convinces her father {{that he was only}} helping is father out of love. Iago returns to inform them that Cassim has been captured by Sa'luk and the remaining Thieves. Jasmine goes with Aladdin to rescue his father, and afterward they return for their wedding, which Cassim attends from the shadows. They go for a ride on Carpet, waving <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the Merchant from the first film and Iago and Cassim as they ride off. Jasmine appears in the animated television series based on the film, which originally aired from 1994 to 1995.|$|E

60|$|Joan {{made her}} <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> those old fellows in the morning, with loving embraces and many tears, {{and with a}} packed {{multitude}} for sympathizers, and they rode proudly away on their precious horses to carry their great news home. I had seen better riders, some will say that; for horsemanship was a new art to them.|$|R
25|$|Lapitch {{writes a}} letter to the Scowlers and leaves the village, wearing the piglet's boots. Although Lapitch has said <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Brewster, the dog joins him the {{following}} morning. Eventually, the two of them visit a young squirrel named Marco (Marko), who lives in a house with a blue star on its walls, and help him round up some geese that went astray while he was tending to the flock.|$|E
25|$|For {{the last}} few months of his life Leigh Fermor {{suffered}} from a cancerous tumour, and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England to say <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> his friends, and then return to die in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Storybrooke, Dr. Jekyll finds the town more {{beautiful}} than they described it to him; David and Mary Margaret take him to Granny's for a meal. Emma tells Hook she loves him, with both ready to take their relationship further. Henry prepares to say <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Violet, believing she and her father, Sir Morgan, will return to Camelot. However, Violet reveals that while {{she was born in}} Camelot, her father is from Connecticut, but fell into a portal to Camelot at one point; thus they will remain in the Real World. Happy to hear this, Henry shares a kiss with Violet.|$|E
50|$|The Mandarin {{dubbed version}} of the film {{featured}} a different theme song {{to that of the}} Cantonese version. The theme song sounded familiar to the main theme of Way of the Dragon. This version also included the scene where Billy and Ann share their <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> Jim. The Cantonese dubbed version shows the commonly found scene where Billy is arrested by the police.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the book, Bod is [...] "about 15" [...] and is slowly losing the Freedom of the Graveyard and even his ability to see ghosts. At {{the end of the}} book, Silas gives Bod some money and a {{passport}} with the name of Nobody Owens. Bod says his <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> his family and friends and leaves the graveyard to embark on a new life.|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} Hong Kong version, the fight with Ji Han-jae is included (during {{the middle of}} the film though), whilst the ending did not show Billy Lo being arrested. Instead, both he and Ann share their <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> Jim as they appear to depart Hong Kong on a boat. The Singaporean version ended with Billy's arrest, and it did not feature the Ji Han-jae fight. This is the version commonly found in Chinese.|$|R
25|$|Charly García and Nito Mestre {{decided it}} was time to quit Sui Generis, almost as if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most {{important}} acoustic rock band saying <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.|$|E
500|$|..... {{last words}} {{were to say}} <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Jukes and thank him for his kindness, and just before the white cap was pulled over his face he said, [...] "Remerciez, Madame Forget." [...] meaning [...] "thank, Ms. Forget".|$|E
500|$|Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times writes, [...] "There {{were a lot}} {{of great}} records by female singers {{in the early days of}} rock... None, however, {{reflected}} the authority and command that we associate with rock 'n' roll today as much as [...] key early hits". Some of Cher's early songs discuss subjects rarely addressed in American popular music such as divorce, prostitution, unplanned and underaged pregnancy, and racism. According to AllMusic's Joe Viglione, the 1972 single [...] "The Way of Love" [...] is [...] "either about a woman expressing her love for another woman, or a woman saying au revoir to a gay male she loved" [...] ("What will you do/When he sets you free/Just the way that you/Said <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> me"). Her ability to carry both male and female ranges allowed her to sing solo in androgynous and gender-neutral songs.|$|E
60|$|The doomed {{children}} {{answered with}} a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked {{at each other and}} rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the subject}} was changed, {{and a few minutes}} later the cadets bid the girls <b>good-bye,</b> {{promising}} <b>to</b> see them again if possible in the near future.|$|R
25|$|The Park's {{grandeur}} {{has attracted}} millions, included {{among them are}} names known around the world such as the Kennedy family, Harry Truman, General Omar Bradley, Winston Churchill, and J. P. Morgan. The Hialeah Park Race Track also holds the dual distinction of being an Audubon Bird Sanctuary due to its famous pink flamingos and being listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The famous aviator Amelia Earhart in 1937 said her final <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> the continental U.S. from Hialeah as she left on her ill-fated flight {{around the world in}} 1937.|$|R
500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} the song only on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, {{where it was}} the closing song of the set list. The staging of the performances {{was inspired by the}} 1971 science fiction film, A Clockwork Orange. The shows featured an introductory verse from [...] "Family Affair" [...] by Sly and the Family Stone. Madonna wore an all-black ensemble involving a cage vest, the longline bra, skintight shorts, knee-pads and a bowler hat. Her getup was a nod to actress Liza Minnelli in the film Cabaret. The performance started with her dancers appearing on the stage, with chairs on their back. Madonna appeared in their middle and started doing push-ups on the stage. She started singing [...] "Family Affair", then midway through the song, changed to [...] "Keep It Together". During the intermediate music, Madonna and her dancers performed an intricate choreography with the chairs. At the end, all the musicians, dancers and collaborators came to say <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Madonna. The singer was left alone on stage to finish with a powerful repeat of her line [...] "Keep people together forever and ever".|$|E
500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in July 1914 Gleeson volunteered for service with the British Army, one of only 17 priests to do so. He was commissioned as a Chaplain to the Forces, 4th Class (equivalent to a Captain) the Army Chaplains' Department on 18 November 1914 and was soon serving with the 2nd battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers on the Western Front in France. The battalion, regular troops who formed part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division, were amongst the first British troops to be deployed to France, seeing action during the Battle of Mons, and after Gleeson joined them they participated in the First Battle of Ypres. British officer and poet Robert Graves recalled in his autobiography <b>Good-Bye</b> <b>to</b> All That that during this battle Gleeson found himself the only unwounded officer of the battalion and, having removed his chaplain's insignia that indicated his non-combatant status, took command of the unit and held until relieved. [...] Later in December that year he joined the battalion in a counterattack at the Battle of Givenchy. [...] On Christmas Day the Munsters were in part of the front line unaffected by the Christmas Truce and Gleeson chose to conduct a Mass in one of the front line trenches that was frequently under fire. [...] The mass was in memory of the seven officers and 200 men of the Munsters who had died in a failed attack on 22 December.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, SU fans said <b>good-bye</b> forever <b>to</b> the {{historic}} stadium. Archbold was demolished {{to make way}} for the new on-campus facility, the Carrier Dome, which opened in 1980.|$|R

The Jeffersons premiered the following week, on January 18, 1975.|$|E
2500|$|If an {{opposing}} player fouls {{out of the}} game, the fans will [...] "wave the wheat", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the disqualified player, {{to the tune of}} [...] "You Didn't Have Your Wheaties", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting Wheaties breakfast cereal. The same waving motion to the tune of [...] "A Hot Time in the Old Town" [...] follows a Jayhawk victory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1750s Elizabeth's health started to decline. She began {{to suffer a}} series of dizzy spells and refused to take the {{prescribed}} medicines. She forbade the word [...] "death" [...] in her presence. Knowing she was dying, Elizabeth used her last remaining strength to make her confession, to recite with her confessor the prayer for the dying and to say <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> those few people who wished {{to be with her}} including Peter and Catherine and Counts Alexei and Kirill Razumovsky. Finally on 5 January 1762 the Empress died. She was buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 3 February 1762 after six weeks lying in state.|$|E
50|$|The soldier {{says his}} final <b>good-byes</b> <b>to</b> Palaestrio and Philocomasium, {{and goes back}} inside to meet Acroteleutium. Just then he is ambushed by Periplectomenus, and his cook Cario. The two men begin to beat him for trying to make {{advances}} on a married woman. Pyrgopolynices begs them to stop; eventually giving the men a hundred drachmae to halt their punches. The men leave the beaten soldier to his own accord; suddenly Sceledrus enters and lets the soldier know what really happened. Pyrgopolynices realized he has been tricked, but does not seem upset about the whole ordeal. The play {{comes to an end}} when he tells the audience to applaud.|$|R

60|$|She was always, as I say, being rescued {{and being}} borne away, and being parted, and {{reaching}} {{out her arms}} to France and to Spain, and saying <b>good-bye</b> forever <b>to</b> Valladolid or the old grey towers of Hohenbranntwein.|$|R
2500|$|Gordon {{had fallen}} in love with Jane Bridges, a girl, aged 17 who was able to tell the story 60 years {{afterwards}} to his biographers. Gordon did not declare his love until he came to say <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> her before leaving for Australia on 7 August 1853. [...] "With characteristic recklessness he offered to sacrifice the passage he had taken to Australia, and all his father's plans for giving him a fresh start in life, if she would tell him not to go, or promise to be his wife, or even give him some hope." [...] This she could not do, though she liked the shy handsome boy and remembered him with affection to the end of a long life. It was the one romance of Gordon's life.|$|E
2500|$|The day {{his term}} expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese {{authorities}} {{to be made}} docent of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but {{had to wait until}} 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics. The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated mannequins only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as saying <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> his former friends and colleagues, a move that may have offended them. According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was [...] "unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment".|$|E
2500|$|He {{composed}} hymns in the Greenlandic language, {{which were}} published in 1909, 1930, 1937, and 1945. The second issue of a Greenlandic songbook, Erinarssûtit features his first published poetry, including [...] "Upernalermat" [...] or [...] "As Spring Is Coming." [...] Later issues of this songbook include more of his poetry–some secular in nature. His poems can be classified as epic or didactic. One poem, [...] "Igdlugssaq Nápagaungmat" [...] or [...] "When the House Was Built," [...] details the seemingly minor event of constructing a home in Angmagssalik. While not overtly heroic, this action will be useful and demonstrated community affection. In [...] "Nunat Asingagingmata" [...] or [...] "When the Countries Again Turned Pale," [...] Lund writes: [...] "We will soon see the country covered with snow, dressed in the garment of the sorrow, and crying in the storm after having bidden <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> all the small birds." ...|$|E
