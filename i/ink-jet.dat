The average efficiency of ∼ 18. 96 % on 80 ohm/square ion implanted emitter with highest efficiency of 19. 2 % demonstrates {{the potential of}} combining the two high precision technologies, inkjet printing and ion implantation. The key attributes of the cells include average open circuit voltage (VOC) of 640 mV, fill factor (FF) of 79. 14 % and short circuit current density (JSC) of 37. 8 mA/cm 2. Worthy of note is that, the front gridlines width and height of 47. 6 μm and 43. 9 μm resulting in aspect ratio of 0. 92 using only 83 mg total Ag, which is, at least 20 % Ag less than today's screen printed cells. However, the reference screen-printed cells showed similar average efficiency with the best gridline widths of ∼ 70 μm and height of ∼ 28 μm used > 100 mg of Ag.

25|$|Counterfeiting is {{measured}} using a system borrowed from chemistry known as {{parts per million}} (PPM). Normally used to judge the potency of molecules in a solution, PPM in the counterfeit sense refers {{to the number of}} fake banknotes found in circulation for every one million genuine notes. In 1990, Canada's counterfeit ratio was just 4 PPM, ranking its currency among the most secure in the world. By the late 1990s, the rise of powerful and affordable home computers, store-bought graphics software, easy-to-use scanners and colour <b>ink-jet</b> printers were breeding a new generation of counterfeiters. The number of fake Canadian bills rose as high as 117 PPM by 1997. In 2004 Canada’s counterfeit rate had ballooned to 470 PPM. In 2012, the counterfeiting rate had fallen to its lowest point, at 28 PPM. It has since started modestly rising to 36 PPM in 2014. The Bank of Canada's MTP (Medium Term Plan) target to stay below is 30 PPM. Most G20 nations used 50 PPM as their benchmark to stay below.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the study in}} the field of microheaters on flexible substrates. The idea of using flexible substrates comes together with the need for low manufacturing costs, having in mind the applications of sensors for home usage and other possible applications as monitors for buildings or basements where possible toxic gases can be accumulated, for instance mathane, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. In the current paper we propose the use of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) as active heating element. The data from literature and our previous experiments have proven that this material can be used as resistive material having the possibility to operate within the desired range of temperatures for sensor applications, between 80 and 100 °C.

Further, we assess the electrical response of NW networks obtained using a mask of SiO 2 NWs <b>ink-jetted</b> from solution. The resulting conformal network etched into the underlying wafer is monolithic, with single-crystalline bulk junctions; thus no difference in conductivity is seen between a direct NW bridge and a percolating network. We also extend the potential of NWL into the third dimension, by using a periodic undercutting that produces an array of vertically stacked NWs from a single NW mask...|$|R

The key mechanical properties for embossing tools are compression and wear rate. To this end, commercially available engineering grade photopolymer materials were characterised in terms of compression and wear using ASTM D 695 and ASTM G 99 standards respectively.

The results have shown that the current capabilities of PEDOT:PSS organic conductive tracks are limited by the dissipated power, due to relatively large resistance.

30|$|In this work, we {{successfully}} demonstrated the new fabrication method for fabricating 3 D electrodes by a metal inkjet printing and selective FC film patterning. FC film patterning was very effective at making ink-phobic boundaries to prevent droplets from spreading after the Ag inkjet printing. Ag ink successfully spread and was trapped {{only on the}} Au surface without FC film, while the FC films acted {{as a barrier to}} prevent the over-spreading after the <b>ink-jetting</b> process. The overall morphology resulted in a dented rectangle with rounded corners due to the coffee ring effect and the thickness of the Ag electrode is non-uniform. However, we could control the thickness of an electrode by regulating the overlap-rate of the inkjet jetting and the number of metal inkjet droplets. The DEP performance of the inkjet-printed Ag electrodes was examined using the 4  μm polystyrene beads and AC drive voltage control. We could confirm that more beads were trapped on the 3 D electrodes than on the planar electrodes because a large amount of the beads could be spatially exposed to the high electric field in a 3 D electrode system. For future research, we need to improve the morphology of the printed structure by controlling printing conditions such as substrate temperature, surface wettability, and ink vapor pressure.|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic {{devices have}} {{applications}} in chemical analysis, biomedical devices and <b>ink-jets</b> 1. An integrated microfluidic system incorporates electrical signals on-chip. Such electro-microfluidic devices require fluidic and electrical connection to larger packages. Therefore electrical and fluidic packaging of electro-microfluidic devices {{is key to}} the development of integrated microfluidic systems. Packaging is more challenging for surface micromachined devices than for larger bulk micromachined devices. However, because surface micromachining allows incorporation of electrical traces during microfluidic channel fabrication, a monolithic device results. A new architecture for packaging surface micromachined electro-microfluidic devices is presented. This architecture relies on two scales of packaging to bring fluid to the device scale (picoliters) from the macroscale (microliters). The architecture emulates and utilizes electronics packaging technology. The larger package consists of a circuit board with embedded fluidic channels and standard fluidic connectors. The embedded channels connect to the smaller package, an Electro-Microfluidic Dual-Inline-Package (EMDIP) that takes fluid to the microfluidic integrated circuit (MIC). The fluidic connection is made {{to the back of the}} MIC through Bosch 2 etched holes that take fluid to surface micromachined channels on the front of the MIC.

In particular, printing semiconductor devices using liquid materials is considered to be important for new applications, such as large-area flexible displays. Recent research has been focused on organic semiconductors^, which have mobilities comparable to that of amorphous silicon (α-Si) ^ 11, but are insufficiently reliable.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} electrochromic and conducting polymers and devices thereof. Chapter 3 : An ion storage layer, poly(thieno[3, 4 - b]thiophene), {{was used in}} the assembly of electrochromic devices (ECDs). Its high-doping level and low-absorption in the visible region in both its oxidized and neutral states makes it an ideal candidate for use as an ion shuttling layer in ECDs. This layer did not distort ECD color, nor does it have a yellowed tint to it (as some previous materials) that may distort vision over time. The characterization of a novel substituted 3, 4 -propylenedioxythiophene, 1, 3 -dimethyl (1, 3 -DM-ProDOT), is also presented. Chapter 4 : The precursor polymer method, which imparts solubility and processability to electrochromic precursors, allowed for the preparation of electrochromics inside assembled solid-state devices. The same polymeric material can be made through in situ conversion (oxidation inside an assembled device) as via solution methods (ex situ conversion via electrochemical or chemical oxidation), saving a step in device preparation. Clean substrates were not needed for this method, removing another step in device production. A study of the effects of precursor film thickness, gel electrolyte composition (including the use of ionic liquids), and comparison to traditionally assembled (ex situ) devices is illustrated therein. These precursor polymers have also been <b>ink-jetted,</b> expanding their utility to a large variety of complex electronics. Further, the use of these materials to prepare easily-assembled electrochromic sunglasses is discussed. The in situ method was also extended to using monomers inside of the electrolyte and electropolymerization thereof. This method offers a simpler still method for ECD assembly. This system was studied with respect to higher contrasts and unique patterning abilities, as well as for a variety of chromophores. Chapter 5 : A new side-chain based precursor polymer was developed using a single pendant heterocycle. This represents a simpler synthetic route to soluble side-chain precursor polymers. As a comparison, a trimeric unit composed of this single heterocycle attached to a central thiophene unit is also incorporated into the side chain precursor polymer method. Films of both are compared with respect to conversion conditions, electrochromic properties, and ease of synthetic procedure. Further, electrospun nanofibers of the single-heterocycle pendant material were prepared and studied, showing higher contrasts. Chapter 6 : Aqueous conversion of a precursor polymer to an electrochromic was accomplished and investigated towards greener processing for conjugated polymers. It is shown that the material which is obtained by conversion in aqueous electrolyte is identical, or nearly identical, to that prepared using conventional, organic electrolytes (based upon spectral and colorimetric data). Both side-chain and main-chain precursor polymers are converted via this method, which involved pre-loading of a salt into the prepared film prior to oxidative conversion to the conjugated material. Chapter 7 : Fabric-based electrochromic devices were developed, using a new device design. These devices do not require the use of a popular electrode material, indium-doped tin oxide (ITO), in their construction. Reflective ECDs were built with these fabrics, representing a significant step towards the realization of wearable displays. Stainless steel woven meshes are used, as well as PEDOT-PSS loaded spandex. Several device architectures have been described, allowing for two-sided displays to be envisioned. Further, the use of carbon black loaded poly(caprolactone) (CB-PCL) films as a counter electrode for these spandex devices was also achieved, showing the versatility of electrode systems that could be used with this system. A study of the effects of underlying substrate color on the electrochromic was also undertaken. Chapter 8 : A new template, sulfonated poly(amic acid), was used to prepare PEDOT dispersions (PEDOT-SPAA). Previous work with a colleague has shown that DNA can also template polymerize EDOT to PEDOT, resulting in biocompatible and bioactive films. This template system was chosen to enhance the overall thermal stability of the conducting polymer. Conversion of the SPAA template to the imide form, SPI, resulted in high thermal stability as compared to conventionally prepared and commercially available PEDOT-PSS. Enhanced conductivity (10 -fold enhancement) has been observed, without doping, upon conversion to the imide (PEDOT-SPI), resulting from the morphological changes that result from this conversion. Further expansion of this work includes the use of a different conducting polymer (poly(aniline) [PANi] and poly(pyrrole) [PPy]), a different template material (sulfonated Kapton© type amides and imides), as well as an exploration of the potential use of a variety of thermally stable dopants as compared to traditional systems used with PEDOT-PSS. ...|$|R
