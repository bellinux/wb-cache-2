40|$|M. Comm. South Africa has {{experienced}} {{a long period of}} high unemployment. While the economy has achieved relatively higher GDP growth rates in the recent past, unfortunately not as many jobs have been created. This is because of, amongst other constraints, the skills shortage experienced. This shortage of skills is not solely the result of the emigration of professionals since the inception of the new political dispensation in 1994. This paper investigated the economic sectors showing high growth, with a view of identifying the sectors that can be promoted for high investment and hence the creation of employment for the country’s labour force. The secondary and the tertiary sectors have been found to contributing more to the country’s GDP growth and could create more employment opportunities if promoted by more investment. However, the unemployment experienced is mainly structural in nature and the country should concentrate on human capital development and skills development to reduce it. The education of the labour force in South Africa {{has been found to be}} concentrated in the secondary level. This has raised questions as to the ability of the country’s education system to fulfil its role of empowering the labour force.

The current study is a descriptive study, describing the epidemiology of sharp object fatalities {{in the city of}} East London (also known as Buffalo City) in South Africa. It is a secondary data analysis of mortuary data collected by morticians trained in data collection methods according to World Health Organisation standards. This descriptive study aimed to develop the profile of sharp object fatalities in East London. Most of the findings were consistent with other literature on sharp object violence/homicide and on homicide in general using rates per population denominator data. It also combined variables to arrive at more complex descriptions. The following risk factors were identified: male, between the ages 30 - 34, being from a <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>group,</b> alcohol consumption, weekend, between the times 20 h 00 and 23 h 59 and if we discount the place of death, 'unknown' then the greatest percentage of deaths occurred in a private house. The results were interpreted within an ecological and contextual theoretical framework to hypothesize possible etiological factors. The conclusion was that there were multiple variables which all interact and influence one another across all ecological levels and as other studies have recommended, this study too also recommends that more work is needed in order to identify the multiple pathways leading to fatalities, perhaps by way of multivariate studies as well as qualitative studies with perpetrators of sharp object fatalities.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} a study on urban housing {{upgrading}} in China. The main objective {{is to look at}} upgrading, which has been widely used in many developing countries, as an alternative approach to solving the existing urban housing problems in China. It is argued that these problems are caused by two main factors: first, the unequal distribution system, under which, public housing can hardly reach those who lack access. Since most of this <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>group</b> resides in old city neighborhoods, an effective housing upgrading program for these areas will effectively solve the overall housing problems. Second, the undergoing housing commercialization reform does little to help the disadvantaged group, because most urban residents cannot afford expensive commodity housing units. Therefore, a new approach is needed to break through the conventional housing system. China can learn valuable lessens from the international experience on providing low-cost housing to the urban poor. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the basic housing background is introduced aiming at better understanding of what are the fundamental factors causing the housing problem; who suffer from these problems; and why upgrading is the crucial issue. The second part is to review the international upgrading experience in many developing countries. The valuable experiences on dealing with issues, such as affordability standard, self-help and effective management are what China lacks and should learn from the international paradigm. In the third part, the main focus of the thesis, I will examine the feasibility of applying the upgrading strategy in China. Based on some detailed analysis, A self-help and lowcost upgrading program will be developed. The suggested strategies involve a series changes on housing policy, design attitude, financial arrangement, as well as institutions. by Fang He. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers on the economics of public policy. The first chapter of the thesis provides a selective overview of the existing political economy literature. The second chapter analyzes {{the relationship between the}} political representation afforded to members of a <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>group</b> and public policies. The starting point of the analysis is the observation that disadvantaged groups tend also to constitute population minorities. The chapter examines the success of an electoral law which enhances the political power of a minority group by reserving seats for them in legislatures in promoting minority interests. It develops a theoretical model of the political process to analyze the policy impact of such a law. It also takes advantage of the existence of such a law in India to empirically test this prediction. Chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis turn to an analysis {{of the relationship between the}} control rights given to a government and policy outcomes. Chapter 3 examines the relationship between a government's redistributive preference and its ability to provide a public good-information. To do so, it develops a model in which a group of heterogenous individuals have to make private investment and labour supply decisions while relying on the government for information about investment returns. The government {{consists of}} an elected citizen who chooses a redistributive strategy in addition to providing information. The chapter identifies reasons why redistributive motives may limit the possibility of credible information transmission by elected governments and lead to under-exploitation of profitable investment opportunities. Chapter 4 of the thesis turns to an analysis of some of the economic and political determinants of industrialisation in underdeveloped agrarian economies. It develops a simple model of an economy in which industrialisation may be inhibited by an investment co-ordination failure amongst landowners. It then examines the possibility of government-led coordination of investment activity. The chapter identifies reasons why the possibility of successful coordination of investment activity on the part of elected governments is sensitive both to the economy's underlying income distribution and to the set of policy instruments available to the government...|$|E

40|$|Targeting {{patients}} for multimorbid care management interventions requires accurate and comprehensive assessment of patients' {{need in order}} to direct resources to those who need and can benefit from them the most.

This ambiguity can potentially result in inequitable selection, as biases in selection may differentially affect patients from <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups.</b> Patient selection could in principal be performed in three ways: physician referral, patient screening surveys, or by statistical prediction algorithms. This paper discusses equity issues related to each method. We conclude that each method may result in inequitable selection and bias, such as physicians' attentiveness or familiarity, or prediction models' reliance on prior resource use, potentially affected by socio-cultural and economic barriers.

However, South Africa fares poorly in the World Health Organization’s ranking of health system performance, while spending {{a large proportion of}} its Gross Domestic Product on health care, suggesting that inequities in health opportunities and outcomes remain.

40|$|AbstractNew Zealand's Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC) {{has been}} highly {{successful}} in facilitating affordable access to medicines {{through a combination}} of aggressive price negotiations, innovative procurement mechanisms, and careful evaluation of value for money. Recently the US government, through the establishment of a series of bilateral and plurilateral “free” trade agreements, has attempted to constrain the pharmaceutical access programs of other countries in order to promote the interests of the pharmaceutical industry. The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) represents the latest example; through the TPPA the US is seeking to eliminate therapeutic reference pricing, introduce appeals processes for pharmaceutical companies to challenge formulary listing and pricing decisions, and introduce onerous disclosure and “transparency” provisions that facilitate industry involvement in decision-making around coverage and pricing of medicines (and medical devices). This paper argues that the US agenda, if successfully prosecuted, would be likely to increase costs and reduce access to affordable medicines for New Zealanders.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{relative}} income hypothesis {{by considering the}} relationship between mortality, income and relative deprivation in South Africa using individual-level data on income and five measures of relative deprivation each with a different reference group. We find that income tends to be protective of, and relative deprivation detrimental to health, but the latter often gives a better account of mortality than does income alone. For some <b>population</b> <b>groups</b> the fit is improved in specifications which include both income and relative deprivation. Overall, {{there seems to be}} solid evidence in support of the relative income hypothesis, particularly for the more economically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups.</b> Relative deprivation is especially significant when age is the reference group, suggesting that the comparison of socio-economic standing that has an impact on health tends to happen within cohorts.

While {{little is known about the}} mechanisms underlying the effect of relative deprivation on health and mortality, the consistent evidence in favor of age as a reference group, particularly in a context like South Africa's suggests that intra-cohort comparisons should be an avenue for more in depth investigation.

This paper is the concluding paper for a series of reviews {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} interventions for improving adolescent health and well-being. In this paper, we summarize the evidence evaluated in the previous papers and suggest areas where there is enough existing evidence to recommend implementation and areas where further research is needed to reach consensus. Potentially effective interventions for adolescent health and well-being include interventions for adolescent sexual and reproductive health, micronutrient supplementation, nutrition interventions for pregnant adolescents, interventions to improve vaccine uptake among adolescents, and interventions for substance abuse. Majority of the evidence for improving immunization coverage, substance abuse, mental health, and accidents and injury prevention comes from high-income countries. Future studies should specifically be targeted toward the low- and middle-income countries with long term follow-up and standardized and validated measurement instruments to maximize comparability of results. Assessment of effects by gender and socioeconomic status is also important as there may be differences in the effectiveness of certain interventions.

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{practice}} {{guidelines are}} developed {{to improve the}} quality of healthcare. However, clinical guidelines may contribute to health inequities experienced by disadvantaged groups. This study uses an equity lens developed by the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) to examine how well clinical guidelines address inequities experienced by individuals with intellectual disabilities. Methods Nine health problems relevant to the health inequities experienced by persons with intellectual disabilities were selected. Clinical guidelines on these disorders were identified from across the world. The INCLEN equity lens was used as the basis for a purpose-designed, semistructured data collection tool. Two raters independently examined each guideline and completed the data collection tool. The data extracted by each rater were discussed at a research group consensus conference and agreement was reached on a final equity lens rating for each guideline. Results Thirty-six guidelines were identified, one of which (2. 8 %) explicitly excluded persons with intellectual disabilities. Of the remaining 35, six (17. 1 %) met the first criterion of the equity lens, identifying persons with intellectual disabilities at high risk for the specific health problem. Eight guidelines (22. 9 %) contained any content on intellectual disabilities. Six guidelines addressed the fourth equity lens criterion, by giving specific consideration to the barriers to implementation of the guideline in <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>populations.</b> There were no guidelines that addressed the second, third, and fifth equity lens criteria. Conclusions The equity lens is a useful tool to systematically examine whether clinical guidelines address the health needs and inequities experienced by disadvantaged groups. Clinical guidelines are likely to further widen the health inequities experienced by persons with intellectual disabilities, and other disadvantaged groups, by being preferentially advantageous to the general population. There is a need to systematically incorporate methods to consider <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups</b> into the processes used to develop clinical guidelines. </p...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was to}} consider changes in smoking prevalence, exposure to secondhand smoke and tobacco advertising, as well as tobacco-related knowledge by gender and education groups in Ukraine after the implementation of tobacco control policies since 2006. METHODS: Prevalence of daily smoking was compared in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Data on tobacco awareness, exposure to SHS and tobacco advertising were available from the surveys conducted in 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: The decline in smoking prevalence in 2005 - 2010 was similar for men and women with different levels of education. Men with university education have lower smoking rates than other men. Women with less than secondary education had the lowest smoking rates which keep consistently low over time. Secondhand smoke and tobacco advertising exposure declined similarly across gender and education. Knowledge about tobacco-related health hazards increased more substantially in lower educated groups. CONCLUSIONS: All demographic groups in Ukraine revealed decline in smoking prevalence, exposure to SHS and the tobacco advertising as well as increase of tobacco-related health knowledge in response to tobacco control policies. Lower educated groups were more responsive to tobacco control policies than it was expected based on findings from high-income countries. In such countries as Ukraine comprehensive tobacco control measures are beneficial for all social groups and could lead to quick decline in prevalence of active and passive smoking...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use geo-coded, {{individual}} level register data on four European countries to compute comparative measures of segregation that {{are independent of}} existing geographical sub- divisions. The focus is on non-European migrants, and using aggregates for egocentric neighbourhoods with different population counts, small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale segregation patterns are assessed. At the smallest scale level, corresponding to neighbourhoods with 200 persons, patterns of over- and under-representation are strikingly similar. At larger scale levels, Belgium stands out as having relatively strong over- and under-representation. More than 55 % of the Belgian population lives in large-scale neighbourhoods with moderate under- or over- representation of non-European migrants. In the other countries, the corresponding figures are between 30 % and 40 %. Possible explanations for this pattern are differences in housing policies and refugee placement policies. Sweden has the largest and Denmark the smallest non-European migrant population, in relative terms. Thus, in both migrant-dense and native-born dense areas, Swedish neighbourhoods have a higher concentration, and Denmark a lower concentration of non- European migrants than the other countries. For large-scale, migrant-dense neighbourhoods, however, levels of concentration are similar in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

Sound knowledge about progress made in prevention of oral and chronic disease and in health promotion may assist countries to implement effective public health programmes to the benefit of the poor and <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups</b> worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} the socio-economic differentials {{in the quality}} (clinical and interpersonal) of antenatal care and also the correlation between differentials in the quality and utilization of antenatal care. Design. The study uses cross-sectional, nationally representative data from National Family Health Survey (1998 – 99). Setting. Four south Indian states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and four north Indian states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh). Main outcomes measured. More than four antenatal care visits for utilization, and index of clinical, information and inter-personal quality of care. Results. Lower than desired quality of antenatal care was observed in both north and south Indian states, though the quality was significantly better in south India compared with north India, especially among the disadvantaged women. Significant socio-economic differentials {{in the quality of}} care were evident in both north and south India, but were more glaring in north India. A significantly positive relationship was observed between the quality and utilization of antenatal care in the rural areas from village-level multivariate analysis. Discussion. Poor quality of antenatal care is likely to reduce its utilization. Policy and program interventions {{to improve the quality of}} care of antenatal care, especially for the poor and other <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups,</b> more so in north India, are essential to improve maternal health outcomes. The India’s National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), launched in 2005, should lay greater emphasis on improving the quality of antenatal care, among other things, to increase utilization of antenatal care and achieve better maternal health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Intersectionality against intersection. Is {{the notion}} of {{intersectionality}} doomed to {{being part of the}} problem it designates? Intersectionality theory was not developed to merely point at intersections but to capture subject positions made invisible by dominant systems of normative representation. It shined the spotlight on processes that reduce <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups</b> to the particular experience of the least oppressed among category members, making other members appear as if they were at the intersection with another group. Rather than dividing between complex and simple oppressions, intersectionality theory thus invites us to reject the intersectional metaphor and problematize every subject position as complex. Yet, abstract categories and asymmetrical constructions of complexity carry real-life challenges for the individuals and groups concerned. But how can these challenges be described in the language of intersectionality without reinforcing the asymmetry? The article examines this conundrum both in the social scientific sphere of analytic description and in the normative sphere of political strategizing. We first briefly trace the history of intersectionality theory as a critique of hierarchies of representativeness both in social movements and in antidiscrimination jurisprudence. Second, we examine the social scientific challenge of describing concrete situations in the language of intersectionality without attributing intersection to the groups affected by it. Finally, we return to politics by examining the limits of turning intersectionality, originally a critique of political domination, into a positive political program, in particular if the latter would {{take the form of a}} universalistic imperative for all emancipation movements to give the same priority to all issues all the time...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} socio-cultural and reproductive health correlates {{of knowledge about}} AIDS among rural women using multivariate analysis of 1998 – 1999 National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data from two Indian states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where the urban HIV prevalence is relatively high. Analysis using multiple logistic regression was undertaken, modelling women's knowledge of AIDS, of whether the disease can be avoided, and of effective means of protection. Although 47 % of all rural women in Maharashtra were aware of AIDS only about 28 % knew that one can avoid it, and only about 16 % possessed correct knowledge about its transmission. In Tamil Nadu, where overall 82 % of rural women had awareness of AIDS, about 71 % knew that one can avoid the disease but only about 31 % possessed correct knowledge about its transmission. In both states, women from socially and economically backward groups had lower odds both of having awareness of AIDS and knowledge of ways to avoid getting the disease. Associations with socio-cultural and reproductive variables {{and the impact of}} contact with family planning services differed in the two states. The spread of the epidemic to rural areas presents a need actively to disseminate AIDS related knowledge for health protection rather than waiting for knowledge to follow the appearance of the disease in communities. Approaches to health promotion that do not consider differing contextual factors are unlikely to succeed. In particular, innovative strategies to disseminate knowledge among <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups</b> are needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{attendance}} {{rates of}} welfare recipients at self-help group meetings was compared when supplementary reinforcement was given for attending {{and when it}} was not. Reinforcers included donated items, such as clothing and household goods, and information about welfare services. It was found that the attendance at meetings averaged three recipients per meeting without reinforcement and 15 recipients per meeting with reinforcement. There was evidence that attendance was associated with participation in other self-help activities. It was concluded that practical forms of reinforcement can be found to maintain the participation of severely <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>populations</b> in self-help <b>groups...</b>|$|R

This mixed-methods study compares the travel patterns of low-income immigrants living in the San Francisco Bay Area with that of other groups and investigates the barriers and constraints faced by low-income immigrants when taking transit and bicycling. Much of the previous work on immigrant travel has relied on national surveys and qualitative analysis, which underrepresent <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> <b>groups</b> and slower modes of travel, or are unable to speak to broader patterns in the population. We conducted interviews with 14 low-income immigrants and a paper-based intercept survey of 2, 078 adults. Interviewees revealed five major barriers that made public transit use difficult for them, including safety, transit fare affordability, discrimination, system legibility, and reliability. Although crime was the most prominent issue in interviews, the survey results suggest transit cost is the most pressing concern for low-income immigrants. Low-income immigrants were less likely than those with higher-incomes to have access to a motor vehicle, and were less likely than higher-income immigrants or the U. S. -born of any income to have access to a bicycle or bus pass. Finally, although most barriers to public transit use were the same regardless of nativity or household income, low-income immigrants were much less willing to take public transit when they had the option to drive and less willing to bicycle for any purpose. The prevalence of concerns about transit affordability, crime, and reliability suggest transit agencies should consider income-based fare reductions, coordinated crime prevention with local law enforcement, and improved scheduling...|$|R
