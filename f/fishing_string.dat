40|$|The Common whelk, Buccinum undatum (L.) is a {{conspicuous}} benthic scavenger in Irish waters, {{and is a}} valuable fisheries resource in South East Ireland. B. undatum is fished {{in many parts of}} its range, and previous studies have shown that certain life history parameters, which vary with location, make this species vulnerable to overexploitation. This makes research into each exploited stock essential to ensure sustainable fisheries management of the species. In 2003, interest in B. undatum as a complementary species in the inshore fishery east of the Inishowen Peninsula, North West Ireland, initiated investigation into fisheries related biological and population aspects of the species in this region. The current study presents estimates of spatial variation and density of the stock, size at age and growth rates, size and age at onset of sexual maturity, and timing of reproductive events in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery for the period of June 2003 to May 2004. Analysis of variance of the total shell length of whelk landings to the fishery was conducted over spatial scales of fishing pot, <b>fishing</b> <b>string</b> and landings to vessels. Landings varied significantly in shell length at the spatial scale at which whelks are attracted to baited pots, but did not vary significantly over larger spatial scales. Depletion estimates of stock density from fisheries derived Catch per Unit Effort data and a mark re-capture experiment estimate 0. 134 - 0. 227 whelks per m 2. Two independent methods of age determination found similar growth logistics functions for B. undatum. Modal analysis of length frequency distribution of landings to the fishery estimated symptotic length, Leo = 151. 64 mm and Brody growth coefficient, K = 0. 04. Analysis of the striae in individual opercula, where each stria was found to represent annual growth, estimated Loo = 137. 73 mm and K = 0. 12. Common whelks in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery grow slowly and are long-lived, with 19 opercula striae recorded in one individual. Onset of sexual maturity is late, and no sex-specific differences in size or age at maturity were determined in the present study. Males were found to achieve sexual maturity at 83. 30 ± 10. 77 mm, and 8. 9 - 11. 1 years of age, and females at 82. 62 ± 10. 68 mm and 8. 8 to 11. 1 years of age. Systematic observations of reproductive events, including histological changes to the female ovary and male testis, and changes in the size and mass of body components, suggest that breeding occurred between the autumn and winter months of October and December 2003. Biological aspects of B. undatum in the study region are compared with previous studies from other regions, and discussed in relation to sustainable management of the fishery...|$|E

5000|$|... "Fish Music" [...] was an idea {{conceived}} when Richards was a student. Fish {{swimming in}} a tank become musical notation {{by means of a}} five line musical stave being placed across the glass. String players are instructed to choose a fish and follow its course behind the stave. A revised version in which a team of improvisers with backs turned to the fish respond to the string sound, was premièred by the strings of Ten Tors Orchestra at the National Marine Aquarium, Plymouth in 2008. The earlier version had no improvisers, but had a pre-recorded soundtrack instead. This was the version filmed by Long Room Productions for their hour-long documentary about Richards entitled [...] "Sonic Harvest". An updated version for filmed <b>fish,</b> <b>string</b> players and improvising soloists was presented in Plymouth city centre in the summer of 2013, using the city's large outdoor screen for the film of the fish. The filmed fish film was also used in 2015 for the CAM Festival at the Millennium Centre, Cardiff, with five string players and improvisers Lona Kozik, Gorwel Owen and Richards himself.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted for sixty days {{to evaluate the}} effects of Vitamin C of formulated feed on growth performance and body composition of <b>stringing</b> <b>fish,</b> Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch, 1792). During experimental trial in the laboratory condition, the change in growth and feed utilization by the <b>stringing</b> <b>fish</b> fed on three different Vitamin C level have been assessed by the determination of condition factor (K), survival rate (SR), specific growth rate (SGR%), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and average daily gain (ADG) and protein efficiency ratio(PER). All the water quality parameters specifically-Temperature (℃), Dissolved oxygen (DO), Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and pH in the plastic tanks were highly monitored and maintained.

These fish eventually learned to swim in a particular way to repeatedly make the bead snag the string and get food. Because the fish used an object external to their body in a goal-oriented way, this satisfies some definitions of tool use.|$|R

50|$|The xalam, in its {{standard}} form, is {{a simple}} lute chordophone with one to five strings. The wooden body (soundbox) membranophone of the instrument is oval-shaped and covered with the hide of cattle. The strings of the xalam are typically made {{of two or three}} tightly wound strands of low-gauge nylon <b>fishing</b> line; these <b>strings</b> are fixed to the instrument's wooden neck by long and narrow leather strips and to its wooden bridge by cotton strings. By moving these strips, the instrument's tune can be adjusted. The xalam usually has two main melody strings that are fingered by the left hand (like the strings of a guitar or banjo) and two to three supplementary strings of fixed pitch. Most xalam players construct their own xalams, although they usually call on woodworkers (lawbe) to carve the body, neck, and bridge for them.|$|R
50|$|Aboriginal fibre works {{until the}} later {{decades of the}} 20th Century were almost universally {{regarded}} and marketed as ethnographic or craft items. However various factors, beginning around the 1970s, began to see fibre works enter the fine art market. First among these was the Australian government support for Aboriginal art centres, which increased from around the 1970s. This provided more marketing, feedback and art world exposure to practitioners, which encouraged them to create innovative and ambitious products and exhibit their traditional works in new contexts. Parallel to this, a number of exhibitions and awards began to exhibit fibre works in a fine art context, which helped change public and collector perceptions. These included the exhibitions Maningrida: The Language of Weaving (1989), Spinifex Runner (1999) and Twined Together (2005), as well as awards such as the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA). Major galleries such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane also began to exhibit fibre works within their collections as fine art. Most Aboriginal fibre artists are women, originally trained in making practical items such as <b>fish</b> traps, baskets, <b>string</b> bags and mats. However many urban Aboriginal artists have been inspired to learn traditional weaving skills, often using innovative materials or translating fibre works into other media such as cast metal and glass.|$|R
5000|$|In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised Christian I of Saxony {{that three}} types of item were {{indispensable}} in forming a [...] "Kunstkammer" [...] or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly [...] "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly [...] "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals". When Albrecht Dürer visited the Netherlands in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the East Indies. The highly characteristic range of interests represented in Frans II Francken's painting of 1636 (illustration, left) shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the Adoration of the Magi) intermixed with preserved tropical marine <b>fish</b> and a <b>string</b> of carved beads, most likely amber, which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing Libera, a Roman fertility goddess) {{on the one hand}} and modern and religious (Christ at the Column) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): portrait miniatures, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia chiaroscuro woodcuts or drawings, and a small still-life painting leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.|$|R
30|$|For {{the last}} 60 years, {{the use of}} {{synthetic}} polymers has grown progressively because of their low cost, reproducibility, and resistance to physical aging and biological attack. However, devices and materials made of synthetic polymers are sometimes used for short-term applications and are subsequently disposed at high rates to the natural environment; ideally such items should be biodegradable {{so that they do}} not accumulate in the environment. Biodegradable plastics are a family of polymer products with a molecular structure that is susceptible to biological decomposition into benign or even beneficial products. The environmentally beneficial perception of these materials, and their range of potential applications is expandin: it already extends to composting bags, mulch films, packaging of agricultural supplies, silage wrap, landfill covers, planter boxes, <b>fishing</b> nets, bundling <b>string,</b> seed coatings, and pellet coatings for the delayed release of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers (Vert 2005). The rate of degradation of biodegradable plastics in the natural environment is controlled not only by the chemical structure of the plastic, but also by environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and nutrient content, all of which influence microbial activity. The rate at which a particular biodegradable plastic will degrade in a given situation is therefore still difficult to determine, and these materials often persist much longer than desired (Sakae et al. 2009). Increased use of biodegradable plastics requires greater reliability of degradation, and one means by which that might be achieved is to better understand the enzymes that efficiently degrade biodegradable plastics and the natural distributions of the microorganisms that produce these enzymes.|$|R

[...] A maximum of four of these are strung over the frets, while the rest are strung lengthwise down the sides of the neck and are strummed with the fingers in accompaniment to the primary melody which is played with a bow. This more elaborate jejy voatavo is especially popular among the Betsileo of the southern Highlands and the Betsimisaraka of the southeast, who play it in accompaniment to their sung epic poems, called rija. In 19th-century Highlands society under the Kingdom of Imerina, the jejy voatavo was considered to be a slave instrument which only mature men were permitted to play. The lokanga, an evolved jejy with the sound box carved to resemble a three-stringed fiddle, is popular among the Southern Antandroy and Bara ethnic groups. The simplest form of instrument in this family is the jejy lava (musical bow), believed to have been brought to Madagascar by settlers from mainland Africa.The piano was introduced to the royal Merina court in the early 19th century by envoys of the London Missionary Society, and soon afterward, local musicians began creating their own compositions for piano based on valiha technique. Piano compositions reached their peak with the Kalon'ny Fahiny style in the 1920s and 1930s before declining in the 1940s. [...] Today, the compositions of this period by pianist theatrical composers like Andrianary Ratianarivo (1895-1949) and Naka Rabemananatsoa(1892-1952) form part of the canon of classical Malagasy music and feature in the repertoire of Malagasy students of piano.|$|R
40|$|Between mid February to end of May 1999 (in 104 days) {{the well}} GPK 2 at the Soultz HDR site was {{successfully}} re-entered and deepened from 3876 m {{to a final}} depth of 5084 m and fully completed.

The well was extended to 5048 m in 8 1 / 2 '' hole size and again completed with a floating 9 5 / 8 -inch by 7 -inch casing string. The casing shoe is at 4431 m. A bottom hole core was taken in the depth range 5048 - 5051 m. The core recovery was app. 40 %. A pilot hole in 6 1 / 4 -inch was drilled from 5051 - 5084 m for in situ stress measurements using the hydraulic fracturing technique. The re-entry and deepening of the well GPK 2 was accompanied by several technical developments. New casing packer elements based on inflatable metal shells were developed in a close cooperation between SOCOMINE and MeSy GmbH (patent pending). These packer elements were successfully integrated into {{the completion of the}} well. The full weight of the casing string is supported by these elements which are filled with and imbedded in cement. High temperature cementing strategies (up to 170 - 190 C) for the complex saline fluids encountered in Soultz (High Magnesium Resistant Cements) were developed in a cooperation between Schlumberger Dowell (Vechta), SOCOMINE, SII of Houston, Ruhr-University Bochum, BGR Hannover and IFP Paris. The development of several high temperature logging tools (200 C range, 6 -arm caliper, PTF probe) was initiated with CSMA (Cornwall) during the preparation of the deepening of GPK 2. Initial scientific investigations included borehole logging (NGS, CLIPER, ARI, UBI, TEMPERATURE), geological investigations (cuttings, core) and seismic monitoring while drilling. During the first temperature log performed, 12 hours after circulation, a temperature of 194 C was recorded at 5048 m (bottom hole at that time) when the temperature tool failed. At this time the temperature was still climbing. Geological investigations and borehole logging indicate a strong degree of fracturation in the open hole section between 4431 - 5084 m.
