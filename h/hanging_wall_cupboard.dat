40|$|The Kabba {{porphyry}} copper prospect {{in northwestern}} Arizona contains two zones of porphyry style mineralization and alteration, which are spatially {{separated by a}} north-south trending normal fault. These two zones {{are referred to as}} the Kabba footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and are hypothesized to represent the root and intermediate depth levels of the same porphyry-like hydrothermal system, respectively. If this hypothesis is correct, then fluid inclusions found in the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and footwall should have the physical and chemical characteristics of fluid inclusions in the root and intermediate depth levels of other known porphyry deposits. Vein and alteration petrography, fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry, and Raman and LA-ICP-MS analyses of individual fluid inclusions from Kabba footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> samples lead to the following observations: 1) the textures and paragenetic sequence of alteration and mineralization in the Kabba <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> is almost identical to the textures and paragenetic sequence of alteration and mineralization in the footwall, 2) the mineralization and alteration in the Kabba prospect is consistent with the footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> having formed in the deep roots and intermediate zones to a porphyry-like hydrothermal system, respectively, 3) the distribution of fluid inclusion types in the footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> broadly matches the distribution of fluid inclusion types in the deep roots and intermediate zones of other porphyry systems, 4) the chemical and physical conditions of fluid inclusions in the Kabba system are very similar to the chemical and physical conditions of fluid inclusions in the Butte porphyry system in Montana, 5) Cu concentrations in fluid inclusions from Kabba are highest in inclusions with the lowest Sr, Rb, and Ba, and 6) Cu concentrations were consistently high in vapor-rich fluid inclusions. These observations strongly suggest that the mineralization and alteration in the Kabba system formed at great depth in a porphyry-like hydrothermal system, and that the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and footwall represent the root and intermediate depth levels of that system. Based on the microthermometric behavior of fluid inclusions from the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and footwall it is interpreted that, 1) the mineralization and alteration in the Kabba system formed via 5 episodes of hydrothermal fluid flux through the footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall,</b> 2) immiscibility may {{have played a role in}} forming the mineralization in the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall,</b> 3) fluids went from being H 2 O to CO 2 -rich over time, 4) the Kabba footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> formed at pressures between 2500 - 3000 bars (10 - 12 km) and 1500 - 2000 bars (6 - 8 km), respectively, 6) fluids in the footwall and <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> were trapped betwee...|$|R

30|$|Compared to the {{footwall}} damage zones, the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> has thinner shear {{zones of}} 2.3 to 18.6  m thickness, possibly due to higher porosity and lower shear {{strength in the}} footwall {{as a result of}} deep burial in the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and accumulation of displacement across the fault. In addition to the contrast in physical properties across the fault, the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> may have developed thinner shear zones because strain was partitioned between the preexisting turbiditic sequence of alternating shale/sandstone-dominant intervals, and deformation was concentrated in the sandstone-rich intervals. In contrast, faults and fractures are more sporadically distributed in the footwall likely due to less partitioning of strain within the sandstone block-in-shale matrix structure, creating thicker shear zones as a whole.|$|R
50|$|A {{rollover}} anticline is a syn-depositional structure developed {{within the}} downthrown block (<b>hanging</b> <b>wall)</b> of large listric normal faults. Such faults are typically regional {{in nature and}} develop {{as a response to}} extensional collapse of a passive continental margin (i.e. Niger Delta, Mississippi Delta). Their main feature is that they flatten (sole out) with depth. The scale and shape of the anticline is controlled by the geometry of the listric fault plane and the amount of slip that has taken place along it. The actual fold develops as the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> is pulled away from the footwall, the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> bends to fill the void that is being formed between the two blocks. The result is an anticline feature in a completely extensional setting.|$|R

The stresses developed in the rock above an active support load were found to be significantly higher than those predicted by elastic theory. The cutting of a <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> dip slot in the back areas of a stope and the allowing of progressive collapse of the strata has been shown to cause large tensile strain changes in the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and to steepen the dip of extension fractures.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} in reservoir quality of clastic rock between the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and the foot {{wall of the}} Ke-Bai overthrust belt, northwestern margin of the Junggar Basin, western China, which affect the efficient petroleum exploration in this highly mature exploration area. Based on {{a large number of}} thin-sections, cast thin-sections, and physical property analysis of cores, we systematically discuss the Permian-Jurassic reservoir differences between the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and the foot wall of the Ke-Bai overthrust fault from the aspects of structural evolution, time-space distribution of the depositional system, diagenesis characteristics, and reservoir quality and analyzed the reasons for the differences in reservoir properties. The overthrusting of the Ke-Bai fault directly results in different burial histories, diagenesis evolution, and porosity evolution between the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> and the foot wall. The differences of reservoir characteristics are mainly embodied in buried depth, grain size, sedimentary facies, diagenetic stage, and reservoir quality. The analysis results showed that burial history and depositional characteristics controlled by overthrusting are direct influencing factors of reservoir differences. Because of shallow burial depth of the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall,</b> the reservoir compaction is weak and primary pores are preserved well. The porosity of reservoir on the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> is generally 10 %– 25 %. The strata on the foot wall are deeply buried, and there are mainly mixed pores with the average porosity of 5 %– 20 %. The favorable reservoir on the foot wall is generally developed near faults or in the channel sand bodies, which are usually dissolution development areas.|$|R
