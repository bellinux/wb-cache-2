[...] The origin may be a blend of Korean shamanism, Buddhist, Chinese myths, Confucian and [...] Taoist legends and myths. The legends may also vary greatly by region, even within the country. For example, the people of Jejudo <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> lifestyle from that of the mainland and so can generate different forms of the same myths.|$|E
2500|$|Wild turkeys, while {{technically}} {{the same}} species as domestic turkeys, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> taste from farm-raised turkeys. In contrast to domestic turkeys, almost all wild turkey meat is [...] "dark" [...] (even the breast) and more intensely flavored. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild turkey meat with a gamier flavor in late summer due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkey that has fed predominantly on grass and grain has a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.|$|E
2500|$|Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism {{disagree}} {{in their}} assumptions and theories about rebirth. Hinduism relies on its foundational assumption that [...] "soul, Self exists" [...] (Atman, attā), {{in contrast to}} Buddhist assumption that there is [...] "no soul, no Self" [...] (Anatta, anatman). Hindu traditions consider soul to be the unchanging eternal essence of a living being, and what journeys across reincarnations until it attains self-knowledge. Buddhism, in contrast, asserts a rebirth theory without a Self, and considers realization of non-Self or Emptiness as Nirvana (nibbana). Thus Buddhism and Hinduism <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> view on whether a self or soul exists, which impacts {{the details of their}} respective rebirth theories.|$|E

In January 2011, Gareth Edwards was announced as the director for the film. In an interview publicizing the DVD release of Monsters, Edwards discussed the new film: [...] "this will definitely <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> feel than the 1998 film and our biggest concern is making sure we get it right for the fans because we know their concerns.

2500|$|Even as Japanese hung Sambo signs {{throughout}} the city, they were undeniably attracted to black music and style. Before hip hop, the Japanese had embraced jazz, rock n roll and funk. It {{is important to}} note however, despite the seemingly racist tendencies toward African Americans and the simultaneous embrace of black culture, the Japanese <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> construction of racial ideology then the US. Whereas the white versus black dichotomy typifies the racial system in the US, the Japanese construct their identities in terms of nationalism. Rather than identifying strongly with a color, Japanese tradition speaks to a homogeneous society that places foreigners in the [...] "other category." [...] Because of this context, [...] "jiggers" [...] and the young teens who wear blackface rebel by embracing individual identities that are different from the norm.|$|E
2500|$|Helms {{articulated}} several understandings, {{derived from}} his working knowledge and experiences as ambassador in Iran. [...] "He {{came to realize}} that he could never understand the Iranians," [...] writes William Shawcross. He quotes Helms, [...] "They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> turn of mind. Here would be ladies, dressed in Parisian clothes. ... But before they went on trips abroad, they would ship up to Mashhad in chadors to ask for protection." [...] Helms with his wife had visited the pilgrimage site in Mashhad, 'the tomb of the eighth Imam'. As to the Shah's statecraft, Helms' May 1976 memo observes, [...] "Iranian government and society are highly structured and authoritarian and all major decisions are made at the top. Often even relatively senior officials are not well informed about policies and plans and have little influence on them." [...] In July 1976 Helms send a message to State which, while confident, again voiced various concerns, e.g., about the [...] "inadequate 'political institutionalization'" [...] of the regime. Professor Abbas Milani comments that in 1975 Helms had [...] "captured the nature of the Shah's vulnerability when he wrote that 'the conflict between rapid economic growth and modernization vis-à-vis a still autocratic rule' was the greatest uncertainty about the Shah's future." [...] Milani, looking ahead after Helms' departure, writes that the election of President Carter in 1976 [...] "forced the Shah to expedite his liberalization plans." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later {{iterations}} of the terminology, such as Carleton S. Coon's Origin of Races, placed {{this theory}} in an evolutionary context. Coon divided the species Homo sapiens into five groups: Caucasoid, Capoid, Congoid, Australoid and Mongoloid, {{based on the}} timing of each taxon's evolution from Homo erectus. Positing the Capoid race as a separate racial entity, and labeling the two major divisions {{of what he called}} the Congoid race as being the [...] "African Negroes" [...] and the [...] "Pygmies," [...] he divided indigenous Africans into these two distinct groups based on their date of origin, and loosened classification from mere appearance — however, this led to disagreement between approaches to dating divergence, and consequent conflicting results. Cavalli-Sforza also accepts this twofold division, pointing out that the Pygmies <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> genetic signature than other Bantu language speakers. He thus proposes that they must have originally had their own now unknown language, but have since adopted the language of the Bantu peoples around them. Cavaill-Sforza does not accept as Coon did that each race evolved separately; he accepts the currently dominant paradigm, the Out of Africa theory (OOA), i.e. that all humans outside of Africa are descended from small groups of people that migrated out of the continent beginning 125,000 to 60,000 years ago, and that populations within Africa are descended from either groups that remained within the continent or later back-migrated from Eurasia after the initial OOA exodus.|$|E
