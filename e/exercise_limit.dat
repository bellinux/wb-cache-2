Despite the universal popularity of using this kind of slabs for simply construction floors, the major world codes focus their attention in a design based on the ultimate limit state, restraining the <b>exercise</b> <b>limit</b> state to a simply verification after the design. For Australia, on the contrary, this is not true. In fact, since this country is not subjected to seismic effects, the main concern is related to the long-term behaviour of the structure. Even if {{there are a lot of}} studies about long-term effects of shrinkage and creep, up to date, there are not so many studies concerning the behaviour of slabs with a cracked cross section and how shrinkage and creep influence it. For this reason, a series of ten full scale reinforced slabs was prepared and monitored under laboratory conditions to investigate this behaviour.

Prevention is {{an essential component of}} strategies to reduce the diabetes burden. There is strong and consistent evidence from randomised controlled trials that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle modification which improves diet, increases physical activity and achieves weight loss in at risk people. The current challenge is to translate this evidence into routine community settings, determine feasible and effective ways of delivering the intervention and providing on-going support to sustain successful behavioural changes. Methods/Design: The Sydney Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPP) is a translational study which will be conducted in 1, 550 participants aged 50 - 65 years (including 100 indigenous people aged 18 years and older) at high risk of future development of diabetes. Participants will be identified through a screening and recruitment program delivered through primary care and will be offered a community-based lifestyle modification intervention.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{have been}} few well {{controlled}} altitude and hypoxic training studies to date. This thesis investigated the effects of altitude and (sham controlled) intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) on exercise capacity, and the associated physiological adaptations. METHODS: Chapter 3 investigated how living and training at 2320 m or at sea level affected total haemoglobin mass (tHb) and race performance in highly trained swimmers. Chapter 4 investigated how IHT or normoxic training affected cardiopulmonary variables and the incremental <b>exercise</b> <b>limit</b> of tolerance (T-Lim), in highly trained runners. Chapter 5 investigated how single-legged IHT or normoxic training affected phosphorus- 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy assessed muscle energetics. RESULTS: In Chapter 3, tHb increased significantly more after altitude (+ 0. 6 ± 0. 4 g•kg- 1, or + 4. 4 ± 3. 2 %) than after sea level (+ 0. 03 ± 0. 1 g•kg- 1, or + 0. 3 ± 1. 0 %), but the changes in swimming performances were not different between groups, {{and there were no}} correlations between tHb and performance changes. In Chapter 4, submaximal heart rate in normoxia decreased significantly more after IHT than after normoxic training (- 5 ± 5 vs. - 1 ± 5 b∙min- 1), and submaximal "V" ̇O 2 in hypoxia significantly decreased, only after IHT. T-Lim in hypoxia significantly increased post-IHT, but there were no between group differences. In Chapter 5, the phosphocreatine recovery time constant was speeded significantly more in the IHT compared to the normoxic trained leg, when tested in hypoxia (- 25 ± 8 % vs. - 13 ± 6 %), but not in normoxia (- 16 ± 15 % vs. - 9 ± 10 %). CONCLUSIONS: Altitude training likely increases tHb, but this is not necessarily associated with improved athletic performance. IHT may induce other non-haematological adaptations; potentially an enhanced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, but evidence for exercise capacity gains is lacking. The precise underlying causes for these adaptations require further investigation, as does any translation to athletic performance. Sporting Edge UK Ltd ([URL]...|$|E

There is strong and consistent evidence from randomised controlled trials that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle modification which improves diet, increases physical activity and achieves weight loss in at risk people. The current challenge is to translate this evidence into routine community settings, determine feasible and effective ways of delivering the intervention and providing on-going support to sustain successful behavioural changes.

The effectiveness and costs of the program on diabetes-related risk factors will be evaluated. Main outcomes include changes in weight, physical activity, and dietary changes (fat, saturated fat and fibre intake). Secondary outcomes include changes in waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, lipids, quality of life, psychological well being, medication use and health service utilization. Discussion This translational study will ascertain the reach, feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a lifestyle modification program delivered in a community setting through primary health care. If demonstrated to be effective, it will result in recommendations for policy change and practical methods for a wider community program for preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in high risk people. </p...|$|E

Main outcome measures : The Short Form 36 Health Survey or SF- 36, the CFS Symptom List, and the CFS-Activities and Participation Questionnaire were filled in prior to, immediately and 24 hours post-exercise. Results : The fatigue increase observed immediately post-exercise (p= 0. 006) returned to pre-exercise levels 24 hours post-exercise. The increase in pain observed immediately post-exercise was retained at 24 hours post-exercise (p= 0. 03). Fourteen of 24 subjects experienced a clinically meaningful change in bodily pain (change of SF- 36 bodily pain score ³ 10). Six of 24 participants indicated that the exercise bout had slightly worsened their health status, and 2 of 24 had a clinically meaningful decrease in vitality (change of SF- 36 vitality score ³ 20).
