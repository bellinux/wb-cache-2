5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, {{resulting in the}} loss of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure,</b> which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{practice}} of impounding mine water and liquid fine waste in underground mines is increasing. Often these underground impoundments {{are created by}} constructing seals or bulkheads designed to withstand the expected <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> Occasionally seals are built for another purpose, usually to act as explosion-resistant ventilation barriers. Due to factors such as clogged drain pipes or unexpectedly high inflow rates, these explosion-resistant seals sometimes become subjected to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> The incidence of seal failures due to inadequate design and/or construction {{is also on the}} increase. Fortunately, to date, no lives have been lost by water seal failures, but a clearer understanding of the design and construction considerations specific to water seals is vital to keep this from occurring in the future. This paper presents technical considerations for the design and construction of seals which will specifically be required to withstand <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures</b> in underground mines...|$|R
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall {{uses the}} belt press wherein {{the upper and}} lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure,</b> rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E

5000|$|Modern airliners have separate, {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} powered by engine-driven pumps. The PTU is used when, for example, there is right <b>hydraulic</b> system <b>pressure</b> but no left <b>hydraulic</b> system <b>pressure.</b> In this example, the PTU transfers hydraulic {{power from the}} right hydraulic system to the left hydraulic system. A PTU consists of a hydraulic motor that powers a hydraulic pump. As the connection is purely mechanical, there is no intermixing of hydraulic fluid between {{the left and right}} hydraulic systems during PTU operation.|$|R
5|$|The two snails {{circle around}} each other {{for up to six}} hours, {{touching}} with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E

40|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foams {{are generally}} "closed celled" with a gas entrapped in each cell. The properties of such foams are significantly {{affected by the}} cell size distribution and morphology of the cells. For example, in thermal insulation foams, small cells lead to lower thermal conductivity and in foams for buoyancy applications, stronger cell windows are resistant to ingress of water until higher <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> The effect of formulation parameters on the size and structure of rigid polyurethane foams was investigated. Foams were made with different surfactants, with variation of surfactant concentration at different blowing agent concentration, with variation of nucleating agent concentration and with variation of catalyst concentration. Micron sized silica particles were used as nucleating agent. The densities of the foams were {{in the range of}} 140 to 165 kg/m(3). The cell window areas of different foams have been measured. The bubble size in the polyol depends on the surface tension lowering ability of a surfactant, and the entrainment {{of a large number of}} small bubbles during mixing leads to a foam with a small cell size and a narrow cell size distribution. Increasing the concentration of the surfactant reduces the cell size and narrows the distribution. Increasing the proportion of organometallic catalyst in the amount of total catalyst used, results in smaller cell sizes, which are narrowly distributed. Hydraulic resistance of the foams was monitored by measuring buoyancy losses at different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> resistance of the foams can be improved by decreasing the area and increasing the thickness of the cell windows...|$|R

5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld lost <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on the grid; he was {{required}} to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same {{because he had a}} fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while H√§kkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, R√§ikk√∂nen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, H√§kkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures</b> applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|R
