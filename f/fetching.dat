5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is <b>fetching</b> though uncomplicated.|$|E

He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason <b>fetching</b> the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely <b>fetching</b> much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain.

In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigrún, Helgi's valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnarök has begun, or if Helgi and his men have been allowed to return.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, <b>fetching</b> as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade in}} New England ice {{expanded}} during the 1830s and 1840s across the eastern {{coast of the}} U.S., while new trade routes were created across the world. The first and most profitable of these new routes was to India: in 1833 Tudor combined with the businessmen Samuel Austin and William Rogers to attempt to export ice to Calcutta using the brigantine ship the Tuscany. The Anglo-Indian elite, concerned {{about the effects of}} the summer heat, quickly agreed to exempt the imports from the usual East India Company regulations and trade tariffs, and the initial net shipment of around a hundred tons (90,000kg) sold successfully. With the ice <b>fetching</b> for three pence (£0.80 in 2010 terms) per pound (0.5kg), the first shipment aboard the Tuscany produced profits of $9,900 ($253,000), and in 1835 Tudor commenced regular exports to Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.|$|E

However, experiments show that the performance does not increase proportionally to the <b>fetch.</b> Once the measured IPC is half the instruction <b>fetch</b> bandwidth, increasing the <b>fetch</b> bandwidth brings very little improvement. In order to better understand this behavior, we develop a model from the empirical observation that the available instruction parallelism grows as the square root of the instruction window size. From the model, we derive that the <b>fetch</b> bandwidth requirement grows as the square root of the distance between mispredicted branches. We also verify experimentally that, to double the IPC, one should both double the <b>fetch</b> bandwidth and decrease the [...] ...|$|R

The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{moved to}} Thika, where he gained {{employment}} with the engineering firm run by Briton John Cook.

He stayed {{at the home of}} his friend Charles Kasaja, located at the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission, in order to recuperate. At the time, the British Empire was involved in World War I, and it had recruited many Kikuyu to serve in the British Army. One of those who joined was Kongo, but he disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like many Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British war effort. Kenyatta had an aunt who had married a Maasai chief and began living with her family. He adopted a number of Maasai customs, and took to wearing the Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt which was known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the most}} {{widespread}} of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, {{with a population of}} as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. A second population in Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam was confirmed as extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, <b>fetching</b> as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression.|$|E

5|$|The true {{origin of}} the rhyme is unknown, but there are several theories. Complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics, as is common with nursery rhyme exegesis. Most {{explanations}} post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. These include the suggestion by S. Baring-Gould in the 19th century that the events were {{a version of the}} story told in the 13th-century Prose Edda Gylfaginning written by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. Baring-Gould stated that Hjúki and Bil, brother and sister respectively in Norse mythology, were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god Máni) as they were <b>fetching</b> water from the well called Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul. Around 1835, John Bellenden Ker suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests; this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented Cardinal Wolsey (c.1471–1530) and Jill was Bishop Tarbes, who negotiated the marriage of Mary Tudor to the French king in 1514.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in <b>fetching</b> them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E
