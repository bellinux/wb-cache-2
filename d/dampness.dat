5|$|Rammed {{earth is}} {{generally}} made without much water, {{and so does}} not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising <b>dampness,</b> must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or <b>dampness.</b> Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{also show}} that green is the color most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with <b>dampness.</b> Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E

25|$|Woodlice {{can also}} invade homes en masse {{in search of}} {{moisture}} and their presence can indicate <b>dampness</b> problems. They are not generally regarded as a serious household pest as they do not spread disease and do not damage sound wood or structures.|$|E
25|$|Biodegradable {{plastics}} are plastics that degrade, {{or break}} down, upon exposure to: sunlight or ultra-violet radiation, water or <b>dampness,</b> bacteria, enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack {{can also be}} considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} spring, Johnny Town-mouse pays Timmy Willie a visit. He complains of the <b>dampness</b> {{and finds}} {{such things as}} cows and lawnmowers frightening. He returns to {{the city in the}} hamper of vegetables after telling Timmy country life is too quiet. The tale ends with the author stating her own preference for country living.|$|E
25|$|Slats {{in either}} the {{horizontal}} or vertical direction are permanently fixed {{to the back of}} the panel, whilst the secondary perpendicular slats remain loose, held solely in place by the upper row. This allows for a degree of movement in the panel, which may warp, subject to changing levels of <b>dampness</b> and atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|When a Chinook {{comes in}} when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the {{tropical}} <b>dampness</b> brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls {{and the cold}} spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.|$|E
25|$|The {{categorization}} {{according to}} the specific function mainly include: exterior-releasing or exterior-resolving, heat-clearing, downward-draining, or precipitating wind-damp-dispelling, dampness-transforming, promoting the movement of water and percolating <b>dampness</b> or dampness-percolating, interior-warming, qi-regulating or qi-rectifying, dispersing food accumulation or food-dispersing, worm-expelling, stopping bleeding or blood-, quickening the Blood and dispelling stasis or blood-quickening, transforming phlegm, stopping coughing and calming wheezing or phlegm-transforming and cough- and panting-suppressing, Spirit-quieting, calming the liver and expelling wind or liver-calming and wind-extinguishingl orifice-openingl supplementing which includes qi-supplementing, blood-nourishing, yin-enriching, and yang-fortifying, astriction-promoting or securing and astringing, vomiting-inducing, and substances for external application.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} to {{indoor air quality}} is the control of moisture accumulation (<b>dampness)</b> leading to mold growth {{and the presence of}} bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns. Water intrusion through a building's envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building's interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth. A well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes, cooking, bathing, cleaning, and other activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{combination}} with its {{use as an}} insecticide, boric acid also prevents and destroys existing wet and dry rot in timbers. It {{can be used in}} {{combination with}} an ethylene glycol carrier to treat external wood against fungal and insect attack. It is possible to buy borate-impregnated rods for insertion into wood via drill holes where <b>dampness</b> and moisture is known to collect and sit. It is available in a gel form and injectable paste form for treating rot affected wood without the need to replace the timber. Concentrates of borate-based treatments can be used to prevent slime, mycelium, and algae growth, even in marine environments.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1609, all was well at Jamestown with many {{dwellings}} built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, an infestation of rats was discovered, along with <b>dampness,</b> which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent {{a large group of}} settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Native Americans and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.|$|E
25|$|In 632, {{chancellor}} Ma Zhou {{charged that}} the retired Emperor Gaozu was living in Da'an Palace (大安宮) to the west, which he considered an inhospitable place as it was built on low-lying lands of Chang'an that was plagued by <b>dampness</b> and heat during the summer. According to him, ever since Emperor Taizong moved to the countryside during the summers, his retired father was left behind in Chang'an to suffer in the summer heat. However, his father would always decline any invitation from Emperor Taizong to spend the summer together. Ever since the bloody palace coup of the Xuanwu Gate Incident in 626, it seemed that father and son had drifted apart to an extent that their relationship never healed.|$|E
25|$|Health {{problems}} in miners {{were the result}} of working in poor air, filled with dust from blasting, and from <b>dampness.</b> Although the miners lived nearly as long {{as the rest of the}} local population, they aged more quickly. The worst affected at Greenside were those who had come from the poorly ventilated mines on Alston Moor. The smelters suffered lead poisoning from inhaling lead fumes at the furnaces. The miners ran their own insurance scheme, paying a shilling a quarter to either the Oddfellows Lodge (founded June 1839) or the Mechanics Lodge (founded 1869). By the 1930s these were paying 12 shillings a week to men unable to work through sickness or accident.|$|E
25|$|In 1787, James was {{released}} from Southwark gaol to voyage to the British penal colony in Australia in April 1787. The document was signed by Evan Nepean on 10 March 1787. Though James began his journey on the Friendship, he transferred himself to the Charlotte in a reshuffle of the women passengers. On 18 January 1788, the First Fleet arrived at Botany Bay, Australia. The openness of this bay, and the <b>dampness</b> of the soil, by which the people would probably be rendered unhealthy, had already determined the Governor to seek another situation. He resolved, therefore, to examine Port Jackson, a bay mentioned by Captain James Cook as immediately {{to the north of}} this. There he hoped to find, not only a better harbour, but a fitter place for the establishment of his new government. The first fleet then moved to Port Jackson by 26 January.|$|E

According to him, ever since Emperor Taizong moved to the countryside during the summers, his retired father was left behind in Chang'an to suffer in the summer heat. However, his father would always decline any invitation to spend the summer together when Emperor Taizong eventually did invite him. Ma Zhou also charged that Emperor Taizong had not visited his father {{for a long time}} even though they lived nearby each other. Ever since the bloody palace coup, it seemed that father and son had drifted apart {{to such an extent that}} their relationship never healed. In 634, Emperor Taizong launched the construction of the Daming Palace. He ordered the construction of the new summer palace as a residence for his father; however, Emperor Gaozu grew ill and never witnessed the palace's completion before his death in the 5th month of 635.|$|E
25|$|As it was {{the first}} game on a new console, the {{development}} team was largely made up of people new to the series, including designers Akira Ohtani and Yuki Sakamoto. The capacity of the Wii U meant that more experimentation with graphics could be done. During the making of the game, the team watched a lot of scary online videos, along with studying lighting and the appearance of being wet. Alongside making a game for dedicated series players, they also added adjustments for new players, partly due to the multimedia developments that were underway. Among these changes were adding helpful gameplay features and creating more conversation cutscenes to make the story easier to understand. The pace of gameplay was also made similar to an action game as opposed to previous entries. In addition, the flashback cutscenes were made to look grainy and low-quality compared to the present-day cutscenes. While they had initially been visually similar to rest of the game, part of the series' appeal was the fear evoked by unseen objects, so they added distortions. The shift onto more powerful hardware also enabled the team to incorporate more graphic scenes, which contributed to it receiving a higher CERO rating than previous titles. A mechanic being tested in the game was the necessity to keep dry, initially inspired by the sweating mechanic from Dead or Alive 5. While this was toned down, <b>dampness</b> being tied to the character's well being remained in the game as both a story and gameplay concept. This aspect was suggested by Ohtani.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{discipline}} worked smoothly till 1718, when it {{came into}} collision with Earl's civil authorities, owing {{in part to the}} reduction of revenue through Wilson's practice of mitigating fines in the spiritual court. Robert Mawdesley, governor from 1703, had been in harmony with Wilson; his successor in 1713, Alexander Horne, became Wilson's determined opponent. The substantive points at issue appear to be whether appeals in ecclesiastical cases should be made to ecclesiastical authorities or to the civil authority of the Lord of Mann; and, later, whether or not soldiers of the Lord of Mann should fall under ecclesiastical rule. The first direct conflict began in 1716. Mary Henricks, a married woman, was excommunicated for adultery, and condemned to penance and prison. She appealed to the lord of the isle, and Horne allowed the appeal. Wilson, rightly maintaining that there was no appeal except to the Archbishop of York, did not appear at the hearing, and was fined £10; the fine was remitted. The episcopal registrar, John Woods of Kirk Malew, was twice imprisoned (1720 and 1721) for refusing to act without the bishop's direction. In 1721, the governor's wife, Jane Horne, was ordered to ask forgiveness (in mitigation of penance) for slanderous statements. For admitting her to communion and for false doctrine Archdeacon Robert Horrobin, the governor's chaplain, was suspended in 1722. Refusing to recall the sentence, Wilson was fined £60, and his vicars-general £20 apiece, and in default were imprisoned in Castle Rushen. Wilson appealed to the crown; they were released, but the fines were paid through Thomas Corlett. The <b>dampness</b> of the prison had so affected Wilson's right hand that he was henceforth unable to move his fingers to write. In 1724 the bishopric of Exeter was offered to Wilson as a means of reimbursement. He refused, reputedly saying to Queen Caroline, “I will not forsake my wife and children because they are poor". On his declining, George I promised to meet his expenses from the privy purse, a pledge which the king's death left unfulfilled.|$|E
500|$|The palace was {{historically}} only accessible {{from the}} overlying Sheesh Mahal, though a new entrance {{was built by}} the British near Hathi Pul, or [...] "Elephant Stairs." [...] Its walls were decorated with intricate frescoes and marble inlay that have been severely deteriorate by layers of subsequent white-washing and centuries of <b>dampness.</b> Passage tunnels also exist that lead from the palace to the fort's exterior where the River Ravi once flowed, suggesting {{that it may have}} been part of an escape tunnel designed to allow occupants to flee in case of attack.|$|E
500|$|The {{photograph}} used on {{the front}} and back cover of the album was taken by photographer Brian Griffin. The picture shows the band on a wet beach in the south of Wales; there are dark clouds in the sky and the sun is low on the horizon causing the band to be silhouetted. The picture was taken on a day off from recording the album. The original album's cover art was designed by Martyn Atkins. The cover received the [...] "Best Dressed LP" [...] award in the 1981 NME Awards. Reynolds said that the band's manager Drummond saw them as representing [...] "cold, <b>dampness,</b> darkness".|$|E
500|$|The {{additional}} armour added {{during construction}} increased her draught by about [...] at deep load, which reduced her freeboard {{and made her}} very wet. At full speed, or in heavy seas, water would flow over the ship's quarterdeck and often entered the messdecks and living quarters through ventilation shafts. This characteristic earned her the nickname of [...] "the largest submarine in the Navy". The persistent <b>dampness,</b> coupled with the ship's poor ventilation, was blamed for {{the high incidence of}} tuberculosis aboard. The ship's complement varied widely over her career; in 1919, she was authorised 1433 men as a squadron flagship; in 1934, she had 81 officers and 1244 men aboard.|$|E
500|$|During the Easter Rising {{an attempt}} was made to blow up the pillar but the {{explosives}} failed to ignite due to <b>dampness.</b> It remained in the city as most of Ireland became the Irish Free State in 1922, and the Republic of Ireland in 1949. The chief legal barrier to its removal was the trust created at the Pillar's inception, the terms of which gave the trustees a duty in perpetuity to preserve the monument. Successive Irish governments failed to deliver legislation overriding the trust. [...] Although influential literary figures such as James Joyce, W. B. Yeats and Oliver St. John Gogarty defended the Pillar on historical and cultural grounds, pressure for its removal intensified in the years preceding the 50th anniversary of the Rising, and its sudden demise was, on the whole, well received by the public. Although it was widely believed that the action was the work of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the police were unable to identify any of those responsible.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} organ {{was moved}} from its central {{position in the}} crossing to the north transept during Scott's restoration. The instrument performed badly following the move, which was attributed to the cold and <b>dampness</b> of its new position. Consequently, it {{was moved to the}} south transept, but it performed no better there, and in 1889 it was sold to Haydock church. The present organ was built in 1890 by Forster and Andrews and partly rebuilt in about 1925. It was again rebuilt in 1973 by Charles Whiteley and Company, who installed electro-pneumatic action among other additions and repairs. Rushworth and Dreaper made further additions during their 1994 restoration. [...] The parish registers date back to 1539 and contain much material relating to Nantwich's history. [...] There is a ring of eight bells, four of which were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in 1713, and the other four by John Taylor and Company in 1922.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the <b>dampness</b> in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
500|$|Verdigris is made {{by placing}} a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, {{slightly}} warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny. It {{was used by the}} Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist <b>dampness,</b> it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. [...] It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.|$|E
