5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps {{as far as}} the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited with being the first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach {{at least as far as}} Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.|$|E

25|$|The Edomites' {{original}} country, {{according to}} the Hebrew Bible, stretched from the Sinai peninsula as far as Kadesh Barnea. Southward it reached as far as Eilat, which was the seaport of Edom. On the north of Edom was the territory of Moab. The boundary between Moab and Edom was the Wadi Zered. The ancient capital of Edom was Bozrah. According to Genesis, Esau's descendants settled <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> after displacing the Horites. It was also called the land of Seir; Mount Seir {{appears to have been}} strongly identified with them and may have been a cultic site. In the time of Amaziah (838BC), Selah (Petra) was its principal stronghold, Eilat and Ezion-geber its seaports.|$|E

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, Pocahontas and Nima witness Grimosco and Miami {{plotting}} to kill the European settlers. [...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill all the White men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating fear about how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larry’s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself. [...] She says she has come with Percy’s lover, Geraldine, also disguised as a page, who has come to convince Percy he was wrong about her infidelity. Pocahontas arrives and convinces the settlers to go to Powhatan’s palace to rescue their colleagues from Grimosco’s plot. They arrive {{just in time to}} prevent the disaster. [...] Grimosco is taken away, and Miami stabs himself in shame. [...] Everyone else has a happy ending: Pocahontas is with Rolfe, Walter is with Alice, Larry is with Kate, Percy is with Geraldine, and even Robin is with Nima.
