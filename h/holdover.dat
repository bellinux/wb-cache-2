5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its <b>holdover</b> time is shorter than the <b>holdover</b> time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager <b>holdover</b> Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{week after}} the season's conclusion, backup quarterback Tyler Ferguson {{announced}} his plans to transfer from the university to somewhere he would have an opportunity to start, rather than be Christian Hackenberg's backup for the remainder of his career. Later, it was announced that though he originally intended to transfer to Western Kentucky (WKU), at which Bobby Petrino was head coach; when Petrino accepted the head coaching position at Louisville, Ferguson changed his plans, and transferred there. In early December, it was reported that quarterbacks coach Charlie Fisher and linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden, the latter of whom was a <b>holdover</b> from the Joe Paterno era, departed, with speculation that they were forced out by Bill O'Brien.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another <b>holdover</b> county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} (Phase II) had been contracted {{to be completed by}} March 2008. This would enable Morningstar, Inc. to move before its early 2009 lease expiration at its present location, 225 W. Wacker Drive. However, financial troubles have caused delays that have necessitated that Morningstar who had intended to occupy over half of the building seek lease proposals from other downtown office towers. Morningstar would suffer <b>holdover</b> penalties and other damages if it were unable to move before its lease expires. Morningstar is hesitant to pursue other opportunities because their lease at 108 North State Street is at a below market price in the low $20s/square foot.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the <b>holdover</b> senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E

5|$|In {{the race}} for city commissioners, each party nominates two {{candidates}} and the top three are elected. The office was a county office, a <b>holdover</b> from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was {{the conduct of the}} city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson, a sales executive.|$|E
5|$|Intermittently, Penn State named Johnson, {{the lone}} {{remaining}} <b>holdover</b> from the Joe Paterno era, the interim {{head coach in}} an effort to stabilize the program to prevent recruit defection, as well as prevent current players, namely quarterback Hackenberg, whose father commented that he was undecided on whether or not to return, from transferring. A few weeks later, however, it appeared Hackenberg would return, as Ferguson followed through on his plans to transfer, and Franklin lauded Hackenberg in his introductory press conference. After the announcement of O'Brien's departure, star wide receiver Allen Robinson, a junior, declared that he would forgo his senior season, and enter the 2014 NFL Draft; according to projections from a CBSSports.com mock draft, Robinson would likely be selected in the late first round.|$|E
5|$|The Man {{with the}} Iron Fists grossed $15.6 million from North America and $4 million from other territories for a {{worldwide}} total of $19.7 million, against a $15 million budget. Pre-release tracking in North America {{for the week}} before release estimated that the film would attract a mostly male audience and would earn between $7 million and $10 million during its opening weekend. The Man with the Iron Fists earned $3 million during its opening day, and during its opening weekend the film earned $7.9 million from 1,868 theaters – an average of $4,235 per theater—finishing fourth behind <b>holdover</b> Argo ($10.2 million), and fellow new releases Flight ($25 million) and Wreck-It Ralph ($49.1 million). The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was under 30 (53%) and male (64%).|$|E

5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only <b>holdover</b> from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E

25|$|On land, the <b>holdover</b> plants {{included}} the lycophytes, the dominant cycads, ginkgophyta (represented {{in modern times}} by Ginkgo biloba) and glossopterids. The spermatophytes, or seed plants came to dominate the terrestrial flora: in the northern hemisphere, conifers flourished. Dicroidium (a seed fern) was the dominant southern hemisphere tree during the Early Triassic period.|$|E
25|$|Ligatures are {{groups of}} notes written together, usually {{indicating}} melismatic singing {{of the same}} syllable over several notes. Ligature forms exist only for the larger note values from the semibreve upwards. Their use in mensural notation was a <b>holdover</b> from the earlier modal rhythmic system, of which they inherited some of their rhythmic meaning.|$|E
25|$|Obregón {{and other}} Sonorans were deeply {{suspicious}} of Carranza's Secretary of War, Felipe Ángeles, because they considered Ángeles to be a <b>holdover</b> {{of the old}} Díaz regime. At the urging of the Sonorans (the most powerful group in Carranza's coalition following Obregón's victories in the Northwest), Carranza downgraded Ángeles {{to the position of}} Sub-Secretary of War.|$|E

25|$|Tom Brass {{argues that}} unfree labour {{is not an}} archaic <b>holdover</b> in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of {{agricultural}} workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{coaching}} staff underwent a revamp with Jong Uichico, from sister team San Miguel Beer, taking over coaching duties from Tanquingcen. Tanquingcen became assistant coach, along with Art Dela Cruz and Juno Sauler.
