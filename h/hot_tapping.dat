40|$|ABSTRACT. Welding on {{in-service}} pipelines (<b>hot</b> <b>tapping)</b> {{has been}} prac-ticed {{for many years}} on pipes containing both liquids and gases. The increasing frequency of sour conditions within gas and oil pipelines increases the risks in-volved in welding on pressure-contain-ing lines and imposes additional re-straints {{in the form of}} maximum tolerable hardness, especially in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). While there are existing pro-cedures to deal with the cooling rate ef-fects of the liquid or gas contained within a pipeline, little is known {{of the effects of the}} physical properties of the liquid or gas on the cooling rates to be expected. Most experimental work on procedure verification has been done on still or cir-culating water as the working fluid. In this study, a pressurized test coupon of X- 52 -type pipe was filled with liquids of differing physical properties — water, ethylene glycol, methanol, water-glycol mixtures and water-methanol mixtures. Thermocouples monitored inside wall-temperature changes caused by mecha-nized GTAW autogenous fusion runs on the pipe surface, and optical pyrometer measurements were used to assess out-side wall temperature cycles. The results show both the working fluid physical properties and the pipe pressure conditions affect the weld zone cooling rate to a significant degree. It is possible to control cooling rates on the inside and outside walls of the pipe by adjusting working fluid properties and in-ternal pressure conditions. Low-hydrogen SMAW deposits were compared to the autogenous GTAW runs for limited but practical repair procedural conditions. This showed the expected heat input increase due to more efficient SMAW arc conditions is about 25 %. This difference is somewhat lower than the usual GTAW/SMAW arc efficiency com-parisons in the literature. It indicates the necessity for more trials incorporating the range of welding process parameters to be considered in evaluating the work-ing fluid cooling characteristics. Once the heat input relationships for various processes are established, the cooling rate control possible with various working fluid compositions can be uti-lized to assess procedure qualification in a controlled engineering environment. A procedure qualification involving the modified water-ethylene glycol working fluid has been used to make a nozzle to pipe weld on an active sour gas pipeline during the Canadian winter...|$|E

The water in the alternate <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> is generally heated with a heating element and stored in a hot tank (much like the traditional hot water heaters used in residential homes). Additionally, the <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> is usually equipped with a push-in safety valve to prevent burns from an accidental or inadvertent pressing of the lever.|$|R
40|$|Ambitions in {{exploration}} {{of oil and}} gas fields at deeper water depth require continuous investigation and maintenance. The transportation pipelines laid in deep waters are both subjected to corrosion and buckling due to environmental phenomena. They may also often undergo branching (namely <b>hot</b> <b>tapping)</b> to redirect (or add to) the transportation paths. Mechanical joints and welding are both considered as available alternatives when sectioning and replacement of the pipes at shallow waters is necessary, yet, welding is more promising for deep waters where remote operation is central. Fusion welding on the other hand comprises several technological detractions for sound operations under high ambient pressures disregarding its low cost and flexibility. The foremost detracting phenomenon in the arc welding is called ‘arc root constriction’, which is defined as arc geometry shrinkage under the increased pressure. Consequently, the power delivery to the weld pool at different pressure levels is a major worry. Effects of ionization and dissociation energies of different gases and mixtures, partial pressure of environmental gases including hydrogen and oxygen, gasification and degasification of the weld metal, inclusions that affect the phase transformation, absorption and desorption kinetics, oxidation and deoxidation reactions and many more are the phenomena that can possibly be altered by the gas type and ambient pressure level. Spattering and fume generation is a problematic issue since the arc is rather unstable under high pressure. Thus, seeking the effect of different chamber gas mixtures on welding parameters, final microstructure and mechanical properties is the main objective of this work. Statistical analysis of the collected voltage and current waveforms is carried out to identify the source of arc misbehavior and instability (discussed in Paper I). The stochastic parameters is related to the electrical stability and resolved into a number of varying welding parameters. The datasets are representing the effects of using pure argon under 14 incrementally increased pressure levels. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is used to characterize the frequency domain of the waveforms. Auto-correlation Function (AF) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) were calculated assuming the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Considering the AF, it is possible to visualize the deteriorating stability of the arc. The rate of stability degradation is quite gentle after 20 bar, though, huge differences were observed from 1 to 20 bar. The characteristic frequencies of 100 - 150 Hz and 350 - 400 Hz were observed. The first range can be associated with the mass transfer or molten droplet launch frequency and the latter range is representative of the rectified mains. The spread of large low-frequency peaks at higher pressures is illustrating the mass transfer deterioration. The aforementioned peaks were found above 125 bar where the range of the characteristic frequency peaks in voltage and current waveforms started to deviate. The calculated arc power is higher at high-pressure range while the weld bead geometry was barely varied. It implies that the arc efficiency factor decreases at high pressures. The heat source dimensions and heat efficiency factor are two major inputs for finite element (FE) simulations of the weld. However, a systematic classification of these factors was hardly available prior to this work. Additionally, to the best of author’s knowledge, the direct high-speed observation of the arc inside the hyperbaric welding chamber has not been investigated in detail by far due to several technological issues. The varying bead-on-plate welds including the end crater appearance can possibly be good candidates to categorize the FE heat source dimensions. Double-ellipsoidal heat source (Goldak’s Model) was implemented in WeldSimS® FE code that is used in this study. Since the model incorporates two superimposed reference heat sources, the amount of dissipated heat from each source should be differentiated. An intermediate heat source model was employed for this purpose. The latter model is after Myhr and Grong that is called distributed point heat sources. This model can be accurately fit to the weld cross section geometry if calibrated accurately. The calibrated parameters were found to be very close to the ones required by Double-ellipsoidal heat source model. By using this approach, not only the effect of welding parameters on weld bead geometry can be categorized, but also the spent time for double-ellipsoidal heat source adjustments will be cut by 90 %. A Gaussian heat source was also employed for welding thermal cycle simulations. Accompanying experiments suggested that the thermal gradients hardly change as pressure elevates. However, {{it was found that the}} increased pressure level might not necessarily result in higher or lower cooling rates despite the geometrical changes. In a parallel investigation, the metallurgical effect of different shielding environments on phase transformation and mechanical properties of the bead-onplate weld samples was studies. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) techniques were used to identify the effect of five different shielding environments on the phase transformation. Argon and Helium chamber gases offer the conditions that facilitate the highest amount of acicular ferrite transformation, yet, they show some differences in a number of crystallographic details. CO 2 gas provided conditions for a lot of porosity in addition to the dominant polygonal ferrite/bainite transformation. He+½CO 2 mixture resulted in bainite transformation that was found to follow the maximum heat flow direction in terms of crystallographic orientations. Very small sized tensile and single-edged notch bending (SENB) samples were machined from the weld metal material. The tests revealed that the best mechanical properties are associated with the He chamber gas and the poorest properties were presented by the samples welded in He+½CO 2 shielding environment. It was also observed that there is a good correlation between the acquired acoustic signals and the fracture properties of the weld sample...|$|E

40|$|Drinking water {{disinfection}} byproducts (DBP) are {{a group of}} inorganic and organic compounds formed during {{water disinfection}}. Epidemiologic studies suggest an association between rectal, and colon cancer and exposure to DBPs in chlorinated surface water. Therefore, DBPs are a growing public health concern; {{one that has been}} mitigated by multiple regulations of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule (Stage 2 DBPR). Tremendous efforts and cost have been spent on controlling DBPs in drinking water; however, human exposure has been poorly characterized. In addition to ingestion exposure, inhalation and dermal absorption during showering for example could also be significant exposure pathways. This dissertation focuses on investigating DBP formation and degradation in heated water (~ 50 oC) in both lab simulated tests and field studies. The first objective of this dissertation was to investigate the temporal variability of regulated DBPs and non-regulated DBPs in cold and <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water at a residential home, in a water plant and in a simulated distribution system test. The results showed that the residence time of water in hot water tanks plays an important role on the formation and degradation of DBPs in the hot water plumbing. There was no obvious difference between the concentrations of TCAA (trichloroacetic acid) in long-heated <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water and cold tap water. The terminal DBPs for cold and <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water were measured and compared to the instantaneous DBP formation in cold and <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water. The heating of tap water in the water tank was found to increase the extent of THM formation. The second objective of this dissertation was to investigate the impact of heating scenarios on the formation and degradation of DBPs. A field study involving homes equipped with either tankless heaters or tank heaters was conducted. The concentrations of DBPs were measured for cold and <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water of each home. A lab-controlled heating test was later on set up to investigate the formation and degradation of DBPs in short term and long term heating to understand the difference in DBP concentrations in the <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water out of different types of water heaters. The results from the field study revealed that the differences in DBP levels in the <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water out of the two types of heaters were statistically significant for chlorine residual, total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), dichloroacetic acids (DCAA), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), trichloroproprane (TCP) and chloropicrin (CP). Bench scale heating tests showed that long term heating changed the concentrations of DBPs significantly. The third objective of this dissertation was to investigate the thermal formation and degradation in various conditions. Especially, the impact of water age on DBP formation and degradation in cold and heated water was investigated. The results of this study demonstrate that DBP concentration profiles in heated water were quite different from the DBP concentrations in the cold tap water. Chloroform concentrations in the heated water remained constant or even decreased slightly with increasing distribution system water age, despite the fact that its levels always increased with water age in the cold water. The final objective of this dissertation was to propose a method to model chlorine decay, not only in the distribution system, but also applicable to home heating scenarios. A robust two-site chlorine decay model of combined effects of pH, temperature in water distribution system and heating condition was proposed. A single set of readily interpretable parameters were estimated by stochastic search using differential evolution...|$|R

Pre- and post-program general population random surveys (N = 337 and 318, respectively) found increased awareness of the danger of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water, from 72 per cent to 89 per cent, but no increase in testing or lowering of water heater temperatures. A third random sample survey (N = 325) among thermometer requesters found a higher rate of testing (difference 58. 1 per cent, 95 per cent CL 55. 3 per cent, 60. 9 per cent) than in the general population. Of those who tested, 43 per cent reported temperatures in the dangerous range of 54. 4 degrees C (130 degrees F) or greater; 52 per cent of this group lowered their water heater thermostat. These findings indicate that: more than 25 per cent of the public is unaware of the potential danger of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water; a safety education program which increases awareness will not necessarily result in injury-control behavior; and most people motivated to request a free thermometer will test their hot water temperature and lower it if necessary.

A large fraction of this cost today as the buildings {{become more and more}} energy efficient is the cost of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water. The study in this report looks into the potential for energy savings from grey wastewater. It is here looked at the amount of energy which can be recovered from hot water leaving the building and reused for pre heating of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water and heating of building. The unit which would recover this energy {{is referred to as the}} grey-water heat recovery unit in this report. A residential building with three floors where each floor has one washing machine, one shower and one dishwasher has been as the case building for the report. The total living area of the building is 450 m 2. In the case building used in this report as much as 17. 1 % of the total used energy goes to heating of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water. By installing a heat recovery system which can recover some of the energy stored in the used hot water which leaves the building, this this could be reduced to 10. 9 % of the total used energy according to simulations done in SIMIEN. There are also possibilities of using this energy for heating of the building as well as pre heating of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water. There are a few different solutions for implementing a grey-water heat recovery unit which could give different energy recovery between 2 716 kWh/year to 3 759 kWh/year. The best solution would be to connect the grey-water heat recovery unit to pre-heating of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water, heating of the building as well as installing an accumulation tank to store recovered energy in. The most simple solution which would give the lowest amount of recovered energy would be to just connect the grey-water heat recovery unit to pre heating of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water. In this report two different simulation programs have been used, EnergyPlus and SIMIEN, to find what impact the energy reduction would have on the building and to see if the simulations would correspond to the theoretical estimates done in this report. The theoretical estimates based on equations for heat recovery and measured data for energy use in the case building gave a little bit better results than the simulated results for the same case building. Although there is a difference both gave a positive indication that a heat recovery unit would not only reduce the energy consumption but also reduce the annual operating cost of a building. The investment cost for a heat recovery system could be a bit large for small buildings compared to the annual savings but for larger buildings the investment cost could be substantially higher. Regarding the energy as much as 87. 7 % of the energy stored in the grey-water could be recovered for a system with an accumulation tank and a connection to the buildings heating system. For a system without the accumulation tank and district heating as the energy source it would have a theoretical efficiency of 76. 7 % and a simulated efficiency of 63. 3 % when simulated in EnergyPlus. </p...|$|R

The PRS equipment was upgraded to max. 600 MSW in 1994 - 95 and due to the Ormen Lange field at 860 MSW, Statoil upgraded the PIF (Pipeline Intervention Frame) /HTCU range to 1000 MSW in 2008 - 09. The main objective for this master thesis was to evaluate the HTCU system for extending water depth capability to 3000 MSW. The main purpose of the report was to describe current design as used during the Åsgard Subsea Compression Project (ÅSCP) in 2012 at 265 MSW, discuss general improvement issues, establish the 3000 MSW design basis and identify necessary upgrades for 3000 MSW operation. The master thesis included performing a literature study on the topic, conduct interviews with people of different professional backgrounds in the industry, reviewing components, reviewing the ÅSCP, evaluating results, reviewing and evaluating improvements to existing design, as well as assessing 3000 MSW upgrade requirements. The most critical components extending water depth capability to 3000 MSW are the control cards and the reverse pressure differential challenge on seals and drive shaft...|$|R
40|$|Burns are devastating injuries, {{and have}} been {{identified}} as a priority for prevention by the World Health Organization. Fire-related burn injuries are responsible for the majority of burn-related deaths and scalds are the major cause of morbidity. This thesis examines the impact of public policy and community practice on the prevention of <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water scalds and residential fire-related injuries, and of research evidence on community knowledge of the optimal application of first aid to a burn. These issues are explored in the New South Wales context using a variety of methodologies. To identify the optimal case selection criteria to identify burns cases from ICD- 10 coded data, a methodological review of commonly used criteria was conducted. Two population-based epidemiological studies were undertaken to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water regulations and smoke alarm legislation. Semi-structured surveys of plumbers, plumbing students and regulators were conducted to investigate resulting changes in practice. To evaluate the community impact of the smoke alarm legislation and first aid knowledge, data from a state-wide population-based CATI survey was used. Results indicate that that routinely used case selection criteria potentially under-numerate burn injury cases by a quarter. Following the introduction of temperature regulations hospitalisation rates have decreased, although <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water scalds remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The plumbing industry surveys highlight that there are deficiencies in knowledge about the benefit of the heated water temperature regulation and a perceived lack of support in the general population. The strengthening of the smoke alarm legislation demonstrates a positive effect on both rate of hospitalisations and smoke alarm ownership although high risk groups remain. Finally, the survey of knowledge of burns first aid indicates that only a minority of the population know the optimal time for cooling a burn injury and other appropriate first aid steps, highlighting a failure of diffusion of new research findings. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that although burn injuries remain an important public health issue in NSW, prevention strategies to reduce burn injuries have had a positive impact; and highlights areas where further prevention efforts can be focused to maximise these gains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Each {{year in the}} UK 2000 {{children}} attend emergency departments and 500 are admitted to hospital following a bath water scald. The long term effects can include disability, disfigurement or psychological harm and repeated skin grafts may be required as the child grows. The costs of treating a severe scald are estimated at 250, 000 GBP. Children living in the most deprived wards are at greatest risk of thermal injuries; hospital admission rates are three times that for children living in the least deprived wards. Domestic hot water, which is usually stored at around 60 degrees Celsius, {{can result in a}} second-degree burn after 3 seconds and a third-degree burn after 5 seconds. Educational strategies to encourage testing of tap water temperature and reduction of hot water thermostat settings have largely proved unsuccessful. Legislation in the USA mandating pre-setting hot water heater thermostats at 49 degrees Celsius was effective in reducing scald injuries, suggesting passive measures may have a greater impact. Thermostatic mixer valves (TMVs), recently developed for the domestic market, fitted across the hot and cold water supply pipes of the bath, allow delivery of water set at a fixed temperature from the <b>hot</b> bath <b>tap.</b> These valves therefore offer the potential to reduce scald injuries. Design/Methods A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of TMVs in reducing bath <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water temperatures in the homes of families with young children in rented social housing. Two parallel arms include an intervention group and a control group where the intervention will be deferred. The intervention will consist of fitting a TMV (set at 44 degrees Celsius) by a qualified plumber and provision of educational materials. The control arm will not receive a TMV or the educational materials for the study duration but will be offered the intervention after collection of follow-up data 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure will be the bath <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water temperature. Fifteen families per arm are required to detect a reduction in the mean bath <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water temperature from 60. 4 degrees Celsius (SD 9. 1) in the control group to 46 degrees Celsius in the intervention group, with 90 % power and a 5 % significance level (2 sided). Secondary outcome measures including acceptability will require a sample size of 120 participants. Discussion Whilst TMVs have the potential to reduce scald injuries, to date there have been no randomised controlled trials assessing their effectiveness, acceptability and cost effectiveness.
