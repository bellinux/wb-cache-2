5|$|Juvenile loggerheads {{share the}} Sargassum habitat {{with a variety}} of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 {{different}} species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Some of the prey, such as ants, flies, bugs, leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the wind to these areas. plant prey of the mats include barnacles, small crab larvae, <b>fish</b> <b>eggs,</b> and plantonn colonies. Marine mammals and commercial fish, such as tuna, also inhabit the mats.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), <b>fish</b> <b>eggs,</b> clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, <b>fish</b> (<b>eggs,</b> juveniles, and adults), {{hatchling}} turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E

40|$|The current {{knowledge}} about teleost <b>fish</b> <b>egg</b> envelope is summarized. The paper analyzes {{the organization and}} deposition process of the protein composition and genes involved in the synthesis of teleost <b>fish</b> <b>egg</b> envelopes and their role in gamete interaction during fertilization. Pelagic and demersal species that our research group is working with are especially considered. The vertebrate ZP family of proteins, the evolution and relationship among the different genes and their expression are taken into account. We consider fish envelope as a possible biomonitor for ecological contaminants. The biotechnological applications for aquaculture and genomic and post-genomic approaches are auspicious...|$|R
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and <b>fish</b> <b>eggs.</b> Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a broader}} {{spectrum}} of higher animal taxa {{in the sea}} than on land, many marine species {{have yet to be}} discovered, and the number known to science is expanding annually. Some vertebrates such as seabirds, seals, and sea turtles return to the land to breed but fish, cetaceans, and sea snakes have a completely aquatic lifestyle and many invertebrate phyla are entirely marine. In fact, the oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats. One of these is the surface film which—despite being tossed about by the movement of waves—provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria, fungi, microalgae, protozoa, <b>fish</b> <b>eggs,</b> and various larvae.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of <b>fish</b> <b>eggs,</b> suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E
50|$|The egg-sucking leech is an {{artificial}} fly used in fly fishing. Its {{name comes from}} its resemblance to a leech {{in the process of}} consuming a <b>fish</b> <b>egg.</b> The body of the lure is dark-colored like a leech, often black or purple, and the tip of the lure is bright red or orange to look like a small rounded <b>fish</b> <b>egg.</b> It is effective for catching fish which might be interested in prey items such as leeches. It is popular for steelhead fishing. This fly can be used to capture salmon, trout, bass, pike, and many other species of fish.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} is performed {{in this study}} to determine the appropriate size of material for a semi-permeable fish control structure that the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation is proposing along the Colorado River between Beal Lake and Topock Marsh. This type of control structure will allow sufficient water to pass through and {{meet the demands of}} the downstream pumping system that is used for hydrologic restoration, while at the same time, preventing nonnative predatory <b>fish</b> larvae and <b>eggs</b> from passing through the structure. This study is unique in that most previous studies have focused on prevent large organisms from passing through the control structures. Experiments were performed in the UNLV Hydraulics Laboratory to determine whether <b>fish</b> larvae or <b>eggs</b> will pass through the structure. <b>Fish</b> <b>egg</b> surrogates that have a diameter of approximately 0. 8 to 1. 0 mm were used in the laboratory. Preliminary results suggest that 0. 375 inch material is able to filter 100 % of a <b>fish</b> <b>egg</b> surrogate, and 0. 5 inch material is able to filter approximately 95 % of the <b>fish</b> <b>egg</b> surrogate. This size material is sufficient to meet downstream hydraulic demands. Future studies will focus on the overall design of a composite filter with various gradation of material and the investigation of the potential clogging of the filter will be investigated in field tests...|$|R
