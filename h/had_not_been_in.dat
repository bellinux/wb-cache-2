Morales {{admitted}} that they had had a son (who had died in infancy), but denied vehemently any granting of favors and said he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with Zapata Montaño since 2007.|$|E

Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered {{for a few}} weeks to receive {{assurance}} that it still applied to him even though he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Pacino {{was born}} in the East Harlem {{neighborhood}} of New York City, to Sicilian-American parents Salvatore and Rose (née Gerardi) Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His mother then took him to The Bronx to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, had come from a town in Sicily named Corleone. His father, who was from San Fratello of Sicily, moved to Covina, California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur, and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> his life since then.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} people of Scots descent who sought {{adventure}} and success at that time, Tod joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He left England for India in 1799 {{and in doing so}} followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although Tod senior <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Company but had instead owned an indigo plantation at Mirzapur. The young Tod journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon patronage. He was appointed lieutenant in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting {{as a member of the}} escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and Resident to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of captain and was commanding the escort.|$|E
5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch {{should be returned to}} the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{returned}} from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four {{home runs in}} three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees' league lead. Despite DiMaggio's return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained Johnny Mize from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on the Yankees, and tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, {{the first time the}} Yankees <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> sole possession of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in a makeup game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire {{for the first time in}} Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.|$|E
5|$|First, {{the waves}} of Norse {{colonisation}} of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English {{seems to have been}} in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).|$|E

5|$|Order {{began to}} be {{restored}} on Thursday. The New York State Militia and some federal troops were returned to New York, including the 152nd New York Volunteers, the 26th Michigan Volunteers, the 27th Indiana Volunteers and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia from Frederick, Maryland, after a forced march. In addition, the governor sent in the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York State Militia, which <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> federal service, and {{a section of the}} 20th Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck. The New York State Militia units were the first to arrive. By July 16, there were several thousand Federal troops in the city.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|Miler {{started his}} {{campaign}} for Test selection when the servicemen arrived in Perth and played their first match against Western Australia. Miller put in his best batting performance {{of the season with}} an 80 in a drawn match, before being rested in the match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, which again ended in a draw. Miller finally returned to his home town on 2 January 1946 and was reunited with family and friends before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 as the military men fell to an innings defeat, troubled by the off spin of Ian Johnson. Miller and the servicemen had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. Miller faced his biggest challenge in Australian conditions in his quest for Test selection when he went out to bat. The Australian selectors <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> England for the Victory Tests to witness his ability and Miller had not played to his potential on Australian soil. Local Australian opinion was that because the Services had played poorly in Australia, their achievements in England must have been against poor opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} work on Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii, Masahiro Sakurai {{was taken}} out for a meal by Nintendo's then-CEO Satoru Iwata in July 2008. During their meal, Iwata asked Sakurai to develop a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was still in early development at the time, with Sakurai being the first external staff member to learn of its existence. On his way home, Sakurai was faced with both ideas and problems: Sora Ltd., which had developed Super Smash Bros. Brawl, had been drastically reduced in size {{as most of the}} game's staff had been either from other Nintendo teams or outsourced. While he had the option to creating an easy-to-develop port for the system, Sakurai decided to create a game around the third-person shooter genre, which was unpopular in Japan yet seemed suited to the planned 3D effects of the 3DS. At this point, the project was still an original game. In later conversations with Iwata, Sakurai decided to use an existing Nintendo IP as the game's basis. This was inspired by feedback received from players of Super Smash Bros. Brawl that many members of its character roster <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> an original game for some time. After a positive response from Iwata at the suggestion, Sakurai ran through the possible franchises and decided to use Kid Icarus due to its long absence from the gaming market and continued popularity in the West. He also decided upon him due to his involvement with the character through Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Once he had chosen a possible series, he conceived the basic sequence of five-minute aerial segments, ground-based combat and bosses at the end of chapters. After submitting his plan, Sakurai was given the go-ahead to develop the game. One of the other franchises under consideration by Sakurai for use in the game was Star Fox, but he felt that there were some restrictions in implementing the planned gameplay features within the Star Fox setting. Uprising was the first Kid Icarus game to be developed since the Western-exclusive 1991 Game Boy title , and the first to be planned for Japan since the original Kid Icarus in 1986.|$|E
