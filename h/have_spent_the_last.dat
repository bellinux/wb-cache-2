25|$|Regarding the ruling, Diane Duke, CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, stated,While this {{intermediate}} decision allows that condoms may be mandated, it doesn’t {{mean they}} should be. We <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two years {{fighting for the}} rights of adult performers {{to make their own decisions}} about their bodies, and against the stigma against adult film performers embodied in the statute. Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate pushes a legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.|$|E
25|$|Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and {{his partner}} Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an {{international}} hitman that has always eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may {{turn out the lights}} in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E
25|$|Salvian {{continued}} his friendly intercourse with both father and sons {{long after the}} latter had left his care; it was to Salonius (then a bishop) that he wrote his explanatory letter just {{after the publication of}} his treatise Ad ecclesiam; and to the same prelate a few years later he dedicated his great work, the De gubernatione Dei ("The Government of God"). If French scholars are right in assigning Hilary's Vita Honorati to 430, Salvian, who is there called a priest, had probably already left Lyons for Marseilles, where he is known to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> years of his life (Gennadius, ap. Migne, lviii. 1099). It was probably from Marseilles that he wrote his first letter — presumably to Lerins — begging the community there to receive his kinsman, the son of a widow of Cologne, who had been reduced to poverty by the barbarian invasions. It seems a fair inference that Salvian had divested himself of all his property in favour of that society and sent his relative to Lerins for assistance (Ep. i., with which compare Ad eccles. ii. 9, 10; iii. 5). It has been conjectured that Salvian paid a visit to Carthage; but this is a mere inference based on the minute details he gives of the state of this city just before its fall to the Vandals (De gub. vii. viii). He seems to have been still living at Marseilles when Gennadius wrote under the papacy of Gelasius (492-496).|$|E
