A number of other domain-based and cross-domain research and operational observing systems also provide important contributions and encompass both in-situ and satellite observations. GCOS is both supported by and supports the international scientific and technical community, and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) co-sponsors the expert panels set up by GCOS for the atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial domains.

50|$|An {{example of}} a {{particularly}} successful step forward in implementing a <b>global</b> <b>observing</b> <b>system</b> for climate is the initiation of a reference network for upper-air observations - the GCOS Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN). The network is the prototype of a hybrid observing system, combining operational upper-air measurement sites with research sites and providing high-quality reference data for atmospheric profiles. GRUAN sites are undertaking high-quality atmospheric profile measurements that will help understand trends in upper-air ECVs, assist in investigating processes in the upper-troposphere and lower stratosphere, and provide data for calibrating satellite measurements and validating independent climate analyses and models. At GRUAN sites, the principles of quality, traceability and complete error characterization have been heeded, for {{at least part of}} the observing programme. The network is planned to grow over its initial size of 15 stations in coming years; introducing climate quality standards to a larger number of sites.|$|E
50|$|The Second Climate Conference {{was held}} on 29 October to 7 November 1990, again in Geneva. It was an {{important}} step towards a global climate treaty and somewhat more political than the first conference. The main task of the conference was to review the WCP {{set up by the}} first conference. The IPCC first assessment report had been completed in time for this conference. The scientists and technology experts at the conference issued a strong statement highlighting the risk of climate change. The conference issued a Ministerial Declaration only after hard bargaining over a number of difficult issues; the declaration disappointed many of the participating scientists as well as some observers because it did not offer a high level of commitment. Eventually, however, developments at the conference led to the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), of which the Kyoto Protocol is a part, and to the establishment of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), a <b>global</b> <b>observing</b> <b>system</b> of systems for climate and climate-related observations.|$|E

40|$|Several global {{quantities}} are {{computed from}} the ERA 40 reanalysis {{for the period}} 1958 - 2001 and explored for trends. These {{are discussed in the}} context of changes to the <b>global</b> <b>observing</b> <b>system.</b> Temperature, integrated water vapor (IWV), and kinetic energy are considered. The ERA 40 global mean temperature in the lower troposphere has a trend of + 0. 11 K per decade over the period of 1979 - 2001, which is slightly higher than the MSU measurements, but within the estimated error limit. For the period 1958 2001 the warming trend is 0. 14 K per decade but this is likely to be an artifact of changes in the observing system. When this is corrected for, the warming trend is reduced to 0. 10 K per decade. The global trend in IWV for the period 1979 - 2001 is + 0. 36 mm per decade. This is about twice as high as the trend determined from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation assuming conservation of relative humidity. It is also larger than results from free climate model integrations driven by the same observed sea surface temperature as used in ERA 40. It is suggested that the large trend in IWV does not represent a genuine climate trend but an artifact caused by changes in the <b>global</b> <b>observing</b> <b>system</b> {{such as the use of}} SSM/I and more satellite soundings in later years. Recent results are in good agreement with GPS measurements. The IWV trend for the period 1958 - 2001 is still higher but reduced to + 0. 16 mm per decade when corrected for changes in the observing systems. Total kinetic energy shows an increasing global trend. Results from data assimilation experiments strongly suggest that this trend is also incorrect and mainly caused by the huge changes in the <b>global</b> <b>observing</b> <b>system</b> in 1979. When this is corrected for, no significant change in global kinetic energy from 1958 onward can be foun...|$|E
