5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> <b>is</b> described as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion {{does not appear to}} have significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> <b>is</b> seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and <b>it</b> <b>often</b> <b>is)</b> the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

Germination is slow, taking {{four to six}} weeks, and <b>it</b> <b>often</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult}} because of furanocoumarins in its seed coat.

25|$|Although {{the first}} season of Sports Night is a sitcom, <b>it</b> <b>often</b> <b>is</b> portrayed {{as more of a}} comedy-drama {{representative}} of some of Sorkin's later work on The West Wing. Sorkin intended for the series' humor to be drier and more realistic than typical sitcoms. He initially wanted the show to be recorded without a laugh track, but ABC network executives insisted on including one. The volume of the laugh track faded as Season One continued and was abandoned at the beginning of Season Two.|$|E

500|$|Although {{only one}} of these {{inscriptions}} is explicitly Christian (vivas in deo), inscriptions on silver spoons comprising a name followed by vivas or vivat usually can be identified as Christian in other late Roman hoards; for example the Mildenhall Treasure has five spoons, three with Chi-Rho monograms, and two with vivas inscriptions (PASCENTIA VIVAS and PAPITTEDO VIVAS). The formula vir bone vivas also occurs on a spoon from the Thetford Hoard, but whereas the Thetford Hoard spoons have mostly pagan inscriptions (e.g. Dei Fau Medugeni [...] "of the god Faunus Medugenus [...] "), the Hoxne Hoard does not have any inscriptions of a specifically pagan nature, and the hoard may be considered to have come from a Christian household (or households). <b>It</b> <b>often</b> <b>is</b> assumed that Roman spoons with Chi-Rho monograms or the vivas in deo formula are either christening spoons (perhaps presented at adult baptism) or were used in the Eucharist ceremony, but that is not certain.|$|E

2500|$|In vehicle racing, {{nitrous oxide}} (often {{referred}} to as just [...] "nitrous") allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen than air alone, resulting in a more powerful combustion.

Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>often</b> <b>is</b> mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate.
