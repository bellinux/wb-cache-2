5|$|As he <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> title, Kepler {{thought he}} had {{revealed}} God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|As <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> table below, each basin uses a {{separate}} system of terminology, {{which can make}} comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur.

5|$|The {{historical}} {{period for}} Giselle is not <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Opéra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It {{is also possible}} that Pillet had the ballet's budget in mind and decided to use the many Renaissance-style costumes in the Opéra's wardrobe for Giselle. These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's William Tell (1829) and Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Opéra until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist {{by the time of the}} first Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail transit, mail service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E

5|$|As <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temple records, {{the priests}} {{of the temple}} were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a {{religious}} group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (<b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} when Monteverdi {{received}} the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was being prepared for performance in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work was written for a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were sponsoring the opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise costs. As was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The brown roll-rim was {{described}} by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1785 as Agaricus contiguus, although the 1786 combination Agaricus involutus of August Batsch is taken as the first valid description. James Bolton published a description {{of what he called}} Agaricus adscendibus in 1788; the taxonomical authority Index Fungorum considers this to be synonymous with P.involutus. Additional synonyms include Omphalia involuta described by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, and Rhymovis involuta, published by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844. The species gained its current binomial name in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries erected the genus Paxillus, and set it as the type species. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January1, 1821, to coincide with the date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required sanction by Fries (<b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name by a colon) to be considered valid. It was thus written Paxillus involutus (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the Species Plantarum. Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.|$|E
5|$|The co-main event {{featured}} a bout between two top contenders and undefeated light heavyweights, Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva.

Silva is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, but prefers to fight standing. Machida entered the UFC 94 fight following a unanimous decision victory over former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz at UFC 84, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards.
