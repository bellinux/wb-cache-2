40|$|Gallium nitride (GaN) and {{sapphire}} {{are important}} materials for fabricating photonic {{devices such as}} high brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs). These materials are strongly resistant to wet chemical etching and also, low etch rates restrict the use of dry etching. Thus, to develop alternative high resolution processing and machining techniques for these materials is important in fabricating novel photonic devices. In this work, a repetitively pulsed UV copper vapour laser (255 nm) {{has been used to}} machine and dice sapphire, GaN and micro LED devices. Machining parameters were optimised so as to achieve controllable machining and high resolution. For sapphire, well-defined grooves 30 μm wide and 430 μm deep were machined. For GaN, precision features such as holes on a tens of micron length scale have been fabricated. By using this technique, compact micro LED chips with a <b>die</b> <b>spacing</b> 100 and a 430 μm thick sapphire substrate have been successfully diced. Measurements show that the performances of LED devices are not influenced by the UV laser machining. Our results demonstrate that the pulsed UV copper vapour laser is a powerful tool for micromachining and dicing of photonic materials and devices. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|Because memory {{performance}} is the limiting factor in many benchmarks, VIA processors implement large primary caches, large TLBs, and aggressive prefetching, among other enhancements.

5000|$|Generally, clock {{frequency}} is favored over increasing instructions per cycle. Complex {{features such as}} out-of-order instruction execution are deliberately not implemented, because they impact the ability to increase the clock rate, {{require a lot of}} extra <b>die</b> <b>space</b> and power, and have little impact on performance in several common application scenarios.|$|R
50|$|A larger buffer can, in theory, {{increase}} throughput. However, if {{the processor}} has a branch misprediction then the entire buffer {{may need to}} be flushed, wasting a lot of clock cycles and reducing the effectiveness. Furthermore, larger buffers create more heat and use more <b>die</b> <b>space.</b> For this reason processor designers today favour a multi-threaded design approach.|$|R

40|$|Increasingly {{aggressive}} pipelining achieves diminishing returns. Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) {{attempts to}} exploit the fact that functional units are frequently idle.

50|$|Microprocessors {{began to}} appear in the early 1970s. Even though {{transistors}} had become smaller, there was often insufficient <b>die</b> <b>space</b> for a full-word-width ALU and, as a result, some early microprocessors employed a narrow ALU that required multiple cycles per machine language instruction. Examples of this includes the popular Zilog Z80, which performed eight-bit additions with a four-bit ALU. Over time, transistor geometries shrank further, following Moore's law, and it became feasible to build wider ALUs on microprocessors.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The {{design of}} mixed-signal {{integrated}} circuits {{has evolved from}} simple analog and digital circuits operating on the same silicon substrate {{to the point that}} now we have complete system on a chip solutions for communication systems. The levels of integration needed to remain cost effective in today's integrated circuit (IC) market require careful use of all the available <b>die</b> <b>space.</b> The current trend of digital to analog converter (DAC) design has focused on maximizing speed and linearity for high performance telecommunications systems. The circuit design methods used to achieve very high sample rates require the use of large amounts of <b>die</b> <b>space.</b> This thesis presents a 10 -bit DAC that has been optimized for area, while still maintaining accurate operation at low frequencies. To achieve 10 -bit performance, an ultra high gain op-amp is introduced for various servoing applications in the DAC. The architecture chosen for the DAC will show an optimization of required die size and performance when compared to other architectures. The DAC was fabricated in a standard digital 0. 18 μm CMOS process. The DAC occupies 0. 0104 mm² (110 μm x 94 μm), and only consumes 2. 8 mW of power. In addition to the 10 -bit DAC, a design is presented for a 13 -bit DAC which occupies 0. 020 mm², and requires only the addition of a minimum number of devices to the 10 -bit DAC...|$|R

It is also suitable for DSP-like tasks where data could be fed directly on chip (from an FPGA or other ASIC) without having to create buffers in temporary memory as for a GPU), making it ideal for robotics & other intelligent sensor applications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This letter {{outlines}} {{a simultaneous}} actuation and displacement sensing technique {{applied to a}} microelectromechan-ical system (MEMS) electrostatic drive. Using the same elec-trostatic drive for both actuation and sensing allows more <b>die</b> <b>space</b> to be dedicated to the electrostatic drive, increasing the effective transduction efficiency of both functions and simplify-ing the mechanical design. Displacement sensing is performed with capacitive measurement implemented by incorporating the drive into an LC oscillator. This provides the mapping from displacement-to-capacitance to frequency-to-voltage. The technique was applied to a MEMS nanopositioner and the sensor exhibited no dynamics over the bandwidth of the device. The sensitivity of the sensor was 0. 7551 V µm− 1 and had a displacement noise floor of 0. 00836 nmrms...|$|R
5000|$|The Kepler {{architecture}} {{employs a}} new Streaming Multiprocessor Architecture called SMX. The SMX {{are the key}} method for Kepler's power efficiency as the whole GPU uses a single [...] "Core Clock" [...] rather than the double-pump [...] "Shader Clock". The SMX usage of a single unified clock increases the GPU power efficiency {{due to the fact}} that two Kepler CUDA Cores consume 90% power of one Fermi CUDA Core. Consequently, the SMX needs additional processing units to execute a whole warp per cycle. Kepler also needed to increase raw GPU performance as to remain competitive. As a result, it doubled the CUDA Cores from 16 to 32 per CUDA array, 3 CUDA Cores Array to 6 CUDA Cores Array, 1 load/store and 1 SFU group to 2 load/store and 2 SFU group. The GPU processing resources are also double. From 2 warp schedulers to 4 warp schedulers, 4 dispatch unit became 8 and the register file doubled to 64K entries as to increase performance. With the doubling of GPU processing units and resources increasing the usage of <b>die</b> <b>spaces,</b> The capability of the PolyMorph Engine aren't double but enhanced, making it capable of spurring out a polygon in 2 cycles instead of 4. With Kepler, Nvidia not only worked on power efficiency but also on area efficiency. Therefore, Nvidia opted to use eight dedicated FP64 CUDA cores in a SMX as to save <b>die</b> <b>space,</b> while still offering FP64 capabilities since all Kepler CUDA cores are not FP64 capable. With the improvement Nvidia made on Kepler, the results include an increase in GPU graphic performance while downplaying FP64 performance.|$|R

In this new scenario, enhanced application-specific on-card Java applets and complex cryptographic services are executed through the smart card Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In order to support such computation-intensive applica-tions, contemporary smart cards are designed with built-in micro-processors and memory. As smart cards are highly area-constrained environments with memory, CPU and peripherals competing for a very small <b>die</b> <b>space,</b> the VM execution engine of choice is often a small, slow interpreter.
