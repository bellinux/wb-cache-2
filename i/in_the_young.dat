40|$|Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly {{occur in}} elderly {{individuals}} in Western countries. However, MDS is {{commonly found in}} young individuals (, 60 years) <b>in</b> Asia. <b>The</b> reason for <b>the</b> high incidence <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> individuals is still unclear, and <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> disease features between young and elderly patients with MDS have been not well recognized. To explore these issues, in this study, we analyzed the clinical and experimental characteristics of MDS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patients <b>younger</b> and older than 60 years old and characterized the potential age-associated differences. The results showed that {{over half of the}} patients with MDS (61. 9 %) were younger than 60 years old upon the first diagnosis. <b>The</b> <b>younger</b> patients {{were more likely to be}} female, who have lower risk and less advanced MDS. The occurrence of trisomy 8 and bone marrow failure were more frequent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> patients than <b>the</b> older ones. The marrow CD 34 + cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> patients showed lower proliferation and higher apoptosis in comparison with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older ones. Obvious amplification of T cells and low CFU formation could be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> patients. CFU formation was significantly increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> patients after <b>the</b> removal of activated T cells. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> patients had a lower frequency of p 15 INK 4 B methylation, longer survival expectancy and less AML transformation. <b>In</b> summary, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> patients with MDS in China may show more benign disease features than the older ones.

40|$|Pigs {{were exposed}} to {{transmissible}} gastroenteritis (TGE) virus when three days old or when 21 days old. Diarrhea was earliest in onset, most frequent, most profuse and most prolonged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> group. Pigs exposed when three days old also had a higher case fatality rate than those exposed when 21 days old. The histological response of both groups to exposure was atrophy of villi and hyperplasia of crypts in jejunum and ileum. However, from days three to seven post-exposure, when most fatalities occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> group, atrophy of villi was both more intensive and extensive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> group. Hyperplasia of crypts was also greater and more prolonged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> group. Regeneration of atrophic villi was more rapid in jejunum than ileum in both groups. Results were interpreted to indicate two populations, with different rates of regeneration, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21 -day old group.

40|$|We {{compared}} hippocampal volume measures {{obtained by}} manual tracing to automatic segmentation with FreeSurfer in 44 younger (20 – 30 years) and 47 older (60 – 70 years) adults, each measured with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) over three successive time points, separated by four months. Retest correlations over time were very high for both manual and FreeSurfer segmentations. With FreeSurfer, correlations over time were significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> age group, which {{was not the case}} with manual segmentation. Pearson correlations between manual and FreeSurfer estimates were sufficiently high, numerically even higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> group, whereas intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates were lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older group. FreeSurfer yielded higher volume estimates than manual segmentation, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> age group. Importantly, FreeSurfer consistently overestimated hippocampal volumes independently of manually assessed volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> age group, but overestimated larger volumes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older age group to a less extent, introducing a systematic age bias <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data. Age differences in hippocampal volumes were significant with FreeSurfer, but not with manual tracing. Manual tracing resulted in a significant difference between left and right hippocampus (right > left), whereas this asymmetry effect was considerably smaller with FreeSurfer estimates. We conclude that FreeSurfer constitutes a feasible method to assess differences in hippocampal volume in young adults. FreeSurfer estimates in older age groups should, however, be interpreted with care until the automatic segmentation pipeline has been further optimized to increase validity and reliability in this age group.
