5|$|Buell quickly {{assigned}} Garfield {{the task}} of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through {{the valley of the}} Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded. At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision.|$|E

Charlotte was the first team to score seven points or fewer in the opening quarter and come back to win since 2008.

5|$|On November 18, 2005, in an 84–56 {{defeat of}} Southern University, Rolle made his collegiate debut, playing 14minutes and scoring six points while also {{grabbing}} three rebounds. Rolle shot 4-of-8 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> contributed season bests in rebounds (10) and points (8) to help lead LSU past Nicholls State. He equaled his season high in points against the Vanderbilt Commodores on February 2, 2006, in only nine minutes of playing time. The Tigers surprised many with a Final Four run, {{and in that}} game Rolle led the team in rebounds with eight, recorded two points from 1-of-1 shooting, and blocked a shot, all in 14minutes of playing time. Despite this performance, LSU's opponent UCLA ultimately prevailed, 59–45.

5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E
5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations {{in the fall and}} winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E

Rutgers had survived two close games to reach this point, {{defeating}} 12th-seeded Oregon, 79–76, in the first round, and then upsetting 4th-seeded Iowa State, 62–61 in the second. Their third-round game was not quite so close. Although Rutgers only trailed by two {{towards the end of}} the first period, UT was able to outscore Rutgers by six to close it out, and opened the second half up by building the lead to sixteen. The Scarlet Knights never recovered, losing 92–60. Holdsclaw and Catchings were again the leading scorers, with 25 and 23. The Lady Vols shot 52.2% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> forced Rutgers to 27 turnovers.

5|$|Though Hunt was {{considered}} for the 2004 State of Origin series among other fullbacks, he was ignored for the entire series in favour of Penrith Panthers fullback Rhys Wesser. Hunt's good form in 2006 paid off when he was selected {{to play for the}} Australian team against New Zealand on 5 May as a replacement for the injured Anthony Minichiello. This decision proved controversial, due to his being preferred over the in-form Matt Bowen. That game was Hunt's representative and international debut, and though he performed well, he only played for 50 minutes, making one error and 83 metres in kick returns. However, he was unable to complete the game due to concussion sustained by a blow from Frank Pritchard. He was taken unconscious <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> played no further part in the match.|$|E

Fordham last won a conference game on January 28, 2009, but Temple Owls had a 27–22 {{deficit in the}} first half. However, a {{balanced}} offensive attack, led by Juan Fernandez and Ramone Moore's 15 points each, helped Temple Owls to take the lead. Michael Eric scored his first collegiate double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Lavoy Allen was the fourth starter to score in double figures, with 12 points. On January 6, starting point guard Juan Fernandez bruised his knee in practice and missed the January 9 game against Saint Louis. Despite shooting 30.6 percent from the field, the Owls won 57–53 behind Ramone Moore's 15 points. Temple Owls was behind 41–32 with 10:13 remaining, then went on an 11–2 run. Moore scored five consecutive points to break a tie at 49, giving the Owls a lead. The Billikens missed all seven three-point shots against the Temple Owls defense. Fernandez also missed the January 12 game against St. Bonaventure, but the Owls defeated the Bonnies nonetheless, 83–55. Ramone Moore led all five starters in double-digit scoring with 19 points.

5|$|With the {{graduation}} of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched {{back to his}} natural position at point guard in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball. A shooting slump that lasted {{the majority of the}} season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games {{in the middle of the}} season due to a bone bruise in his knee, but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> committed three turnovers.
