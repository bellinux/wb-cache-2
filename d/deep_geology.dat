40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the earthquake effects on the urban area of Rome has been conducted for the L’Aquila sequence, which occurred in April 2009, by using an on-line macroseismic questionnaire. Intensity residuals calculated using the mainshock and four aftershocks are analyzed in the light of a very accurate and original geological reconstruction of the subsoil of Rome based on a large amount of wells. The aim of this work is to highlight ground motion amplification areas and to find a correlation with the geological settings at a sub-regional scale, putting in evidence the extreme complexity of the phenomenon and the difficulty of making a simplified model. Correlations between amplification areas and both near-surface and <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> were found.

30|$|Field {{studies in}} the EEC have shown that bay-like {{features}} emitting H 2 gas sometimes occur along structural trends, very probably corresponding to basement faults (Larin et al. 2014). Many {{studies have suggested that}} H 2 anomalies are commonly related to faults (Wakita et al. 1980; Jones and Pirkle 1981; Ware et al. 1985; Sato et al. 1986; Shcherbakov and Kozlova 1986; McCarthy and McGuire 1998; Rogozhin et al. 2010), which act as fluid conduits. This suggests that H 2 -emitting features are genetically related to structural features of the crystalline basement. The available information on the <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> of NC is insufficient to exactly define the locations of faults or their distances from these depressions (Lawrence and Hoffman 1993). This theory, together with the potential alignment of the bays along structural trends, suggests a close relationship between Carolina bays and the observed molecular hydrogen seepages from these potential geological structures.|$|E

Recent BGS projects undertaken as part of its DGSM Project have modelled selected areas of the UK at a variety of resolutions and in these areas understanding and visualisation of sub-surface geology is greatly improved.

40|$|U {{migration}} was {{studied in}} order to better understand to processes of safety relevant elements, particularly U. The rock sequence on the site can be analogous to a potential rock overburden of <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> repositories. A multidisciplinary approach was undertaken {{in order to}} identify and characterise U mobilisation/immobilisation processes within sedimentary clayey rocks with organic matter enriched interlayers. Both conventional methods and modern sophisticated spectroscopic methods were combined. Sequential extraction, wet chemical method and even spectroscopic methods proved that U prevailed in the U(IV) form in low-oxidised samples. It moved towards more easily releasable fractions with sample ageing (oxidation). The combination of SE, µ-XRF and µ-XAFS results proved U to be unexpectedly associated with As and P, leading to the presumption that U(VI) from groundwater was reduced to U(IV) on As pyrite. The evaluation of the hydrogeochemical conditions and isotope analyses then brought the results into broader context: Sedimentary organic matter within the sedimentary layers was microbially oxidised, releasing dissolved organic matter and providing H+ in order to dissolve sedimentary inorganic carbonates.

40|$|Traditional {{statistical}} methods for seismic zonation require information from many subjects, such as regional geology and neotectonics, seismicity, stress field, damage analysis of historic earthquakes, geophysics and others. These subjects are weighted differently during statistics. In fact, {{the information from}} most of these subjects is more like fuzzy sets, ie, it {{is a sort of}} estimation rather than precise data. In this paper we propose a fuzzy logic system that uses crustal structural features (seismotectonics) and historic seismic activities (seismicity) as two fuzzy inputs for seismic zonation. Seismotectonics is a combination of features from regional and <b>deep</b> <b>geology,</b> neotectonics, stress field and geophysics whereas seismicity is defined by historic earthquakes and their damages to some specific areas. Applying this fuzzy system to the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, a well-known intraplate seismic region in the world, outlines are not only the existing well recognised seismic zones where large earthquakes took place in history, but also some areas where there have been no strong shocks occurred for the last 2000 years.

40|$|In May {{last year}} Drs Moon and de Lange {{presented}} evidence at a School of Science Seminar {{for the presence}} of faulting within the surface deposits of the Hamilton Basin, and speculated on the presence of 4 fault zones that may have been active during the last 250, 000 years. Since then, with the support of an EQC grant and funding from the Waikato Regional Council, further progress has been made on identifying the location of hidden faults. The results of shallow seismic and initial resistivity surveys indicate more than 20 faults cross the Waikato River, and combined with LiDAR data, the evidence shows that some have been active during the last 16, 000 years. Data from oil, gas and coal exploration surveys of the <b>deeper</b> <b>geology</b> of the basin combined with the surface data have shown a pattern of normal listric faults extending from the basement to the surface, which explain the pattern of low hills within the basin.

40|$|Eurocode 8 allows {{that any}} country can use its own {{shape of the}} elastic {{response}} spectrum after it defines it in the National Annex. Having in mind that such country-specific spectra are to be derived through analysis of the strong motion data recorded in the considered seismo-tectonic region, in this Paper we discuss the existing {{and a set of}} new empirical equations for scaling pseudo-acceleration spectra in Serbia and the whole region of north-western Balkans. We then compare the presented spectra to those proposed by Eurocode 8. Results show that the indiscriminate use of the strong motion data from different seismo-tectonic regions, improper classification of the local soil conditions, and neglect of the effects of <b>deep</b> <b>geology,</b> may all lead to unreliable scaling equations and to extremely biased ground motion estimates. Moreover, only two spectral shapes that are defined for wide magnitude ranges and scaled by a single PGA value, are not able to adequately represent all important features of real strong ground motion, and instead of using such normalized spectra one should rather employ the direct scaling of spectral amplitudes that is based on the analysis of regionally gathered and processed strong motion data.

30|$|In this context, the EU-funded H 2020 DEEPEGS (Deployment of DEEP Enhanced Geothermal Systems for {{sustainable}} energy business) project aims at demonstrating {{the feasibility of}} EGS in high-enthalpy reservoirs (temperature up to 550  °C, with an Icelandic demonstrator) and in deep hydrothermal reservoirs (temperatures around 200  °C, with French demonstrators), to deliver new innovative solutions and models for wider deployments of EGS. The first demonstrator deployed {{in the frame of}} the DEEPEGS project is located in the Reykjanes geothermal system in southwest Iceland. The deepening of the wellbore RN- 15 from 2500  m depth (RN- 15 /IDDP- 2) began in August 2016 and the well is completed at a depth of 4659  m MD (measured depth, ~[*] 4.5  km vertical depth) in January 2017 (temperature around 500 – 530  °C) (Friðleifsson et al. 2017; Friðleifsson and Elders 2017 a, b; Stefanson et al. 2017). RN- 15 /IDDP- 2 provides information about the <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> and the deep rock behavior in the Icelandic context. Notably, borehole images provide a unique view of the geological structure of the Icelandic crust. To improve the productivity of the well (estimated injectivity index around 1.7  L s− 1  bar− 1 at the end of drilling), stimulations in the form of cold-water injection (mainly thermal stimulations) have been performed to connect the wellbore to existing hydraulic pathways, i.e., pre-existing natural fracture network.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{crystalline}} rock that constitutes <b>deep</b> <b>geology,</b> {{attempts have been}} made to explore its hydraulic characteristics by focusing on the network of numerous fractures within. As the hydraulic characteristics of a rock are the accumulation of hydraulic characteristics of each fracture, it is necessary to develop the hydraulic model of a single fracture to predict the large-scale hydraulic behavior. To this end, a simultaneous permeability and shear test device is developed, and shear-flow coupling tests are conducted on specimens having fractures with varied levels of surface roughness in the constant normal stiffness conditions. The results show that the permeability characteristics in the relation between shear displacement and transmissivity change greatly at the point where the stress path reaches the Mohr-Coulomb failure curve. It is also found that there exists a range in which transmissivity is not proportional to the cube of mechanical aperture width, which seems to be because of the occurrence of channeling phenomenon at small mechanical aperture widths. This channeling flow disappears with increasing shear and is transformed into a uniform flow. We develop a simulation technique to evaluate the macroscopic permeability characteristics by the lattice gas cellular automaton method, considering the microstructure of fracture, namely the fracture surface roughness. With this technique, it is shown that the formation of the Hagen-Poiseuille flow is affected by the fracture microstructure under shear, which as a result determines the relationship between the mechanical aperture width and transmissivity.|$|E
50|$|A {{geological}} survey is the systematic {{investigation of the}} geology beneath a given piece of ground {{for the purpose of}} creating a geological map or model. Geological surveying employs techniques from the traditional walk-over survey, studying outcrops and landforms, to intrusive methods, such as hand augering and machine-driven boreholes, to the use of geophysical techniques and remote sensing methods, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery. Such surveys may be undertaken by state, province, or national {{geological survey}} organizations to maintain the geological inventory and advance the knowledge of geosciences {{for the benefit of the}} nation.A geological survey map typically superimposes the surveyed extent and boundaries of geological units on a topographic map, together with information at points (such as measurements of orientation of bedding planes) and lines (such as the intersection of faults with the land surface). The maps and reports created by geological survey organisations generally aim for geographic continuity and completeness in establishing the spatial patterns of near-surface rock units. The map may include cross sections to illustrate the three-dimensional interpretation. Subsurface geological and geophysical maps, providing limited coverage of <b>deeper</b> <b>geology</b> (known, for example, from drilling for oil or gas), are maintained internally by major oil companies and regulators. Some geological survey organisations have collaborated with them to include subsurface geology in their systematic surveys, for example, the Geological Atlas of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Subsurface maps typically depict the three-dimensional form of geological surfaces by means of contours and cross sections. Computer-based models are increasingly used to provide more comprehensive information storage and greater flexibility of presentation.In the United States, the 50 state surveys are coordinated by the Association of American State Geologists.|$|R
40|$|Pockmarks are {{indicators}} of focused fluid seepage, most notably gas such as methane, and {{can occur in}} vast numbers in many marine and even in lacustrine environments. The presence and distribution of pockmarks {{need to be considered}} in the development of any infrastructure at the seabed. However, manual mapping of these features can be extremely time-consuming and it is implicitly subjective. An extensive area in the central North Sea, where the seabed comprises a thick sequence of muds and sandy muds of the late glacial Witch Ground Formation, shows numerous inactive pockmarks, typically 20 - 100 m diameter and 3 - 4 m deep. Within this area a few larger, active pockmarks, 500 m diameter and up to 17 m deep are known. Modern site investigations in this area regularly include multibeam sonar mapping, a technique that collects large volumes of bathymetric data {{that can be used to}} produce digital depth models of the seafloor with sufficient resolution to characterize individual pockmarks. This paper presents a semi-automated method to recognize, spatially delineate and characterise morphometrically pockmarks at the seabed. The method comprises two scripts, Pockmark Mapping and Pockmark Characterization, that allow the systematic application of a sequence of well defined tools available within the ESRI ArcGIS toolbox. Almost 4150 pockmarks were mapped applying this method to 18 selected site surveys across the central North Sea. The mapping and morphometric characterization of such vast number of pockmarks allows the identification of certain trends reflecting the hydrodynamic regime, whereas the pockmarks density and spatial distribution appears to be attributable to differences in shallow gas availability and <b>deeper</b> <b>geology</b> controlling fluid migration pathways...|$|R
40|$|The deep-water Hatton Basin (flanked by the Hatton and Rockall Highs) {{is located}} 600 km west of Scotland (NE Atlantic Ocean) {{on the western}} margin of the Eurasian {{continental}} plate. Prior to Atlantic opening the area was adjacent to SE Greenland. The basin straddles the UK/Irish median line. Water depths increase southwards from 1000 m to over 1300 m. The basin has never been licensed for hydrocarbon exploration and is currently the subject of ownership negotiations related to the UN Convention on Law of the Sea. Consequently it is under-explored. The deepest borehole penetration is by DSDP borehole 116 which reached TD at 854 m below sea bed in the Late Eocene. The Pre-Cambrian metamorphic basement only crops out on Rockall Bank where high-grade gneiss and granulite have been sampled and dated at c. 1900 to 1700 Ma. This is a different terrane from that which underlies most of Scotland. Palaeozoic rocks have not been proved in the area but may provide some of the pre-rift basin infill. The Hatton Basin probably opened during the Cretaceous. Recent (2007) seismic data suggest the presence of tilted fault blocks on the basin margins. Mid Cretaceous (Albian) sandstones and mudstones have been proved at shallow depth on the Hatton High. The area was massively affected by Late Paleocene to earliest Eocene volcanism which emplaced several large central igneous complexes and caused widespread lavas which degrade the seismic data from the <b>deeper</b> <b>geology.</b> Atlantic rifting commenced west of the Hatton High at about 56 Ma. During the Cenozoic the basin was affected by differential subsidence and several unconformity-forming compressional events.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} isotopic {{composition}} (C, O, S and Sr) of carbonates, sulphates and sulphide cements {{in the rock}} matrix and fracture fillings in geological formations of the Southeast basin of France, using core samples collected during the <b>Deep</b> <b>Geology</b> of France programme (GPF ArdSche theme). The Southeast basin belongs to the Alpine Tethyan margin. It {{is one of the}} thickest sedimentary basins in Europe, reaching upwards of 9 km in certain locations. The main fluid transfer from the basin is related to the large Pb-Zn Mississippi Valley-type district along the southern margin of the Massif Central block. A synthesis of the tectonic, mineralogical and petrographic investigations on the GPF boreholes shows that a major fluid circulation event occurred across the Alpine margin of Tethys during the Early Jurassic (Hettangian-Bathonian). It produced a general cementation of the rock porosity through precipitation of dolomite, sulphate and barite. Fracture fillings yield isotopic signatures distinct from the matrix cements. Matrix cements have particular characteristics, i. e. delta(34) S and delta(13) C that agree with a marine origin. The delta(34) S values of Permo-Carboniferous to Triassic sulphides from fracture cements are interpreted as resulting from the thermo-chemical reduction of sulphates. Fracture sulphates in the same geological formations yield delta(34) S values that define a relatively homogeneous end-member, whose composition is similar to sulphates in the LargentiSre Pb-Zn ore deposit. The source of S is attributed to the Permo-Carboniferous succession. The borehole fracture fillings are attributed to a major fluid circulation stage compatible with the Early Jurassic stage identified from the geological investigation of the boreholes. The formation of the LargentiSre deposit is considered as resulting from the mixing of this Early Jurassic fluid with continental hydrothermal fluids circulating in a basement horst, along its margin with the sedimentary basin. Other Pb-Zn deposits may also be related to fluid migration along the basement/sedimentary cover interface in the eastern and western parts of the Massif Central. This regional fluid circulation event may represent a geodynamic marker of the Jurassic extensional phase...|$|E
40|$|Geological mapping and {{modelling}} generally {{proceed from}} the {{known to the}} unknown. For example, mapping work uses exposures and quarry faces to control an interpretation of intervening unexposed ground. Similarly, 3 D geological subsurface models use borehole records as ‘tie-points’: the only locations where the geology is observed directly. ‘Borehole records’ can encompass several separate inter-related datasets including geophysical, lithological and stratigraphic logs. The British Geological Survey (BGS) holds more than 1. 2 million borehole records from across the UK landmass, a unique resource for geoscience research and surveying. Identifying those boreholes which are of value as tie-points for modelling has thus far been reliant {{on the experience of}} BGS’s experts on UK geology and stratigraphy, augmented by laborious manual searches. With many of these geologists approaching retirement there is an imperative to capture their accumulated knowledge before this expertise leaves the organisation. Geologists tend to re-use borehole records that they know, or that have been cited before. With new borehole records being added to the archives, can they be sure that they still using the best available data? The National Borehole Information Capture (NBIC) project aims to define the ‘Golden Spike Boreholes’ that will collectively describe the <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> of the UK. These are the borehole records that should act as ‘tie-points’ in geological models. They are being chosen by BGS’s District Geologists (so exploiting the expertise of these individuals), assisted by software tools developed for this project, including a tailored database interface and GIS view showing borehole locations. The project utilises recent advances in BGS’s databasing capability which allows linking of multiple datasets in real time, in particular the creation of a single primary key and its propagation across all BGS’s borehole data holdings. Key to the project success will be the ability to match metadata derived from one dataset to other datatypes as it may act as a quality constraint on other types of data for the same borehole. This will enhance the exploitation of these records by maximising their value. This will allow geologists to make a rapid assessment of the quality of all the various datasets held for a particular borehole and so more rapidly choose those boreholes of greatest value and stratigraphic importance. Preliminary results and detailed selection criteria will be presented. ...|$|E

40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} of the anelastic structure of the Derbyshire Dome and adjacent areas from the analysis of high frequency, 0. 6 - 4. 2 Hz, fundamental mode Rayleigh waves observed from quarry blasts within the study area. Seismic field experiments, designed and implemented to record Rayleigh waves accurately, are discussed together with the data preparation sequence. The effects of possible errors on timing and amplitude measurements are investigated and reduced. Time domain measurements indicate the Carboniferous Limestone district of the Derbyshire Dome consists of smaller provinces the boundaries of which are marked by sudden changes in group velocity and co-incide with geological surface features. Similar provinces are not found in the adjacent Millstone Grit district. Approximate estimates of group velocity are higher over the limestone than over the Millstone Grit district. Transformation into the frequency domain facilitates the determination of group arrival times and amplitude spectrum of each Rayleigh wave recorded. Least squares interstation analyses provide estimates of group slowness dispersion for the districts and component provinces and the Rayleigh wave specific attenuation factor, Qy- 1 (v), as a function of frequency for certain districts and provinces. Group slowness which ranges from 0. 33 - 1. 1 s km 1, increasing generally with frequency, is higher in the Millstone Grit district. Qy- 1 (v) ranges between 0. 01 'and 0. 08 showing no marked correlation with surface lithology. Models of shear wave velocity, ß(z), and intrinsic specific 11 attenuation factor for shear waves, Qßl(z), with depth, z, are obtained for the upper 1. 5 km of the crust in each district and province from the inversion of the observed dispersion and Q- 1 (v) Y data using linearised and Hedgehog techniques for ß(z) and similar methods for Qßl(z). The <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> of the area is inferred from the ß(z) models. The limestone district is divided by a major basement fault, to which surface features may be related. The Carboniferous Limestone of different provinces is underlain directly by Ordovician mudstones or Devonian sandstones. A sedimentary basin, of 1. 5 km thickness, displaying rhythmic sedimentation is postulated within the Millstone Grit district. Fluid saturation conditions are inferred from the Qß 1 (2) models. On comparison with previous laboratory work values of Q 1 -ß which exhibit a possible frequency dependence imply partial saturation of the upper layers of the limestone district whilst field estimates of Qß- 1 not exhibiting any frequency dependence imply the Millstone Grit district to be fully saturated at all levels.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the geologic {{setting for the}} Deep Saline Reservoirs and Coal Seams in the Ohio River Valley CO{sub 2 } Storage Project area. The object of the current project is to site and design a CO{sub 2 } injection facility. A location near New Haven, WV, has been selected for the project. To assess geologic storage reservoirs at the site, regional and site-specific geology were reviewed. Geologic reports, deep well logs, hydraulic tests, and geologic maps were reviewed for the area. Only one well within 25 miles of the site penetrates the deeper sedimentary rocks, {{so there is a}} large amount of uncertainty regarding the <b>deep</b> <b>geology</b> at the site. New Haven is located along the Ohio River on the border of West Virginia and Ohio. Topography in the area is flat in the river valley but rugged away from the Ohio River floodplain. The Ohio River Valley incises 50 - 100 ft into bedrock in the area. The area of interest lies within the Appalachian Plateau, on {{the western edge of the}} Appalachian Mountain chain. Within the Appalachian Basin, sedimentary rocks are 3, 000 to 20, 000 ft deep and slope toward the southeast. The rock formations consist of alternating layers of shale, limestone, dolomite, and sandstone overlying dense metamorphic continental shield rocks. The Rome Trough is the major structural feature in the area, and there may be some faults associated with the trough in the Ohio-West Virginia Hinge Zone. The area has a low earthquake hazard with few historical earthquakes. Target injection reservoirs include the basal sandstone/Lower Maryville and the Rose Run Sandstone. The basal sandstone is an informal name for sandstones that overlie metamorphic shield rock. Regional geology indicates that the unit is at a depth of approximately 9, 100 ft below the surface at the project site and associated with the Maryville Formation. Overall thickness appears to be 50 - 100 ft. The Rose Run Sandstone is another potential reservoir. The unit is located approximately 1, 100 ft above the basal sandstone and is 100 - 200 ft thick. The storage capacity estimates for a 20 -mile radius from the injection well ranged from 39 - 78 million tons (Mt) for each formation. Several other oil and gas plays have hydraulic properties conducive for injection, but the formations are generally only 5 - 50 ft thick in the study area. Overlying the injection reservoirs are thick sequences of dense, impermeable dolomite, limestone, and shale. These layers provide containment above the potential injection reservoirs. In general, it appears that the containment layers are much thicker and extensive than the injection intervals. Other physical parameters for the study area appear to be typical for the region. Anticipated pressures at maximum depths are approximately 4, 100 psi based on a 0. 45 psi/ft pressure gradient. Temperatures are likely to be 150 F. Groundwater flow is slow and complex in deep formations. Regional flow directions appear to be toward the west-northwest at less than 1 ft per year within the basal sandstone. Vertical gradients are downward in the study area. A review of brine geochemistry indicates that formation fluids have high salinity and dissolved solids. Total dissolved solids ranges from 200, 000 - 325, 000 mg/L in the deep reservoirs. Brine chemistry is similar throughout the different formations, suggesting extensive mixing in a mature basin.

GEOLOGICAL DATA MANAGEMENT AND VALORISATIONS BRGM, the French geological survey, is the unique public organisation in France which manages the large amount of data acquired in the field (geological maps) and from the major exploration programmes in the sedimentary basins (seismics, deep drilling, airborne geophysics, gravity, [...] .). BRGM works since decades on databases management which is essential for producing integrated synthetic geological models. For the deep sedimentary basins (Fig. 1), the BRGM has in particular been managing since 2006 the 350, 000 km petroleum seismic lines and the 6 000 boreholes (Fig. 2). Raw data are accessible to all via a public "front office" (guichet. H@brgm. fr) and dedicated re-processing is possible on request. Beyond data management and delivery, BRGM has launched a vast data enhancement programme. The seismic lines are gradually being homogeneously reprocessed and interpreted and then assembled for providing major regional reference transects. The borehole logs are systematically digitised to well logging (Gamma ray, density, resistivity, [...] .) records and petrophysical logs (porosity, permeability), thus enabling stratigraphical and petrophysical calibration of the geological models (Fig. 3 & 4). The methodologies are also implemented internationally for geological syntheses and basin modelling. Taking advantage of an easy access to data and a renewal of activity in the sedimentary basins, BRGM is now in a position to update existing geological syntheses and to produce digital models dedicated to various applications. Consequently, the geological models must be in 3 D and compatible with the dynamic software used downstream by the hydrogeologists and reservoir engineers. Today, one of the France's sedimentary basins most studied for this kind of applications is the Paris basin. Figure 3 : Example of well logs digitalised (Dogger aquifer, Paris basin), from the left to the right: Gama Ray, density, volume of shale in carbonate system (VSH), equivalent porosity (without and with shale effect), facies rocks descriptions UNDERGROUND APPLICATIONS IN PARIS BASIN Following the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, the development of deep geothermal energy exploded in France between 1980 and 1986. The Dogger carbonate formations of the Paris Basin have been the principal targets for such exploration. Today, in anticipation of the thermal potential drop of Dogger aquifers, the underlying Triassic aquifers are being studied. The water resources of the shallow aquifers present major pollution risks. It is now necessary to identify alternative water resources, and thus to explore the deep water reservoirs. Several projects exploring major fracture and/or karst systems in Dogger formations are currently underway in France's in three main sedimentary basins. Particular attention is also been paid to the major aquifers for underground storage - methane which is in constant development since the 1960 s, and CO 2. Major French and European research programmes have led us to reconsider the principal deep reservoirs of each basin in order to study storage capacities on a regional scale (unlike the storage of methane, localized on anticlinal structures). GEOLOGICAL AND PETROPHYSICAL MODEL PRODUCTION: OUR INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY The models made so far for groundwater applications, postulated a structure consisting of homogeneous geological formations. Today, our challenge is to restore the reservoir heterogeneity in three dimensions to build more realistic geological models. Yet, the characteristics of geological formation in the reservoir (porosity, permeability) vary greatly from place to place in the sedimentary system. To build these models, we relied on a methodology developed by petroleum engineer, working at oilfield's scale (a few square kilometers). We have transposed same approach on a regional and entire basin system scale (several hundred square kilometers, Fig. 4). We integrate in models, deep data (seismic lines and boreholes) interpreted in terms of sequential stratigraphy (ie subdivision of the sedimentary pile into layers bounded by isochronous surfaces), paleogeographic maps (environments deposits and / or facies rocks) and geological map data (limits on geological outcrops). Based on this approach we are then able to produce paleogeographic maps and 3 D digital models suitable for geodynamic reconstruction of the basins. Prediction of favourable zones for the exploitation of such formation is evaluated by petrophysical modelling. For each type of rocks, data analysis of boreholes (logs and core data) is made. These petrophysical data are estimated and/or simulated in the geological model using geostatistical tools. Our large scale models allow locating basins areas potentially suitable for CO 2 storage or geothermal resources. When these interesting zones are located in the aquifer, smaller models can be rebuilt by upscalling of largest preliminary models. In the example below (Fig. 4), we produced a gridded 3 D geological model at the basin scale, dressed with petrophysical properties (Fig. 4). After potential areas for CO 2 storage are localised, a regional model is built (downscaling). Both scales of models allow to make dynamic simulations of flow and injection of CO 2 and to assess its impact in the media over time. Finally, these methodological results are now transferable to other Paris Basin's aquifer and obviously to others sedimentary basins (ie. the Aquitaine basin, South East Basin or, the Upper Rhine Valley, Fig. 1).

Gabalda, Geology division, BRGM) Figure 5 : Simulation of CO 2 injection (with Tough 2) into the Dogger aquifer (Paris basin, ANR-SHPCO 2, Author: C. Chiaberge, Water division, BRGM) ON-GOING CHALLENGES: COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN GEOMODELLING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARES Because of the diversity of geological context, we made the choice of using several softwares. Considering that no software possesses all the required facilities for 3 D geological modelling and simulation, we have to work with the complementarity between commercial (ISATIS, Earth Vision, PETREL, etc.) and in-house softwares (GDM Multilayer, Geomodeller 3 D, etc.). One or other is chosen in function of the complexity of geological context and the aim of the 3 D modelling. For example, Petrel (©Schlumberger) software is mainly used for 3 D gridded models of sedimentary basin, dedicated for simulations with Eclipse or Tough. More complex geological context, like basin in front of mountain range (non-tabular structures, folds, diapirs, etc) are modelled using Geomodeller 3 D (in house software, see an example in Fig. 6). Ones of our tracks in research and development is to improve compatibility between geomodelling and simulations softwares (see Fig. 7). The workflow allowing to work with software and to transfer the job to another has to be fluent as possible. Main challenges lie on model compatibility and on workflow rapidity. Models need to be as complete as possible (geometry, petrophysical information [...] .) and their integrity have to be preserved from one software to another.

40|$|Le forage de Couy-Sancerre (Programme Géologie profonde de la France) avait pour objectif d'atteindre l'Anomalie magnétique du Bassin Parisien. La série sédimentaire entièrement carottée, complétée par un jeu complet de diagraphies modernes (micro-résistivité, sonique, gamma-ray, densité, neutron, PEF, pendagemétrie), est le plus souvent compréhensive, mais présente parfois des condensations. L'analyse séquentielle du forage de Couy a permis de mettre en évidence 17 séquences dans le Jurassique inférieur et une partie du Jurassique moyen. Dans le Jurassique inférieur, les 11 séquences caractérisées (la dernière passant dans le Jurassique moyen) sont très semblables à celles proposées par Haq et ai. (1988). Pour le Jurassique moyen, les 8 séquences reconnues sont assez délicates à corréler avec celles proposées par Haq et al. (1988), aussi bien que par Rioult et al. (1991) en Normandie ou par Gonnin et al. (1993) en Poitou. Le forage de Couy, par ses données lithostratigraphiques et biostratigraphiques, ainsi que par ses enregistrements diagraphiques bien calés, constitue un sondage de référence pour la stratigraphie du Bassin Parisien. The Couy-Sancerre {{borehole}} (<b>Deep</b> <b>Geology</b> Program of France) had {{the target}} of reaching the Paris Basin magnetic anomaly. It was located {{in the eastern part}} of the Biturige subblock, more precisely between the Armorican Block and the Burgondy Block, on the edge of the Loire Trough, on the site of the Mesozoic Marly Trough. It was located on a small intermediate horst (Fig. 1). The sedimentary series has been entirely cored, and this has been completed by a complete set of modern well logs (microresistivity, sonic, gamma ray, formation density, compensated neutron, photoelectric effect, dipmetering). This series is often comprehensive, but sometimes shows condensations. Petrographic and mineralogic studies (Delavenna et al., 1989; Mélières, 1991) and the determining of numerous ammonites (Lorenz et al., 1987) make this borehole a first-rate stratigraphic reference concerning the Lower and Middle Jurassic series in the southern part of the Paris Basin. The lithostratigraphic analysis has already been the subject of a publication (Lorenz et al., 1992), and a description of the sequences has been sketched out (Gely and Lorenz, 1991). At the same time, the implementation of lithostratigraphic data and the description of the well logs provide greater accuracy in interpretation in terms of desposit sequences, while the stratigraphic calibration of the well-log signatures gives a reference on the scale of the Paris Basin. The sequences defined in the Couy borehole are compared to the ones already published elsewhere on a global scale (Haq et al., 1988; Vail et al., 1987) and on a regional scale (Rioult et al., 1991; Gonnin et al., 1992, 1993; Bessereau and Guillocheau, 1994, (Figs. 2 and 3). Discontinuities corresponding to a sedimentation gap are usually represented by traces of bioturbation or by perforations in the top surface of a bed or else by a surface of gullying. In other cases, the sequence boundaries do not seem to be so clearly expressed but correspond to highly bioturbated bands, a single limestone bed in the midst of marls or perhaps an abrupt lithological change. For a limestone bed situated at the upper boundary of a sequence, we can see that this latter is often perforated or bioturbated. This enables them to be distinguished from other limestone levels situated at the transgressive maximum, and which contain pelagic fossils or authigenic minerals. On well logs, these two types of beds often have a comparable signature. The sequence boundaries are clearly shown by the well logs, which show clearcut curve breaks and are often capable of orienting or confirming the choice of identification criteria of the boundaries in the core samples. However, it can be seen that there is no direct relationships between the visible size of the discontinuity and the existence of an appreciable biostratigraphic gap. The Domerian-Toarcian boundary does not show any biozone gap, but it is particulary well expressed by gullying. Whereas the very large gap in the Lower Bajocian is not marked by any appreciable discontinuity, but only by a perforated surface, the gap nonetheless corresponds to four biozones. From the absence of erosion traces of a subaerial nature, we can deduce that the drop in sealevel at the end of the sequences was less than subsidence (Type 2 discontinuity) in the area around the Couy borehole. Located between the Biturige subblock and the Loire Trough, the Couy borehole, as the result of the evolution of local tectonic subsidence, reveals either carbonate facies of the Berry platform (sequence of dominantly carbonate deposits) or thick clayey facies of the Marly Trough (sequence with dominantly clayey deposits). In these sequences, maximum transgression corresponds to the minimum values of the gamma-ray log in the basin series and to maximum values on the platform domains (Lorenz and Gely, 1994). Hence, in the platform domain, the transgressive maximum may be shown by clayey limestones with rare ammonites, indicating a maximum value of the gamma-ray log. However, in other places this must not be confused with a comparable well-log signature provided on the platform by lagoonal marls situated at the top of the sequences. In the basin domain, the transgressive maximum is linked to the maximum distancing of continental areas from a fixed point, thus having a good chance of involving a slowing down of sandy and clayey terrigenous influxes. For the other components of the sediment, the slowing down of clayey sedimentation causes a decrease in dilution. Enrichments in phosphate appear (Bifrons and Bomfordi subzones, Opalinum, Niortense and Garantiana zones), in glauconite (Hodsoni zone), in ferruginous ooliths (Niortense and Garantiana zones, and above in the region, the Macrocephalus, Lamberti and Cordaturn zones). The influence of regional subsidence is superimposed on the successions of deposits, linked to sealevel changes. These two factors control the accomodation and the hydrodynamic conditions of the basin. Tectonic activity can obliterate the role of eustatism to the extent of preventing any deposit, and entire sedimentary sequences may then not be expressed locally, as is the case for the Humphriesianum zone in the Poitou and Berry regions. On the other hand, a speeding up of the subsidence of the Marty Trough occurred during the highstand interval in the Lotharingian (Sequence 3), causing the deposition of back basin clays, thus situating the maximum paleodepth exceptionally at the top of the sequence underneath a nonerosive discontinuity. A contrast can also be seen between the marly series of the Upper Pliensbachian, such as the Bathonian, and the condensed limestone series of the Lower and Middle Bajocian. The installation of the carbonate platform in the Aalenian-Lower Bajocian (platform with an accumulation of bioclast sands of the keep-up carbonate platformtype, Sarg, 1989), with already a first glimpse of the upermost Toarcian (micritic limestone platform with gryphites, of the catch-up carbonate platformtype, according to Sarg, 1989), was probably caused by a great slowing down of subsidence. The same pattern can be found in the regional Callovian with periods of erosion or nondeposition. We are led to highlight three periods of tectonic activity in the Couy area (Lotharingian, Aalenian-Bajocian, Callovian), which do not always correspond to the tendencies described in other paleogeographic domains, for example such as Champagne in the Middle Jurassic (Guillocheau, 1991). A sequential analysis of the Couy borehole has revealed 18 sequences in the Lower Jurassic and part of the Middle Jurassic. In the Lower Jurassic, 11 characterized sequences (the last one transiting into the MiddleJurassic) are similar to the ones proposed by Haq et al. (1988), which for Western Europe must stem from the relative uniformity of Lower Jurassic deposits, often with clearcut boundaries, with generally abundant ammonites, and with a biostratigraphic scale that has been widely accepted by researchers. For the Middle Jurassic, the 8 recognized sequences are rather difficult to correlate with the ones proposed by Haq et al. (1988) as well as by Rioult et al. (1991) in Normandy, or by Gonnin et al. (1993) in Poitou. In the Middle Jurassic, the shallow carbonate platform facies, with numerous more or less prolonged sedimentation gaps, generally have fewer ammonite fauna than the Lower Jurassic deposits, and their lithological units are less clearcut and vary laterally very quickly. To complicate the analysis, at least in France, this was a period of slight tectonic instability linked to both the opening up of the Atlantic and the rifting period of the future Alpine domain. In distensional conditions this resulted in tiltings of blocks causing local variations in facies and thickness, and even emersions (Lorenz and Pomerol, 1985; Gabilly et al., 1985). These relatively slight movements disturbthe recording of eustatic variations. The biostratigraphic dating of these in the Middle Jurassic in the Tethysian province and in the Boreal province. The Paris Basin is situated at the fluctuating boundary between these two provinces. Likewise, these two scales have not been definitively accepted by researchers, which sometimes makes the correlations of their results more delicate. In the Middle Jurassic, only a few major breaks reflecting the eustatism can be considered. It is to be feared that the others, even though biostratigraphically well dated, risk, for some time to come, representing local phenomena rather than general event. Because of its lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data, as well as its well-calibrated well-log recordings, the Couy borehole is a reference borehole for the stratigraphy of the Paris Basin. It has been possible to recognise third-other deposit sequences described on a global scale and to characterize them by a specific well-logging signature (curve break, ramps and major peaks) used for correlations on a basin scale...|$|E
