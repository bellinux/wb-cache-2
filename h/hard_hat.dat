The site adjoins the car park where the body was found, and overlies the chancel of Greyfriars Friary Church.

Following the <b>Hard</b> <b>Hat</b> Riot of May 8, 1970, Brennan was wooed by the Nixon administration as a potential supporter in the 1972 presidential election.

500|$|The {{management}} professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka {{with developing}} the first civilian <b>hard</b> <b>hat</b> while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, {{but this is}} not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally [...] "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term [...] ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.|$|E
