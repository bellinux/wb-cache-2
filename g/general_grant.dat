5|$|The Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site near St. Louis, {{and several}} other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant's life. There are smaller {{memorials}} in Chicago's Lincoln Park and Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. Named in his honor are Grant Park, {{as well as several}} counties in western and midwestern states. On June 3, 1891, a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor Johannes Gelert was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena, Illinois. From 1890 to 1940, part of what is now Kings Canyon National Park was called <b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> National Park, named for the <b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> sequoia.|$|E
5|$|Even though Steuart {{had fought}} bravely under {{extremely}} difficult conditions, {{neither he nor}} any other officer was cited by Johnson in his report. Gettysburg marked the high-water mark of the Confederacy; thereafter Lee's army would retreat until its final surrender to <b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the war, the strategy of total warfare—endorsed by <b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> and President Lincoln—has {{been the subject of}} controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as best he could in order to fulfill his part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.|$|E

5|$|Thus, on April 9, 1865, Confederate General Lee unconditionally {{surrendered}} his starving Army of Northern Virginia to <b>General</b> <b>Grant.</b> The surrender look {{place at}} the home of Wilmer and Virginia McLean in the small community of Appomattox Court House, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered <b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man {{was pleased with the}} change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|<b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E

5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to <b>General</b> <b>Grant</b> {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{had been}} too great for the advance posts of the much-reduced Yeomanry Mounted Division, which fell back down the Wadi Zeit but the pursuing Ottoman force was suddenly blocked by the 11th Light Horse Regiment of 4th Light Horse Brigade. The 4th Light Horse Brigade had moved by the same route as the 7th Mounted Brigade, but near El Burj they found the road blocked by fire. Brigadier <b>General</b> <b>Grant,</b> reporting to Barrow, ordered the brigade south of Beit Ur el Tahta to support the 6th Mounted Brigade. The 11th Light Horse Regiment was pushed forward with two machine guns to hold Wadi Zeit south west of Beit Ur el Foqa.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a {{prominent}} United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General {{at the conclusion of}} that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding <b>General,</b> <b>Grant</b> worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him as a president who performed a difficult job with some merit, and took strong action on civil rights for African Americans.|$|E
