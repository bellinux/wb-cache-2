5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July.

Jinnah <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E

Reuben, {{former chief}} of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., {{revealed}} that data for 21 studies he had authored for {{the efficacy of the}} drug (along with others such as celecoxib) had been fabricated in order to augment the analgesic effects of the drugs. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States).

Likewise, Sosa never admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs nor did he ever fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> about the controversy. Only deputy Carlos Kunkel {{said that although}} he did not know Lázaro Báez, if he committed a crime {{he had to go to}} prison; however, he thought there was insufficient evidence. Governor of Santa Cruz province Daniel Peralta denied any connection to Báez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through Vialidad Nacional. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to Federal Peronism. He said that the national government had invested $770million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the SIGEN. Minister Julio de Vido considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Dams. Báez, in a news conference where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame Néstor Kirchner; he questioned Fariña and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program.|$|E

500|$|In the {{run up to}} the Democratic National Convention, set {{to begin}} at the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896, no {{candidate}} {{was seen as an}} overwhelming favorite for the presidential nomination. [...] The leading candidates were former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. [...] "Silver Dick" [...] Bland was seen as the elder statesman of the silver movement; he had originated the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, while Boies' victories for governor in a normally Republican state made him attractive as a candidate who might compete with McKinley in the crucial Midwest. [...] Both had openly declared their candidacies, and were the only Democrats to have organizations seeking to obtain pledged delegates. [...] Neither candidate had much money to spend on his campaign. [...] In addition to the frontrunners, other silver men were spoken of as candidates. [...] These included Vice President [...] Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, Indiana Governor Claude Matthews, and Bryan. [...] Illinois Governor Altgeld, a leader of the silver movement, was ineligible because he was not a natural-born U.S. citizen as required for the presidency in the Constitution. [...] When Senator Teller walked out of the Republican convention in protest over the currency plank, he immediately became another possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. [...] However, he was deemed unlikely to succeed, as many Democrats feared that if elected, he might fill some patronage jobs with Republicans. [...] President Cleveland spent the week of the convention fishing, and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> about the events there; political scientist Richard Bensel attributes Cleveland's political inaction to the President's loss of influence in his party.|$|E
