25|$|The high {{specificity}} of meganucleases {{gives them a}} high degree of precision and much lower cell toxicity than other naturally occurring restriction enzymes. Meganucleases were identified in the 1990s, and subsequent work has shown that they are particularly promising tools for genome engineering and <b>gene</b> <b>editing,</b> as they are able to efficiently induce homologous recombination, generate mutations, and alter reading frames.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} {{can be combined}} to increase the possibility of creating new enzymes, while maintaining {{a high degree of}} efficacy and specificity. The scientists from Cellectis have been working on <b>gene</b> <b>editing</b> since 1999 and have developed a collection of over 20,000 protein domains from the homodimeric meganuclease I-CreI as well as from other meganucleases scaffolds. They can be combined to form functional chimeric tailor-made heterodimers for research laboratories and for industrial purposes.|$|E
50|$|Where {{biological}} {{components and}} systems are {{treated in a}} similar manner to software, and similar development models and methodologies are applied, the term 'wetware' can be used to imply an approach to their problems as 'bugs' and their beneficial aspects as 'features'.

25|$|Once the TALEN {{constructs}} {{have been}} assembled, they are inserted into plasmids; the target cells are then transfected with the plasmids, and the gene products are expressed {{and enter the}} nucleus to access the genome. Alternatively, TALEN constructs can be delivered to the cells as mRNAs, which removes the possibility of genomic integration of the TALEN-expressing protein. Using an mRNA vector can also dramatically increase the level of homology directed repair (HDR) {{and the success of}} introgression during <b>gene</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} {{plants can}} also be developed using gene knockdown or gene knockout to alter the genetic makeup of a plant without incorporating genes from other plants. In 2014, Chinese researcher Gao Caixia filed patents {{on the creation of}} a strain of wheat that is resistant to powdery mildew. The strain lacks genes that encode proteins that repress defenses against the mildew. The researchers deleted all three copies of the genes from wheat's hexaploid genome. Gao used the TALENs and CRISPR <b>gene</b> <b>editing</b> tools without adding or changing any other genes. No field trials were immediately planned. The CRISPR technique has also been used to modify white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus).|$|E
25|$|Transcription activator-like {{effector}} nucleases (TALEN) are restriction {{enzymes that}} can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain (a nuclease which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind to practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a nuclease, DNA can be cut at specific locations. The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in <b>gene</b> <b>editing</b> or for genome editing in situ, a technique known as genome editing with engineered nucleases. Alongside zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN is a prominent tool {{in the field of}} genome editing.|$|E

40|$|Pyruvate kinase {{deficiency}} (PKD) {{is a rare}} erythroid {{metabolic disease}} caused by mutations in the PKLR gene. Erythrocytes from PKD patients show an energetic imbalance causing chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, as pyruvate kinase defects impair ATP production in erythrocytes. We generated PKD {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (PKDiPSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNCs) of PKD patients by non-integrative Sendai viral vectors. PKDiPSCs were <b>gene</b> <b>edited</b> to integrate a partial codon-optimized R-type pyruvate kinase cDNA in the second intron of the PKLR gene by TALEN-mediated homologous recombination (HR). Notably, we found allele specificity of HR led by the presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism. High numbers of erythroid cells derived from gene-edited PKDiPSCs showed correction of the energetic imbalance, providing an approach to correct metabolic erythroid diseases and demonstrating the practicality of this approach to generate the large cell numbers required for comprehensive biochemical and metabolic erythroid analyses. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
2500|$|Doudna {{has been}} a leading figure in what is often {{referred}} to as the [...] "CRISPR Revolution" [...] for her early fundamental work and ongoing leadership in the development of CRISPR-mediated genome editing. In their seminal 2012 paper A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity, Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR/Cas9 could be used for programmable <b>gene</b> <b>editing.</b> This discovery is considered as one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology.

2500|$|In December 2015, an International Summit on Human <b>Gene</b> <b>Editing</b> {{took place}} in Washington under the {{guidance}} of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. [...] They agreed to support basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes could be inherited by future generations. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism). Altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.|$|E
40|$|Loss-of-function {{genetics}} provides {{strong evidence}} for a gene 2 ̆ 7 s function in a wild-type context. In many model systems, this approach has been invaluable for discovering the function of genes in diverse biological processes. Axolotls are urodele amphibians (salamanders) with astonishing regenerative abilities, capable of regenerating entire limbs, portions of the tail (including spinal cord), heart, and brain into adulthood. With their relatively short generation time among salamanders, they offer an outstanding opportunity to interrogate natural mechanisms for appendage and organ regeneration provided that the tools are developed to address these long-standing questions. Here we demonstrate targeted modification of the thrombospondin- 1 (tsp- 1) locus using transcription-activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and identify a role of tsp- 1 in recruitment of myeloid cells during limb regeneration. We find that while tsp- 1 -edited mosaic animals still regenerate limbs, they exhibit a reduced subepidermal collagen layer in limbs and an increased number of myeloid cells within blastemas.

40|$|Abstract: The {{classical}} view of {{the gene}} prevailing during the 1910 ’s and 1930 ’s comprehended the gene as the indivisible unit of genetic transmission, genetic recombination, gene mutation and gene function. The discovery of intragenic recombination in the early 1940 ’s led to the neoclassical concept of the gene, which prevailed until the 1970 ’s. In this view the gene or cistron, as it was now called, was divided into its constituent parts, the mutons and recons materially identified as nucleotides. Each cistron {{was believed to be}} responsible for the synthesis of one single mRNA and concurrently for one single polypeptide. The discoveries of DNA technology, beginning in the early 1970 ’s, have led to the second revolution in the concept of the gene in which none of the classical or neoclassical criteria for the definition of the gene hold strictly true.

40|$|Regions of the Didymium iridis {{mitochondrial}} genome {{were identified}} with similarity to typical mitochondrial genes; however, these regions contained numerous stop codons. We used RT-PCR and DNA sequencing to determine whether, through RNA editing, these regions were transcribed into mRNAs that could encode functional proteins. Ten putative gene regions were examined: atp 1, atp 6, atp 8, atp 9, cox 1, cox 2, cytb, nad 4 L, nad 6, and nad 7. The cDNA sequences of each gene could encode a functional mitochondrial protein that was highly conserved compared with homologous genes.
