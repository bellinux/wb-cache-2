5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her.

Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he <b>informed</b> <b>her</b> that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him.

5|$|Elle Bishop is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appeared on the}} American psychological thriller science fiction series Heroes, which aired on NBC from 2006 to 2010.

Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that <b>informed</b> <b>her</b> they would love to have her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her.

Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who <b>informed</b> <b>her</b> that a new prime minister {{would need to be}} selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a husband on the queen and would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.|$|E
