5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé is back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E

25|$|Hart had {{performed}} the stunt {{only a few}} times before. Hart's widow Martha has suggested that, by moving around to get comfortable with both the harness and his cape on, Hart unintentionally triggered an early release. Television viewers did not see the incident. During the fall, a pre-taped vignette was being shown on the pay-per-view broadcast {{as well as on the}} monitors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> arena. Afterward, while Hart was being worked on by medical personnel inside the ring, the live event's broadcast showed only the audience. Meanwhile, WWF television announcer Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per-view that what had just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. Hart was transported to Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries. The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma.|$|E

500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, {{the bridge of her}} nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E

500|$|The {{cockatoo}} {{would have}} been a rare bird at the time, [...] "and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this". It did not become well-known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of Captain Cook in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatoos had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (Mr & Mrs William Chase) and a separate study, The Parrot. In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the [...] "lungs-glass", but was perhaps making a statement about the values of society in the Age of Enlightenment. The white plumage of the cockatoo also shows much more effectively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> room than the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early oil sketch. A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the Trinity found in Early Netherlandish painting, where the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove, to which God the Father (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.|$|E
500|$|Bacon's {{work from}} the 1970s has been {{described}} by the art critic Hugh Davies as the [...] "frenzied momentum of a struggle against death". Bacon admitted during a 1974 interview that he thought the most difficult aspect of aging was [...] "losing your friends". This was a bleak period in his life, and though he was to live for another seventeen years, he felt that his life was almost over, [...] "and all the people I've loved are dead". His concern is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> flesh and background tones of his paintings from this period. His acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life were heightened by Dyer's death in Paris. In the next three years he painted many images of his former lover, including the series of three [...] "Black Triptychs" [...] which have come to be seen as among his best work. A number of characteristics bind the triptychs together: the form of a monochromatically rendered doorway features centrally in all, and each is framed by flat and shallow walls. In each three Dyer is stalked by a broad shadow; which takes the form of pools of blood or flesh in the outer panels and the wings of the angel of death in the left hand and central images. In its display caption for Triptych–August 1972 the Tate gallery wrote, [...] "What death has not already consumed seeps incontinently out of the figures as their shadows." ...|$|E

50|$|The Burial of the Sardine is {{also one}} of the most {{astonishing}} virtuoso performances to come down to us from Goya's brush. Rarely did Goya again reach such decisiveness of touch. Every brushstroke is a calligraphic marvel at the same time that it describes with consummate precision the expression of faces and the emotional charge of each stance or gesture. We have arrived here at the perfect balancing point between the early tapestry cartoons and the later Black Paintings.

2500|$|A charismatic showman and self-promoter, in 1891-1893 Tesla {{used the}} Tesla coil in {{dramatic}} public lectures demonstrating the new science of high voltage, high frequency electricity. The radio frequency AC electric currents {{produced by a}} Tesla coil did not behave like the DC or low frequency AC current scientists of the time were familiar with. In lectures at Columbia College May 20, 1891, scientific societies in Britain and France during an 1892 European speaking tour, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia in February 1893, and the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis in March 1893, he impressed audiences with spectacular brush discharges and streamers, heated iron by induction heating, showed RF current could pass through insulators and be conducted by a single wire without a return path, and powered light bulbs and motors without wires. He demonstrated that high frequency currents often did not cause the sensation of electric shock, applying {{hundreds of thousands of}} volts to his own body, causing his body to light up with a glowing corona discharge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> room.

2500|$|Fluoroscopy's {{origins and}} radiography's origins can both {{be traced back}} to 8 November 1895, when Wilhelm Röntgen, or in English script Roentgen, noticed a barium {{platinocyanide}} screen fluorescing as a result of being exposed to what he would later call X-rays (algebraic x variable signifying [...] "unknown"). [...] Within months of this discovery, the first crude fluoroscopes were created. [...] These experimental fluoroscopes were simply thin cardboard screens that had been coated on the inside with a layer of fluorescent metal salt, attached to a funnel-shaped cardboard eyeshade which excluded room light with a viewing eyepiece which the user held up to his eye. The fluoroscopic image obtained in this way was quite faint. Even when finally improved and commercially introduced for diagnostic imaging, the limited light produced from the fluorescent screens of the earliest commercial scopes necessitated that a radiologist sit for a period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkened</b> room where the imaging procedure was to be performed, to first accustom his eyes to increase their sensitivity to perceive the faint image. [...] The placement of the radiologist behind the screen also resulted in significant dosing of the radiologist.|$|E

2500|$|Like all sugar compounds, honey caramelizes if heated sufficiently, {{becoming}} darker in color, {{and eventually}} burns.

40|$|The {{color of}} food, {{especially}} meat and meat products, is a parameter that strongly influences consumer choice. In Italy, repeated cases of darkening in deboned thigh meat of male turkeys packaged in modified atmosphere (MAP; 80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) have been reported. The pH, lipid oxidation (TBARS), heme proteins, and iron content were investigated in MAP samples of turkey males, females, and in oxygen-permeable filmpackaged males. Furthermore, the absorbance spectrum (400 to 700 nm) {{of the meat}} extracts was analyzed to better delineate the evolution and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>darkening</b> process. Results showed that darkening occurred only in males with higher content of total iron, independently {{of the content of}} heme proteins, which differs only between males and females. Furthermore, pH was higher in muscles taken as controls, with respect to muscles involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkening,</b> as well as in females. Finally, TBARS values were found to be higher in darkened regions than in not darkened ones, as well as in MAP samples with respect to oxygen-permeable filmpackaged samples.

The films were studied by photoluminescence (PL), optical absorption, micro-Raman and X-ray diffraction methods. It is found that heating {{of the films}} to 100 °C promotes PVA crystallization and stimulates an increase of the PL intensity for the NCs of both types. The latter effect is ascribed mainly to the improvement of NC surface passivation by functional groups of PVA.
