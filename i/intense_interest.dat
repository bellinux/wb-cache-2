5|$|Frontier Indiana was prime ground missionary for the Second Great Awakening, with {{a never-ending}} parade of camp {{meetings}} and revivals. Baptist church records show an <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in private moral behavior at the weekly meetings, including drinking and proper child-rearing practices. The most contentious issue was antimission controversy, {{in which the}} more traditional elements denounced missionary societies as unbiblical.|$|E
5|$|He {{developed}} {{a love of}} science fiction and fantasy novels, especially the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, of which he remains an avid fan. During his adolescence, he also {{developed a}}n <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in fantasy role-playing games, especially Dungeons & Dragons, a pastime which he later characterized as an early experience in acting and improvisation.|$|E
5|$|When Brown was {{six years}} old, his father took him to an air show. Brown gained an <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in flying from this experience, and afterward, was {{attracted}} to a dirt airfield near his home, which he visited frequently in spite of being chased away by a local mechanic.|$|E
40|$|Some {{normally}} developing {{young children}} show an <b>intense,</b> passionate <b>interest</b> {{in a particular}} category of objects or activities. The present article documents the existence of extremely <b>intense</b> <b>interests</b> that emerge very early in life and establishes {{some of the basic}} parameters of the phenomenon. Surveys and interviews with 177 parents revealed that nearly one third of young children have extremely <b>intense</b> <b>interests.</b> The nature of these <b>intense</b> <b>interests</b> are described, with particular focus on their emergence, commonalities in the content of the interests, and the reactions of other people to them. One of the most striking findings is a large gender difference: Extremely <b>intense</b> <b>interests</b> are much more common for young boys than for girls...|$|R

50|$|His <b>intense</b> <b>interests</b> {{extended}} from pugilism (specifically, boxing), to hands-on involvement with sports cars, and, of course, the Chopin Études and the Beethoven Sonatas. Pianists should read his The Pianist's Problems.|$|R
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Matejko {{published}} an illustrated album, Clothing in Poland (Ubiory w Polsce), a project reflecting his <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in historical records {{of all kinds}} and his desire to promote such interest among Polish people, to intensify their patriotism. His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings, Death of Wapowski during the crowning of Henry Valois (Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego, 1861) and Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka (Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki, 1862), which settled his debts.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May Ladas {{started at}} odds of 1/12 (0.08/1) for the Newmarket Stakes against four opponents. He {{took the lead}} soon after half way and won easily ("unextended") by two lengths from St Florian. His price for the Derby was {{immediately}} shortened (reduced) to 4/9 (0.44/1). In the next two weeks, Ladas {{was the subject of}} <b>intense</b> <b>interest,</b> and was protected by a group of police detectives.|$|E

25|$|The new HRLR ranking {{innovative}} methods sparked <b>intense</b> <b>interests</b> {{from many}} institutions and inspired several other ranking lists and scoring {{which are based}} on professional, alumni, executives, competitiveness, human capital-oriented aspects.

5|$|Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August they {{returned}} to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.|$|E
5|$|More killings take place. Tilde, a {{beautiful}} lesbian journalist, is murdered {{at her home}} along with her lover Marion. Maria, the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is later hacked {{to death with a}} axe after discovering the killer's lair. Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti has an unusually <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in his work. That night, Neal and his Italian assistant Gianni watch Berti's house. Gianni approaches the house alone {{to get a better view}} and sees an assailant hack Berti to death with an axe. However, Gianni is unable to see the murderer's face. He returns to Neal to find the novelist has been knocked unconscious on the lawn.|$|E
5|$|Precise modern {{models of}} the Big Bang appeal to various exotic {{physical}} phenomena {{that have not been}} observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> for scientists, {{but it is not clear}} whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently unsolved problems in physics.|$|E

5000|$|The patrician Nickerson was {{occasionally}} seen as {{an unusual}} member of the Democratic Party. Referring {{to the man who}} was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, Nickerson once explained, [...] "Adlai Stevenson turned me into a Democrat. I was active in his first campaign, and I stayed active. He brought in other people like myself who had <b>intense</b> <b>interests</b> about government, of ideals and principles." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Aunt Gloria visiting Ted's family. Ted {{is a boy}} with Asperger syndrome. She is {{accompanied}} by her son Salim, a half-Asian boy who is about {{a year older than}} Ted. People with Asperger syndrome often display <b>intense</b> <b>interests,</b> and Ted has a fascination with the weather. Salim has a similar intense fascination with large structures, but it is never confirmed if he has Asperger syndrome.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of uranium fission in December 1938, {{reported in the}} January 6, 1939 issue of Die Naturwissenschaften by Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassmann, and its correct identification as nuclear fission by Lise Meitner in the February 11, 1939 issue of Nature, generated <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> among physicists. Even before publication, the news {{was brought to the}} United States by Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Enrico Fermi on January 26, 1939. The results were quickly corroborated by experimental physicists, most notably Fermi and John R. Dunning at Columbia University.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of the trappings of civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> by the men of the respective ships.|$|E
5|$|Titanic sank in 1912, {{when she}} {{collided}} with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. The wreck {{could not be}} located {{at the time and}} was not discovered until 1985. Numerous expeditions tried using sonar to map the sea bed in the hope of spotting it, but were unsuccessful. The wreck was finally located by a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The wreck {{has been the focus of}} <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> since its discovery and has been visited by numerous expeditions, including salvage operations which have controversially recovered thousands of items which have been conserved and put on public display.|$|E
40|$|InGaN半导体的带隙基本上覆盖了整个可见光波段,还包含了部分红外波段，在光电器件和光存储器件方面都有着广泛的应用。目前，影响其未来发展的几个难题，包括晶体质量、发光机制和相分离现象，深受大家的关注并需要迫切解决。本论文通过计算模拟和实验研究，并结合前人的研究，全面深入地考察了InGaN中相分离的有关问题，分析其性质、阐明其物理机制，进而讨论其抑制方法及其对InGaN发光的影响等。首先从热力学基础出发，着重分析了相分离与自由能变化量的关系，得出自由能变化量是否大于 0 ，由混合焓和熵共同确定；当&# 8706; 2 G/&# 8706;x 2 < 0 时，亚稳态分解自发产生，从而导致了相分离的发生，反之，& [...] .

25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in {{my entire}} life have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the <b>intensest</b> <b>interest,</b> with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|R
5|$|Webster went {{on trial}} at the Central Criminal Court– the Old Bailey– on 2 July 1879. In {{a sign of}} the great public {{interest}} aroused by the case, the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General, Sir Hardinge Giffard. Webster was defended by a prominent London barrister, Warner Sleigh, and the case was presided over by Mr. Justice Denman. The trial was just as well-attended as the earlier hearings in Richmond and attracted <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> from all levels of society; on the fourth day of the trial, the Crown Prince of Sweden– the future King Gustaf V– turned up to watch the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Following the bird's extinction, {{remains of}} the great auk {{increased}} dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, {{the largest number of}} any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £9000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year. The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally. Two mounted skins were destroyed in the twentieth century, one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War, and one in the Museu Bocage, Lisbon that was destroyed by a fire in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked <b>intense</b> <b>interest</b> and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E

Kaufmann continued: [...] "His call {{to the university of}} Basel came as a surprise to Nietzsche, who had not yet received his doctorate though he had published some fruits of his research in a scholarly journal. He had actually considered giving up philology for science when, on Ritschl's recommendation, he was appointed a professor of classical philology at Basel, and Leipzig hurriedly conferred the doctorate without examination." ...|$|R
