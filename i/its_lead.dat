25|$|A {{thyristor}} is a solid-state {{semiconductor device}} with four layers of alternating P and N-type materials. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of <b>its</b> two <b>leads</b> by combining that current with the smaller current of <b>its</b> other <b>lead,</b> known as <b>its</b> control <b>lead.</b> In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between <b>its</b> <b>leads</b> is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|R
