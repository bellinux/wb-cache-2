5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

500|$|The {{personal}} relationships of Michael Jackson {{have been the}} subject of public and media attention for several decades. He was introduced to the topic of sexual activity at age nine while a member of The Jackson 5.

The entertainer said his [...] "first real date" [...] was with the child actress Tatum O'Neal, when he was a teenager in the 1970s; he called her [...] "my first love - after Diana [...]" [...] The pair eventually [...] "cooled off" [...] and Jackson entered into a romance with model Brooke Shields in 1981.

500|$|Once in the maze, The Nameless One converses with Ravel, {{who asks}} him, [...] "What {{can change the}} nature of a man?"

Ravel is pleased with The Nameless One's answer because he offers his own thoughts; she claims she has killed many men in the past who, instead of giving their own answers, tried to guess what her answer might be. As the conversation progresses, Ravel explains that, in a past life, The Nameless One <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to make him immortal; however, the ritual she performed was flawed, causing him to lose his memory each time he died. She reveals that the mortality she separated from him was not destroyed, and that {{as long as he was}} alive, his mortality must still be intact. She does not know where his mortality is, but suggests that the fallen deva Trias might.|$|E

She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'"

500|$|Historian Robert Bartlett has {{commented that}} [...] "one {{of the largest}} {{uncertainties}} in {{the whole story of}} the death and resurrection of William Cragh is why Lady Mary [...] interceded for him", but intercede she did. John of Baggeham, when questioned about her motivation 18 years after the event, could only reply that [...] "Lady Mary had sought the body of this William, he did not know why". [...] Before the execution she <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> husband to spare the two condemned men, but he had refused. Then on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead, and believing that Cragh was still alive, she once again asked that he be handed over to her, but de Briouze delayed until he was convinced that Cragh was also dead. Then [...] "he granted him [...] to the said lady, such as he was, and ordered him to be taken down from the gallows". Lady Mary had [...] "a special devotion" [...] to Thomas de Cantilupe, the deceased Bishop of Hereford, and in her own words, upon hearing of Cragh's death, [...] "on bended knee, she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe to ask God to restore life to William Cragh".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Matsoukas {{said that she was}} surprised with the professional standard of Rihanna's acting. The inspiration for Rihanna acting in the video came from when Matsoukas saw the clip for [...] "Man Down" [...] in April 2011; the director stated that she was taken aback at how Rihanna realistically re-enacted a rape scenario. Matsoukas described the process for choosing O'Shaughnessy as the male love interest, stating that Rihanna <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to find a man she could [...] "fake fuck" [...] while filming. The director said that she telephoned a boxer her friend had told her about, and asked him to make a tape of himself using the description of how the male love interest should act. When asked if any of the video was improvised, Matsoukas revealed that she would create a scenario and then it was left to Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy to elaborate upon what the director had given them. Matsoukas jokingly said that the scene in which O'Shaughnessy draws a tattoo on Rihanna's buttock cheek {{was not part of the}} video's treatment, and that O'Shaughnessy improvised it. Upon the video's release, multiple media outlets and music critics compared the content of the video to a reenactment of Rihanna and Brown's physical altercation. When asked about this, Matsoukas clarified that the video was not linked to Brown in any circumstance, and said, [...] " [...] doesn't even really look like Chris Brown to me." ...|$|E

[...] She asked him to speak with Catesby, but Garnet reassured her that Catesby was instead seeking a commission in Flanders.

When in October Vaux raised the issue once more, claiming that several women <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> where they should retreat to once [...] "the brunt was passed in the beginning of Parliament", Garnet again mentioned Flanders, although Fraser suggests that Vaux's questioning must have concerned him deeply.|$|E
