However, since they operate {{in a wide variety}} of flight conditions, some of these have conflicting impacts on aircraft design process, as a single configuration may be efficient in one instance but perform poorly in others. A shape-shifting surface, or usually referred as 'morphing', potentially enables transport aircraft to reach maximum performance in any flight conditions. Within the framework of the Joint Technology Initiative Clean Sky (JTI-CS) project, and during the first phase of the <b>Green</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Integrated Technological Demonstration (GRA-ITD), the authors focused on the design and technological demonstration of an innovative bi-modal morphing outer wing flap to be installed on the next generation open rotor <b>green</b> <b>regional</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A novel active rib layout was designed to enable the articulation of the entire flap structure by means of multi-box arrangement. In order to prove structural load-carrying capabilities with the reference to a relevant environment, the full-scale morphing flap was properly analyzed by means of detailed finite element model analysis. To the authors' knowledge, there is no morphing concept in literature based on a similar architecture based on distributed servo-mechanical actuators. Hence, a rational review of the potential problems associated with actuators off-design conditions has been conducted to investigate the maturity of the concept and safety issues concerning the flap ground static test. In addition, useful insights have been provided to effectively detect potential failure conditions in service...|$|E

Research activities were carried out to substantiate the feasibility of morphing concepts enabling flap camber variation in compliance with the demanding safety requirements applicable to the next generation <b>green</b> <b>regional</b> <b>aircraft,</b> 130 - seats with open rotor configuration. The driving motivation for the investigation on such a technology was found in the opportunity to replace a conventional double slotted flap with a single slotted camber-morphing flap assuring similar high lift performances -in terms of maximum attainable lift coefficient and stall angle- while lowering emitted noise and system complexity. Studies and tests were limited to a portion of the flap element obtained by slicing the actual flap geometry with two cutting planes distant 0. 8 meters along the wing span. Further activities were then addressed in order to increase the TRL of the validated architecture within the second phase of the CS-GRA. Relying upon the already assessed concept, an innovative and more advanced flap device was designed in order to enable two different morphing modes on the basis of the A/C flight condition / flap setting: Mode 1, Overall camber morphing to enhance high-lift performances during take-off and landing (flap deployed); Mode 2, Tab-like morphing mode. Upwards and downwards deflection of the flap tip during cruise (flap stowed) for load control at high speed. A true-scale segment of the outer wing flap (4 meters span with a mean chord of 0. 9 meters) was selected as investigation domain for the new architecture in order to duly face the challenges posed by real wing installation. Advanced and innovative solutions for the adaptive structure, actuation and control systems were duly analyzed and experimentally validated thus proving the overall device compliance with industrial standards and applicable airworthiness requirements...|$|E

40|$|In the EU Clean Sky <b>Green</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Aircraft</b> project, we {{are proposing}} a 3 D wing model {{equipped}} with a gapless leading edge (LE) inclined downward, i. e., droop-nose, as a possible solution for reducing aeroacoustic noise.

In this research, noise radiated from the model has been predicted by a hybrid method. A stationary flow around the airfoil was first simulated in CFD analysis using a RANS turbulence model. After reconstructing a transient flow by an SNGR model, mid-field sound pressure was simulated based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy. Far-field pressure was finally computed by Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. The overall sound pressure level of this model was predicted to be 1. 6 dB lower than that of the baseline model having no LE devices. It was also found that the transition between the droop-nose and the regular LE near the wing tip should be sharp for preventing flow separation in this region...|$|E

These issues currently limit further growth of traffic operated by regional airliners which, in the next future, will have to face even more stringent environmental normative worldwide and therefore re-designed to incorporate advanced active aerodynamic technologies. The new concept behind GRA is based on several mainstream technologies: airframe low-noise (LN), aerodynamic load control (LC) and load alleviation (LA). These technologies integrate relevant concepts for hybrid and natural laminar flow (HLC/NLF) wing, active control of wing movables and aeroelastic tailoring for LC/LA functions, passive means (micro-riblets) for turbulent flow drag reduction, innovative gapless architectures (droop nose, morphing flap) beside conventional high-lift devices (HLDs), active flow control through synthetic jets, low-noise solutions applied to HLDs (liners, fences), and to fuselage-mounted main and nose landing gears (bay/doors acoustic treatments, fairings, wheels hub cap).

40|$|Modern {{aerospace}} {{research programs}} are increasingly oriented towards adaptive wing structures for greening {{the air transport}} in the near future. New structural concepts implementing and integrating innovative technologies are mandatory for succeeding in this critical task. Among these, the so-called morphing structures {{are taken into account}} in aerospace applications, since they ensure the structural shape control in order to optimize the aerodynamic efficiency during the different flight phases. Among the most ambitious research projects launched in Europe, the JTI - <b>Green</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Aircraft</b> (GRA) is placed in foreground for the design and the demonstration of a true-scale morphing flap applicable to the Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) wing of a 130 -seats reference aircraft belonging to EASA CS 25 category. In this framework, the authors intensively worked on the definition of a specific actuation and control system layout properly enabling two flap operational modes: overall camber morphing in deployed configuration, during take-off and landing, to enhance high lift performances; upwards and downwards deflection of the flap trailing edge (nearly the 10 % of the local chord) in stowed configuration, to improve wing aerodynamic efficiency in cruise. For this purpose, a digital logic control law was opportunely implemented into controller devices by using LTI DriveManager® software.

40|$|The current need {{to reduce}} {{emissions}} from air traffic leads to a rapid transition from ponderous and squandering to lightweight and energy efficient aircraft. Within this development many aircraft systems are electrified in order to eliminate pneumatic and hydraulic power sources. Furthermore, not having to bleed air from the engine compressor increases engine efficiency {{and the removal of}} hydraulic fluid contributes to reduce the environmental impact. Such an aircraft design requires all on-board systems be electric and share a common power source. This necessitates evaluating the electrical performance of the complete aircraft system in order to correctly specify generators, distribution networks and algorithms to reliably manage the distribution of electrical power in various load cases. To test and validate said energy management, static and dynamic performances of on-board systems need to be assessed with particular focus on electrical loads. These measures must be done early in the design process, ideally through simulations. However, different subsystems are often implemented in various simulation environments, each specifically suited to the task at hand. Consequently, the evaluation of the entire aircraft system requires a shared simulation environment (SSE) integrating individual sub-systems. For this purpose, we have developed detailed models of different on-board systems (EBird project) as well as an SSE connecting the different components (iSSE project).

40|$|In the <b>Green</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Aircraft</b> (GRA) {{project of}} the "Clean Sky" Joint Technology Initiative (JTI), an open rotor (OR) {{aircraft}} with 130 seats is being developed. One of the objectives in the Low Noise Conguration (LNC) domain is to reduce noise during approaching and landing phases that is annoyance perceived {{in the neighborhood of}} airports. In the landing phase, high-lift devices such as aps and slats attached to the main wing are deployed. Although this is to compensate deficiency of lift as airspeed is decreased from cruising speed, large noise is radiated from these devices. It is louder than engine noise because the power is minimum in this phase. It is very important to reduce aeroacoustic noise from these devices. This study is focused on estimation of noise radiated from a few high-lift configurations of a 2 D baseline airfoil. These are equipped with a double-slotted Fowler ap at the trailing edge (TE) in common, but have different devices at the leading edge (LE). The hybrid two-step method is used for computation. In the first step, a transient ow around the airfoil is simulated using computational uid dynamics (CFD) with a model of large eddy simulation (LES) [1, 2] and time-varying pressure fluctuation on the airfoil is estimated. In the second step, sound radiation is simulated using computational aeroacoustics (CAA), where the wave equation is solved with the estimated surface pressure as a boundary condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of lift force required by an aircraft during take-off and landing phases is conventionally obtained through wing flap deflection. Such devices are usually driven by control systems made of robust actuators and control lines that significantly {{contribute to the}} weight of the whole wing structure and, whereas proper external fairings are needed, also to wing friction drag and aerodynamic noise. Moreover, the shape change locally induced by flaps to wing airfoils is clearly limited to the allowable flaps excursion; it follows that, in operative conditions, only a discrete set of few airfoil shapes can be achieved, each shape being related to a precise flap deflection angle within the allowable range. The naturally foreseen advantages of an adaptive high lift device able to smoothly change its shape according to flight conditions as well as the intent of reducing friction drag and emitted aerodynamic noise in take-off and landing, all represented valid motivations for the assessment of a novel flap technology. In the framework of the Low Noise Configuration domain of the Clean Sky – GRA ITD, the authors proved the feasibility of a morphing architecture enabling the controlled camber variation of a flap segment in compliance with top-level requirements pertinent to the next generation <b>Green</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Aircraft.</b> The architecture is characterized by an Al-alloy multi-body morphing structure based on articulated ribs driven by electro-mechanical actuators. By referring to specific aerodynamic requirements in terms of target shapes and external loads expected in service, the structural layout of the device was preliminarily defined. Advanced FE analyses were then carried out in order to properly size the load-carrying components of the structure and the actuation system. Design performances were finally validated by experimental tests carried out on a true-scale prototype. The experimental campaign covered functionality, static and dynamic tests; obtained results showed high correlation levels with respect to numerical expectations thus proving the compliance of the device with design requirements as well as the goodness of modelling approaches implemented during the design phase...|$|E
40|$|Noise from {{contra-rotating}} open rotors is a {{major obstacle}} {{to the adoption of}} this fuel efficient technology as a viable aircraft propulsion system. A better understanding of both contra-rotating open rotor noise generation and reduction has been achieved due to ongoing extensive research. One of the most recent research activities is the WENEMOR (wind tunnel tests for the evaluation of the installation effects of Noise EMissions of an open rotor advanced regional aircraft) project, which has been developed in response to the requirements described in the Clean Sky-Integrated Technology Demonstrators under the heading of <b>Green</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Aircraft.</b> The project investigates the airframe installation effects of a 1 / 7 th scale model of a regional aircraft equipped with two contra-rotating open rotors of the same rotor diameter, the same rotational speed and equal blade number. For this case, the blade passing frequency of rotor-alone tones and the frequency of relevant interaction tones cannot be distinguished due to the equal blade count of the two rotors. This study presents the tone directivity plots up to 4 × blade passing frequency of the isolated WENEMOR single pylon contra-rotating open rotor engine in both pusher and tractor configurations at various angles of incidence and flow velocities. A linear array of 13 microphones is deployed for the far field sound measurements. The tone directivity trends show the efficient on-axis acoustic radiation at all blade passing frequency tones with the contra-rotating open rotor tone at 2 × blade passing frequency dominating {{in the vast majority of}} the tests. The main objective is to compare the acoustic emission of pusher and tractor configurations tested under the same flow velocities and angles of incidence. The results suggest that the pusher configuration of the isolated contra-rotating open rotor tends to be slightly louder than the tractor at 2 × blade passing frequency. However, it is shown that the acoustic performance of the isolated contra-rotating open rotor is complicated and sensitive to any change in the flow velocity and the angle of incidence. The increasing flow velocity and the increasing angle of incidence show limited consistency in proportional trends in the directivity plots of sound pressure levels. It is anticipated that the findings will be different for a more realistic case of installed-on-model contra-rotating open rotor. © The Author(s) 201...|$|E
