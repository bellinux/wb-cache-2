500|$|A few reviewers {{were pleased}} by the new {{friendship}} between Rory and Sam. Kubicek said it was [...] "officially my <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> from the entire third season of Glee", and Bell approved, though she said [...] "the writers don't know how to use" [...] Rory, and was disappointed that his brotherly relationship with Finn had [...] "fizzled". VanDerWerff singled out Rory's reading from the bible, which was, as Canning phrased it, [...] "ripped from A Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] when Linus reads the same passage, as one that [...] "irks" [...] him most, [...] "because it takes a perfectly beautiful little moment from a nearly perfect TV special" [...] and makes it a [...] "cutaway gag".|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "a half hour of heartwarming comedy". She was particularly pleased with how Michael was able to overcome Oscar with pathos, and she enjoyed the episode's subplots. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic praised the episode and awarded it five stars out of five. He wrote that [...] "If my <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> for Jim to do is prank Dwight, my second favorite is when he backs Michael." [...] Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "While this A story was filled with plenty of laughs, [...] Dwight's B story was absolutely murderous [...] all gold". He also felt that the C plot was enjoyable, because [...] "Andy is great in small doses".|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the sitcom Imagine That in 2002, replacing Emeril mid-season in the NBC lineup. He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who [...] "transformed" [...] each episode into a character Miller has imagined, [...] "provid a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work". Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired, due to poor critical reaction and ratings. Azaria later commented on the show: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} really truthful and interesting and impactful. We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> on television, but we couldn't do it on NBC, and nor would we want to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn't make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don't blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn't working." ...|$|E

50|$|The Huffington Post broke a {{story in}} November 2009 that, {{for the first time}} in several years, there would be no Oprah's <b>Favorite</b> <b>Things</b> episode. This turned out to be true; no reason was {{explicitly}} given for the cancellation, though the recession that had been taking place the year prior and that had served as the impetus for the low-budget <b>Favorite</b> <b>Things</b> that year was still ongoing at the time. However, Oprah held a sweepstakes in December 2009 that gave away prizes from past <b>Favorite</b> <b>Things</b> collections. The sweepstakes winner was announced and posted on the Oprah website.|$|R
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] {{was written}} {{alongside}} [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever" [...] in February and March 2008. [...] Its title {{is derived from}} the 1933 science fiction novel of the same name by H.G. Wells. [...] Co-executive producer/writer Drew Goddard called the episode [...] "maybe my <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> I've done on Lost, and I've been lucky with all the episodes I've gotten so far". [...] Shooting began on March10 and continued through March25, alongside filming of [...] "Something Nice Back Home". [...] The scene in which Ben confronts Widmore was actually filmed in London, because actor Alan Dale was unable to fly to Hawaii as he had been appearing in a production of the play Spamalot. [...] Several crew members and Michael Emerson flew to London to film the scene. [...] A scene in which Claire has a prophetic vision was produced; however, it was cut due to runtime constraints.|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{was written}} by Diane Warren and was {{produced}} by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Beyoncé and Kuk Harrell.

On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Posts PopWrap that she wrote [...] "the best [...] ever written" [...] {{a week and a}} half ago and that Beyoncé had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as [...] "a career song and probably my <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever written". The development of [...] "I Was Here" [...] was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyoncé since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that [...] "I Was Here" [...] was the ideal timing, [...] "I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing [...] would be Beyoncé.

500|$|Another {{idea from}} which the episode was crafted was the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all {{citizens}} {{of the town of}} South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as [...] "Landslide". They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as [...] "our <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> of any South Park ever": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. [...] "Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, we just thought it was the greatest thing ever," [...] he remarked.|$|E
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her <b>favorite</b> <b>thing.</b> That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
500|$|Jasmine is now revered as {{an iconic}} {{character}} and princess. Teen Vogue included Jasmine {{in an article}} recognizing the [...] "10 Best Disney Princesses of All Time". BuzzFeed ranked Jasmine second on their [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses" [...] list, while E! placed character at number four. According to PureWow, Jasmine is the fifth best Disney Princess because she [...] "was not OK with her family marrying her off to some random suitor." [...] Seventeen placed the character at number nine on a similar countdown. Author Jelani Addams Rosa wrote, [...] "Our <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> about Jasmine is that her and Aladdin take turns rescuing each other", {{but at the same}} criticized her for being too judgmental. On MTV's [...] "Ultimate Ranking of the Best Disney Princesses of All Time", Jasmine finished 10th. Refinery29 readers voted Jasmine the eighth greatest Disney Princess, garnering 351 votes. Seventeen ranked Jasmine the hottest Disney Princess, crediting her with initiating several young boys' sexual awakenings during 1992. Complex placed Jasmine second in its article [...] "The 25 Hottest Cartoon Women Of All Time", praising her hair and her eyes.

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Nick Offerman improvised the line [...] "Put it in an e-mail?", which he said when Leslie told him she had a very long story to tell him. Schur thought the line was [...] "my <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> in the show", and they made him say in it every {{subsequent}} take during filming. Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review. Dean Holland, Parks and Recreations editor, said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season. Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering, after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles, [...] "I feel like I'm already in the boys' club. Look at those bitches cleanin' up after me." [...] Schur said the line helped develop Leslie's character in future episodes because [...] "we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler than we had originally thought". The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode, but was moved to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] when the producers decided it fit better there. Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode. [...] "Boys' Club" [...] ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said, [...] "It's a running joke in the writer's room that every episode should end with clinking beers." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E

Steele considered Dead Again to be less melancholic and more positive compared to the band's previous albums. The album cover depicts the Russian mystic Rasputin, a historical figure that Steele admired. The title track touches on drug abuse and Steele's sense of having killed part of himself after suffering a relapse. [...] "Tripping a Blind Man" [...] is a diatribe on how Steele felt after his involuntary commitment was brought about by his family. [...] "Halloween in Heaven" [...] is a song about dead rockstars that Steele was inspired to write {{by the death of}} his close friend Dimebag Darrell. Steele's final live performance was on Halloween night at Harpos Concert Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, the last show of Type O Negative's 2009 tour.|$|E
