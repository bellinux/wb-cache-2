40|$|Hydrogen donor {{reactions}} in the coprocessing of coal and petroleum resids {{have been investigated}} using different hydrogen-rich models and reduced resids as donors and aromatics as acceptors. Three hydrogen-rich donor species were compared: cyclic olefins, <b>hydroaromatics,</b> and cycloalkanes; the aromatic acceptors included pyrene and anthracene; and the resids were reduced by the Birch method. Hydrogen was transferred most readily at 380 °C by cyclic olefins, followed by <b>hydroaromatics,</b> and the least was transferred by cycloalkanes. Catalysis by thiophenol promoted the hydrogen transfer by the cycloalkanes at 380 °C but had little effect at 440 °C. Reduced resids transferred substantially more hydrogen to an aromatic species than did the untreated resids. In a tertiary system of reduced resid, cycloalkane, and aromatic, the reduced resids yielded more hydrogen transfer and promoted hydrogen donation from the cycloalkanes in a nitrogen atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceThe {{pyrolysis}} of 1 -n-butyldecalin at {{high pressure}} (100 bar) was studied in gold sealed tube reactors at 400 °C. It leads to 4 main chemical {{families of products}} in order of predominance: (a) normal alkanes (methane, ethane, propane and n-butane), (b) bicyclics (decalin and 1 -methyldecalin), (c) <b>hydroaromatics</b> (tetralin and 5 -methyltetralin) and (d) diaramatics (naphthalene and 1 -methylnaphthalene). This distribution of products suggests that breaking of side alkyl chain and aromatization reactions should prevail at high pressure and low temperature. Reaction pathways are effectively proposed {{to account for the}} formation of main products. Both normal alkanes (except CH 4 and C 2 H 6) and bicyclics should mainly come from Csingle bondC bond breaking reactions on the side alkyl chain of 1 -n-butyldecalin. Methane and ethane should come from further decomposition of fuel radicals, including ring opening through beta-scissions given the absence of any C 12 and C 13 compounds in similar quantities. Both <b>hydroaromatics</b> and diaromatics are secondary products, which result from aromatization reactions of decalin and 1 -methyldecalin. In our conditions, 1 -n-butyldecalin and n-butylcyclohexane have a similar thermal reactivity. A higher yield in n-butane was observed in the case of 1 -n-butyldecalin.

30|$|Coal {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used fuels. It is used both as a fuel for {{generation}} of electricity and as a non- fuel for the production of value added chemicals and products (Song and Schobert 1993, 1996; Nyathi et al. 2013). Coal is also the biggest contributor to the pollution in the world. With the limitations being imposed on the CO 2, NO 2 and other harmful gases emissions into the atmosphere, it becomes all the more important to have cleaner coal combustion and utilization. Coal is basically a condensed macro-molecular polymeric structure (Krevelen 1993; Larsen et al. 1985; Hall and Larsen 1993; Chen et al. 1998). Most of its structural constituents are aromatics, paraffinics, heteroaromatics and <b>hydroaromatics</b> which are held by various covalent and non-covalent interactions. These interactions are vanderwaal interactions, aromatic-aromatic, charge transfer and donor acceptor interactions between the aromatics and heterocyclic units (Haenel 1992; Nishioka and Larsen 1990; Larsen and Mohammadi 1990; Otake and Suuberg 1997; Painter et al. 1990; Rahman et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|The world`s {{supply of}} {{petroleum}} crudes is becoming heavier in nature {{so that the}} amount of vacuum bottoms has been steadily increasing. Coprocessing of coal with these resids (1, 000 F+) is an attractive way of obtaining useful distillates from these readily available cheap materials. The objective of this work is to pretreat the host oil in ways that would improve its performance in coprocessing with coal. The following are examples of some ways in which heavy oil could be made into a better host oil: converting aromatic structures to <b>hydroaromatics</b> capable of donating hydrogen to coal, cracking the heavy oil to lower molecular weight material that would be a better solvent, and removing metals, sulfur, and nitrogen. The work reported here used a Venezuelan oil obtained from the Corpus Christi refinery of Citgo. Two coals, Illinois No. 6 and Wyodak subbituminous, were coprocessed with host oils. The authors have found that mild pretreatment of a Citgo resid (1, 000 F) using either Mo naphthenate or Mo/Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }/SO{sub 4 }, as well as a pretreatment using the homogeneous catalyst Co{sub 2 }(CO) {sub 8 } under synthesis gas can increase the available (donatable) hydrogen content of the resid. When these pretreated oils were thermally (no added catalyst) coprocessed with an Illinois No. 6 coal, about 90 wt% of the coal (maf) was converted to soluble products. This high coal conversion was realized even at a high coal loading of 50 wt%. The products from coprocessing coal and oil were equally split between high boiling material, mostly asphaltenes, and distillate. Distillate yields appeared to be affected by the concentration of coal in the feed, with maximum yields at coal loadings below 50 wt%...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} coal {{thermolysis}} were investigated, including how the chemical structures of aromatics, <b>hydroaromatics,</b> and alcohols affect their reactivities as hydrogen donors and acceptors in coal processing. The susceptibilities of substructural entities in coals to fragmentation via {{a number of}} thermal pericyclic and free radical mechanisms were probed, as were the factors governing relative reactivities within series of such coal model compounds. The theoretical {{part of the work}} applied perturbation molecular orbital (PMO) and frontier orbital theories, in conjunction with pi- and pseudo-pi MC's, to the study of model compound reactivity. This enabled prediction of reactivity patterns of H-donors, H-acceptors and coal-like structures as functions of their pi- and o-bond configurations, including heteroatomic effects. Experimentally, the liquid phase reactions of the coal model compound PhOCH 2 Ph (Benzyl phenyl ether, BPE) were detailed {{for the first time in}} each of the four hydronaphthalene H-donor solvents, (1, 4 - dihydronaphthalene, or 1, 4 -DHN), (1, 2 -DHN), (tetralin), and (trans-decalin), in the temperature range 220 *- 300 *C. The thermolysis of BPE exhibited a pronounced dependence on solvent structure, both with respect to product selectivities and reaction kinetics. The most preferential formation of light products, the most efficient hydrogen transfer, and the fastest kinetics were obtained with 1, 4 -DHN. In contrast, the overall BPE transformation rates in 1, 2 -DHN, tetralin and t-decalin were roughly comparable, despite qualitative differences in kinetic detail and heavy product (>C 130) formation. BPE thermolysis pathways were delineated as involving (a) rearrangement, leading to isomerization, (b) hydrogenations, leading ultimately to PhOH and PhCH 3 products,and (c) addition reactions, engendering heavy products. Pathways (b) and (c) are competitive and, in each, self-reactions of BPE-derivatives vie against reactions between these and the donor solvent. Of the detailed free radical and pericyclic reaction mechanisms postulated, the latter rationalized many more facets of the BPE results than the former.

40|$|The world's proven {{reserves}} {{of crude oil}} will be depleted in 42 years at {{the current rate of}} consumption. Oil refiners are under considerable economic and environmental pressure to improve the efficiency of refining and the quality and definition of products. Statistical and fundamental models are extensively used to more accurately model the important refinery processes such as Fluidised Catalytic Cracking (FCC). A major problem with the fundamental approach is that FCC feedstocks are by definition heavy petroleum fractions, and as such constitute highly complex mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis of heavy petroleum fractions reveals a broad 'hump' of unresolved compounds termed an Unresolved Complex Mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons. Conventional instrumental techniques alone are unable to elucidate the composition of UCMs, they are simply too complex. Oxidative degradation of UCMs has already been used with some success to selectively oxidise aliphatic and aromatic UCMs to reveal some of the structures incorporated in UCMs from various natural and anthropogenic sources. Ruthenium tetroxide (RUO 4) attacks aromatic rings at the ipso-carbon of aromatic moieties. Unsubstituted aromatic carbon is oxidised to CO 2 whereas substituents are preserved as carboxylic acids. "Retro-structural analysis" involves reconstruction of the products of oxidation to reveal the original molecule or 'average' molecule. However, previous studies have highlighted problems with the recovery of products from die oxidation of <b>hydroaromatic</b> compounds. <b>Hydroaromatic</b> compounds contain an alicyclic ring attached to an aromatic ring e. g. tetralin. This study presents evidence that (theoretically) data from RUO 4 oxidation FCC feedstocks can make a significant improvement to the accuracy of FCC modelling at BP Amoco. RUO 4 oxidation and work-up procedures were developed further in an attempt to overcome problems with 'losses' of oxidation products from <b>hydroaromatic</b> compounds, including an improved carbon dioxide trap. Several novel <b>hydroaromatic</b> compounds and a diaromatic compound proposed in a previous study as being 'average' UCM components were synthesised and fully characterised by GC, GCMS, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The compounds synthesised were 6 -cyclohexyltetralin, l-(3 '- methylbutyl) 7 -cyclohexyltetralin, 1 -n-nonyl- 7 -cyclohexyltetralin and 1 -/n-nonyl- 7 - cyclohexylnaphthalene. RUO 4 oxidation of the synthetic compounds and commercial tetralin revealed that while losses of between 70 and 50 % of the expected water soluble dicarboxylic acids are observed, these losses can be at least partially accounted for by the 'over oxidation' of carboxylic acids to produce smaller carboxylic acids. For example, the RUO 4 oxidation of tetralin produces 1, 6 -hexanedioic acid as a major product but significant amounts of 1, 5 -pentanedioic acid is observed along with trace amounts of 1, 4 - butanedioic acid. Smaller acids are likely to be undetected or lost as butyl esters during the work-up. Where 2 -n-nonyl- 1, 6 -hexanedioic acid was produced, decanoic and nonanoic acid as well as 1, 5 - pentanedioic acid and 1, 4 -butanedioic acid were observed corresponding to oxidation of the 2 - position on the dicarboxylic acid. The three major products from RUO 4 oxidation of ln-nonyl- 7 -cyclohexylnaphthalene were partially oxidised compounds including 2 -(l-oxo-n-decane) - 4 -cyclohexylbenzoic acid, showing that the oxidation of diaromatic compounds in UCMs gives more complex oxidation products. This is consistent with previous studies where diaromatic UCMs were oxidised to give a more complex 'oxidised UCM' rather than simple carboxylic acids. The observation of monocarboxylic acids in oxidation products from the alicyclic portion of a <b>hydroaromatic</b> compound has not previously been reported. This represents a new source of monocarboxylic acids in the RUO 4 oxidation products of UCMs and should be taken into account when oxidising UCMs likely to contain a significant proportion of <b>hydroaromatic</b> structures, such as hydrotreated FCC feedstocks. The synthesis and oxidation of di-substituted teiralins has increased the understanding of RuG 4 oxidation products from UCMs and consequently furthered the use of RUO 4 as a potentially useftjl tool in the elucidation of FCC feedstock compositions and other aromatic UCMs...|$|E

Slow-growing B. japonicum I- 110 demonstrated positive chemotaxis to shikimate, quinate, protocatechuate, and vanillate; threshold concentrations for the compounds were as low as 10 (- 6) M.

Taxis to beta-ketoadipate occurred constitutively and, of the tested compounds, beta-ketoadipate gave the strongest peak response. Taxis to shikimate or quinate was induced by growth on either substrate but not by growth on protocatechuate or succinate.

Py. of the pretreated coal as the second stage, H 2 P-Hy. Py. process, is effective for an increase of yields of oil, BTX and PCX. Hy. Py. process, due to the slow rate of hydrogen diffusion and without solvent, {{seems to be more}} subject to mass transfer limitation. It is suggested that during hydrogen pretreatment more hydrogen penetrates the coal to stabilize the free radicals formed pyrolytically, being favourable of the formation of light <b>hydroaromatics</b> and phenols in subsequent Hy. Py. It is found that Hy. Py. is unfavourably affected by the pretreatment under He, C 02 and H 2 O at 648 K, 3 MPa and gas residence time of 2 min for 30 min. Pretreatment under He seems to have no significant influence on Hy. Py. while pretreatment under CO 2 and H 2 O increases the oil yield. However, because of the strong penetration abilities of CO 2 and H 2 O it is very difficult for H 2 to replace them in Hy. Py. stage, resulting in hydrogen deficient condition and thus the decrease in the BTX yield. In addition, in H 2 P-Hy.

The induction level by shikimate was significantly decreased by the disruption of qsuR, which is located immediately upstream of qsuA in the opposite direction and encodes a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, suggesting that QsuR acts as an activator of the qsuABCD genes.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an overview on carbon chemical structure transformation to understand kerogen thermal decomposition {{based on the}} chemical structure of kerogen. Formation of kerogen is highlighted to distinguish the typical types of kerogen containing in oil shale and coal. The oil production potential for oil shale and coal is found to little correlate with their organic amounts but {{to depend on the}} quality or chemical structure of organic matters. Aliphatic and aromatic carbons in kerogen are correlative with the yield of oil and carbon residue from Fischer Assay retorting, respectively. The aliphatic carbon moieties largely produce oil and gas, while aromatic carbon portion is apt to be converted directly to carbon residue during kerogen pyrolysis process. On this basis, an updated lumped mechanism model is proposed for viewing kerogen pyrolysis and provides a basis for understanding the transformation of carbon chemical structures. Further quantization and analysis conclude that: 1) 10 - 20 % aliphatic carbon leaves in carbon residue as methyl groups and methylene bridges attached to aromatic rings, 2) 45 - 80 % aliphatic carbon is directly distillated into oil, and 3) 15 - 40 % aliphatic carbon is aromatized into aromatic carbon. The aromatization degree of aliphatic carbon varies with secondary reactions and its intrinsic chemical structure (alkyl chains, naphthenic and <b>hydroaromatic</b> hydrocarbons). Thus, the article justifies that primary pyrolysis determines the potentially maximal oil yield according to original carbon chemical structure, while the subsequent secondary reactions should be selective and minimized to determine the final oil yield and quality.

40|$|Quinate and protocatechuate {{are both}} {{abundant}} plant products and can serve, {{along with a}} large number of other aromatic or <b>hydroaromatic</b> compounds, as growth substrates for Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1. The respective genes are part of the chromosomal dca-pca-qui-pob-hca cluster encoding these pathways. The adjacent pca and qui gene clusters, which encode enzymes for protocatechuate breakdown via the β-ketoadipate pathway and for the conversion of quinate or shikimate to protocatechuate, respectively, have the same direction of transcription and are both expressed inducibly in response to protocatechuate. The pca genes are governed by the transcriptional activator-repressor PcaU. The mechanism governing qui gene expression was previously unknown. Here we report data suggesting the existence of a large 14 -kb primary transcript covering the pca and qui genes. The area between the pca and qui genes contains no promoter activity, whereas a weak, constitutive promoter was identified upstream of quiA (quiAp). The 5 ′ end of the quiA transcript was mapped. Northern blot analysis allowed the identification of a 12 -kb transcript spanning pcaI to quiX. An analysis of the pca and qui gene transcripts in a strain missing the structural gene promoter pcaIp led to the identification of two pcaIp-independent transcripts (4 and 2. 4 kb). The 2. 4 -kb transcript makes up about 25 % of the total transcript abundance of quiA, and thus the majority of transcription of the last gene of the area is also driven by pcaIp. This report strongly supports the organization of the pca and qui genes as a pca-qui operon and, furthermore, suggests that PcaU is the regulator governing its expression...|$|E
40|$|The sterols {{are complex}} <b>hydroaromatic</b> {{secondary}} alcohols which occur widely, if not abundantly, in living matter. The familiar example is cholesterol, known since {{the eighteenth century}} as the principal com-ponent of gallstones. Cholesterol forms glistening crystals with char-acteristic notched corners, by means of which it was early recognized in many morbid structures of the human body. Later it {{was found to be}} a constituent of normal tissues. The brain contains an ounce of it, and apparently every organ contains it in appreciable amount. Vegetable sterols were at first confused with cholesterol. Later they were known as plant cholesterols or phytosterol. The all-inclusive term, sterol, which came into use about 1911, now comprises a family of considerable size. It is usually restricted to those crystalline alcohols found in the unsaponifiable fractions of oils and fats, but not of waxes. There are groups of physiologically important substances which are fundamentally sterols in structure, although they are generally classified according to their function. Among these are the bile acids and certain cardiac poisons, sex hormones, venoms, and vitamins. In a short space one can mention merely a fraction of the great number of investigations published on the sterols. It will be necessary in some instances to cite other reviews, and frequently to omit investigations which are mainly of clinical or chemical significance. DISTRIBUTION OFSTEROLSINTHEANIMALANDVEGETABLEKINGDUMS. Discovery of cholesterol. The study of sterols began with investigations on the dissolution of gallstones.

40|$|VanK is {{the fourth}} member of the {{ubiquitous}} major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with PcaK, BenK, and MucK, contributes to aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1. VanK and PcaK have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype associated with inactivation of its homolog. Furthermore, vanK pcaK double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the <b>hydroaromatic</b> compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. This provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and {{is in line with}} the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. Previous studies of aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the β-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. By using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. In this study, the overlapping specificity of the VanK and PcaK permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vanK or pcaK. Spontaneous mutations identified in vanK include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a G 6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of VanK structure and function. Preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated PCR mutagenesis in one VanK mutant gave results similar to those using LacY, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. The selection for transport mutants described here for Acinetobacter may also be applicable to Pseudomonas putida, where the PcaK permease has an additional role in chemotaxis...|$|E
40|$|Microscale sealed vessel {{pyrolysis}} (MSSVpy) {{with online}} gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used {{with several other}} established and complementary analytical methods to robustly characterize the structure of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) and to practically assess the analytical value of MSSVpy. The NOM {{used in the study}} was from North Pine (NP) reservoir, {{which is one of the}} major source waters supplying Brisbane, the capital city of the Australian state of Queensland. The reservoir has moderate dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 5 mgL(- 1)) levels and is impacted by algae which periodically occur in bloom proportions. The hydrophobic (HPO; 65 % initial DOC) and transphilic (TPI; 12 %) fractions showed H/C values > 1, low UV(abs) and low aryl-C measured by NMR which are all indicative of low aromaticity. MSSVpy produced distinctly higher product concentrations than traditional flash pyrolysis and the molecular profile of the HPO and TPI fractions revealed by MSSVpy was correlated with the other analytical data to help establish their structural relevance. Prolific distributions of alkyl substituted aromatic (e. g., benzenes, naphthalenes) and <b>hydroaromatic</b> (e. g., tetralins) products detected in the HPO fraction were attributed to the aromatisation of terpanes and other aliphatic compounds from algal, and possibly also plant sources. Alkyl phenols also detected in HPO in high abundance, are probably from algal biopolymers, but may also reflect a contribution from non-methoxylated lignin units of catchment grasses. There was no analytical evidence of the dihydroxy or methoxy aromatic structures typical of wood lignin or tannin. N-organic pyrolysates (e. g., alkyl pyrroles, pyridines, indoles) of diagenetically altered proteins were concentrated in the TPI fraction. The quantitative importance of the N-organic moiety of the TPI fraction was corroborated by a low C/N ratio and distinctive amide and amine signals detected by (13) C NMR and FTIR. This integrated study demonstrates that the qualitative speciation provided by MSSVpy can make a significant contribution to the structural characterisation and source recognition of aquatic NOM.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{behaviour}} of coal plays {{a critical}} role on developing high coke quality attributes including strength which are critical for efficient blast furnace operation. Effect of coal plasticity {{on the evolution of}} coke microstructure is complex and particularly limited in relation to role of coal mineral chemistry. This study reports an experimental investigation relating to coal phase transformations during controlled carbonization as a function of coal ash and mineral composition using a range of analytical tools including FTIR, GC/MS, XRD, SEM and Optical microscopy. The chemical nature and magnitude of various carbonization products were related to the microstructure and the mechanical strength their cokes. The study identified the significance of coal mineral chemistry on plasticity as well as coke microstructure and mechanical strength. A number of microstructure parameters were combined to develop a combination microstructural parameter, and related to coke tensile strength as well as plastic range of parent coals. Under the tested conditions, up to 5 wt. % of kaolinite addition in coal is found to improve the fluidity, which could be associated with the increase of CHAr/CHAl ratio as well as decrease in CH 3 /CH 2 ratio of the residual char. The proportion of C=O/C=C bonds affected the plastic range. The study further showed that elevated kaolinite level in coal suppresses the evolution of low molecular compounds in tar phase and decrease the fluidity. Kaolinite addition in coal showed a significant effect on altering tar composition particularly phenol and benzene content especially at lower temperatures. Increasing presence of kaolinite levels in coal increased coke tensile strength but did not show a similar level of improvement in case of conventional coke tumbling strength. The effect of kaolinite presence on coal pyrolysis behaviour was also influenced by particle size such that finer particle size promoted fluidity while coarse particles improve the release of <b>hydroaromatic</b> methylene compounds. Coarser kaolinite leads to improve coke microstructure as well as mechanical strength. The study has implications for coal blending practice for improving coke quality such that future studies may focus in clarifying the role of other coal minerals and their associations on their thermoplastic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Shikimic acid {{production}} using recombinant E. coli {{has been}} developed during the past 15 years due to the increased demand of this product, primarily as a starting material for the anti-influensa medicine Tamiflu?. A detailed metabolic analysis of a shikimic acid producing E. coli strain {{was made in the}} current work in order to increase the understanding of shikimic acid production and identify means of improving the process. The strain used (called W 3110. shik 1) was modified for shikimate production by deletion of aroL, and by overexpression of aroFFBR (on a plasmid). Physiological characterizations were made using techniques such as metabolite analysis, stoichiometric network analysis, transcriptome analysis, and in situ 2 D-fluorometry at different modes of cultivation, and compered to a wild-type strain (W 3110). A high yield of shikimic acid requires both a high flux into the pathway and minimum by-product formation. In carbon-limited chemostat cultivation the total flux into the pathway was almost 2 times higher than the one obtained in phosphorus-limited chemostat cultivation (yields on glucose: ~ 0. 2 vs. 0. 1 c-mole/c-mole), but at the expense of increased formation of DHS, DHQ and quinic acid. Typical yields carbon- vs. phosphorus-limitation: shikimate: 0. 02 vs. 0. 06, DHS 0. 03 - 0. 12 (increased with increased growth rate) vs. 0. 03, DHQ: 0. 02 vs. 0. 01, quinic acid: 0. 02 vs. 0. 01. The batch and fed-batch conditions studied showed similar characteristics as their chemostat dittos. A theory to explain the mechanisms of by-product formation, based on intracellular equilibration, is discussed and compared to the <b>hydroaromatic</b> equilibration theory. Gene expression patterns of the two growth conditions showed differences in agreement with observed changes in total flux and by-product formation. Under carbon-limitation an upregulation of aroF, aroG, talA and talB agreed with the larger total flux into the pathway, and an upregulation of the genes ydiB, ydiN and aroD may explain the increased by-product formation. A slight starvation of the aromatic amino acids (identified by an induction of the trp and tyr-operons) under carbon-limitation, which was relieved under phosphorus limitation, was observed. The relief could possibly be explained by a simultaneous increased expression of aroK and aroA, thus enabling a higher flux downstream of shikimate. Metabolic flux analysis showed that the flux into the pathway was mostly dependent on the relationship between consumption and production of erythrose- 4 -phosphate. In addition, a higher flux connected to overflow metabolism was observed in the central metabolism under phosphorus-limitation. These fluxes were generally lower under carbon-limitation. 2 D-fluorometry was used to monitor strain stability in chemostat cultivation. It was shown that strain stability was not maintained for more than about 25 generations, even in selective medium. This method provided additional information about metabolic changes coupled to adaptation mechanisms. For example a change in fluorescence probably coupled to pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate dependent proteins and FAD-related compounds/proteins was observed...|$|E
