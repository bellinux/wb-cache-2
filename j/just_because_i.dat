And it's not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E

500|$|I {{spent a lot}} of {{time after}} [...] left the studio {{tightening}} up the rough. In fact, I'm sure she let me mix it <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> loved the track so much! I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals — but a lot of it was about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.|$|E
500|$|Denis O'Hare {{joined the}} cast in late March 2011 as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange joined the cast in April 2011 as Constance, marking her first regular role on television.

I've been offered network [...] before, and determined not to do it, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can't {{make that kind of}} time commitment." ...|$|E

[...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? <b>Just</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E

[...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> felt the movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} like it...
