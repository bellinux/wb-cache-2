5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the recipient, {{the fate of}} her sons, and the authorship of the letter. Bixby's character <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> (including rumored Confederate sympathies), {{at least two of}} her sons survived the war, and the letter was possibly written by Lincoln's assistant private secretary, John Hay.|$|E
5|$|P. p. centralis, {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1928 under its current name, breeds in Central Asia. It is smaller and less strongly blue than P. p. himalayanus, but its distinctness {{from the next}} subspecies <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|Scholia – {{commentary}} on the earlier writings of Pseudo-Dionysius. The original edition in Latin of Balthasar Corderius (Antwerp 1634) attributes all of the Scholia to Maximus, but the authorship <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> with Hans Urs von Balthasar (1940, 1961) attributing some of the Scholia to John of Scythopolis.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} was significant, because it represented the first ceratopsid known from China, {{and possibly the}} only ceratopsid from Asia. The only other possible Asian ceratopsid is Turanoceratops, but recently, its identification as a ceratopsid <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|Current eagle feather law {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> by Native American groups {{on the basis that}} it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, its {{identification}} as a Roman road <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> by academics, and alternative interpretations suggested for its purpose and date of construction.

5|$|Ladislaus {{intervened in}} a {{conflict}} between Wladislaw I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke's illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter's behalf. He marched to Poland and captured Wladislaw I Herman's younger son, Boleslav, in 1093. At Ladislaus's demand, Wladislaw I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The Illuminated Chronicle also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Cracow during Ladislaus's campaign, but the credibility of this report <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b> It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E
5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the nascent Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result, the veracity of Theophanes's account <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> by recent scholarship, which places more emphasis on the Arabic and Syriac sources.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b> He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E

5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 the German {{zoologist}} Peter Simon Pallas formally {{described the}} bluebuck as Antilope leucophaeus. In 1853, the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck {{stated that the}} type specimen was an adult male skin now in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (formerly Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie), collected in Swellendam and present in Haarlem before 1776. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> whether this was actually the type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis selected it as the lectotype of a syntype series, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned,</b> however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> {{is the fact that it}} claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|Recordings {{with the}} Parental Advisory label are often {{released}} alongside censored versions that {{reduce or eliminate}} the questionable material. Several retailers will distribute all varieties of the product, occasionally with an increased price for censored versions, while some sellers offer the amended pressings as their main options and choose not to distribute the explicit counterparts. However, the label <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> for its perceived ineffectiveness in limiting the amount of inappropriate material that young audiences are exposed to.|$|E
