Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rhymed couplet.

Other attacks also consist of variations of existing moves with a different conclusion, such as his Combined Wind and Sand-Dust attacks, which both give similar visible cues but with the latter <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lower strike. Others moves such as Violent Cannon make use of feints, appearing to attack from one angle but striking from another.|$|E
