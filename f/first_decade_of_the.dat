5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} since the <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, {{the press is}} corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since the <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E

In the early <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, the core curriculum for undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998–2004), making the school's offerings more accessible to non-major Dartmouth students.

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population; and almost 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat in the <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land in the <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England {{before the end of}} the <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
