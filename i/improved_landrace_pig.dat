40|$|Western and {{indigenous}} Chinese pig breeds show obvious differences in muscle growth and meat quality, however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The main {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the gene expression of muscle fiber type in local Rongchang and exotic <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs</b> at the same body weight (10 ~ 110 kg). We compared differentially expressed muscle fiber types such as types I and 2 a, type 2 b, as well as type 2 x fibers in longissimus dorsi of Rongchang and <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs</b> using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Results suggested that there are varieties and existence difference in developmental regularity of fiber types of longissimus muscle between Rongchang and <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs,</b> and the fiber composition differences mainly manifest in 80 kg. Ratio of MyHC 2 b type fiber in Rong Chang was significantly lower than that of <b>Landrace</b> <b>pig.</b> These results may provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism responsible for breed specific differences in growth performance and meat quality.

Variation amount of each population was measured with average number of alleles per locus, heterozygosities, polymorphism information content (PIC) value were calculated.

Cell cycle information was detected by flow cytometry. Results showed that there was a greater (P, 0. 05) number of SCs in Lantang <b>pigs</b> compared with <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs</b> after 72 h of culture. The percentage of cell population in S phase and G 2 /M phases in Lantang pigs were higher (P, 0. 05), while in G 0 /G 1 phase was lower (P, 0. 05) in comparison with the <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs.</b> The mRNA abundances of MyoD, Myf 5, myogenin and Pax 7 in SCs from Lantang pigs were higher (P, 0. 05), while those of myostatin, Smad 3 and genes in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (with the exception of 4 EBP 1) were lower (P, 0. 05) than the <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs.</b> Protein levels of MyoD, myogenin, myostatin, S 6 K, phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated eIF 4 E were consistent with the corresponding mRNA abundance.

To elucidate the molecular interactions among diet, pig genotype, and physiological stage, we examined the effect of dietary protein concentration, pig genotype, and physiological stages on amino acid (AA) pools, protein deposition, and related signaling pathways in different types of skeletal muscles. The study used 48 <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs</b> and 48 pure-bred Bama mini-pigs assigned to each of 2 dietary treatments: lower/GB (Chinese conventional diet) - or higher/NRC (National Research Council) -protein diet. Diets were fed from 5 weeks of age to respective market weights of each genotype. Samples of biceps femoris muscle (BFM, type I) and longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM, type II) were collected at nursery, growing, and finishing phases according to the physiological stage of each genotype, to determine the AA concentrations, mRNA levels for growth-related genes in muscles, and protein abundances of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our data showed that the concentrations of most AAs in LDM and BFM of pigs increased (P< 0. 05) gradually with increasing age. Bama mini-pigs had generally higher (P< 0. 05) muscle concentrations of flavor-related AA, including Met, Phe, Tyr, Pro, and Ser, compared with <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs.</b> The mRNA levels for myogenic determining factor, myogenin, myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2 A, and myostatin of Bama mini-pigs were higher (P< 0. 05) than those of <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs,</b> while total and phosphorylated protein levels for protein kinase B, mTOR, and p 70 ribosomal protein S 6 kinases (p 70 S 6 K), and ratios of p-mTOR/mTOR, p-AKT/AKT, and p-p 70 S 6 K/p 70 S 6 K were lower (P< 0. 05). There was a significant pig genotype-dependent effect of dietary protein on the levels for mTOR and p 70 S 6 K.
