Curs: 2013 / 2014 Society {{perceives}} the Resources and Capabilities {{as simple}} elements {{that make up}} a company, but really are important business tools that can make obtaining a competitive advantage if they are managed and exploited optimally by their managers. On the other hand, it is also interesting to investigate the Labor Flexibility and especially the Internal Labor Flexibility, so ask whether to achieve cost reduction is necessary to incur redundancy policies or whether there is other alternatives. Following this issue, and the capacity of Internal Flexibility, the effect of this on the company <b>Fertiberia</b> <b>SA,</b> and especially in relation to innovation in the factory will be analyzed. Thus, the following research aims to reaffirm that the implementation of these measures of internal flexibility which will be explained throughout the report, will provide an alternative to both businesses and workers, as their perspective is great importance. Therefore this research will deepen the theoretical level of resources and capabilities, and labor flexibility, and more extensively in practice and the importance of Internal Labor Flexibility in international fertilizer company, <b>Fertiberia</b> <b>SA</b> To perform this study is essential to analyze the following: • Appreciate the role of resources and capabilities within firms. • Identify and evaluate resources and capabilities. • Assess the potential of resources and capabilities and establish a sustainable competitive advantage. • Use analysis results to formulate strategies appropriate to the environment After defining these points research will focus on answering the following questions in both the theoretical and practical level. What kind of flexibility used <b>Fertiberia</b> <b>SA?</b> Does the flexibility is a source of competitive advantage in <b>Fertiberia</b> <b>SA?</b> What is the relationship between the internal labor flexibility and innovation in <b>Fertiberia</b> <b>SA?</b> Does the employee training benefits Fertiberia internal flexibility in SA? This investigation is structured as follows: after defining the objective of the research, theories of the most important authors on resources and capabilities and flexible working will be stated. The methodology by which the research has been performed and by which results are obtained will be explained. Finally in the discussion section, the results obtained was studied and the information reflect about the company will be valued Fertiberia S. A, and the project will conclude with a summary and final review of the issues of greatest significance discussed during the research, highlighting compliance or non-compliance with the objectives stated in the introduction to the report...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{feasibility}} of visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy in quantifying parameters such as oil, protein and total glucosinolate contents of three cultivars of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and one cultivar of Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun). Spectral data from 400 to 2498 nm were recorded on intact seeds {{in a total of}} 189 samples at 2 nm intervals. The content of the constituents ranged from 34. 1 % to 48. 4 % for oil, from 14. 5 % to 31. 2 % for protein and from 15. 8 to 97. 9 μmol/g for total glucosinolates. Global calibration equations using the entire Brassica database were developed by means of modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression analysis of conventional laboratory analysis values using different data pre-processing treatments. Different external validation sets were used to evaluate the accuracy of the global calibration model; in all cases the second derivative pre-processing showed the best results. In the external validation including samples of both Brassica species, the coefficient of determination (r 2) and the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference data to the standard error of prediction (RPD) were 0. 98 (6. 5), 0. 96 (4. 9) and 0. 99 (10. 0) for oil, protein and total glucosinolate contents, respectively. However, the predictive performance of the global calibration model on single species resulted in lower r 2 and RPD values for total glucosinolates. The accurate predictions provided by the NIR equations confirm that NIR technology could be very useful for the rapid quality evaluation of intact rapeseeds avoiding the need for grinding and saving time. © 2010 Elsevier B.
