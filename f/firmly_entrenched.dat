40|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century until the closing decades of the twentieth century, Greeks played a large part in Australia’s food {{catering}} industry. They continued, nevertheless, to enter a wide variety of occupations. These included: agricultural and pastoral activities, mining, sea-related industries, itinerant work, secondary industries, public life, professional fields, and artistic and sporting avenues. Moreover, their contribution in some activities proved significant. This paper <b>firmly</b> challenges the <b>entrenched,</b> popular stereotype of Greek-Australians as being historically defined as essentially a collection of fish’n’chip shop owners and café and milk bar proprietors.

40|$|Siphoning {{refers to}} the {{practice}} used by pay television broadcasters by which they appropriate, or ‘siphon off’ certain events that have been traditionally shown on free-to-air television so that viewers who do not subscribe to their services are unable to view those events.   • Australia’s free-to-air broadcasters lobbied government extensively {{to ensure that a}} list of programs which could not be siphoned by pay television was in place to coincide with the introduction of pay television in the mid 1990 s. The list detailed events that can not be shown on pay television until telecast rights have first been acquired by a free-to-air broadcaster.   • Pay television operators initially objected to the introduction of an anti siphoning list {{on the grounds that it}} would inhibit the development of pay television. • The list has undergone considerable review since its introduction. This has resulted in some minor changes, but a list, per se, appears to be <b>entrenched</b> <b>firmly</b> as part of the media landscape in Australia.        • Arguments surrounding the maintenance of the list have been consistent. Free-to-air broadcasters claim that the list serves the public interest, and therefore it should be maintained. Pay television operators oppose the list, which they argue serves the interest of free-to-air broadcasters, not the public.    • The diametrically opposing stances of these powerful interest groups have ensured that anti siphoning is not an issue that governments can ignore. At the same time, anti siphoning has proven an issue that governments, despite various efforts at compromise, have not been able to resolve to the total satisfaction of the broadcasters or other participants, including viewing audiences.       • This paper traces the history of the anti siphoning regime in Australia. It discusses its development and explores the arguments for and against its retention, both in past context and in relation to a current government inquiry into the relevance of the scheme in a changing 21 st century media environment.      Image: dpstyles / flick...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Current {{critiques of}} the {{insufficiency}} of conventional design practices in tackling massive problems with complex political, ethical and material dimensions often overlook a key assumption underlying {{the entirety of}} both design practice and theory: that design is effectively a discipline that deals with relations in both the human and nonhuman realms, but that the lenses that designers use are one-way, <b>entrenched</b> <b>firmly</b> in a human-centric (‘correlationist’) foundation. With few exceptions, {{much of the research}} coming out of design tends to accept the strongly correlationist traditions prevalent in both the humanities and science without question, and thus we argue that the capacity of design as a discipline to deal with complex systemic problems, with issues of sustainability, instability, and even survival, is severely hampered without a complete account of how the nonhuman world functions. This paper lays out our argument for the need for a non-correlationist description of design praxis and poiesis, that does not distinguish between the human/nonhuman binary, but treats all things on an equal, or ‘flat’, ontological footing. For this, we turn to the recent speculative realist turn which has sought to challenge correlationism within the humanities, in particular the work of the object-oriented ontological (OOO) philosopher Graham Harman. In Harman, we find a fascinating account of the nature and relations of things in a flat ontology. We propose that an OOO based account of design has interesting implications for reframing current interaction and systems design praxis in two ways. Firstly, it reveals how the design process is already constituted as a form of ontological inquiry concerned with understanding thingly essences and manifestations. Secondly, it gives a distinct account of both thing-thing and thing-in-itself relations that we feel opens up new horizons in a general theory of aesthetics, affect, and interaction in design. We will, for the purposes of initiating this new mode of inquiry, work with the Harmanian concepts of the quadruple object and allure to suggest a redefinition of the concept of affordances in interaction design, and suggest the concept of unities to show how object totalities may be mapped without a reduction to mere relations...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon a {{longitudinal}} study of L 1 attrition in two bilingual teenage siblings, J and her older brother S, with Korean as their L 1 and English as their L 2. The two teenagers 2 ̆ 7 initial exposure to English occurred {{at the age of}} 9. When the two siblings began to have sustained exposure to and immersion in an English L 2 environment, they were at the postpubertal age. They had been attending high school in a Mid-Western city in the U. S for about two years when the study was conducted. The longitudinal study addressed three main questions. The first question concerned the siblings 2 ̆ 7 language (L 1 and L 2) development, language dominance and cross-lingusitic influence from a bidrectional perspective. The second question examined the evidence for L 1 attrition in relation to lexis, morphology and syntax, and their relative levels of vulnerability. The third question examined the role of extra-linguistic factors in the process of L 1 attrition. In order to address the above questions, the two siblings were observed in their home over a period of 8 months. The data for the longitudinal study included the siblings 2 ̆ 7 (i) spontaneous speech interactions in the home (ii) oral narratives in the L 1 and L 2 and (iii) their responses to a language background questionnaire. The results showed that the two siblings 2 ̆ 7 English L 2 developed and improved over time, but that they continued to maintain their L 1 (Korean) as their dominant language. The evidence from both siblings 2 ̆ 7 L 1 and L 2 use supported bidirectional cross-linguistic influence (i. e. from the L 1 onto the L 2 and from the L 2 onto the L 1). L 1 attrition occurred only minimally in relation to morphology (e. g. honorification, case particles, classifiers, and plural marking) and lexical choice, while the siblings 2 ̆ 7 L 1 syntax remained relatively stable over time. Overall, the siblings were largely successful in maintaining their L 1. In part, this was because their L 1 was already <b>firmly</b> established or <b>entrenched,</b> as their immersion in an L 2 environment occurred only when they were older (around puberty). Furthermore, their frequent use of their L 1 for social networking, along with their positive attitudes toward their heritage language, also {{played a crucial role in}} maintaining and stabilizing their L 1. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of the findings of the present study, as well as recommendations for the future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{emplacement}} of Soviet {{missiles in}} Cuba in October of 1962 and the American {{response to this}} action thrust the world into its first major nuclear crisis. Because this American-Soviet confrontation seemed to propel the antagonists {{to the brink of}} nuclear holocaust, at least in appearance if not also in fact, a vast amount of history has been written on this brief but crucial episode in the Cold War. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the development of the various historiographical perspectives of the Cuban missile crisis. The traditionalists view President John F. Kennedy as responding by necessity to a Soviet threat to alter the balance of power via the Russian missiles in Cuba. The American response in the form of a quarantine was superb as President Kennedy successfully terminated the crisis by compelling Nikita S. Khrushchev-to withdraw the Soviet missiles from Cuba. The traditionalists praise the President for his exceptional skills in crisis management and for his superb leadership which ultimately resulted in a victory for America as a period of detente ensued between the United States and the Soviet Union. The right wing revisionists accuse President Kennedy encounters with the Soviet Union. They also accuse the President of seeking conciliation with the Russians during the crisis rather than seeking a military victory in the confrontation. According to the right wing perspective, the President suffered a defeat. in the aftermath of the crisis, for his policy of accommodation allowed Castro to continue his dictatorship over Cuba and permitted communism to become <b>entrenched</b> <b>firmly</b> in the Western Hemisphere. The left wing revisionists accuse President Kennedy of rejecting a diplomatic approach to the crisis and initiating the confrontation. For the sake of personal prestige and political expediency, the President arbitrarily transformed an international political problem into an international military crisis. According to the left wing perspective, the aftermath of the crisis instilled in Americans an arrogance of power and resulted in the advancement of the nuclear arms race. The Sovietologists' perspective differs from the other interpretations in that it neither praises nor condemns President Kennedy. The Sovietologists are concerned primarily with the Soviet motives for emplacing missiles in Cuba and for eventually withdrawing them. The Sovietologists ascribe multiple motives to the Russians for their decisions both to of contributing to the instigation his ineptness and lack of decisive of the crisis situation by leadership in previousemplace and to withdraw the missiles in Cuba. The concluding interpretation accuses both Khrushchey and Kennedy of initially acting irresponsibly, the former creating a situation subject to crisis and the latter by creating a needless confrontation. Once the crisis was initiated, the two leaders generally behaved responsibly and cautiously as they attempted to control the crisis. Yet, despite the efforts of Khrushchev and Kennedy, the nuclear confrontation was terminated successfully without armed conflict or catastrophic consequences as much by fortune as by human design.

The Emir was in favour of an alliance but wanted British help in recapturing Peshawar which the Sikhs had captured in 1834. The British refused to help. Dost Muhammad then started negotiating with the Russians who had also sent an envoy to Kabul. This led the Governor General of India, Lord Auckland to conclude that Dost Muhammad was anti-British.

On 21 April 1967, during Operation UNION, elements of Company F, conducting offensive operations at Binh Son, encountered a <b>firmly</b> <b>entrenched</b> enemy force and immediately deployed to engage them. The Marines in Private Martini's platoon assaulted across an open rice paddy to within twenty meters of the enemy trench line where they were suddenly struck by hand grenades, intense small arms, automatic weapons, and mortar fire. The enemy onslaught killed 14 and wounded 18 Marines, pinning the remainder of the platoon down behind a low paddy dike. In the face of imminent danger, Private Martini immediately crawled over the dike to a forward open area within 15 meters of the enemy position where, continuously exposed to the hostile fire, he hurled hand grenades, killing several of the enemy. Crawling back through the intense fire, he rejoined his platoon which had moved to the relative safety of a trench line. From this position he observed several of his wounded comrades lying helpless in the fire swept paddy. Although he knew that one man had been killed, attempting to assist the wounded, Private Martini raced through the open area and dragged a comrade back to the friendly position. In spite of a serious wound received during this first daring rescue, he again braved the unrelenting fury of the enemy fire to aid another companion lying wounded only twenty meters in front of the enemy trench line. As he reached the fallen Marine, he received a mortal wound, but disregarding his own condition, he began to drag the Marine toward his platoon's position. Observing men from his unit attempting to leave the security of their position to aid him, concerned only for their safety, he called to them to remain under cover and through a final supreme effort, moved his injured comrade to where he could be pulled to safety, before he fell, succumbing to his wounds. Stouthearted and indomitable, Private Martini unhesitatingly yielded his own life to save two of his comrades and insure the safety of the remainder of his platoon. His outstanding courage, valiant fighting spirit and selfless devotion to duty reflected the highest credit upon himself, the Marine Corps, and the United States Naval Service.

During the battle, the Chinese managed to amass 133 large caliber guns, 24 BM-13 rocket launchers and 47 anti-aircraft guns in the largest Chinese artillery operation during the Korean War, and it posed {{a serious threat to}} ground troops of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division operating in the area. The artillery was heavily guarded, forcing the UN forces to use airpower to combat them.|$|E
500|$|Judge John Deed {{presents}} a fictionalised {{version of the}} English legal system. The British Film Institute's Screenonline notes that [...] "Almost every week, Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex-wife or defended by his on-off girlfriend (with occasionally help from his daughter)", highlighting how unlikely {{it would be for}} a real judge to have so many conflicts of interest in his court. It also notes that Deed's faults, such as his affairs with his therapist and with Francesca Rochester, prevent him from being [...] "a completely idealised heroic figure", and the fact that because all of his family and friends practise law, he is <b>firmly</b> <b>entrenched</b> in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against. Deed has been accused of hypocrisy, particularly for using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in [...] "Exacting Justice". There is a belief in some legal circles that, although Judge John Deed is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas, viewers see Deed as an aspirational character taking on a corrupt establishment. Despite being picked apart by legal professionals, the cast and Newman were invited to the annual dinner of the Association of Women Barristers in 2006 as part of a drive to raise the profile and attract new members to the group.|$|E
