5|$|In 1994, Slayer {{released}} Divine Intervention, the band's {{first record}} with drummer Bostaph. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an {{architect of the}} Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> church, and the lengths to which governments will go to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much {{of the content of}} the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, {{including}} Dow, believed drunkenness {{was a great}} {{threat to}} the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became {{a founding member of}} the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.|$|E

[...] This is similar to what the Prophet Moses {{had been told to}} say when Pharaoh had expressed his design before his full court to kill him: [...] "I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning."

5|$|The {{history of}} {{feminism}} in India {{can be divided}} into three phases: the first phase, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, initiated when male European colonists began to speak out against the social <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> Sati; the second phase, from 1915 to Indian independence, when Gandhi incorporated women's movements into the Quit India movement and independent women's organisations began to emerge; and finally, the third phase, post-independence, which has focused on fair treatment of women at home after marriage, in the work force and right to political parity.|$|E
5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> war and political parties.) When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times. However, the Senate, where non-slave and slave states had more equal representation, never passed the measure.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Wallace {{published}} a book entitled The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures about developments in the 19th century. The {{first part of the}} book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> European colonialism. Wallace continued his social activism {{for the rest of his}} life, publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death.|$|E
5|$|At the court, Kalyani defends her act of {{infanticide}} {{with the}} judge being Chandrasekaran, who after hearing her tragic story realises she is his sister, and faints. Gunasekaran is also brought to the court for having attacked the pujari who tried to molest his sister. During his trial, Gunasekaran explains the misfortunes which have befallen him and his family, and justifies his actions. Gunasekaran's valiant defence in the court awakens everyone on the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> the society. As the trial proceeds, Vimala arrives and produces Kalyani's child, which was revealed to have safely fallen in her boat instead of the river. Kalyani and Gunasekaran are pardoned and acquitted by the court, and are finally reunited with Chandrasekaran. Gnanasekaran, while collecting donations for his association of beggars, also joins them unexpectedly. With Vimala and Gunasekaran deciding to get married, the family subsequently inaugurates a welfare home for orphans.|$|E

5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> {{the world in the}} box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the party}} {{nominated}} Thompson for vice president, joining a ticket headed by Neal Dow of Portland, Maine, {{the author of}} one of the nation's first municipal prohibition laws. Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. The Prohibitionists increased their vote total in the election that year, but still received just over 10,000 votes out of more than nine million cast. Thompson made another bid for elected office in 1887, when the Prohibition Party nominated him for Governor of Ohio. He was again unsuccessful, netting {{less than one percent of}} the vote and finishing in a distant fifth place behind the winner, Democrat Richard M. Bishop. Thompson's vote total was also surpassed by the Republican candidate, William H. West, and the candidates of two other minor parties, the Workingman Party and the Greenback Party.|$|E

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{venture into}} modernity brought {{concepts}} of democracy, equality and individual rights. The {{rise of the}} concept of nationalism and introspection of discriminatory practices brought about social reform movements related to caste and gender relations. This first phase of feminism in India was initiated by men to uproot the social <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> sati (widow immolation), to allow widow remarriage, to forbid child marriage, and to reduce illiteracy, as well as to regulate the age of consent and to ensure property rights through legal intervention. In addition to this, some upper caste Hindu women rejected constraints they faced under Brahminical traditions. However, efforts for improving the status of women in Indian society were somewhat thwarted by the late nineteenth century, as nationalist movements emerged in India. These movements resisted 'colonial interventions in gender relations' particularly in the areas of family relations. In the mid to late nineteenth century, there was a national form of resistance to any colonial efforts made to 'modernise' the Hindu family. This included the Age of Consent controversy that erupted after the government tried to raise the age of marriage for women.|$|E
