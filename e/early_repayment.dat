5|$|On 26 July 2012, for {{the first}} time since September 2010, Ireland was able to return to the {{financial}} markets, selling over €5 billion in long-term government debt, with an interest rate of 5.9% for the 5-year bonds and 6.1% for the 8-year bonds at sale. In December 2013, after three years on financial life support, Ireland finally left the EU/IMF bailout programme, although it retained a debt of €22.5 billion to the IMF; in August 2014, <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> of €15 billion was being considered, which would save the country €375 million in surcharges. Despite the end of the bailout the country's unemployment rate remains high and public sector wages are still around 20% lower than at the beginning of the crisis. Government debt reached 123.7% of GDP in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating part of {{the company}} may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five years}} from these. It cannot demand <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E

He sponsored the Grand Canyon National Park Act, and, {{in honor of his}} mother, he introduced a joint resolution calling for women's suffrage. In 1914, Hayden secured an extension of repayment times for loans made under the National Reclamation Act of 1902 from ten to twenty years. The extension included greater flexibility in the payment amounts during the <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> period. An additional change in the way that reclamation projects were funded came in 1922 with passage of Hayden's legislation authorizing revenues from sale of hydroelectric power to be credited to repayment of project debts. Favoring local control of reclamation projects, in 1917 Hayden wrote legislation transferring financial obligations and operations of the Salt River Project from the Bureau of Reclamation to a local government entity. The Bureau transferring control to local government agencies would become the model for future reclamation projects in The West.|$|E
25|$|There {{may also}} be a special class which absorbs <b>early</b> <b>repayments</b> in the {{underlying}} assets. This is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which, in essence, are repaid whenever the properties are sold.

Similarities are noted between this model and those used for profit testing in life insurance. We emphasize aspects that reasonably can be treated in several ways and also indicate where the cash flow model differs from the pricing methods usually employed in bank lending. The sensitivity of interest rates to various parameters of the model such as the length of loan and the expected default rate is examined.

40|$|Mortgages {{characterized}} by negative or low early amortization schedules amplify the macroeconomic {{effects of a}} housing risk shock. We analyze the role of mortgage amortization in a two-sector DSGE model with housing risk and endogenous default. Mortgage loan contracts extend to two periods and have adjustable rates. The fraction of principal to be repaid {{in the first period}} can vary. As the fraction of principal to be paid in the first period falls, steady-state mortgages and leverage increase and the impact of a housing risk shock on consumption and output is amplified. Borrowers prefer negative amortization. If free to choose the amortization schedule, borrowers would repay most of the principal in the last period of the contract. Low <b>early</b> <b>repayments</b> of principal allow borrowers to hold on to their housing stock and postpone default to the second period having incurred small sunk costs.

50|$|Reflecting strong oil export revenues, {{external}} debt is on a downward trajectory. For example, these revenues facilitated <b>early</b> <b>repayments</b> of US$900 million in {{loans from the}} African Development Bank and Saudi Arabia. In March 2006, Algeria’s purchase of 78 aircraft from Russia led to the cancellation of Algeria’s entire debt to Russia. In 2006 {{external debt}} was estimated at US$4.4 billion, down from US$23.5 billion in 2003. In 2006 foreign direct investment (FDI) in Algeria totaled US$1.8 billion. The petrochemical, transport, and utilities sectors have been recent beneficiaries of FDI. FDI into the oil sector was expected to rise {{as a result of}} a hydrocarbons law, approved in April 2005, that created a more even playing field for foreign oil companies to compete with Algeria’s state-owned oil company, Sonatrach, for exploration and production contracts. Algeria also is seeking foreign investment in power and water systems.|$|R

Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2–3 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as <b>early</b> loan <b>repayments</b> due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.|$|R

50|$|Deferred {{financing}} costs or debt issuance costs is an accounting concept meaning {{costs associated with}} issuing debt (loans and bonds), such as various fees and commissions paid to investment banks, law firms, auditors, regulators, and so on. Since these payments do not generate future benefits, they are treated as a contra debt account. The costs are capitalized, reflected in the balance sheet as a contra long-term liability, and amortized using the imputed interest method or over the finite life of the underlying debt instrument, if below de minimus. The unamortized amounts {{are included in the}} long-term debt, as a reduction of the total debt (hence contra debt) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. <b>Early</b> debt <b>repayment</b> results in expensing these costs.|$|R

Using hand-collected data on business microcredits from a Microfinance Institution (MFI), we provide an indirect measure of entrepreneurial success through loan repayment performance. Controlling for the endogeneity of entrepreneurial motivation in a bivariate probit model, we find that "necessity entrepreneurs" {{are more likely to}} have difficulty repaying their microcredits than "opportunity entrepreneurs". However, type of motivation does not appear to make a difference to business survival. We build a stylized model to develop formal arguments supporting this outcome. We test for the robustness of our results using parametric duration models, and show that necessity entrepreneurs experience difficulties in loan <b>repayment</b> <b>earlier</b> than their opportunity counterparts, corroborating our initial findings...|$|R

This dissertation examines the trade-off between the additional benefit {{of waiting for}} better information and the additional cost of delaying a decision. The chapters below focus on government policies designed to address this trade-off and show when better social outcomes can be achieved if early decisions-even those based on scarce and unre- liable information-are allowed. Chapter 1 shows that conditioning banker bonuses on <b>early</b> loan <b>repayment</b> forecasts can {{reduce the amount of}} risk taken by a bank only if bonuses can be "clawed" back in the event of the loan's default. Chapter 2 shows that allowing a court to intervene early in the legislative process can result in more consti- tutional laws than forcing the court to rule in just judicial review proceedings. And in Chapter 3, the IRS's advance pricing agreement (APA) program is studied. The APA program can reduce a multinational's tax uncertainty by allowing the firm and IRS to agree on future tax payments. Emphasis is placed in this dissertation on how these government policies affect the public's incentives and when these policies are socially beneficial...|$|R
50|$|<b>Early</b> <b>repayment</b> charge, {{redemption}} penalty or tie-in - The lender may incur {{many forms}} of up-front costs (for example property valuation costs, if not charged explicitly; or by offering a lower interest rate {{in the first few}} years of the mortgage; or - not least - remuneration of intermediaries or sales teams). It would seek to recoup these costs by charging higher interest rates over the remainder of the mortgage term. Therefore, they typically impose a penalty if the borrower repays the loan earlier than planned in order to ensure that at least some of these costs are recouped. These penalties used to be called a redemption penalty or tie-in, however since the onset of Financial Services Authority regulation they are referred to as an <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> charge.|$|E

40|$|Financiers {{across the}} world {{structure}} debt contracts to limit the risk of entrepreneurial lending. But debt structures that reduce risk may inhibit enterprise growth, especially among the poor. Using a field experiment we quantify the short- and long-run tradeoffs associated with the classic microfinance debt contract. We contrast the classic contract which requires that repayment begins immediately after loan disbursement with a contract that provides a two-month grace period before repayment begins. The shift to a grace period contract increased short-run business investments and long-run profits, implying average return to capital of over 8 % per month. However, we also observe {{a significant increase in}} the variance of profits and a tripling of default rates. In this manner, <b>early</b> initiation of <b>repayment</b> reduces risk to financiers but also reduces the potential impact of microfinance on microenterprise growth and household poverty...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the current Western financial sanctions on the Russian economy. Modeling the capital flow components (accounting for the influence of other factors, including falling oil prices) reveals that sanctions have directly affected sanctioned state-controlled banks, oil, gas and arms companies by severely constraining foreign funding and have indirectly affected non-sanctioned companies by reducing inflows of foreign direct investment and causing funding conditions to deteriorate. The overall negative effect on gross capital inflow over 2014 – 2017 is estimated at approximately $ 280 bn. However, the effect on net capital inflow is significantly lower ($ 160 – 170 bn) due to Russian companies’ self-adjustment, which is evidenced by their utilization of foreign assets accumulated <b>earlier</b> for debt <b>repayment</b> and an overall decrease in gross capital outflow. The sanctions’ estimated effect on GDP is significant (– 2. 4 p. p. by 2017, compared with a hypothetical scenario with no sanctions) but 3. 3 times lower than the estimated effects of the oil price shock...|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the size}} of the loan and the {{prevailing}} practice in the country the term may be short (10 years) or long (50 years plus). In the UK and U.S., 25 to 30 years is the usual maximum term (although shorter periods, such as 15-year mortgage loans, are common). Mortgage payments, which are typically made monthly, contain a repayment of the principal and an interest element. The amount going toward the principal in each payment varies throughout the term of the mortgage. In the <b>early</b> years the <b>repayments</b> are mostly interest. Towards the end of the mortgage, payments are mostly for principal. In this way the payment amount determined at outset is calculated to ensure the loan is repaid at a specified date in the future. This gives borrowers assurance that by maintaining repayment the loan will be cleared at a specified date, if the interest rate does not change. Some lenders and 3rd parties offer a bi-weekly mortgage payment program designed to accelerate the payoff of the loan.|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} confirms {{our findings}} from the Defaulter Survey regarding quantitatively important relationships between repayment problems and borrower income. We also identify an important role for student debt, educational attainment, and beliefs about repayment. The analysis further reveals the importance of intergenerational relationships for repayment. Children whose parents are {{able and willing to}} financially help them out in times of economic stress are much less likely to experience repayment problems. The extended period of loan designation data associated with the 2010 and 2011 CSS samples allows us to examine the persistence of repayment problems. Individuals who had some form of repayment problem at the date of the CSS (<b>early</b> in their <b>repayment</b> period) {{were much more likely to}} be experiencing repayment problems a year or more later than were individuals with no repayment problem as of the CSS. Individuals on IR/RAP were less likely to be experiencing repayment problems 12 and 18 months later than those who were delinquent at CSS; however, both groups had significantly higher serious repayment problems at the later date than did those with no problem at CSS. Our results also suggest that income (at CSS), student loan debt, and educational attainment are important factors affecting default/bankruptcy a year or more after CSS. Interestingly, youth who attended private post-secondary institutions were significantly more likely to experience serious repayment problems 12 and 18 months after CSS...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays. The common theme is Public Economics: to understand the effects of government policies {{in order to improve}} their design and to understand how special interest groups affect the local fiscal policies. ^ In the first chapter, I study the impact of student debt on the education, career, and marriage choices of female lawyers. Law students quite often take on substantial amounts of debt to finance their graduate education. There has been much concern in the legal profession and among policy-makers that this debt burden distorts career choices. The empirical analysis is based on a novel, nationally representative, longitudinal data set. In contrast to the previous literature that has largely focused on males and finds only small effects, these new data suggest that debt has large and significant negative effects on female career and marriage outcomes. To explore the likely causes of these negative debt effects, I develop and estimate a dynamic model of education, labor, and marriage markets. My findings suggest that {{a large part of the}} debt effect on schooling and career choices comes from the diminished marriage prospects associated with the debt burden. I then focus on policies that aim to reduce the debt burden while also encouraging female lawyers to pursue careers in the public sector. My policy experiments show that subsidizing student debt <b>repayment</b> <b>earlier</b> in the career is more effective than doing so later. ^ In the second chapter, I study the impact of unions on municipal elections and urban fiscal policies. The efficient decentralized provision of public goods requires that special interest groups, such as municipal unions, do not exercise undue influence on the outcome of municipal elections and local fiscal policies. I have assembled a unique data set that is based on union endorsements that are published in leading local newspapers. My empirical analysis focuses on municipal elections in the 150 largest cities in the U. S. between 1990 and 2012. I find that challengers strongly benefit from endorsements in competitive elections. Challengers that receive union endorsements and successfully defeat an incumbent also tend to adopt more union friendly fiscal policies. ...|$|R
