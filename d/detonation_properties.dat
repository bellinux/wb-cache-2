For example, gasoline with the same knocking characteristics as a mixture of 90% iso-octane and 10% heptane would have an octane rating of 90. A rating of 90 {{does not mean that the}} gasoline contains just iso-octane and heptane in these proportions but that it has the same <b>detonation</b> resistance <b>properties</b> (generally, gasoline sold for common use never consists solely of iso-octane and heptane; it is a mixture of many hydrocarbons and often other additives). Because some fuels are more knock-resistant than pure iso-octane, the definition has been extended to allow for octane numbers greater than 100.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} study of flame propagation, acceleration, and transition to detonation in kerosene–air mixture in a small-scale pulse detonation engine (SPDE) was performed. An SPDE model with the aero-valve and two different obstacles in detonation tube was designed that the inner diameter and the overall length were 29 and 995 mm, respectively. The model was performed with kerosene as fuel under the condition of filling air by an airblower, and was ignited by a spark plug with low energy. The propagation of the flame and pressure waves was measured by pressure transducers and ion probes. The pairs of transducers and probes were placed at various locations along the tube {{in order to get}} information about the progress of the phenomena and the <b>detonation</b> wave <b>properties</b> were analysed when the SPDE was ignited at different frequency. As a result of the experiments, deflagration-to-detonation transition regimes and detonation parameters of kerosene–air mixture were determined.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks of thermochemical codes for the calculation of <b>detonation</b> <b>properties</b> is the accurate description of the state of gaseous products within a rather wide range of pressures and temperatures – from several hundreds of kbar and several thousands of K to atmospheric pressure and temperature.

The BKW EOS gives good agreement between calculated and experimentally obtained detonation parameters for many standard high explosives having densities in the range 1. 2 – 2 g/cm 3. However, it fails to predict accurately <b>detonation</b> <b>properties</b> at lower densities. To overcome this problem, we introduced the concept of density dependent molecular covolumes in the BKW EOS instead of invariant.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and difficult parts of constructing a multidimensional numerical simulation of flame acceleration and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in a reacting flow is finding a reliable and affordable model of the chemical and diffusive properties. For simulations of realistic scenarios, full detailed chemical models are computationally prohibitive. In addition, they are usually inaccurate for high-temperature and high-pressure shock-laden flows. This paper presents a general approach for developing an automated procedure to determine the reaction parameters for a simplified chemical-diffusive model to simulate flame acceleration and DDT in stoichiometric methane-air and ethylene-oxygen mixtures. The procedure uses a combination of a genetic algorithm and Nelder-Mead optimization scheme to find the optimal reaction parameters for a reaction rate based on an Arrhenius form for conversion of reactants to products. The model finds six optimal reaction parameters that reproduce six target flame and <b>detonation</b> <b>properties.</b> Results from the optimization procedure show that the optimal reaction parameters, when used in 1 -D reactive Navier-Stokes simulations, closely reproduce the target flame and <b>detonation</b> <b>properties</b> for the stoichiometric methane-air and ethylene-oxygen mixtures. When the reaction parameters are used as input in a 2 -D simulation of flame acceleration and DDT in an obstacle-laden channel containing stoichiometric methane-air, the simulation results closely follow the transition to detonation observed in experiments. This automated procedure for finding parameters for a proposed reaction model makes it possible to simulate the behavior of flames and detonations in large, complex scenarios, which would otherwise be an incalculable problem.
