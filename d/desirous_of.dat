5|$|The Louisiana Purchase {{doubled the}} size of the United States, and today forms much of the center of the country. <b>Desirous</b> <b>of</b> honoring the centennial of the purchase, Congress passed authorizing {{legislation}} for an exposition; the bill was signed by President William McKinley on March 3, 1901. McKinley was assassinated in September of that year.|$|E
5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am <b>desirous</b> <b>of</b> seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but <b>desirous</b> <b>of</b> unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

5|$|At {{least as}} far back as the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were {{established}} as a technologically sophisticated and prosperous people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the Mascarene Islands. To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (tamboho) of the type also prevalent in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major trading partner of the Betsimisaraka, to whom they traded rice and zebu. The Betsimisaraka, <b>desirous</b> <b>of</b> greater access to Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled through a combination of firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the Sakalava to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted {{in their use of}} the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected {{in the evolution of the}} palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or <b>desirous</b> <b>of</b> change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E

5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the <b>desirous</b> aspects <b>of</b> morality.|$|R

25|$|Initially {{the crash}} was {{attributed}} to pilot error and/or technical failure, with no direct evidence for either cause. As the accident happened at night, the pilot might have misjudged his altitude relative to the sea.

25|$|According to {{an article}} in the Jewish Encyclopedia, great as was the success of Barnabas and Paul in the heathen world, the {{authorities}} in Jerusalem insisted upon circumcision as the condition of admission of members into the church, until, on the initiative of Peter, and of James, the head of the Jerusalem church, it was agreed that acceptance of the Noachian Laws ‚Äî namely, regarding avoidance of idolatry, fornication, and the eating of flesh cut from a living animal ‚Äî should be demanded of the heathen <b>desirous</b> <b>of</b> entering the Church.|$|E
25|$|Ceres was an East Indiaman {{launched}} in 1787. She made three trips to China for the British East India Company (EIC). After {{the outbreak of}} war with France in 1793, the Admiralty, <b>desirous</b> <b>of</b> quickly building up the Royal Navy, purchased a number of commercial vessels, including nine East Indiamen, to meet the need for small two-decker fourth rates to serve as convoy escorts. The Admiralty purchased Ceres in 1795 and renamed her HMS Grampus. In 1797 the Admiralty converted her to a storeship. That year her crew participated in the Spithead and Nore mutinies. Grampus grounded in January 1799 and was destroyed.|$|E

The captain was <b>desirous,</b> however, <b>of</b> purchasing a number of hogs, but there were none to be had--The trade in pork was a royal monopoly, and no subject of the great Tamaahmaah dared to meddle with it. Such provisions as they could furnish, however, were brought by the natives in abundance, and a lively intercourse was kept up during the day, in which the women mingled in the kindest manner.|$|R
60|$|I suppose no {{one will}} be {{disposed}} to dispute the proposition, that the prime duty of every member of such a Board is to endeavour to administer the Act honestly; or in accordance, not only with its letter, but with its spirit.

So that it is really not admissible, except for factious and abusive purposes, to assume that any one who endeavours to get at this clear meaning is <b>desirous</b> only <b>of</b> raising quibbles and making difficulties.|$|R
