For the carbon black material itself the 129 Xe chemical shift of xenon adsorbed at the surface of carbon black aggregates yields information about the relative average pore size of the carbon black aggregates. The experimental 129 Xe-NMR results of carbon black filled ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) can be explained when {{it is assumed that}} the xenon atoms in the bound EPDM <b>fraction</b> <b>exchange</b> rapidly on the NMR time scale between a state where they are adsorbed on the carbon black surface and a state in which they are absorbed in the EPDM layer.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the tertiary structure of cytochrome c and of a methionine- 80 chemically modified form of this protein has been investigated by monitoring on-line the exchange of amide protons with deuterons using infrared spectroscopy. The modified protein has a structural stabilization energy of approximately 50 % of that of native cytochrome c, whereas the secondary structure is not affected by the modification. In the modified protein the <b>fraction</b> of slow <b>exchanging</b> amides is smaller compared {{to that in the}} native protein, and the exchange rate constants are found to be 2 - 3 times larger for the slow (half-life of 5. 5 h) and intermediate (half-life of 4. 1 min) <b>exchanging</b> <b>fraction</b> of amides. The exchange rate of a fast <b>exchanging</b> <b>fraction</b> of amides (half-life smaller than 1 min), most likely surface exposed amides, is not influenced by tertiary destabilization of the protein. The results in aqueous solution agree well with data obtained by monitoring the amide-proton exchange using 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance. In films, using attenuated total reflection infrared techniques, this difference in tertiary stability between modified and native cytochrome c could also be demonstrated.

Confluent flasks of a normal primary fibroblast cell line (AG 1522) were irradiated at high dose rates with either gamma rays or 200 MeV/nucleon Fe ions (LET = 440 keV/micron), incubated at 37 C for 24 hours after exposure, and subsequently subcultured.

40|$|Variable {{effects were}} noted on the argon (Ar) and {{potassium}} (K) contents of clinoptilolite fractions used in ion-exchange and dehydration experiments. The K contents of clinoptilolite fractions were differently affected during cation exchange with Ca-, Cs-, K-, and Na-chloride solutions. Ar was generally less affected during these experiments, {{except for a}} Na-clinoptitolite <b>fraction</b> <b>exchanged</b> for five days. Loss of Ar during organic heavy-liquid treatment and cleaning using acetone and deionized water does occur, as indicated by comparing the amounts of radiogenic Ar of treated and untreated fractions. Moreover, a regular decrease in radiogenic Ar contents was noted in clinoptilolite fractions during dehydration experiments at different temperatures for 16 hours. Comparable losses do not occur from saturated samples that were heated in 100 C {{for more than five}} months. Water appears to {{play a vital role in}} stabilizing the clinoptilolite framework structure and in the retention of Ar. The radiogenic Ar depletion pattern noted in clinoptilolite fractions dehydrated in unsaturated environment at different temperatures is similar to variations in the amount of radiogenic Ar observed in clinoptilolite samples from the unsaturated zone of an altered tuff. These results can be used to evaluate the extent of zeolitic water (and hence Ar) retention in unsaturated geologic settings. The utility of alkali zeolites (e. g., phillipsite, clinoptilolite, and mordenite) from low-temperature, open-hydrologic alteration as potential dateable minerals was evaluated using the K/Ar method as part of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project, which is evaluating Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a potential high-level radioactive waste repository site...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 To {{develop an}} assay to detect {{antibodies}} to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis in mallard ducks, a growth curve was first {{established for the}} bacterium. The growth curve indicated that the crystal delta endotoxin would be best harvested {{from the rest of}} the cell material after 12 hours of growth. The delta endotoxin was solubilized in alkaline conditions followed by treatment with proteases or no treatment. The two differently treated delta endotoxins were purified by column chromatography. Fractions were assayed for duck erythrocyte lysis and cytotoxicity to a mosquito cell line. The proteolyzed sample gave four protein peaks with gel filtration, and the fourth peak containing biological activity was further separated into three protein <b>fractions</b> by anion <b>exchange</b> chromatography; two of the three showed biological activity. These two fractions contained 22 and 23 kD proteins species. The nonproteolyzed sample was separated into two protein fractions by gel filtration; only the first peak contained the biological activity. This fraction was further separated into two <b>fractions</b> by anion <b>exchange</b> chromatography; only the second fraction, containing a 28 kD protein, exhibited the activity. This fraction contained a 28 kD protein. However, the fractions containing 22 or 23 kD proteins originating from the proteolyzed sample showed the highest biological activity. Mallard ducks were repeatedly exposed to an aerosolized commercial preparation of the organism.
