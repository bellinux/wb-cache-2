It is {{virtually}} impossible to regrind the tip of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch and properly shape the center projection.When using a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch, make sure the axis of the shank of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch is in line with the axis of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Do not cant the <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch off to one side. When you strike the <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch, hit it directly on the top of its head. If you strike the head of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch at an angle you may bend the shank.|$|R
50|$|Spring punches, {{also called}} <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches, {{are used to}} drive <b>roll</b> <b>pins.</b> Standard pin punches should never be used on a <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Because of the hollow, thin wall {{construction}} of a <b>roll</b> <b>pin,</b> a standard pin punch will often collapse, mar or distort {{the end of the}} pin or be driven into, and jammed inside, the hollow core of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> When choosing a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch, select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin. If this occurs, {{it may be possible to}} drive the punch through the hollow center of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches are {{designed}} with a small projection {{in the center of}} the pin tip to support the circumference of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> The tips of <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches are not flat and should never be used on regular solid <b>pins.</b> If a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch is used on a solid pin, it will mar or mark the pin.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>pins</b> come in {{a variety}} of sizes, shapes and {{materials}} including glass, ceramic, acrylic, bakelite, copper, brass, aluminium, silicone, wood, stainless steel, marble, and plastic. Some are hollow and are able to be filled with cold or warm water to better roll a desired food.

50|$|A {{rolling pin}} is a {{cylindrical}} food preparation utensil used to shape and flatten dough. Two styles of rolling pin are found: rollers and rods.

50|$|The {{slide of}} the P220 series is a {{heavy-gauge}} {{sheet metal stamping}} with a welded-on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion is a machined insert attached to the slide {{by means of a}} <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> visible from either side. The frame is of forged alloy with a hard-anodized coating. The SIG P220 series incorporates a hammer-drop lever {{to the rear of the}} trigger on the left side, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H before World War I. After chambering a round, the hammer will be cocked, so for safe carriage the hammer drop is actuated with the thumb, dropping the hammer in a safe manner.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine gun}} is {{fitted with a}} folding bipod (attached {{to the end of}} the gas cylinder) that can be {{adjusted}} for height. For carrying or use as a forearm, the aluminum legs can be folded back and secured in slots under the receiver by hooks and a spring-loaded catch. When firing from the hip, the bipod legs remain extended and the left leg is gripped for support. The bipod can be removed from the gas cylinder by tapping-out a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> in the gas cylinder head until it is flush and the bipod can be rotated enough to clear the gas cylinder's retaining lugs.|$|R

In the next few weeks, he made multiple appearances at the Greensboro Coliseum against The Missouri Mauler, Rudy Kay and Tiny Mills. In late-1967, Linden entered the promotion's tag team division. On December 9, 1967, Linden teamed with Rick Hunter against Tiny Mills and Steve Stanlee in a best two-out-of-three falls match in Lexington, North Carolina. Hunter won the first fall with a victory <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> but their opponents ended up scoring the other two.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension <b>pin</b> or <b>roll</b> <b>pin)</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. Spring pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
5000|$|The {{slide of}} the pre-1996 P226 {{was a heavy}} gauge, mill {{finished}} sheet metal stamping with a welded on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion was a machined insert attached to the slide by means of brazing and a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> visible from either side. Since 1996, production has shifted to CNC machining and the slide is now milled from {{a single piece of}} stainless steel. Therefore, the current standard P226 has a Nitron coated, stainless steel slide. This resulted in a stronger slide, which was necessary to chamber the more powerful [...]40 S&W and [...]357 SIG cartridges. The frame of most models is made from hard anodized aluminum alloy.|$|R
50|$|Montgomery devised {{different}} control {{methods for}} his gliders, including weight shifting <b>for</b> <b>roll</b> and an elevator for pitch (1884). Subsequent designs used hinged, pilot-operated trailing edge flaps {{on the wings}} (1885-1886) <b>for</b> <b>roll</b> control, and later, full wing warping systems <b>for</b> <b>roll</b> (1903-1905) and <b>for</b> both pitch and roll (1911).|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow <b>roll</b> <b>pins,</b> one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer milled slides are a one-piece unit and do not have a removable breech block.|$|R
