5|$|At age seventy-seven, Barbree {{is one of}} the longest-serving network correspondents to work {{continuously}} on {{a single}} subject. He started working for NBC on July 21, 1958 covering the space program, and continues in that capacity to the present. He has never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did not miss any launches.|$|E
5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> several months by the date stated.|$|E

5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{begins a}} few moments after Dracula ends. Count Dracula has just been {{destroyed}} by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to Scotland Yard, where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because {{he had already been}} <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.|$|E
5|$|His loss {{of faith}} in human {{relationships}} is mirrored in his loss {{of faith in}} God. During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{was also}} {{closely linked to}} ravens because in Norse myths he {{received}} the fallen warriors at Valhalla, and ravens were linked with death and war due to their predilection for carrion. It is consequently likely that they were regarded as manifestations of the Valkyries, goddesses who chose the valiant <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> military service in Valhalla.|$|E

5|$|Shannyn Sossamon portrays Coraline Duvall, St. John's {{ex-wife and}} {{original}} sire. A courtesan in early 18th century France, she is approximately 340 years old. After turning Mick into a vampire, the couple became estranged and Coraline was presumed <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> {{more than twenty}} years. When she returns under the pseudonym Morgan, she appears to be completely human and claims to have a cure for vampirism, which Mick becomes desperate to obtain.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|At the Santa Monica Pier, a magician, The Amazing Maleeni, twists {{his head}} {{completely}} around at a carnival, while Billy LaBonge, another magician, heckles Maleeni during the event. As he's leaving, his severed head falls completely off. Billy LaBonge is later questioned by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson); {{he tells the}} agents that he thought Maleeni was a ripoff. During the autopsy, Scully finds that, although Maleeni's head was cleanly cut off, {{he died of a}} heart attack. She also finds that he was <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> at least a month and refrigerated, even though the carnival manager spoke to him mere moments leading up to his head falling off.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did not arrive {{until the middle of}} February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> survival.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Ethan Winters, a civilian, {{is drawn}} to a {{derelict}} plantation in Dulvey, Louisiana, by a message from his wife, Mia, who has been presumed <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> the past three years. While exploring a seemingly abandoned house, Ethan finds Mia imprisoned in the basement. During their escape, Mia suddenly becomes extremely violent and attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her. After receiving {{a call from a}} woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is attacked by a revived Mia, who cuts his left hand off. Jack Baker, the patriarch of the Baker family, captures Ethan; he is dragged to another house and Zoe staples his hand back on. Ethan is held captive by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son Lucas, and a catatonic, wheelchair-bound elderly woman. After escaping his restraints, he is repeatedly attacked by Jack, who is infected with powerful regenerative abilities.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow, Sam {{and their}} party {{return to the}} Wall after finding two frozen corpses. Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined. Sam points {{out that there is}} no sign of decay on their corpses, even though they have {{apparently}} been <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> weeks. Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns him to keep his commitment to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is held back by his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.|$|E

5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added to}} the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man <b>dead).</b> <b>For</b> {{the last quarter of the}} movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
5|$|The casino {{legislation}} was not called {{to a vote}} in the Democratic controlled Kentucky House of Representatives, where 60 votes out of 100 would have been required for passage. Beshear announced that his proposal for a constitutional amendment to allow for casinos was <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, an associate of the Millennium Group—a secret society which believes the apocalypse will happen on the new year of 2000—resurrects the <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> use in bringing about the apocalypse. As a result, Mulder and Scully {{have to ask the}} help of criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a man who has former experience with the shadowy group, for assistance.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare the}} <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> the afterlife, the mummies were {{surrounded}} with ceramic pots containing food, tunjos and cotton bags and mantles. The guecha warriors were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton. When the caciques and zaque and zipa died, their mummified bodies {{were placed in}} mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their many wives, by slaves and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in Gámeza, Boyacá, had a teether around the neck. Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, {{as was the case}} with a young girl described by Liborio Zerda.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
