In addition, the new aircraft <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the General Electric TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the Allison J35.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which {{made it difficult for}} him to communicate, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E

5|$|At age fourteen, Pascu's voice changed. He {{was still}} a soprano in the choir, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his head voice. As a high school student, Pascu had to enlist in the Union of Communist Youth (UTC), the Romanian {{communist}} regime compulsory youth organization. In 1976, he enrolled at the Agnita High School, which later became the Agro-Industrial High School. The same year, he gave up handball and began a more formal study of guitar music, using the Maria Boeru textbook as his guide. He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5|$|Historically, people repored that Fragile Allegiance did {{not work}} {{properly}} on Windows XP and later Windows platforms, as the game was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing when trying to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox {{in order to get}} the game to function properly but it may still crash when trying to rename a saved game.|$|E

5|$|On 10 August 1919, one of {{the largest}} engagements of the {{intervention}} occurred, taking place at Seltso and the surrounding villages along the Dvina. In a confused battle through the marshy swamps Sadlier-Jackson's brigade battled a large Bolshevik force, with the Fusiliers—including the two Australian companies of the 45th Battalion—fighting their way through with their bayonets and re-occupying Seltso. Perhaps as many as 1,000 prisoners were taken and 19 field guns captured. Due to the terrain the Fusiliers had been unable to manoeuvre their mountain guns through the swamp, whilst Sadlier-Jackson <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an observation balloon for situational awareness. During this battle an Australian, Corporal Arthur Sullivan, won the Victoria Cross (VC) for saving a group of drowning men while under fire.|$|E
5|$|Prospect Mountain {{originally}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an incline railway car {{to access}} {{the house at the}} top where people could dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby hiking trail that heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway.|$|E
5|$|The German Generals, in {{particular}} Guderian, were relieved that the Luftwaffe had prevented the Allied bombers from knocking out their supply bridges. By nightfall, at least 600 tanks, {{including those of}} the 2nd Panzer Division which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the 1st Panzer Division's bridge at Gaulier (owing to theirs not having yet been constructed), were across the Meuse. The German victory in the air battle had been decisive.|$|E

5|$|The Route 21 freeway {{was planned}} to extend north to Interstate 80 in Elmwood Park at the {{interchange}} with County Route 507, crossing over the Passaic River. However, this extension was opposed by residents {{who lived on}} the east side of the Passaic River, and for a quarter-century, traffic headed for Paterson <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> local streets in Passaic. In the 1980s, plans were resurrected for completing the Route 21 freeway along the west bank of the Passaic River to U.S. Route 46 in Clifton. Official plans were made in 1996, and in late 1997, construction began on this portion of the freeway. It opened on December 20, 2000 at a cost of $136 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism in the {{occupied}} Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the flag, and schoolchildren sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some {{areas such as the}} Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The group {{started work}} on the album in 1972, trying to follow up Tommy and Who's Next, which had both {{achieved}} substantial critical and commercial success. Recording was delayed while bassist John Entwistle and singer Roger Daltrey recorded solo albums and drummer Keith Moon worked on films. Because a new studio was not finished in time, the group <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio. As well as the group's typical playing styles, especially from Moon, the album makes significant use of Townshend's multi-tracked synthesizers and sound effects, and Entwistle's layered horn parts. Relationships between the group and manager Kit Lambert broke down irretrievably during recording and {{he had left the}} band's services by the time the album was released.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. The riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. The riders in the machines poinçonnées category <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
5|$|Until 1914, {{artillery}} generally fired over open sights at visible targets, {{the largest}} unit accustomed to firing {{at a single}} target was the artillery regiment or brigade. One innovation {{brought about by the}} adoption of trench warfare was the barrage—a term first used in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915. Trench warfare had created the need for indirect fire, with the use of observers, more sophisticated artillery fire plans, and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery, where artillerymen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern; {{in the case of a}} barrage, the pattern was a line.|$|E
5|$|Yip {{was born}} with muscular dystrophy, a genetic {{disorder}} that slowly breaks down the muscles, and a nerve condition that affects eyesight. When she was five, she started swimming to improve her health and strengthen her muscles; nevertheless, {{by the age of}} eleven, she had lost her ability to walk and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a wheelchair. The youngest of three children in her family, she studied in Ai Tong Primary School and Bendemeer Secondary School, then graduated from Republic Polytechnic as back-up valedictorian and, as of 2012, is studying social science at Singapore Management University.|$|E
50|$|However, stances {{are limited}} in that only {{particular}} stances may be used with a certain equipment type, e.g., a fighter wanting <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Roof Guard stance would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a Great Sword, rather than a sword and shield. A musketeer wanting <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Flintlock stance would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a Rifle, rather than a pistol. A stance is usable only when it is learned; unlearned stances are greyed-out and unavailable for use.|$|R

5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} game's {{development}} was finished, Mikami told Takumi {{that they should}} make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided {{making a lot of}} changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All.|$|E
