5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, {{it might be}} observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore.

5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} <b>found</b> <b>not</b> guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were <b>found</b> <b>not</b> guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
