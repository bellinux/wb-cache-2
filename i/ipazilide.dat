40|$|<b>Ipazilide</b> fumarate (Win 54, 177 - 4) is a {{chemically}} novel an-tiarrhythmic {{agent that}} prolongs ventricular refractoriness and possesses antiectopic activity. Subchronic (29 days) nonclinical safety evaluation of <b>ipazilide</b> was conducted following oral and iv administration in Sprague-Dawley rats (20 - 320 mg/kg oral and 1. 25 - 10 mg/kg iv) and 14 and 28 days in beagle dogs (3 - 30 mg/kg oral and 2. 5 - 20 mg/kg iv). The pharmacokinetic pa-rameters of <b>ipazilide</b> indicate that <b>ipazilide</b> is absorbed (tmxs. Â«s 1 hr) in fasted rats and dogs following single and repeated oral administrations. The apparent elimination half-life {{in the two}} species is approximately 1 hr (except in rats at a dosage of 320 mg/kg), suggesting rapid clearance. Increases in liver weights (rats 320 mg/kg) accompanied by the observation of centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes were considered an expression of an adaptive metabolic response of the liver to <b>ipazilide</b> and may b...|$|E
