25|$|The {{cause of}} the GnRH rise is unknown. Leptin might be the {{cause of the}} GnRH rise. Leptin has receptors in the {{hypothalamus}} which synthesizes GnRH. Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate puberty. The levels of leptin increase with the onset of puberty, and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed. The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics. A study discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both Neurokinin B as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty. The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of Kisspeptin, a compound responsible for triggering <b>direct</b> <b>release</b> of GnRH as well as indirect release of LH and FSH.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of New Super Mario Bros., {{consumers}} and publishers have shown renewed interest in 2D platformers, which can be attributed both to handheld consoles such as the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, and low-risk downloadable services offered by WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam. These range from classic revivals such as , Contra ReBirth, and , to original titles like Splosion Man and Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure. , released in 2008, was a platformer that featured completely two-dimensional graphics and a rich visual style. Subsequent games such as Braid, A Boy and His Blob, and The Behemoth's BattleBlock Theater also use completely 2D graphics. New Super Mario Bros.

The success of New Super Mario Bros.

50|$|Despite {{attention}} from the FDA and regulatory agencies of the European Union, procedures for monitoring drug concentrations and adverse effects in the environment are lacking.

A concept combining pharmacovigilance and environmental pharmacology, intended {{to focus attention on}} this area, was introduced first as ecopharmacology and later as ecopharmacovigilance (EPV) by Velo et al., with further concurrent and later terms for the same concept (pharmacoenvironmentology, environmental pharmacology, ecopharmacostewardship).|$|E
50|$|Selenium can {{be removed}} from the {{ecosystem}} and bound in sediment through natural processes of chemical and microbial reduction of the selenate form to the selenite form. The reduction is followed by adsorption to clay, reaction with iron species, and coprecipitation or settling. After selenium is in the sediment, other chemical and microbial reduction may occur, causing insoluble organic, mineral, elemental, or adsorbed selenium. Some organic forms may be released into the atmosphere from volatilization by chemical or microbial activity in the water and sediment or by <b>direct</b> <b>release</b> from plants. Immobilization processes effectively remove selenium from the ecosystem, especially in slow-moving or still-water areas.|$|E

5000|$|Aerosol delivery: There are two {{proposals}} {{for how to}} create a stratospheric sulfate aerosol cloud, either through release of a precursor gas (...) or the <b>direct</b> <b>release</b> of sulfuric acid (...) and these face different challenges. If [...] gas is released it will oxidise to form [...] and then condense to form droplets far from the injection site. Releasing [...] would not allow control over the size of the particles that are formed but would not require a sophisticated release mechanism. Simulations suggest that as the [...] release rate is increased there would be diminishing returns on the cooling effect, as larger particles would be formed which have a shorter lifetime and are less effective scatterers of light. If [...] is released directly then the aerosol particles would form very quickly and in principle the particle size could be controlled although the engineering requirements for this are uncertain. As direct [...] release would allow control over the particle size it could be possible to avoid some of the inefficiencies associated with [...] release.|$|E

5000|$|Helium-3 {{occurs as}} a {{primordial}} nuclide, escaping from the Earth's crust {{into the atmosphere}} and into outer space over millions of years. Helium-3 is also {{thought to be a}} natural nucleogenic and cosmogenic nuclide, one produced when lithium is bombarded by natural neutrons, which can be released by spontaneous fission and by nuclear reactions with cosmic rays. Some of the helium-3 found in the terrestrial atmosphere is also a relic of atmospheric and underwater nuclear weapons testing. Most of this comes from the decay of tritium (hydrogen-3), which decays into helium-3 with a half life of 12.3 years. Furthermore, some nuclear reactors (landbound or shipbound) periodically release some helium-3 and tritium into the atmosphere. The nuclear reactor disaster at Chernobyl released a huge amount of radioactive tritium into the atmosphere, and smaller accidents have caused smaller releases. Furthermore, significant amounts of tritium and helium-3 have been deliberately produced in national arsenal nuclear reactors by the irradiation of lithium-6. The tritium is used to [...] "boost" [...] nuclear weapons, and some of this inevitably escapes during its production, transportation, and storage. Hence, helium-3 enters the atmosphere both through its <b>direct</b> <b>release</b> and through the radioactive decay of tritium.|$|E
