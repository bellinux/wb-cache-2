5|$|The T19 Howitzer Gun Motor Carriage {{was similar}} to the M3 Half-track, as it shared the same chassis, <b>engine,</b> <b>{{suspension}},</b> armor, and fuel tank. It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical volute springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was capable of a maximum road speed of 45mph. The power-to-weight ratio was 14.7hp/ton.|$|E

500|$|The {{prototype}} of the Light Tank Mk VII (A17), nicknamed 'Purdah', was first developed in 1937 by Vickers-Armstrongs as a private venture, and [...] {{was intended to be}} sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries. It was [...] to be {{the latest in a series}} of light tanks produced by the company. The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns. Vickers-Armstrong installed on the Mk VIIs a 2-pounder [...] main gun paired with a [...] Besa machine gun, and mounted the two guns in a two-man turret. The tank possessed a maximum of [...] of armour. The prototype weighed approximately [...] and was powered by a [...] Meadows <b>engine.</b> <b>Suspension</b> was on eight road wheels, four per side, with no separate driver or idler wheels and it was capable of a [...] top speed. The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system [...] incorporated into earlier Vickers models. The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks. For sharper turns, the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage. The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping, and each of the wheels was independently sprung.|$|E
