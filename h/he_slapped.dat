5|$|Warner Bros. {{was quick}} to team its two rising gangster stars—Edward G. Robinson and Cagney—for the 1931 film Smart Money. So keen was the studio to follow up the success of Robinson's Little Caesar that Cagney {{actually}} shot Smart Money (for which he received second billing in a supporting role) {{at the same time}} as The Public Enemy. As in The Public Enemy, Cagney was required to be physically violent to a woman on screen, a signal that Warner Bros. was keen to keep Cagney in the public eye. This time, <b>he</b> <b>slapped</b> co-star Evalyn Knapp.|$|E
5|$|Patton led U.S. {{troops into}} the Mediterranean theater with an {{invasion}} of Casablanca during Operation Torch in 1942, where he later established himself as an effective commander through his rapid rehabilitation of the demoralized U.S. II Corps. He commanded the U.S. Seventh Army during the Allied invasion of Sicily, {{where he was the}} first Allied commander to reach Messina. There he was embroiled in controversy after <b>he</b> <b>slapped</b> two shell-shocked soldiers under his command, and was temporarily removed from battlefield command for other duties such as participating in Operation Fortitude's disinformation campaign for Operation Overlord. Patton returned to command the Third Army following the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, where he led a highly successful rapid armored drive across France. He led the relief of beleaguered American troops at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and advanced his Third Army into Nazi Germany {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Modi {{refused to}} allow the IAS officer Mahendra Surana watch a match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, because he {{believed}} Suarana to be an associate of the Rungta faction of RCA. When Surana and his friend Hemendra Suarana (an army doctor and a former Ranji player) arrived at the Stadium, Modi tore their tickets. He repeated this act with the IPS officer R.P. Srivastava. During a cricket match, <b>he</b> <b>slapped</b> a constable for walking into his box at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, leading to protests by the city's constabulary.|$|E
500|$|They began dating, with Lennon now {{referring}} to her as [...] "Cyn". In the autumn of 1958, she ended her engagement to be with him, and he ended his relationship with another art student, Thelma Pickles. [...] His jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her, as when <b>he</b> <b>slapped</b> her across the face (causing her head to hit a wall), after watching her dance with Stuart Sutcliffe. After the incident, she broke up with Lennon for three months, but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology. Another time a cleaning woman at the college caught Lennon hitting her and suggested she stay away from him.|$|E
500|$|The Third Infantry Division {{was moved}} in to replace the forty-fifth, which was now ticketed for the {{upcoming}} invasion of the Italian mainland. In recalling events on Sicily in his biography, Middleton noted a strain in his relationship with General Patton. Patton, never comfortable as the brunt of someone else's humor, felt that the Mauldin cartoons published in the division newspaper were irreverent and unsoldierly. Middleton consistently defended Mauldin, but was verbally ordered by Patton {{to get rid of}} Mauldin and his cartoons. When Middleton told Patton to put the order in writing, the issue was dropped. [...] Soon thereafter, Patton had much more to worry about after <b>he</b> <b>slapped</b> two soldiers who he suspected of malingering in hospitals. These incidents brought General Patton public condemnation, and loss of his command.|$|E

500|$|Clouzot {{was very}} {{demanding}} with his actors and would often quarrel {{with them to}} get them in the mood he desired. Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, [...] "So what? <b>He</b> <b>slapped</b> others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain". Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped. Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an [...] "innocence about him" [...] that was not seen.|$|E
500|$|The {{engagement}} of Gopal and Latha is fixed {{and while the}} reception is being held, a young woman arrives, claiming to be Chitra, accompanied by her uncle Rangan. Gopal says the woman is an impostor, but she and her uncle produce evidence which convinces even Gopal's police officer friend Kumar. Gopal's engagement with Latha is cancelled. Chitra and Rangan become disruptive and Gopal gets frustrated, fearing that Latha might leave him because his [...] "wife" [...] has turned up. Several days later, Gopal reveals the truth to everyone. In a flashback, when Chitra was ready to leave Gopal, <b>he</b> <b>slapped</b> her. Chitra, suffering from a heart condition, is unable to take the insult of his slap and dies from the shock. Gopal realises that he had inadvertently killed his wife. To avoid arrest, and safeguard the honour of his family, he manipulates the murder to appear like a suicide on a railway track and fabricates the necessary {{evidence to show that}} Chitra committed suicide. Thus, Gopal escapes from the charges of murder. Not wishing to continue living in Singapore, he leaves by a ship to India.|$|E

Backlund [...] "snapped" [...] after Hart repeatedly tried to offer a sportsmanlike handshake following the match. <b>He</b> <b>slapped</b> Hart {{in the face and}} locked him in the crossface chickenwing submission hold, while screaming hysterically. After finally releasing the hold, Backlund stared at his hands in apparent shock. Backlund then started to regularly [...] "snap" [...] in similar fashion during his matches, viciously attacking his opponent with the crossface chickenwing and refusing to release it after the opponent submitted.
