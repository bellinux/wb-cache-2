40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{literature}} regarding sustainability and <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> frameworks.

Following this, we look at understanding stakeholders and their importance in sustainability and conclude with some observations about sustainability frameworks, and the motivations of companies for increased disclosure with their stakeholders. These motivations focus on the long-run corporate benefits including improved financial performance of the firm, increased competitive advantage, profit maximisation, and the long-term success of the firm...|$|E
40|$|Internationally, {{there is}} growing {{awareness}} of the environmental and social impacts of the business activities of organizations. This awareness was heightened by the 1987 report Our Common Future by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987). In order to address the concerns raised, companies have increasingly reported the social and environmental impacts of their business activities to secure their right to operate from society. This paper argues for the importance of an integrated reporting framework that provides information on economic performance via intellectual capital (IC) information and non-economic performance, including that used in the management of performance across social and environmental impacts. This paper briefly reviews three <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> approaches, namely IC, balanced scorecard (BSC) and social and environmental reporting. The paper demonstrates that the emphases of these reporting approaches, while diverse, could be complementary to one another and be integrated into an extended performance reporting framework (EPRF), which would provide a more complete account of the management and performance of an organization. The EPRF could empower stakeholders and facilitate change in the way organizations conduct their activities. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Multicast {{applications}} and network monitors can potentially {{benefit from the}} ability to infer the loss rates along links within a multicast tree. Estimators, known generically by minc, or multicast inference of network characteristics, {{have been developed to}} provide this ability. They consider multicast data packets to be probes, and conduct inference based upon reports of which probes reached each receiver. In practice, gathering reports from receivers in real time is a non-trivial task that presents scaling problems as the number of receivers increases. Prior work has led to an extension of the RTP data transport protocol to permit receivers to report per-probe information in packets known as RTCP XR packets. This paper demonstrates how minc inference can, in fact, be conducted using only a default RTP packet format known as RTCP RR. RTCP RR packets contain summary information rather than per-probe information. They thus offer bandwidth savings, although this comes at the expense of an increase in estimator convergence time. Furthermore, this technique can be used by the observer of any standard RTP session, whereas estimation based upon per-probe information is only possible when a session explicitly employs the <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> format...|$|E

40|$|For {{quite some}} time {{there has been a}} debate {{surrounding}} the issue requiring companies to disclose not only financial information but also non-financial information, as shown in recent efforts for enhanced business reporting (EBR). This discussion paper explores non-financial information in three aspects: social and environmental information, intellectual capital information, and risk information, and it also examines the extent and reasons for the disclosure of non-financial information. In addition, the question about the media is also discussed with consideration to the trend for integrated reporting and XBRL. Ultimately, non-financial information should fuse with financial information and evolve to become integrated reporting. XBRL can only realize its potential if both non-financial information and financial information are integrated. However, there are many obstacles for realizing integrated reporting at one time. Therefore, to stimulate a change in investor behavior and company behavior, as argued by some international organizations such as IIFC, there is an urgent demand for <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> that integrates information on sustainability and information on intellectual capital as a source of company competitive advantage. For such non-financial information, there is a necessity to discuss questions related to an expansion in management's disclosure responsibility, as well as the corresponding judgment in auditing. There is also a necessity to discuss questions concerning how to reduce the cost of auditing and how to construct an assurance system that helps to improve the reliability of information and to limit the overextension of non-financial information. ...|$|E

Performance management {{is well known in}} the manufacturing industry but not common in the building industry. The performance approach is the practice of thinking and working in terms of ends rather than means. It is concerned with what a building or a building product is required to do, and not with prescribing how it is to be constructed. Performance based building (PBB) includes amongst others functional briefing and performance assessments. However, an overview of tasks in PBB is lacking and the principle has not yet been applied to smart homes. Aim of this research is to contribute to performance management in the construction of health smart homes by identifying tasks and proposing a task assignment. Tasks are identified by studying the <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> of the Performance Based Building Network (PeBBu). In conclusion we may say that PBB of health smart homes primarily differs from traditional building in the way tasks are performed. PBB demands that the client does not design (specify how to build) but restricts himself to specifying why he wants and why he wants it. PBB also demands that the designers and contractors are selected on both price and capabilities. Besides these alterations in how tasks are performed merely two tasks are added. These are the verification of the realized design and the monitoring of performance of the building in use...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the role of two {{different}} new management tool, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and the Intellectual Capital Report (ICR) in managing and reporting intangibles. Unlike the majority of IC scholars the author, and consistently with Bukh et al. (2005), the author starts from the idea that BSC and ICR are not alternative, but complementary tools in measuring intangibles, addressing different needs for firms that measure, manage and report intangibles. The research hypothesis of the paper will be demonstrated through the analysis of a case study of an Italian group which use both intangibles ’ reporting systems. A case study methodology has been chosen, given that it is widely used by researchers and provide the basis for the application of ideas and extension of methods (Yin, 1994). Intercos group has been chosen to test the research hypothesis, since it makes use of both models in measuring and reporting intangibles. The study of the case Intercos group found evidence that the two types of <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> are different and yet complementary and that both tools are necessary for firm in measuring IC, since they address different aims. This includes therefore a marked difference in use of indicators, given that IC indicators in the ICR have to support the overall aims derived by company’s strategy, while BSC indicators provides a breakdown of strategic goals with respect to profitability, growth etc. The contribution of the paper to the IC literature is to extend the findings of the Bukh et al. ’s (2003) study, investigating the hypothesis (and finding evidence) that BSC and ICR are complementary in reporting intangibles in an Italian group. Implications of the paper are for company’s manager, who increase the awareness that they have at their disposal two management tools, with address different aims, to manage intangibles...|$|E
40|$|Purpose and {{research}} questions The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to investigate influencing factors on the choice of tailoring of ERP systems during implementation. The research questions to answer are what types of adjustments {{can be made to}} the system to make it fit with the organisation, together with what factors influence the choice of these adjustments and how? Research methodology To fulfil the purpose and answer the research questions the study has been carried out in line with the hermeneutic circle. This has been done in three sequences. A pre-understanding of the phenomenon has been obtained by a literature study in the first sequence. In the second sequence interviews with IFS AB and Systeam AB have been carried out, analysed together with the pre-understanding and a model has been created. During the last sequence Sogeti Sverige AB has been interviewed to verify the model. Research findings The different ways of tailoring an ERP system are configuration, bolt-ons, extended report-ing, screen masks, workflow programming, user exits, ERP programming, interface development, new software package and package code modification. Tailoring types 1 - 8 and 10 were found in the literature while new software package was found in the empirical study. The factors influencing the choice of tailoring are coming from three domains: the customer, the consultant and the system. The factors from the customer are attitude towards customisation, costs, knowledge, process design, time and user needs. Attitude towards customisation, customisation possibility and knowledge are coming from the consultant domain. Complexity, external software, functionality and maintenance are finally coming from the system domain. All factors were derived from the literature except knowledge in the customer domain, which was found during the empirical study. Some factors influence the choice of specific tailoring types, while others influence the choice between light and heavy tailoring types. There are also factors that do not directly influence the choice of tailoring. Instead they act as prerequisites for the tailoring types. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} influencing factors can not be seen in isolation; it is the combined influence from all of them that decides the choice of tailoring types. Syfte och forskningsfrågor Syftet med den här uppsatsen är att undersöka influerande faktorer på valet av anpassning av ERP-system under implementering. Forskningsfrågorna att besvara är vilken typ av anpassningar som kan göras av systemet för att det ska passa med organisationen, tillsam-mans med vilka faktorer som influerar valet av dessa anpassningar och hur? Metod För att uppfylla syftet och besvara forskningsfrågorna har studien utförts i linje med den hermeneutiska cirkeln. Detta har gjorts i tre sekvenser. En förförståelse har erhållits genom en litteraturstudie i den första sekvensen. I den andra sekvensen har intervjuer med IFS AB och Systeam AB genomförts, analyserats tillsammans med förförståelsen och en modell har skapats. Under den sista sekvensen har Sogeti Sverige AB intervjuats för att verifiera modellen. Forskningsresultat De olika sätten att anpassa ett ERP-system är configuration, bolt-ons, <b>extended</b> <b>reporting,</b> screen masks, workflow programming, user exits, ERP programming, interface develop-ment, new software package och package code modification. Anpassningstyperna 1 - 8 och 10 påträffades i litteraturen medan new software package hittades i den empiriska studien. Faktorerna som influerar valet av anpassning kommer från tre domäner: kunden, konsulten och systemet. Faktorerna från kunden är attitude towards customisation, costs, knowledge, process design, time och user needs. Attitude towards customisation, customisation possi-bility och knowledge kommer från konsultdomänen. Complexity, external software, functionality och maintenance kommer slutligen från systemdomänen. Alla faktorer är härledda från litteraturen, förutom knowledge från kunskapsdomänen kund som påträffades under empiristudien. Några faktorer influerar valet av specifika anpassningstyper, medan andra influerar valet mellan lätta och tunga anpassningstyper. Det finns också faktorer som inte direkt influerar valet av anpassning. De är istället förutsättningar för anpassningstyperna. Detta leder till slutsatsen att anpassningstyperna inte kan ses isolerade; det är den kombinerade influensen från alla faktorer som bestämmer vilka anpassningstyper som kommer att väljas...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Risk {{management}} in enterprises, organisations and companies {{has had a}} long and complicated history. During the eighties, and at least during the beginning of the nineties, the notion concerning risk management was that if an accident happened in an otherwise perfect system it was due to the human operator in some way being the cause of the error. The cause for the accidents was described in terms of “negligence”, “lack of competence” and such similar statements. Gradually, during the late nineties, the risk management paradigm shifted. James Reason, a psychologist, made a tremendous impact with his book Human error, published in 1990. He introduced the term latent failures (or latent conditions). These, he said, are “resident pathogens”, built into the system. They are latent since the system can live with these pathogens for months and even years, and perform adequately, until something happens, which hampers the “immune system of the system”. Reason states that the human operator goes to work everyday with the intention of doing a good job. The human operator has no wish “to screw up things”. When accidents happen, and operators make mistakes, it is therefore not a deliberate action. The causes should be sought in design flaws in the system. In this thesis we are dealing with high-risk systems, though not high-risk technologies. We are studying acute somatic health care, air traffic control, pharmacy and cancer treatment. We will explore different ways for an organisation to receive feedback from safety related occurrences, in order to improve safety. The aim with this thesis will be to explore methods for obtaining safety feedback in the above mentioned domains. Four different approaches will be attempted: • Retrospective learning from accidents (paper I) • Proactive learning using an external agent (paper II) • Operator centred learning (paper III) • User centred proactive learning (paper IV) Methods and material Methods In paper I we used MTO (Man-Technique-Organisation) analysis as described by the nuclear power operators in Sweden, with a certain adaptation for health care. Paper II was inspired on the work with paper I. During the numerous interviews with doctors and nurses a quite common reaction was: “Why did we not think of these risks before? It is so obvious!” Another concern was the limited value of retrospective investigations when it comes to improving safety. This started us on designing a method for proactive risk analysis. Several methods were already described for this, but they were mainly tuned to technical systems with more or less tight coupling, assuming a high degree of linearity (as for instance the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, FMEA). We felt these methods did not fit the way in which our studied organisations functioned. The result was the DEB (Disturbance- Effect-Barrier) analysis used in paper II. The identified system weaknesses by using this method was compared to system weaknesses extracted from the analysis (done by headquarter analysts) of 15 loss of separation incidents at the unit. When working with this it became obvious that one category of incidents, i. e. the loss of separation incidents (AIRPROX), was only the tip of the iceberg. Each day {{there were a number of}} near misses that did not result in loss of separation, and therefore not used for safety feedback. Talking to the controllers also revealed a hidden knowledge on questionable procedures that might constitute risks. Thus the idea was fairly simple: Why not let the controllers do the job of analysing safety occurrences? This led to the design of a method for operator-centred learning, i. e. paper III. The method included a brief to the controllers for 1 ½ days on system thinking. The starting point for paper IV was particularly tragic. I investigated a case where an eight-year-old girl with cancer was killed by mistake. She was administered the total dose of cytotoxic agents each day for three days, i. e. a 300 % overdose. We used the DEB analysis again, for a proactive risk analysis of the process of treating patients with cytotoxic drugs, but this time using a formalised user group. Material The material for paper I was a consecutive series of eight reports to the National Board of Health and Welfare, from acute somatic health care. The material for paper II was a DEB analysis performed for the processes at the Malmoe air traffic control unit in Sweden. In paper III a trial was performed for half a year with <b>extended</b> <b>reporting</b> of learning occurrences. In this way an additional 45 occurrences were reported which otherwise would not have been documented and analysed. In paper IV the DEB analysis were performed at one ward unit at the department of oncology at the Lund University hospital, taking into consideration interface problems between the ward unit and the hospital pharmacy (which prepared the cytotoxic infusions). Results In paper I we could demonstrate that the notion of latent conditions was fruitful for analysing and learning from medical accidents. We identified a number of system weaknesses in seven out of eight cases, providing a good potential for improving safety. In paper II we identified a number of risks (latent conditions) in the air traffic control system. We compared the identified system weaknesses with 15 loss of separation cases, investigated by the regulator. We identified all system weaknesses from 14 out of 15 as loss of separation analyses. In paper III we could demonstrate that the operators indeed were able to analyse “learning occurrences”, and to identify preventive actions, one of these being training on the aircraft flight management system for controllers. Also, they could show that quite a few number of “unexpected flight behaviours” actually were actually partly caused by air traffic control actions. In paper IV we refined the DEB analysis by using a formalised reference group of staff from the very beginning [...] The analysis disclosed a number of system weaknesses, which were presented for the staff. The disclosed risks were accepted as valid, and quite a few of our recommendations were implemented during the next couple of years Discussion We discuss our methods in relation to current research, particularly we discuss MTO analysis in relation to root cause analysis, and DEB analysis in relation to FMEA. We are critical to both. We find that both methods could benefit from using the notion of latent conditions, and even applying the concept and vocabulary from the ISO 9000 quality management standard when describing risks. We discuss the learning potential of retrospective vs. proactive analysis and are in favour of proactive methods. We introduce complexity theory and relate this to our results. Our conclusion is that the operator-centred approach (paper III) seems to be the most effective way of influencing a complex system in a desirable manner, concerning self-organising and emergent properties...|$|E
