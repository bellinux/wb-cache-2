40|$|AbstractObjectivesCurrent {{guidelines}} {{tell us that}} {{intervention in}} severe necrotizing pancreatitis ought to be performed as late as possible. However, when <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> becomes infected, the necrotic tissue needs to be removed. Unfortunately, bacterial infection can only be proven by invasive methods. MethodsNecrotizing pancreatitis with sterile or infected necrosis was induced in mice. Mice serum samples were examined by antibody-based protein array. After identifying candidate proteins that showed strong regulation, the serum concentration of these proteins was examined by sandwich ELISA. Then, human serum samples were collected from patients with mild pancreatitis, severe pancreatitis with and without <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> and patients with microbiologically proven infection of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis.</b> These serum samples were then analyzed by sandwich ELISA. ResultsIn mice 6 proteins were strongly up-regulated and were further investigated by ELISAs. Of these proteins, CXCL 16 and TRANCE (RANKL) concentrations were analyzed in human serum samples. CXCL 16 and TRANCE were increased in patients with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> and abdominal infection. Receiver operated characteristics showed that CXCL 16 was superior in predicting infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> when compared to C-reactive protein and TRANCE. ConclusionsSerum CXCL 16 is increased in severe pancreatitis with infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> and identifies patients who benefit from surgical necrosectomy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} dynamic contrast enhanced {{computed tomography}} for detecting and localising <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> in acute pancreatitis. DESIGN [...] Prospective evaluation with blind reporting of scans. SETTING [...] Single teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] 60 Consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis suspected to have <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> because of major organ system failure (13); slow recovery {{five to seven}} days after admission with raised scores on the acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE-II) system (27); or findings on previous ultrasonography or computed tomography (20). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> proved histologically [...] that is, greater than 30 g necrotic tissue debrided at laparotomy (for life threatening sepsis or peritonitis) or necropsy. RESULTS [...] Dynamic computed tomography correctly localised <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> in 11 patients (confirmed at laparotomy in nine and at necropsy in two). Of nine patients with low enhancement of peripancreatic tissues alone, eight recovered after conservative management; necropsy confirmed viable pancreas and necrosis of peripancreatic fat in one patient. Of 40 patients with normal contrast enhancement, none required laparotomy to debride <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Dynamic contrast enhanced computed tomography {{seems to be a}} safe and accurate method of identifying and localising <b>pancreatic</b> and peripancreatic <b>necrosis,</b> which cannot be predicted accurately by conventional imaging techniques...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a disease}} of increasing annual incidence associated with significant morbidity and mortality and with an increasing consumption of health care resources [1]. In particular, patients suffering from acute necrotizing pancreatitis who develop infected necrosis present a severe prognosis with mortality ranging from 20 % to 70 % [2, 3]. The diagnosis of infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> is usually based on Gram stain and cultures of material obtained from the necrotic area by fine-needle aspiration. On a clinical basis, infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> should be suspected {{in the presence of}} worsening abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis, usually 1 - 2 weeks after disease onset. In accordance with the current recommendations [4], sterile necrosis should be managed conservatively, whereas the occurrence of infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> requires immediate surgery. The standard approach to infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> has been open surgical debridement with a variety of drainage and closure techniques (multiple drainages, marsupialization of the lesser sac, continuous or intermittent lavage, unique o repeated necrosectomy, etc.) [5]. So, the paradigm “infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> = surgery ” seems to be an accepted principle in clinical pancreatology. However, over the last ten years some controversies have arisen regarding this topic. In fact, some reports have shown that early surgical intervention for <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> could result in a worse prognosis in comparison with patients who underwent surgery in a later phase of the disease [6, 7]. In addition, some reports have shown surprisingly enough, the efficacy of nonsurgical management for infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> [8, 9, 10, 11]. Recently, an interesting clinical study carried out at the Universities of Goyang and Seoul, Korea [12], have added new fuel to this debateable issue.

RESULTS: We identified 61 patients with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis.</b> Six patients with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> and gas in the retroperitoneum were treated exclusively with clinical support without any type of drainage. Only 2 patients had an APACHE II score > 8. The first computed tomography scan revealed the presence of gas in 5 patients. The Balthazar computed tomography severity index score was > 9 in 5 of the 6 patients. All patients were treated with antibiotics for at least 3 weeks. Blood cultures were positive in only 2 patients. Parenteral nutrition was not used in these patients. The length of hospital stay exceeded three weeks for 5 patients; 3 patients had to be readmitted. A cholecystectomy was performed after necrosis was completely resolved; pancreatitis recurred in 2 patients before the operation. No patients died.

The traits, for which the selection was done included growth rate, feed consumption, protein retention, energy retention, and feed conversion efficiency. Selected fish had a twice better growth rate, a 40% higher feed intake, and an increased protein and energy retention. This led to an overall 20% better Fed Conversion Efficiency as compared to the wild stock. Atlantic salmon have also been selected for resistance to bacterial and viral diseases.

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a disease}} capable of the widest clinical expression, ranging from mild discomfort to multiorgan failure and death. Moreover, the process may remain localized in the pancreas, or spread to regional tissues, or even involve remote organs. Despite several efforts, the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis and its complications remains obscure. In {{the absence of an}} understanding of the pathogenesis and the reasons for the variations in severity, the study and management of acute pancreatitis has necessarily been empirical. There is little doubt that the development of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> in patients with acute pancreatitis results in an increase in clinical severity and an escalation of the mortality risk when compared to interstitial pancreatitis. Furthermore, the mortality risk of patients with sterile <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> is markedly different from that of patients developing secondary infections in pre-existing <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis.</b> Infected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>necrosis</b> is uniformly fatal, if untreated.
