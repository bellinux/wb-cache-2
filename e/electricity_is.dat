5|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>is</b> {{distributed}} by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking in the island city, and by Reliance Energy, Tata Power, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (Mahavitaran) in the suburbs. Consumption of <b>electricity</b> <b>is</b> growing faster than production capacity. Power supply cables are underground, which reduces pilferage, thefts and other losses.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much <b>electricity</b> <b>is</b> not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The <b>electricity</b> <b>is</b> sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, <b>electricity</b> <b>is</b> bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV <b>electricity</b> <b>is</b> significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>was</b> first {{introduced}} in Tanzania(Tanganyika) in 1908 by the German colonial authorities in Dar-es-salaam.
