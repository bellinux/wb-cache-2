60|$|The Value of Money is to {{appearance}} {{an expression}} as precise, as free from possibility of misunderstanding, {{as any in}} science. The value of a thing is what it will exchange for; the value of money is what money will exchange for, the purchasing power of money. If prices are low, money will buy much of other things, and is of high value; if prices are high, it will buy little of other things, and is of low value. The value of money is inversely as general prices; falling as they rise, and rising as they fall. When one person lends to another, as well as when he pays wages or rent to another, what he transfers is not the mere money, but {{a right to a}} certain value of the produce of the country, to be selected at pleasure; the lender having first bought this right, by giving for it a portion of his capital. What he really lends is so much capital; the money is the mere <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer.</b> But the capital usually passes from the lender to the receiver through the means either of money, or of an order to receive money, and at any rate it is in money that the capital is computed and estimated. Hence, borrowing capital is universally called borrowing money; the loan market is called the money market; those who have their capital disposable for investment on loan are called the moneyed class; and the equivalent given for the use of capital, or, in other words, interest, is not only called the interest of money, but, by a grosser perversion of terms, the value of money.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} aims to {{see what}} may be the effects of singing the lullabies on the development of individual identity [1]. It describes a qualitative research, conducted on a sample of 105 female subjects of the hinterland around a big city like Naples. Participants shared the characteristic of being mothers and of belonging to a family in which there are three generations of mothers (grandmothermother- daughter) [2]. So, the sample was formed by 35 families in which there were three generations of women. Research hypothesis were that lullabies have an educational function, from generation to generation, they can pass on ancient beliefs and values [3], but they are also an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> of unconscious contents, from mother to her daughter. Lullabies can be tools for trans-generational transmission (based on the concept of unconscious psychic transmission) [4], and our interests of research is to explore the role of the lullabies in education and identity symbolization processes through interviews to the three generations of women in the same family [5]. The interviews were administered orally, recorded and then transcribed and in all cases took place in the house of the respondents. The questions are four, two closed (with the possibility to answer yes / no, even if it is left to the interviewees the opportunity to broaden the discourse, however, doing the necessary specifications) and two open questions concerning the feelings related the memory of the lullaby sung by her mother. The collected data were analyzed both across the transgenerational and the transverse line, analyzing the responses of the various members belonging to the same families to understand what kind of differences there would be from a generation to another, but also analyzing the answers of people who belonged to the same generation but to different families in order to explore similarities and differences from a family to another. The conclusions show empirically how it happens education through music and lullabies from generation to generation in unformal contexts: lullabies are a vehicle for the transmission of values, ideas, beliefs and contribute to the construction of personal, but also social and cultural identity. Moreover, it are explored the streets of interpsychic transmission in the female gender education [6]...|$|E
40|$|The probate {{codes in}} {{about a third of}} the states contain a {{so-called}} divorce revocation provision, applicable both to probate and nonprobate transfers. Such statutes address the situation in which a transferor 2 ̆ 7 s will or will substitute designates as a beneficiary a person who was the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s spouse at the time that the transferor executed the document, but whom the transferor later divorced. The premise of these statutes is that divorce entails a profound change of circumstances not foreseen by the transferor, and that the transferor is unlikely to have intended to benefit an ex-spouse. Accordingly, the intent implementing purpose of wealth transfer law is better served by having a default rule that treats the subsequent divorce as having revoked any provision for the now-ex-spouse unless the document expressly provides otherwise. In Egelhoff v. Egelhoff (2001), the Supreme Court held that when the <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> is a beneficiary designation in a pension plan or life insurance policy subject to federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (2 ̆ 2 ERISA 2 ̆ 7), the otherwise applicable state divorce revocation statute is preempted, even though ERISA makes no mention of divorce revocation. The Court reasoned that enforcing the state divorce revocation statute would 2 ̆ 2 interfere with nationally uniform plan administration. 2 ̆ 2 Because the result in Egelhoff allowed supposed plan-level administrative convenience to defeat the principled objective of the divorce revocation statutes, a number of courts reacted by allowing so-called post distribution relief, in some cases pursuant to a state statute so providing. Obeying Egelhoff, these courts preempted the state divorce revocation law at the plan level, thereby permitting the ex-spouse to receive the designated benefit from the plan, but allowing the person(s) entitled under the divorce revocation statute to recover those proceeds from the ex-spouse in a subsequent state-court action based on unjust enrichment. In a 2013 decision, Hillman v. Maretta, involving an insurance policy purchased under a program for federal employees, the Supreme Court extended preemption to forbid such post distribution relief. In this Article, I point to serious shortcomings in the reasoning and policy merits of Egelhoff and Hillman...|$|E

40|$|Social {{security}} is a complex <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> payments in France, consisting of numerous regimes covering different groups of the population. Benefits are extensive and may be classified into three categories: medical, old-age, and family. The system represents a large and increasing {{part of the national}} economy and is financed largely through employer and employee contributions. French demography is characterized by slow decreases in mortality at most ages and by a decreasing fertility. Fecundity rates have fallen below the 2. 1 level necessary for the replacement of generations. Population projections through 2075 are presented, given various fecundity hypotheses, both constant and fluctuating. Financially, French social security since 1968 has been marked by instability. During the 1970 's, certain funds (family benefits, for example) were often in a surplus state, while others (medical benefits) often ran a deficit. This instability was due to numerous factors: demography, political changes in benefits and contributions, and economic recession. The demographic factor in the future will favor continued deficits in the medical and old-age branches which will be only partially offset by surpluses in the family branch. Social security, as a kind of collective intergenerational transfer, is concerned with the ratio of inactives to actives in the population. While actives as a {{percent of the total population}} are fairly constant even with a changing fecundity, movements between the groups of young and aged persons can be significant. The cost to the nation of a retiree is only slightly more than that of a young person, so from this perspective, fertility change is not so important. From the perspective of government though, the change is more important, as government spends 2. 50 times as much on individual retirees as on children. In any case the effects of fertility change are seen to be less than the potential effects of a change in the retirement age or an increase in feminine activity in the workforce. The life of a pay-as-you-go pension scheme involves three groups: the initial generations, the intervening generations, and the terminal generations. These first receive benefits without having contributed to the system; the second receive benefits which reflect, ideally, contributions made plus increases for demographic and economic growth; and the third contribute without receiving any benefits. A capitalized pension system would establish a fund where contributions would collect interest. Under stable conditions, the individual contributions in a funded system or a pay-as-you-go system would be equal whenever the natural growth rate of the population equaled the interest rate adjusted for inflation. A fully-capitalized system on a national level, however, would probably be impossible due to the capital demands of the fund. A partially-funded scheme, such as exists in Sweden, might be possible, however. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{credit risk}} transfer in banking. Specifically, we model loan sales and loan insurance (e. g. credit default swaps) {{as the two}} <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>transfer.</b> Recent empirical {{evidence suggests that the}} adverse selection problem is as relevant in loan insurance as it is in loan sales. Contrary to previous literature, this paper allows for informational asymmetries in both markets. We show how credit risk transfer can achieve optimal investment and minimize the social costs associated with excess risk taking by a bank. Furthermore, we find that no separation of loan types can occur in equilibrium. Our results show that a well capitalized bank will tend to use loan insurance regardless of loan quality in the presence of moral hazard and relationship banking costs of loan sales. Finally, we show that a poorly capitalized bank may be forced into the loan sales market, even in the presence of possibly significant relationship and moral hazard costs that can depress the selling price. credit risk transfer, banking, loan sales, loan insurance, credit derivatives...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{properties}} of the second best allocation in a fiscal federal system in which both federal tax and intergovernmental grants are involved and the taxation is distortionary. We extend the analysis of Boadway and Keen (1996) and Dahlby and Wilson (1994) by introducing both imperfect mobility and heterogeneous regions. In contrast to the outcomes in the existing works, we find; (i) the second best {{does not require the}} equalization of the conventional MCPFs between regions; (ii) in order to replicate the second best, matching grants based on either the local tax rates or tax revenues should be introduced to internalize the tax externality; and (iii) federal tax policy is redundant once the intergovernmental grants are optimized. The irrelevancy of the federal tax implies that optimal fiscal gap is indeterminate. Therefore, it will be argued that the standard framework of fiscal federal model in the literature does not provide a rationale for either decentralization or centralization of the tax system once the federal government is allowed to use sufficient <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> inter-regional <b>transfers.</b> tax externality, equalization of MCPFs, matching grants, optimal fiscal gap...|$|R
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} rights such as patents protect new inventions from imitation and competition. Patents' major {{objective is to}} provide incentives for invention, sacrificing short-term market efficiency for long-term economic gains. Although patents are primarily granted to private firms, policy changes over the last 25 years have resulted in greater use of patenting by the public sector. This study examines government patenting behavior by analyzing case studies of patenting and licensing by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. ARS uses patenting and licensing as a means <b>of</b> technology <b>transfer</b> in cases in which a technology requires additional development by a private sector partner to yield a marketable product. Licensing revenue {{is not a major}} motivation for ARS patenting. More widespread use of patenting and licensing by ARS has not reduced the use <b>of</b> traditional <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> technology <b>transfer</b> such as scientific publication. Once the decision has been made to patent and license a technology, the structure of the licensing agreement affects technology transfer outcomes. As commercial partners gain experience with the technology and learn more about the market, mutually advantageous revisions to license terms can maintain the incentives through which private companies distribute the benefits of public research. patents, licenses, intellectual {{property rights}}, technology transfer, Agricultural Research Service, agricultural research and development, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} notions of our world is “globalization” which affects the lives of human beings in several ways. It is a concept which removes boundaries and limits; therefore, involves a global world, and consequently a global economy. Within the global economy, there are flows of goods, capital, technology and other means of production among different countries. As a result, these movements create a high competition among the different actors of the game. In order to develop themselves in this global economy, firms have to expand their businesses abroad to compete in the international arena.

40|$|The minimum {{consensus}} {{in defining the}} concept of a parliamentary system is closely related to the presence of the responsible government in the system governed by the principle of the separation of powers, which is the essential characteristic of parliamentarism. A constitutional and political theory classify this system as a model of parliamentary government that is elected by Parliament and responsible to Parliament, which is the essence and the common denominator of this system. Moreover, all the modalities of the system develop in line with the relations established between the legislative and the executive authorities, i. e. between the head of state, the government and the parliament. Nowadays, there is no 'pure' model of the parliamentary government, for at least two reasons. First, modern constitutions set up <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> rationalization and <b>transfer</b> the focus <b>of</b> the constitutional power either to the government or to the head of state, but in any case 'away from' the parliament.

It {{has been a}} {{constant}} presence in directing resources to the EU agricultural sector, but the means of channelling these resources have changed considerably in that time. This article charts the evolution in the principal policy instruments used and analyses the welfare effects of the major reforms implemented. It also analyses these changes in terms of the institutional context of the principal reform pressures, of international trade obligations and EU budget concerns. Both pressures are linked to the dominant policy instruments adopted initially – price support. The initial institutions, however, meant that whilst trade concerns did not lead to significant CAP reform, budget concerns did. During the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, however, changes to the institutional context of both trade and budget policies resulted in joint pressures forcing the EU to change fundamentally {{the way in which it}} delivered financial resources to farmers.
