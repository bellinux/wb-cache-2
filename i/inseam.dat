2500|$|Despite the low {{demand for}} luxury {{motorcycles}} during the Great Depression, Indian not only continued {{production of the}} Four, but continued to develop the motorcycle. One of the less popular versions of the Four was the [...] "upside down" [...] engine on the 1936-37 models. While earlier (and later) Fours had inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) cylinder heads with overhead inlet valves and side exhaust valves, the 1936-1937 Indian Four had a unique EOI cylinder head, with the positions reversed. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the new engine was more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head, and the rider's <b>inseam,</b> very hot. This, along with an exhaust valvetrain that required frequent adjustment, caused sales to drop. The addition of dual carburetors in 1937 did not revive interest. The design was returned to the original configuration in 1938.|$|E
50|$|An <b>inseam</b> is {{the seam}} that binds {{the length of}} the inner trouser leg. The {{distance}} from the bottom crotch to the lower ankle is also known as the <b>inseam.</b> The <b>inseam</b> length determines {{the length of the}} inner pant leg to appropriately fit the wearer. In the UK this is usually known as the inside-leg measurement (for trousers fit).|$|E

Widespread fashions {{for women in the}} early 1980s included sweaters (including turtleneck, crew neck, and v-neck varieties); fur-lined puffer jackets; tunics; faux-fur coats; velvet blazers; trench coats (made in both fake and real leather); crop tops; tube tops; knee-length skirts (of no prescribed length, as designers opted for choice); loose, flowy, knee-length dresses (with high-cut and low-cut necklines, varying sleeve lengths, and made in a variety of fabrics including cotton, silk, satin, and polyester); high-waisted loose pants; embroidered jeans; leather pants; and designer jeans. Women's pants of the 1980s were, in general, worn with long <b>inseams</b> – a style carried over from the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Polyester spun {{sewing thread}} is {{commonly}} used in high-speed sewing machines in the garment manufacturing process. Recently core spun sewing threads produced with polyester filament core and polyester sheath fibres have been introduced to the local garment industry. Poly/ploy core spun thread is believed to give superior quality performance <b>inseams.</b> The spun polyester and core spun sewing threads are having different structures and as such, their properties will be significantly different. The behavior of these threads in different types of seams would provide an insight {{to the performance of}} core spun (poly/poly) and 100 % polyester sewing threads. The results of this research project show that the core spun would give superior performance in seams and the thread consumption is less when the core spun thread is used...|$|R

5000|$|Cotton - This {{version was}} {{specified}} {{at the very}} end of 1964 and still used the standard 8.5 ounce cotton sateen. However, due to changes in production and distribution time, they were not really seen until 1966. This version maintained all of the key distinctive style features such as the pockets, etc., but with some key differences. The two shirt chest pockets received a pointed pocket flap. The shirt also received a button cuff at the wrist. The buttons were changed to the [...] "standard" [...] dull plastic button as used on jungle fatigues (and later BDU's). Another change to the trousers was the removal of the waist adjustment tab. Both the shirt and pants also adopted the [...] "true measurement" [...] sizing style - for example, pants were marked in waist and <b>inseam</b> length (32" [...] x 34" [...] would show pants with a 32" [...] waist and 34" [...] <b>inseam)</b> and the shirts were marked in neck size and sleeve length (16.5" [...] x 34" [...] would show a shirt with a 16.5" [...] neck and a 34" [...] sleeve length).|$|E

For complete lists of all available sets and permutations, {{it is recommended that}} you utilize the reference material. Each branch of the U.S. military was represented with uniform/equipment sets; The navy sets included a frogman, with real rubber 3-piece wetsuit (jacket, trousers and hood); a deep sea diver, with rubberized suit, bell helmet, weights and other detailed accessories, a landing signal officer and others. The air force sets included a scramble pilot, pilot with working parachute, dress uniform; an astronaut with Mercury space capsule. The marines set included communications, paratrooper, beachhead assault, medic, and dress uniform. The army sets included Military Police, medic, radio operator, and ski/mountain troops. All authentic G.I. Joe clothing, and many of the early cloth accessory items, carried the [...] "G.I. Joe™" [...] or [...] "G.I. Joe®" [...] tag sewn into the neck of shirts and jackets, the <b>inseam</b> of pants, the left or right <b>inseam</b> of sweaters, and so on.

5000|$|Squirt boating {{incorporates}} {{the use of}} low-volume boats to perform special moves in whitewater features. Squirt boating predates, and was critical to the foundation of, playboating. Squirt boats are often fairly long and flat, with low volume throughout the design. Because squirt boats are custom built to the paddlers weight, <b>inseam,</b> and personal preference, they are constructed with composite materials instead of plastic. Many squirt moves are intended to submerge {{all or part of}} the craft and paddler, such as the [...] "mystery move," [...] in which both the boat and the paddler submerge completely into the river's flow for several seconds and up to half a minute.|$|E
50|$|Regular female sized {{clothing}} {{is designed for}} a woman at least 165 cm tall (without shoes) and will not fit a woman of significantly shorter height well. Even if the bust, waist and hip circumferences are appropriate, the sleeve lengths, leg <b>inseam</b> lengths and vertical torso measurements (such as the back length and bust-waist length) must be altered significantly to fit well. Non-petite size dresses cannot be easily altered to produce the equivalent petite size, since, in general, these lengths (particularly the critical torso measurements) cannot be altered without introducing an unsightly seam. Significant errors in the torso measurements will make a well-fitted look impossible, e.g., if the bust-point darts are off by three inches.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays, {{gym shorts}} are worn by {{adolescents}} {{on a daily}} basis {{in the spring and summer}} months. While some boys prefer shorts that reach the calf, most wear shorts that stop at the knee or just above, propagating the style as fashion. The appeal of these knee length shorts as warm weather wear is diminishing as most adults find the added length of cloth restrictive and counterproductive in truly active or competitive sports. A modern example of this departure was evident during the 2012 Olympics when the USA men's volleyball team opted for the more athletic-friendly thigh length. The international volleyball federation (FIVB) now requires men's shorts to have an <b>inseam</b> of at most 10 centimeters (3.9 inches). Shorter cut gym shorts appear to be slowly returning to popularity for those that favor function over fashion.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{more common}} in women's apparel, vanity sizing occurs in men's {{clothing}} as well. For example, men's pants are traditionally marked with two numbers, [...] "waist" [...] (waist circumference) and [...] "inseam" [...] (distance from the crotch to the hem of the pant). While the nominal <b>inseam</b> is fairly accurate, the nominal waist may be quite a bit smaller than the actual waist, in U.S. sizes. In 2010, Abram Sauer of Esquire measured several pairs of dress pants with a nominal waist size of 36 at different U.S. retailers and found that actual measurements ranged from 37 to 41 inches. The phenomenon has also been noticed in the United Kingdom, where a 2011 study found misleading labels on {{more than half of}} checked items of clothing. In that study, worst offenders understated waist circumferences by 1.5 to 2 inches. London-based market analyst Mintel say that the number of men reporting varying waistlines from store to store doubled between 2005 and 2011.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the basic}} design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some {{manufacturers}} {{have taken advantage}} of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have come up with is to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the <b>inseam</b> area which would rub directly against the wearer's skin, many manufacturers switched to a seamless design, or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. Although it is very common for boardshorts to be worn without underwear, some male wearers prefer to wear compression shorts, boxers, a jockstrap or briefs under them. Some female surfers wear a swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts.|$|E

5000|$|Elmer Ellis {{invented a}} method of {{improving}} the coating of fabrics for shoe insoles, and received U.S. Pat. No. 1,830,428, which he assigned to plaintiff B.B. Chemical Co. for $8000. Before Ellis's invention, it was the practice {{in the manufacture of}} shoes to reinforce insoles by cementing a layer of textile fabric material shaped to the [...] "lip" [...] (edge) of the insole, to reinforce the lip, thus forming a more secure anchorage for the <b>inseam</b> stitches. The usual practice had been to employ a strip of fabric of approximately the width of the insole, having coats of thermoplastic material which had to be heated just prior to its application to the insole in order to secure proper adhesion. The degree of heat required was dangerously high, and considerable skill {{on the part of the}} operator was required in order to produce uniform results. This was commonly known as the [...] "hot process." [...] There was also, a process known as the [...] "cold process", but it was considered unsatisfactory in the trade.|$|E
