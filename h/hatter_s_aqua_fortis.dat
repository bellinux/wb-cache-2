6000|$|When <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis</b> dissolves Silver and not Gold, and Aqua regia dissolves Gold and not Silver, may {{it not be}} {{said that}} <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis</b> is subtil enough to {{penetrate}} Gold as well as Silver, but wants the attractive Force to give it Entrance; and that Aqua regia is subtil enough to penetrate Silver as well as Gold, but wants the attractive Force to give it Entrance? For Aqua regia is nothing else than <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis</b> mix'd with some Spirit of Salt, or with Sal-armoniac; and even common Salt dissolved in <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis,</b> enables the Menstruum to dissolve Gold, though the Salt be a gross Body. When therefore Spirit of Salt precipitates Silver out of <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis,</b> is it not done by attracting and mixing with the <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis,</b> and not attracting, or perhaps repelling Silver? And when Water precipitates Antimony out of the Sublimate of Antimony and Sal-armoniac, or out of Butter of Antimony, is it not done by its dissolving, mixing with, and weakening the Sal-armoniac or Spirit of Salt, and its not attracting, or perhaps repelling the Antimony? And is it not for want of an attractive virtue between the Parts of Water and Oil, of Quick-silver and Antimony, of Lead and Iron, that these Substances do not mix; and by a weak Attraction, that Quick-silver and Copper mix difficultly; and from a strong one, that Quick-silver and Tin, Antimony and Iron, Water and Salts, mix readily?

50|$|Testing {{for gold}} with acid {{focuses on the}} fact that gold is a noble metal which is {{resistant}} to change by corrosion, oxidation or acid. The acid test for gold is to rub the gold-colored item on black stone, which will leave an easily visible mark. The mark is tested by applying <b>aqua</b> <b>fortis</b> (nitric acid), which dissolves the mark of any item that is not gold. If the mark remains, it is tested by applying aqua regia (nitric acid and hydrochloric acid). If the mark is removed, then this test dissolves the gold, proving the item to be genuine gold. More accurate testing of the item for its fineness or purity can be done through the use of differing strengths of aqua regia and comparative testing of gold items of known fineness.|$|R

2500|$|The Farmers General held a {{monopoly}} of the production, import {{and sale of}} tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. However this revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: [...] "When a spirit of vitriol, <b>aqua</b> <b>fortis</b> or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise." [...] Lavoisier also noticed that {{the addition of a}} small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. [...] Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote [...] "His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated." [...] Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed. To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen. To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, let us {{not forget}} that the aim of the true satirist is not to be severe upon persons, but only upon falsehood, and, as Truth and Falsehood start from the same point, and {{sometimes}} even go along together for a little way, his business is to follow the path of the latter after it diverges, and to show her floundering in the bog at the end of it. Truth is quite beyond the reach of satire. There is so brave a simplicity in her, that she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak or a pine. The danger of the satirist is, that continual use may deaden his sensibility to the force of language. He becomes more and more liable to strike harder than he knows or intends. He may be careful to put on his boxing-gloves, and yet forget that, the older they grow, the more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt. Moreover, in the heat of contest, the eye is insensibly drawn to the crown of victory, whose tawdry tinsel glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures Truth's wreath of simple leaves.

Since we have nothing more difficult in this Hypothesis to conceive, first, as to the kindling of Tinder, then how a large Iron-bullet, let fall red or glowing hot upon a heap of Small-coal, should set fire to those that are next to it first: Nor secondly, is this last more difficult to be explicated, then that a Body, as Silver for Instance, put into a weak Menstruum, as unrectified <b>Aqua</b> <b>fortis</b> should, when it is put in a great heat, be there dissolved by it, and not before; which Hypothesis is more largely explicated in the Description of Charcoal.
