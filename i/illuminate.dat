The destroyers were to <b>illuminate</b> any targets with searchlights and discharge torpedoes while the cruisers were to open fire at any available targets without awaiting orders. The cruiser's float aircraft, launched in advance, were to find and <b>illuminate</b> the Japanese warships with flares. Although Helena and Boise carried the new, greatly improved SG radar, Scott chose San Francisco as his flagship.|$|E

40|$|Shadowed {{contour lines}} vary line width. <b>Illuminated</b> contour lines {{additionally}} vary color {{based on an}} angle of illumination. <b>Illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines {{date back to the}} midnineteenth century, but their effectiveness compared to conventional contour lines has not been fully examined. Currently, <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines are not widely used in computer-based cartography because they are not included in most GIS apmaking software. This article introduces improvements to existing algorithms for creating <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines from digital elevation data. A software package is made available to allow mapmakers to more easily make customized <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour maps. A user study comparing <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines to conventional contour lines and shaded relief with approximately 400 participants was conducted. Results indicate that map-readers can interpret relative height differences between points better and quicker with <b>illuminated</b> contour lines than regular contour lines or shaded relief. Study participants were able to select absolute maxima on an unlabeled <b>illuminated</b> contour map and a labeled regular contour map with equal accuracy and speed. These findings suggest that <b>illuminated</b> contour lines could be used more frequently for improved visualization of terrain and other surface data on maps...|$|R

From dusk to midnight, the floodlights <b>illuminate</b> the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to <b>illuminate</b> the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to <b>illuminate</b> a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would <b>illuminate</b> their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E
