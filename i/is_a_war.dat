5|$|On 14 December 1944, Aldenham was sunk by a {{naval mine}} in the Adriatic Sea off Pag Island after she led a Royal Navy force in a {{bombardment}} mission against targets {{on the island of}} Pag and near the town of Karlobag in support of the Yugoslav Partisans.

5|$|The attacking {{force has}} the natural {{advantage}} {{at the start}} of each game, likely indicating an important cultural aspect by mimicking the success of Viking raids. Another cultural indication of the king is that importance of the Viking chiefs' presence in battle. Although the kings of Europe later claimed divine rule and sat upon the throne rather than being a physical presence on the battlefield, it was essential for a Viking chief to be considered an equal in war. The importance of war is also reflected in Hnefatafl because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> strategy game, which can indicate an important reason why the gaming boards have been found with males of all ages. In Balnakeil, a male skeleton between the ages of 8 and 13 was found with weapons and a Hnefatafl board game. Vikings tended to take boys onto the battlefield with them, which explains why young boys also played these war-strategic board games.|$|E

25|$|The {{first book}} of the series Marching Through Georgia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> story set during the Eurasian War, the Domination timeline's {{equivalent}} of World War II. In this war, the Nazis utterly crushed the Soviet Union, with only a Siberian rump state beyond the Urals surviving under a junta led by Marshal Timoshenko. The Nazi success derives from the Soviets suffering two recent, devastating civil wars, and needing to defend a long southern border with the Domination. Additionally, the Lend-Lease between the United States and the Soviets was rendered ineffective by Nazi U-boats effecting a powerful blockade in the Atlantic, Japanese naval hegemony in the Pacific, and the Domination's refusal to allow lend-lease supplies through its territory.|$|E
