40|$|Adaptation of {{compression}} ignition engines to dual fuel supply can be accomplished both in case of modern engines equipped with common rail system and older engines equipped with classic injection system (piston pumps). Due to big differences in price of gaseous and liquid fuels there is observed a natural tendency to use very small initial doses. At current level of introduction of gas-eous fuels to powering of traction engines {{there is a need}} to provide alternating fuelling of the engine with the Diesel only and in dual fuel system. It requires usage of original injection systems in the dual fuel engines, what largely restricts possibility of reduc-tion of the initial doses. In the paper are presented investigations concerning uniformity of the dosing by in-line piston pump of the P 56 - 01 type and two types of <b>injectors</b> with common <b>rail</b> system. The investigations have shown that the P 56 - 01 pump adjusted for nominal doses shows big non-uniformity of the dosage in area of small doses. Improved uniformity of the dosage can be attained in result of adjustment for a smaller doses, what allows reduction of the dose to about 15 - 20 % of nominal dose and improves smooth-ness of engine operation. Also in case of the <b>injectors</b> in common <b>rail</b> system, reduction of the doses is limited due to worsening of uniformity of the dosing from one cycle to another, and failure of the dosing. It results from the fact, that minimal doses in dual fuel system are smaller than the ones present in case of idling speed when the engine is run on the Diesel oil only.

40|$|Amid {{concerns}} of global warming, {{it has become}} necessary to reduce the emissions produced by engines. One method of achieving this is by controlling the air/fuel mixture formed by the spray of the injector within the combustion chamber. In comparing previous experimental results and the equations which describe the spray structure disagreement was found, {{which is expected to}} be caused by having insufficient information of the injection pressure; a required input of the equation. The aim of this research is to predict this injection pressure by modelling a mechanical injector, and testing and modelling a common <b>rail</b> <b>injector.</b> The mechanical injector simulations show that the injection pressure is lower than the line and opening pressure and is dependent on the number of discharge orifices, throttling condition and opening pressure of the injector. Consequently, the line and opening pressures are not sufficient approximations of the injection pressure and must not be used to predict spray properties. The simulations showed the injected flow rate is higher for a three hole injector at high engine loads and higher opening pressures, resulting in a more atomised and penetrating spray.

A common rail system providesthe possibility to separate the injection control from the mechanical components of theengine. A common <b>rail</b> <b>injector</b> is capable of multiple injections during each combustioncycle and offers the possibility to electronically change the injection timing. After performing a market research among the main manufacturers of injectors a BoschCRI 2 injector from a BMW M 47 N engine was purchased. The previous cylinder headwas adapted for the otto injector and had to be redesigned. A construction was made toattach the new CRI 2 injector and seal off the combustion chamber. To control the injector multiple different signals are needed for an evaluation of thecrankshaft position and injection timing. The treatment of these signals and the controlsoftware were first tested with an AFT PROtroniC ECU alone in a test bed using asignal generator.

The unique feature of the UNSW HEUI {{is the fact that}} it uses diesel fuel as the driver for pressure amplification within the unit injector. The work undertaken is part of a wider study aimed at optimization of the design of diesel injectors for dual-fuel systems to reduce green house gas emissions. The contribution of this thesis is the development of the model of the UNSW HEUI injector, which can be used to investigate possible modifications of the injector for its use in dual-fuel injection systems. The developed models include electrical, mechanical and hydraulic subsystems present in the injectors. They are based on Kirchhoff??s laws, on the mass and momentum conservation equations and on the equilibrium of forces. The models were implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK graphical software environment, which provides a high degree of flexibility and allows simulation of both linear and nonlinear elements. The models were used to perform sensitivity analysis of both injectors. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the temperature of the solenoid coil is one of the critical parameters affecting the timing and the quantity of the fuel injection of both injectors. Additional critical parameters were found to be the dimensions of the piston of the CRI, the stiffness of the needle spring of the HEUI and the dimensions of the intensifier of the HEUI. The models also revealed that in the case of pilot injections the speed of the solenoid is the major limiting factor of the performance.

40|$|Spray {{formation}} from {{diesel fuel}} injection through a realistic heavy-duty multi-hole common <b>rail</b> <b>injector</b> is studied {{in a newly}} developed high pressure, high temperature cell, using digital high speed shadowgraphy at 4500 frames per second. Care is taken to establish accurate synchronisation between camera and injection system {{and because of the}} relatively large exposure time, an effective camera image time is calculated for every frame. Further emphasis is given to determining the actual start of fuel mass injection by comparing (for each injection) a predetermined, rail pressure dependent needle relaxation distance to the actual needle lift signal. The spatiotemporal evolution of the spray is found to reproduce well in general, but often sprays suffer from short-lived, small, laterally moving anomalies, which influence axial motion and the spray cone angle. High speed shadowgraphy allows this to be observed and taken into account. After an overview of methods found in the literature, an algorithm for geometrical analysis is presented, which is based on an extension of a combination of those methods. In this algorithm, a local spray angle i(x) is determined from lateral cross-sections at 80 % of the shadow level in order to encompass most of the spray without being too sensitive to background noise. The macroscopic cone angle cone is derived from the approximate constancy of i(x) over a relatively long axial distance. Spray penetration is obtained by lateral integration of the spray shadow. A procedure for accurate correlation of spray growth with time shows that the growth is proportional to tb with b = 0. 57 ± 0. 02 for a common rail pressure of 150 MPa and a gas density 33 kg/m 3 (N 2 at room temperature). The exact value of b is very sensitive to uncertainties in synchronisation and the start of injection determination. The spray cone angle cone is not constant, but varies with time during an injection, mainly as a result of spray shape changes...|$|R
40|$|Alternative fuels such as {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} (CNG) have lately gained an increasing interest due to the even more stringent emission regulations and environmental policies. Considerable R&D activity {{has been carried out}} in order to enhance the mixture formation and to improve the after treatment efficiency. The achievement of these goals cannot disregard the importance of the injection system and of its component (common <b>rail,</b> <b>injectors</b> and pressure reducing valve) on the air-to-fuel mixing. The amount of injected fuel should in fact be properly targeted by the ECU basing on the estimation of the induced air and accounting for the embedded closed-loop strategies. Still, these latter are normally derived from engine-base routines and totally ignore the injection system dynamics. The present paper aims at developing a thorough model of the injection system with specific attention to the one component which significantly contributes to fully defining its dynamic response, i. e. the pressure reducing valve. The pressure reducer is made up of various elements that retain diverse weights on the valve behavior and should consequently be differently addressed to. The research has been focused on defining the set of parameters to be precisely reproduced in the 0 D- 1 D simulation so as to match the injection system experimental behavior. A refined model of the pressure reducer has hence been proposed and the model has been calibrated, tested and run under various operating conditions so as to assess for the set-up validity. Comparisons have been carried out on steady state points as well as through out a vehicle driving cycle and the model capability to properly reproduce the real system characteristic has been investigated into. The proposed valve model has proved to consistently replicate the injection system response for different speed and load conditions. A few methodological indications concerning modeling aspects of a pressure regulator can be drawn from the present study. Finally, the model has been run in a predictive mode so as to inquiry into the response of the system to fast transient operations, both in terms of speed and load. The model outputs have highlighted mismatches between the ECU target mass and the actually injected one and have hinted at the need for dedicated and refined control strategies capable of preventing anomalies in the mixture formation and hence in the engine functioning...|$|R
40|$|Current, {{state of}} the art natural gas engines provide the lowest {{emission}} commercial technology for use in medium heavy duty vehicles. NOx emission levels are 25 to 50 % lower than {{state of the}} art diesel engines and PM levels are 90 % lower than non-filter equipped diesels. Yet, in common with diesel engines, natural gas engines are challenged to become even cleaner and more efficient to meet environmental and end-user demands. Cummins Westport is developing two streams of technologies to achieve these goals for medium-heavy and heavy-heavy duty applications. For medium-heavy duty applications, lowest possible emissions are sought on SI engines without significant increase in complexity and with improvements in efficiency and BMEP. The selected path builds on the capabilities of the CWI Plus technology and recent diesel engine advances in NOx controls, providing potential to reduce emissions to 2010 values in an accelerated manner and without the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction or NOx Storage and Reduction technology. For heavy-heavy duty applications where high torque and fuel economy are of prime concern, the Westport-Cycle{trademark} technology is in field trial. This technology incorporates High Pressure Direct Injection (HPDI{trademark}) of natural gas with a diesel pilot ignition source. Both fuels are delivered through a single, dual common <b>rail</b> <b>injector.</b> The operating cycle is entirely unthrottled and maintains the high compression ratio of a diesel engine. As a result of burning 95 % natural gas rather than diesel fuel, NOx emissions are halved and PM is reduced by around 70 %. High levels of EGR can be applied while maintaining high combustion efficiency, resulting in extremely low NOx potential. Some recent studies have indicated that DPF-equipped diesels emit less nanoparticles than some natural gas vehicles [1]. It must be understood that the ultrafine particles emitted from SI natural gas engines are generally accepted to consist predominantly of VOCs [2], and that lubricating oil is a major contributor. Fitting an oxidation catalyst to the natural gas engine leads to a reduction in nanoparticles emissions in comparison to engines without aftertreatment [2, 3, 4]. In 2001, the Cummins Westport Plus technology was introduced with the C Gas Plus engine, a popular choice for transit bus applications. This incorporates drive by wire, fully integrated, closed loop electronic controls and a standard oxidation catalyst for all applications. The B Gas Plus and the B Propane Plus engines, with application in shuttle and school buses were launched in 2002 and 2003. The gas-specific oxidation catalyst operates in concert with an optimized ring-pack and liner combination to reduce total particulate mass below 0. 01 g/bhphr, combat ultrafine particles and control VOC emissions...|$|R
