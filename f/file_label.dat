30|$|Basic thought: {{patients}} have stored n initial medical data PHR[*]=[*]{P 1,[*]P 2,[*]P 3,[*]⋯,[*]PN} {{in the medical}} cloud, wherein each file has a corresponding <b>file</b> <b>label.</b> When a patient uploads his or her own, he or she needs to define a set of keywords for each one, forming {{a different set of}} keywords on the medical cloud. The patient uses the local key to encrypt the data and then uploads the medical cloud. Later, users continue to upload a medical data, where he needs to check first, as there are backups that {{do not have to be}} repeated for upload, otherwise, defined as the initial upload.|$|E
30|$|The {{contradiction between}} the {{encryption}} of medical data and ridding unbalance cloud data always exists before the convergence encryption [9]. The so-called convergence encryption is {{to define the}} hash value of the medical data file as the key of the file symmetric encryption. This allows the same file to remain the same encryption key for each user with a different private key, thus ensuring that the encrypted file is kept {{the same as the}} encrypted file, thus resolving the contradiction between encryption and ridding unbalance. But the simple convergence encryption algorithm can easily encounter a violent crack and guess an attack and so on. To optimize the performance, the <b>file</b> <b>label</b> is no longer defined as the hash value of the data encryption ciphertext, but the hash value of the convergence key, which is proposed in the randomized convergent encryption scheme (Randomized Convergent Encryption; RCE) [10]. This greatly saves the tag generation overhead. However, this also poses a new threat to the data security of the medical cloud-replica forgery attack, and the integrity of the file is not guaranteed. To protect the integrity and privacy of medical data on unreliable medical clouds, encryption prior to data upload and validation of data returned by the cloud server is particularly important. Moreover, even if the encryption is applied before the data is uploaded, {{it does not mean that}} the data we store in the medical cloud will not be maliciously altered. In view of the cloud server’s unreliable and inquisitive service attitude, the cloud server may be, to save computational overhead and network bandwidth, only in partial operation, returning a part of the results, or the cloud server may maliciously delete and modify some files, plus malicious adversary attacks, causing users to receive unreliable data files. Therefore, it is necessary to verify the integrity of the results returned by the cloud server.|$|E

40|$|This file {{was created}} by Tim J. Zuehlsdorff on the 17 th of October 2016. It {{contains}} all input files necessary to reproduce {{the results of the}} publication "Predicting solvatochromic shifts and colours of a solvated organic dye: The example of Nile Red". The data in this file is organised as follows. The folder NWChem contains input files to perform the scan over the S 1 potential energy surface under rotation around the C-N bond of nile red in vacuum, both with PBE and with CAM-B 3 LYP. The PBE results also generate the ground state potential energy surface that is used for the parameterisation of the AMBER forcefield. The folder experimental_results contains both the raw data plotted in Figure 2 of the publication, as well as the raw data collected from 20 different solvents used to parameterise Eqn. 1 of the publication. The folders toluene, acetone, ethanol, hexane, respectively contain all ONETEP input files for all snapshots considered for the appropriate solvents. The ones labelled "implicit" are the ones that have the solvent environment stripped away and are calculated in the implicit solvent only. The folder raw_spectra contains the raw data that is used to produce all spectra in the publication and is created from the converged results from all ONETEP input files. All ONETEP input files are labelled with a. dat <b>file</b> <b>label.</b> Note that the ONETEP calculations making use of implicit solvation were all performed in several stages. First a calculation in vacuum and open BC was performed.

Please refer to the user manuals on the ONETEP website (www. onetep. org) for further details regarding how to perform these calculations. All NWChem input files were run using version 6. 3.

It {{contains}} all input files necessary to reproduce {{the results of the}} publication "First-principles treatment of solvent effects on electronic excitations in alizarin". The data in this file is organised as follows. The folders alizarin_frame 1 to alizarin_frame 5 contain the input files associated with the MD snapshots that are referred to as frame 1 to frame 5 in the publication. The subfolders labelled NWChem contain the NWChem input files for the vacuum, the implicit solvent and the 4 angstrom calculation.

Please refer to the user manuals on the ONETEP website (www. onetep. org) for further details regarding how to perform these calculations. For frame 1, frame 3 and frame 5, the atoms in the 8 ang, 10 ang and 12 ang. dat files are labelled {{in such a way that}} waters to within 7 ang are denoted with a H 1 and O 1 label, while in the 6 ang. dat file, waters within the 4 ang region are denoted in the same way. This labelling enables the performance of TDDFT calculaions using a truncated density matrix in order to reproduce Fig. 5 (please again refer to the manuals on the ONETEP website for further details).

The audio segments contain diverse instrument timbres of percussion instruments (though the same set of instruments are played, there can be slight variations in the individual instruments across different ensembles), recording quality and period of the recording.
