5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which changes in the <b>effectiveness</b> status <b>of</b> schools can be related to changes in the {{functioning}} of school factors included in the dynamic model <b>of</b> educational <b>effectiveness.</b> The methods <b>of</b> a follow-up study were identical to those of a study conducted 4 years ago in order to test the validity of the dynamic model.

Discriminant function analysis reveals that changes not only in the functioning of some school factors but also in the quality of teaching practice can help us classify the schools into those which improved their effectiveness status, those which remained equally effective, and those which even reduced their <b>effectiveness</b> status. Implications <b>of</b> findings for the development <b>of</b> educational <b>effectiveness</b> research are drawn...|$|R

Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully.

40|$|Background. Evidence-based {{practice}} aims {{to improve}} patient care and service delivery, {{particularly in the}} management of individuals with low back pain, the largest client group seen by out-patient physiotherapists. Objective: This study determined the prevalence of use of interventions with evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> {{in the management of}} acute non-specific low back pain by physiotherapists. Methods. A multi-centered cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 physiotherapists working with low back pain patients. Using a telephone-administered interview, therapists described their current and desired treatment practices for a typical case of low back pain. Each intervention reported was coded according to its evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (strong, moderate, limited or none) as per Van Tulder's rating system. Information on clinician, workplace and client characteristics was also obtained. Results. The prevalence of use of interventions with strong or moderate evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> was 68 %. Almost all therapists use interventions with limited or no evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> or moderate evidence of ineffectiveness. Users of interventions with high evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> as compared to non-users, had graduated more recently (p = 0. 0098) and had taken a higher number of post-graduate clinical courses (p = 0. 0091). Conclusion. Although most therapists use interventions with high evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> much <b>of</b> their treatment programs consist of interventions that are not well studied in the literature...|$|R
