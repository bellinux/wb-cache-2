5000|$|While already {{famous as}} an {{economic}} entomologist, Forbes undertook studies of massive fish mortality in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. He showed the connection of algae blooms and lake physics to fish kills, and embarked on a remarkable research program into lake ecology and river ecology. Many of his insights about lake ecology were collected in an influential paper, [...] "The Lake as a Microcosm". Notable for both conceptual creativity {{and the use of}} innovative quantitative methods, his work foreshadowed the ecosystem concept as well as modern ideas of behavioral ecology and food web dynamics. On top of this, Forbes introduced the concept of a [...] "community of interest" [...] that emphasized two major points: [...] "the first that of a general community of interests among all the classes of organic beings here assembled, and the second that of the beneficent power of natural selection which compels such adjustments of the rated of destruction and of multiplication of the various species as shall best promote this common interest." [...] Stephen Alfred Forbes in 1880 advocated an ecological approach and combinations of resurgence of primary pests, selection of strains of pests resistant to insecticides and <b>general</b> <b>contamination</b> of the environment. Although the term pest management looks new in controlling pests but it is based on decades of development. Stephen Alfred Forbes {{is said to be the}} first to work on the pest management.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{using in}} situ analysis by portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) has shown that contamination present on industrial buildings at a heritage arsenic works site near Redruth, Cornwall, UK results from the absorption of arsenic by porous and semi-porous building materials that were in contact with arsenic-rich flue gases. Results from a preliminary survey indicate that arsenic remains locked in these materials and is being gradually leached out by weathering processes. This weathering causes <b>general</b> <b>contamination</b> of the adjacent building surfaces averaging 1845 µg g- 1 arsenic, presumably caused by evaporation of leach solutions in contact with air at {{the surface of the}} building materials. More extensive crystalline deposits were found under arches protected from dissolution and further dispersion by rain water.

40|$|International audienceThe Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008 / 105 /EC (EQSD) marks an {{important}} step in the use of sediments and biota as matrices for chemical-status assessment under the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (WFD). Analysis of contaminants in sediments and biota is indeed widely recognized as a cost-effective approach in water-quality monitoring to describe the <b>general</b> <b>contamination</b> level, to supply reference values for local and regional monitoring and to identify areas of concern where additional monitoring effort is needed. Because of the explicit reference in the EQSD to the use of sediments and biota as preferred matrices for the monitoring of substances with accumulation potential - especially for the assessment of long-term trends, but also for compliance checking, wherever appropriate - Member States of the European Union (EU) asked the European Commission to publish a guidance document to enhance the degree of harmonization among EU countries in chemical monitoring of sediments and biota, taking into account best available techniques, standard procedures and common practices.

40|$|Abstract—The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the human exposure to PCBs, PBDEs and HBCDs in three Vietnamese e-waste recycling sites (EWRS) using breast milk as bioindicator. The <b>general</b> <b>contamination</b> patterns followed the order of PCBs> PBDEs> HBCDs except for some recycling workers {{with higher levels of}} PBDEs than PCBs. Compared with the urban site, human exposure to PBDEs in two EWRS was significantly higher, up to two orders of difference for a number of recyclers. These highly PBDE-exposed individuals also had significantly higher levels of HBCDs than the urban population. In EWRS, PBDE and HBCD positively correlated with each other but not with PCBs, suggesting different sources of PCBs and BFRs. Levels of penta- to deca-PCBs were found to be associated with consumption of lipid-rich food whereas levels of the lower PCB congeners and BFRs were related to recycling activities. Comparing the estimated daily intake of PBDEs with their reference doses, potential health risks associated with feeding mother milk were suggested for children of Bui Dau recycler mothers. To our knowledge, these preliminary results are the first to be reported on human exposure to BFRs related to e-waste recycling in Vietnam...|$|E

To better understand whether surface irrigation waters might be a source of these two pathogens, five irrigation ponds were studied. Water microbiological, environmental and chemical factors were studied to determine if there was a correlation between any of these factors and the presence of pathogens. The methodology for pathogens detection combined a Most Probable Number (MPN) method, a filtration technique for large volumes of surface water, a standard selective media and a real-time PCR TaqMan assay. E. coli O 157 :H 7 concentrations ranged from not detectable to 0. 98 MPN per L and from below detection limit to 2. 07 MPN per L for Salmonella spp. With variables at disposal, it was found that E. coli presence seems to be related with water temperatures whereas Salmonella with nutrients in the water.

40|$|A {{zinc layer}} on a steel surface {{combined}} with on organic coating (duplex system) offers highly effective protection against corrosion. The zinc layer prevents the oxidation of the steel by being sacrificed onodicolly. The additional system of paints prevents the penetration of humidity and the <b>general</b> <b>contamination</b> of the galvanised surface during exposure to intensely corrosive atmospheres. In this work galvanised steel specimens were coated with the following four different systems of organic coatings: System 1 (two layers) : Wash Primer + Coal tar epoxy; System 2 (one layer) : Coal tar epoxy; System 3 (three layers) : Wash Primer + Zinc rich epoxy + epoxy paint; System 4 (two layers) : Zinc rich epoxy + epoxy point. The corrosion behaviour of these specimens in 3. 5 % w/w NaCl was investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), monitoring of the corrosion potential, potentiodynamic polarization measurements and dielectric measurements. Also, their behaviour in a salt spray chamber was monitored. Uncooted specimens of galvanised steel were used as reference specimens. Results of EIS and dielectric measurements were fitted to advanced models for the prediction {{of the changes in}} the parameters that characterise the anticorrosive behaviour of the organic coatings. Interrelation of the obtained results shows that the four coating systems offer more protection than simple galvanising.

40|$|Fusarium solani (F. solani) is a soil-borne {{filamentous}} fungus which causes seed and seedling rot in soybean (Glycine max). Infection during germination can cause severe stand reductions. However, if a soybean seedling {{is able to}} survive through the initial infection the plant tends to be larger in size and produces higher yield. The objective {{of this research is}} to determine if infection by F. solani persists in the soybean roots after initial infection. Seedlings were grown in soil inoculated with uninfested and infested red sorghum for 28 days. Three observation techniques, plating, staining, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers specific for F. solani, were conducted on roots after the plants were harvested. When roots were plated on ampicillin rifampicin infused water agar (ARWA) media there was <b>general</b> <b>contamination</b> of the roots with what appears to be Pythium spp., a fungus-like genus which interferes with the growth of filamentous fungi. This contamination may also complicate microscopic assessment of fungal infection of stained roots due to our inability to distinguish hyphae of F. solani from those of Pythium spp. Use of specific primers allowed us to detect F. solani in the sampled roots; however, competition with Pythium spp. compromised our results. Use of selective culture media and sterilization of growth media may be necessary to prevent the growth of contaminating Pythium spp. This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} lead poisoning in children and to identify associated factors, as well as possible local sources of contamination. METHODS: A cross-sectional prevalence study conducted in 2006 with {{a random sample of}} 97 children age zero to five years from a neighborhood in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Blood lead levels were measured and a questionnaire administered to collect information on sociodemographics, recycling and dwelling. A preliminary environmental evaluation was carried out with direct analysis of soil and indirect analysis of air pollution with bioindicators to identify possible sources of contamination. To analyze lead concentrations from the different collection sites, for each type of material studied, ANOVA was performed with a Brown-Forsythe adjustment for heteroscedasticity and with Dunnett's T 3 procedure for multiple comparisons of unequal variances. RESULTS: Blood lead levels > 10. 0 µg/dL was found in 16. 5 % of children. Recycling of waste at home, low father's education level, and increased age of children were associated with increase blood lead levels. High lead levels were found in soil, and there was little indication of lead air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of lead poisoning was identified, and the potential sources of contamination in this community appear related to waste recylcing activities.
