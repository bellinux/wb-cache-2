25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 prompted {{a number of}} reforms in the eurozone. One was a u-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy {{that led to the}} creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a <b>European</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.|$|E
40|$|Only {{several years}} after Euro {{banknotes}} and coins were put into circulation, the 1 Eurozone {{was struck by the}} global financial and economic crisis. Originated from theUS, the crisis progressively gained in intensity when reaching the Eurozone,nourished by a wide variety of factors such as major fiscal worsening caused byextreme increases in public spending (for example, wages and pensions, as in Greeceor Portugal), property bubbles weakening the financial sector (Spain), loss ofconfidence due to false public statements on the condition of fiscal accounts (Greece) generating skyjumping spreads and snow-ball effects on debt dynamics, etc. In acontext of financial contagion, these imbalances coagulated into a Eurozone crisis, ofsuch a magnitude {{to the point of being}} a major threatening for the perenity of theEurozone itself.

40|$|The {{past few}} months have seen {{decisions}} taken that will affect the shape of European policy making for years to come.

While sold as “saving the euro”, the institutionalisation of eurozone bailouts may, in the end, increase the chances of a major country leaving the euro. The ECB’s change in collateral rules for Greek bonds has been a damaging blow to its credibility and many questions remain about its new sovereign bond purchase programme.

40|$|While {{there has}} been much {{speculation}} amongst academics, journalists, and policymakers about the potential benefits of pooling European debt into so-called “Eurobonds,” {{there has been}} relatively little examination to date of the context or precedent of joint sovereign borrowing. Drawing on existing political economy theories of sovereign debt and several examples, this article argues that enhancing debt commitments through alliances and guarantees is an alternative and highly effective way to generate credibility. In fact, the rapid and dramatic convergence of Eurozone sovereign borrowing rates to those akin to Germany {{at the outset of the}} euro project is a prime example of the market assuming a higher level of financial support than existed in practice (as is evident from the equally rapid divergence of sovereign bond spreads in the past two years, once it became clear that bailouts and mutualization of debt would not be automatic). In this context, the article analyzes the bonds issued in 2011 through the <b>European</b> Financial <b>Stability</b> <b>Mechanism</b> to finance the support packages for Ireland and Portugal. The objective is to determine how these bonds are being priced and traded by market participants in order to help gauge the potential impact and success of future European joint sovereign bonds...|$|R

500|$|During {{the second}} half of 2014, the Greek {{government}} again negotiated with the Troika. The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed [...] "Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16", while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at €2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The Eurogroup was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015–16. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the <b>European</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Mechanism.</b> The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the European {{sovereign}} debt crisis, some eurozone states required a bailout from the EU via the European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stability Mechanism (to be replaced by the <b>European</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Mechanism</b> from 2013). In exchange for their bailout, Greece was required to accept a large austerity plan including privatisations and a sell off of state assets. In order to ensure that Greece complies with the EU's demands, a [...] "large-scale technical assistance" [...] from the European Commission and other member states has been deployed to Greek government ministries. Some, including the President of the Euro Group Jean-Claude Juncker, state that [...] "the sovereignty of Greece will be massively limited."

2500|$|Overall - {{looking at}} the new European {{economic}} governance framework, {{it seems to be}} in front of a [...] "mixture" [...] of different acts adopted at various territorial levels and characterized by a different legal nature. In particular, three acts shall be ascribed to the international norms’ realm: (1) the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), created by the Euro area Member States following the decisions taken on 9 May 2010 {{within the framework of the}} ECOFIN Council. Particularly, the EFSF’s mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to the Eurozone’s macro-economic adjustment programme (2) the Treaty establishing the <b>European</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (ESM) was signed on 2 February 2012, after a decision taken by the European Council (December 2010). Designed as a permanent crisis resolution mechanism for the countries of the Euro area, the ESM issues debt instruments in order to finance loans and other forms of financial assistance to the involved Member States; finally, (3) the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG), whose final version was signed on 2 March 2012 by the leaders of all euro area members and eight other EU member states, and entered into force on 1 January 2013. The TSCG has been commonly labeled [...] "Fiscal Compact [...] ", originally intended to promote the launch of a new international economic cooperation enforced by those EU Member States which are also part of the so-called.|$|E
2500|$|As the European Union {{has grown}} from 6 to 28 member states, a clear {{procedure}} for accession of members is set out in TEU article 49. The European Union is only open to a [...] "European" [...] state which respects the principles of [...] "human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, {{the rule of law}} and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities". Countries whose territory is wholly outside the European continent cannot therefore apply. Nor can any country without fully democratic political institutions which ensure standards of [...] "pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail". Article 50 says any member state can withdraw in accord [...] "with its own constitutional requirements", by negotiated [...] "arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union". This indicates that the EU is not entitled to demand a withdrawal, and that member states should follow constitutional procedures, for example, through Parliament or a codified constitutional document. Once article 50 is triggered, there is a two-year time limit to complete negotiations, a procedure which would leave a seceding member without any bargaining power in negotiations, because the costs of having no trade treaty would be proportionally greater to the individual state than the remaining EU bloc. Article 7 allows member states to be suspended for a [...] "clear risk of a serious breach" [...] of values in article 2 (for example, democracy, equality, human rights) with a four-fifths vote of the Council of the European Union, and the consent of the Parliament. Within the treaties' framework, sub-groups of member states may make further rules that only apply to those member states who want them. For example, the Schengen Agreements of 1985 and 1990 allow people to move without any passport or ID checks anywhere in the EU, but did not apply to the UK or Ireland. More recently, during the Eurozone crisis, the Treaty Establishing the <b>European</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Mechanism</b> 2012 and the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance 2012 (the [...] "Fiscal Compact") were adopted only for member states who had the Euro (i.e. not Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania or Bulgaria). This required, among other things, a pledge to balance the government budget and limit structural deficits to 0.5 per cent of GDP, with fines for non-compliance. The jurisdiction for these rules remains with the Court of Justice.|$|E
