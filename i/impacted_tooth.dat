25|$|For {{partially}} impacted {{teeth in}} those over 20 year of age, {{the most common}} pathology seen, and the most common reason for wisdom teeth removal, is pericoronitis or infection of the gum tissue over the <b>impacted</b> <b>tooth.</b> The bacteria associated with infections include Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides bacteria. The next most common pathology seen is cavities or tooth decay. Fifteen percent of people with retained wisdom teeth exposed to the mouth have cavities on the wisdom tooth or adjacent second molar due to a wisdom tooth. The rate of cavities {{on the back of}} the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age.|$|E

30|$|Erupted {{teeth are}} {{directly}} affected by conditions such as mastication, tooth brushing, and by ageing. <b>Impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> remain intact and are only affected by the ageing process (Bocutog & Yakan, 1997; Azaz et al., 1974). Therefore, <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> are considered suitable for use in research in the effect of ageing on teeth.Coronal displacement of cementum in <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> {{can be used as}} an age marker. Study done by Bocutog et al. in 1997 showed that there is a significant linear correlation between age and coronal displacement of cementum in <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> (Bocutog & Yakan, 1997). This may be related to continually erupting forces which affect the <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> and may be mechanism by which the teeth are protected at the cemento enamel junction. This phenomenon could be used in forensic odontology in age determination.|$|R

The radiographic evaluation of patients revealed the presence of 86 residual roots in 58 radiographs. 17. 58 % of patients had residual roots & 5. 8 % of patients had <b>Impacted</b> <b>teeth.</b> 58. 1 % of residual roots and 45 % of <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> were in the maxilla and others were in mandible. Maximum Percentage of residual roots (58. 1 %) and <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> (70 %) were found in molar region. In this study revealed 23. 3 % of examined patients had remaining dental fragments. From these patients, 5. 76 % had <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> and 17. 58 % had residual roots, and maximum percentage of rooth fragments (58. 1 %) were found in molar region. In similar study by spyropoulus, maximum percentage of root fragments (45. 6 %) reported in molar region and maximum percentage of <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> were found in molar and canine region (41. 2 % in molar and 41. 2 in canine region). In this study, 58. 1 % of root fragments and 45 % of <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> were found in the maxilla but in spyropoulos" report, 71. 9 % of root fragments and 94. 1 % of <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> were found in the maxilla...|$|R

This case presentation describes two different surgical approaches for two maxillary impacted canines in a 12 -year-old girl. A sequential approach included a first stage of surgical exposure using apically positioned flaps and orthodontic extrusion of both <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth.</b> A successive laterally positioned flap was used for the left maxillary canine to achieve a harmonious soft-tissue contour.

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} science {{report is}} to show a rare case of {{multiple}} <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> at adult patient and our propose clinical approach. Materials and methods: The clinical case is showed from adult man / 64 -year old/ with multiple <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> (6 <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> in the anterior place on the mandible) were not suggestive of any syndrome or metabolic disorder. The extraction of the <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth</b> was made on two stage with piezosurgery unit under local anaesthesia. For prevention of postsurgical complications, as a swelling and prevention of postsurgical resorbtion were used coneshapes from pressure xeno colagen. To base on clinical and radiological examination we will discuss the differential diagnosis and we will offer a clinical approach about decided the case. Result and Conclusion: The incidence of multiple retained teeth by literature research range from 10. 9 % to 40. 4 %, most frequently is the retention of the third molars. In the literature most rarely have clinical reports about multiple retained teeth which differ from third molars at adult patients. The rare clinical case we showed is very demonstrative and the medicative approach which we used gave excellent result...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study were to examine localization, the {{prevalence}} of <b>impacted</b> permanent <b>teeth</b> and to perform the distributions according to sex and jaws in Hatay population.

Data including the age, gender, localization were evaluated by statistical tests.

40|$|Objective: Dental {{impaction}} {{is a very}} frequent problem. Supernumerary teeth, or hyperdontia, are {{the presence}} of additional teeth to the normal series in the either of the dentition.

Study Design: The panoramic radiographic records of 4750 patients attending the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital between September 2008 to December 2012 were examined for this retrospective study. The ages of the patients ranged from 8 to 72 years, with a mean of 34. 6 years. Results: A total of 798 (16. 8 %) patients presented with 1126 <b>impacted</b> <b>teeth.</b> <b>Impacted</b> canines were the most prevalent (9. 7 %), followed by impacted premolars (4. 3 %).

50|$|Erupted {{teeth that}} are {{adjacent}} to impacted teeth are predisposed to periodontal disease. Since {{the most difficult}} tooth surface to be cleaned is the distal surface of the last tooth, {{in the presence of}} an <b>impacted</b> <b>tooth</b> there is always gingival inflammation around the second molar that is invariably present. Even this minor amount of inflammation can provide bacteria access to a larger portion of the root surface that results in early formation of periodontitis compromising the tooth.Even in situations in which no obvious communication exists between the mouth and the impacted third molar there may be enough communication to initiate dental caries (tooth decay).|$|E
50|$|Pericoronitis is an {{infection}} of the soft tissue that covers the crown of an <b>impacted</b> <b>tooth</b> and is usually caused by the normal oral microbiota.

Another common cause is entrapment of food beneath the gum flap (also called an operculum). Pericoronitis can present as a mild infection or severe infection. In its mildest form it is just a localized tissue swelling and soreness whereas in severe forms the swelling is slightly larger even sometimes creating trismus (difficulty opening the mouth).|$|E
