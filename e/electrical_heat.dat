25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European <b>electrical</b> <b>heat</b> detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

50|$|Chunks of {{concrete}} had been {{falling from the}} garage ceiling since the 1990s, and when Chancellor Collins ordered the closure, 600 spaces had already been lost due to ongoing repairs and rerouting of passenger and vehicular traffic.

50|$|As {{described}} in inventions of Sylvester L. Steffen, chillcuring is an electrical ventilating process that facilitates the photoelectric after-ripening of bulk stored seeds. The ventilation process {{is controlled by}} monitoring the wet-bulb temperature of air around the grain (as measured by evaporative cooling), by which the grain is brought to equilibrium moisture and temperature with atmospheric air. Seed dormancy is better maintained at cooler (chill) atmospheric temperatures, and grain weight and seed vigor are better preserved. The after-ripening of seeds is a biochemical process of carbohydrate/protein stabilization associated with the chemical release of water (H:OH), a reverse process of hydrolysis. The triatomic molecules of water and carbon dioxide are especially reactive in attenuating infrared light-spectrum waves, which provides energy necessary in photosynthesis and (curing) after-ripening. Infrared <b>electrical</b> <b>heat</b> is supplied by “grainlamps” so as to energize water vapor in the air under high humidity conditions.|$|E

5000|$|The fire helmet's first {{function}} was to shed water in early years. Today, it {{is first and}} foremost designed to protect a firefighter from falling debris and injury to the head while fighting a fire. The secondary job of the fire helmet is to protect from heat, and hence burns to the head. It provides a hard shell, <b>electrical,</b> <b>heat,</b> and steam burn protection, and in some types of helmets, goggles, a face shield or borkes, a short folding shield that covers the eyes. In the media these are often seen unfolded. All three provide a degree of protection for the firefighter's eyes during rescue and extrication operations. Fire helmets are constructed of various materials including non conductive materials for protection against electrical currents, carbon fiber and plastic combination for a lightweight design for comfort, and a Kevlar lining for strength and protection. More traditional US fire helmets are made out of leather.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the 'heat flow' technique is called 'power compensation' calorimetry. This method uses a cooling jacket operating at constant flow and temperature. The process temperature is regulated by adjusting {{the power of the}} electrical heater. When the experiment is started, the <b>electrical</b> <b>heat</b> and the cooling power (of the cooling jacket) are in balance. As the process heat load changes, the electrical power is varied {{in order to maintain the}} desired process temperature. The heat liberated or absorbed by the process is determined from the difference between the initial electrical power and the demand for electrical power at the time of measurement. The power compensation method is easier to set up than heat flow calorimetry but it suffers from the similar limitations since any change in product composition, liquid level, process temperature, agitation rate or viscosity will upset the calibration. The presence of an electrical heating element is also undesirable for process operations. The method is further limited by the fact that the largest heat it can measure is equal to the initial electrical power applied to the heater.|$|E
