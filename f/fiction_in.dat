5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional <b>fiction,</b> <b>in</b> that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

In 1938, the young attorney ran against longtime Republican incumbent Charles W. Lyon for the California State Assembly. Lyon cross-filed and secured his re-election by winning both primaries, defeating Chotiner in the Republican poll, and narrowly beating Robert A. Heinlein (who subsequently turned to writing science <b>fiction)</b> <b>in</b> the Democratic contest.|$|E

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is {{a notorious}} antisemitic {{literary}} forgery, probably written {{under the direction}} of the Russian secret police in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a work of <b>fiction</b> <b>in</b> 1920 by Lucien Wolf and the following year by Philip Graves in The Times. Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, Barkun writes, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s. Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.|$|E
5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C. Whitehead, were hired {{to help find}} fiction to reprint. Frank R. Paul, {{who had worked with}} Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; Paul had produced many illustrations for the <b>fiction</b> <b>in</b> The Electrical Experimenter. Amazing was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298mm), {{the same size as the}} technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000.|$|E

5|$|The storylines {{follow the}} three couples {{as they try}} to stay {{faithful}} to each other. They are held back by issues such as impotence, infidelity, and unplanned pregnancy. Their lives are further complicated by their jobs, money troubles, and moving in together. Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life. The directors and producers made additional contributions, with the intent to keep the <b>fiction</b> <b>in</b> the programme as true to life as possible. The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{has been}} {{represented}} in <b>fiction,</b> <b>in</b> literature, film and television, and in video games, {{often as a}} peripheral character in the central storyline.
