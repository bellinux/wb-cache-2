Previous {{studies have reported}} that the visual system can use optic flow to identify and globally subtract the retinal motion component resulting from self-motion to recover scene-relative object motion, a process called flow parsing. In this article, we developed a retinal motion nulling method to directly measure and quantify the magnitude of flow parsing (i. e., <b>flow</b> parsing <b>gain)</b> in various scenarios to examine the accuracy and tuning of flow parsing for the visual perception of object motion during self-motion. We found that <b>flow</b> parsing <b>gains</b> were below unity for all displays in all experiments; and that increasing self-motion and object motion speed did not alter <b>flow</b> parsing <b>gain.</b> We conclude that visual information alone is not sufficient for the accurate perception of scene-relative motion during self-motion. Although flow parsing performs global subtraction, its accuracy also depends on local motion information in the retinal vicinity of the moving object. Furthermore, the <b>flow</b> parsing <b>gain</b> was constant across common self-motion or object motion speeds. These results {{can be used to}} inform and validate computational models of flow parsing...|$|R

The boom motion {{control of a}} hydraulic robot arm driven by a singlerod hydraulic actuator {{is used as a}} case study. The experimental system dynamics are highly nonlinear.

40|$|One of {{the least}} {{desirable}} schemes for a linear electro-hydraulic motion control actuator is having a low backup structure stiffness coupled with a high <b>flow</b> <b>gain</b> of the spool valve. It has been demonstrated that this condition causes instability {{in the form of}} high frequency oscillations. This thesis examines how actuator parameters can be varied to add stability when a low backup structure stiffness and high <b>flow</b> <b>gain</b> are mandatory design criteria. The stability of the system is examined by developing the system characteristic equation and analyzing its poles in the complex frequency domain. In the complex frequency domain, the parameters are varied to determine when stability begins and ends for a given qualitative range of a specific variable. Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s Theorem is used to expand the region around an unstable root to yield a sensitivity function for assessing parameter values that cause system instability. Combining the sensitivity equations for each parameter renders a function for predicting the instability of the system as various parameters are modified.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of water between {{the surface and}} subsurface environments {{plays a crucial role}} in hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. The {{exchange of}} water is driven by the local morphology of the streambed (hyporheic exchange) and the regional forcing of a large-scale hydraulic gradient, which results in losing or <b>gaining</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. We measured the effects of losing and <b>gaining</b> <b>flow</b> conditions on hyporheic exchange fluxes in a sandy streambed using a novel laboratory flume system (640 cm long and 30 cm wide) under a combination of average overlying velocities and losing/gaining fluxes. Hyporheic exchange fluxes were analyzed based on a new conceptual framework. This combination of experimental observations and modeling revealed that hyporheic exchange fluxes under losing and <b>gaining</b> <b>flow</b> conditions are similar. Because interfacial transport increases proportionally to the square of the overlying velocity and linearly with increasing fluxes of losing and gaining conditions in the sand bed, the hyporheic exchange flux becomes smaller when the losing or gaining flux increases. Thus, losing and <b>gaining</b> <b>flow</b> conditions become the dominant mechanisms of water exchange at a certain flux, which depends on the competitive interaction between the overlying velocity in the stream and the losing/gaining fluxes...|$|R
