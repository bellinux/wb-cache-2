5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914 Norway declared its neutrality, alongside Sweden and Denmark. Nansen was appointed president of the Norwegian Union of Defence, but had few official duties, and continued with his professional work as far as circumstances permitted. As the war progressed, the loss of Norway's overseas trade led to acute shortages of food in the country, which became critical in April 1917 when the United States entered the war and placed extra restrictions on international trade. Nansen was dispatched to Washington by the Norwegian government; after months of discussion he secured food and other supplies {{in return for the}} introduction of a rationing system. When his government hesitated over the deal, <b>he</b> <b>signed</b> <b>the</b> agreement on his own initiative.|$|E

Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, <b>he</b> <b>signed</b> <b>the</b> treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|After Ali's death, the Shias of Iraq {{declared}} Ali's {{eldest son}} Hasan {{the successor to}} Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan {{was not interested in}} becoming caliph, and to prevent further bloodshed, <b>he</b> <b>signed</b> <b>the</b> Hasan–Muawiya treaty and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. Muawiyah died in Medina at the age of forty-five in 669, and was succeeded by Yazid I in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali refused to accept Yazid's leadership.
