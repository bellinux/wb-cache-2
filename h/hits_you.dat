500|$|A common {{criticism}} of Majora's Mask {{is that it}} is not as accessible as Ocarina of Time. GameSpot, which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10/10, gave Majora's Mask an 8.3/10, writing that some might [...] "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place." [...] Game Revolution wrote that it [...] "takes a little longer to get into this Zelda", but also that [...] "there are moments when the game really <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> with all its intricacies and mysteries, and that makes it all worthwhile." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield, {{writing for}} Rolling Stone, opined that [...] "the {{expansive}} new sound gives Sleater-Kinney room {{to experiment with}} their Husker Du-style storytelling." [...] Sheffield also felt that the band had grown as songwriters, citing the song [...] "The Size of Our Love" [...] as {{the highlight of the}} album: [...] "No other band could have made this song hit home -- not even Sleater-Kinney, until now. They've earned the right to keep reinventing themselves". In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau praised the vocal interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, stating that the band [...] "emerges as a diary of adulthood in all its encroaching intricacy". Sara Sherr of The Village Voice gave high marks to Tucker's vibrato, describing it as [...] "a human teardrop [...] The one that <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> and feels like a kiss".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called The Holy Bible [...] "Richey James' last will and testament", concluding: [...] "Every song has a passage frightening in its imagery. Although the music itself isn't as scarily intense, its tight, terse hard rock and glam hooks accentuate the paranoia behind the songs, making the lyrics cut deeper." [...] Upon its re-release ten years later, Dan Martin of NME described The Holy Bible as [...] "a work of genuine genius". Joe Tangari of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "In a way, {{the story of}} Edwards' spiral into some unknown oblivion {{is tied to the}} experience of The Holy Bible, which in retrospect has become a sort of horror-show eulogy for a man who couldn't live with the world around him." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "even the pall of [...] absence can't cancel out the life-affirming force that <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> with the very first song".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed. Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... we think this is going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a D {{and said that}} it [...] "should have been called 'Relentless'. Exploiting every cliché in the pop 2001 {{handbook}} – florid ballads seemingly formulated for movie soundtracks [...] it quite literally <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> baby, {{and more than one}} time." [...] Although he gave Simpson credit for being able to sing, he said that she did it in a [...] "talent show manner". Kirsten Koba of Popmatters commented that [...] "Irresistible is more reminiscent of trips to the dentist's office, or any equally oppressive place that only plays adult contemporary schlock." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone wrote that except [...] "Hot Like Fire", every other track on Irresistible needed remixing. He concluded by saying, [...] "With so many teen-pop choices, this prom-queen cyborg remains redundant and reactionary." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant called the album a [...] "lackluster sophomore" [...] effort. He commented that there was no [...] "original note" [...] on the album and compared the tracks to those by Spears.|$|E

500|$|Chris Bentley, {{author of}} The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide, notes {{similarities}} between The Day After Tomorrow and the Fireball XL5 episode [...] "Faster Than Light", whose plot concerns the problems encountered by {{the crew of}} spacecraft when it accelerates to light speed. Elizabeth Howell, a science journalist, argues that the programme is remarkable for its depiction of space exploration [...] "in the colonisation sense, rather than Star Wars and its descendants who show space as a spot to be conquered." [...] She comments further that the themes are [...] "strangely timeless... the true, unknown part <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> at the very end." [...] In a review published in TV Zone magazine in 2002, Andrew Pixley praised the acting, music and direction in general, writing that the film [...] "oozes with the charm associated with the golden era of Anderson." [...] However, criticising other aspects, he argued that [...] "it is the fundamental concept that falls flat. Rather than making physics a palatable piece of escapist hokum, the format is dragged down {{to the level of}} a scantily-illustrated physics textbook... something isn't quite right." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris True, {{also from}} AllMusic, {{selected}} the song as a standout track on her Greatest Hits 87-97 album. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at four on their [...] "Kylie Minogue Primer: The Top 10 Past <b>Hits</b> <b>You</b> Need to Know" [...] stating [...] "'Breathe’ {{is the obvious}} stand out, sounding almost like a Nine Inch Nails throwaway in its opening seconds and morphing into a silky, sexy defence of Minogue's experimental side." [...] Louis Virtel from The Backlot listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at number14 on their [...] "Kylie Minogue’s 50 Best Songs, in Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "'Breathe' would be a meditative masterpiece if it weren't so confrontational, deadpan, and sexually domineering. Impossible Princess unassuming heart stopper trips into unexpected carnality in its choruses, assuring you 'It won’t be long now' {{as you try to}} time your hyperventilation." [...] According to Tom Parker, who provided the special edition album notes for Impossible Princess, [...] " [...] is a seductive electronic groove, with a hypnotic subtlety and timelessness befitting the theme inward contemplating and resolve." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard said that [...] "Breathe" [...] is a [...] "user-friendly jam" [...] which is [...] "largely due to its big-beat electronic groove and ear-tickling pop chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands {{stand the test of}} time, but this reminds you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{was voted}} the National Football League Players Association NFC Offensive Lineman {{of the year}} four times—1983, 1986, 1987, and 1989 and was the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award winner after the 1995 season. Slater played in 259 games from 1976 to 1995, a then-record for {{offensive}} lineman (broken by Bruce Matthews in the 1999 season). He was {{the first player to}} play 20 seasons for one team, later matched by Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson and third all-time. He played for 24 quarterbacks and 37 running backs in his lengthy career, during which seven running backs reached for over 1,000 yards in a season and played in seven Pro Bowls. Former teammate Jim Everett stated [...] "Jackie Slater is proof they were playing football in the prehistoric days". [...] He was Dickerson's Hall of Fame presenter in 1999. In 2001, Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said [...] "Jackie Slater didn't want to just beat you, he wanted to dominate you. That's what made him the player that he was."

500|$|Truth Serum {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Anita Moran of The New Zealand Herald opined that the tracks were [...] "easy to listen to" [...] and had [...] "wide appeal". She also considered that the record was [...] "too short" [...] and that Lo's voice {{did not have}} the same intensity of Ellie Goulding's. Writing for BBC News, Mark Savage said that the EP [...] "contains more hooks than a coat rack". Furthermore, he ranked the record at number two on his list of the top ten singles of 2014, writing that, [...] "Every track <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> like a hurricane – the pop hooks deployed like rock riffs as Tove excavates her darkest secrets". Ben Oliver of We Listen Hear called it an [...] "excellent debut EP" [...] and [...] "a collection that not only showcases a sharp new talent but sets a new standard for emotional pop music". Panisch of Out noted that the singer [...] "manages to mesh together a warts-and-all narrative [...] with polished dance floor-ready beats". John Calvert of NME gave the extended play a mixed review; though he praised Lo's sincerity in the lyrics of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", he criticized the production of Truth Serum, writing that it is not [...] "anywhere near as boundary pushing, sonically – instead, it's dominated by anodyne, cliché-packed Scandi-pop". Tord Litleskare of the Norwegian publication Gaffa also gave the EP a mixed response, stating that the lyrics of the tracks were [...] "silly and sad" [...] and [...] "too focused on heartbreaks and drugs".|$|E
500|$|John A. Hanson of Sputnikmusic {{felt that}} the {{greatest}} hits album was released [...] "at the perfect time" [...] {{as many of the}} songs were released {{a long time ago and}} [...] "they've lost the overplayedness, but its [...] soon enough that they still have some sort of relevance". He concluded for the album, [...] " [...] <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> with recognizable hit after recognizable hit, and they are all pretty much as perfect as contemporary R gets". Describing the album as a [...] "masterclass in what happens when a great band comes together", Yahoo! Music's Hattie Collins wrote, [...] "Despite the low-points, this is a Destiny's Child must have collection of classics from one of R's most significant talents". A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website musicOMH who felt the album included many [...] "skippable" [...] songs and noted that the material from The Writing's on the Wall and Survivor were the collection's best. She {{felt that the}} progress in the sound of the band was evident on #1's, but offered the opinion, [...] "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves to be pretty ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R". San Francisco Chronicle Aidin Vaziri criticized the songs from Destiny Fulfilled and [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] and concluded [...] "surveying Destiny's Child's entire career on this set... it's obvious their hearts slipped away around the same time Beyonce's solo album sold its first million".|$|E

500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine {{what they are going to}} do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it <b>hits</b> <b>you</b> feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on <b>hits,</b> <b>you</b> get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
