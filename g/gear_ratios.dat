5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E

50|$|A high <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{occurs when}} the {{contraction}} velocity of the whole muscle {{is much greater than}} that of an individual muscle fiber, resulting in a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that is greater than 1. A high <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> will result in low force, high velocity contractions of the entire muscle. The angle of pennation will increase during contraction accompanied by an increase in thickness. Thickness is defined as the area between the aponeuroses of the muscle. A low <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{occurs when the}} contraction velocity of the whole muscle and individual fibers is approximately the same, resulting in a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. Conditions resulting in a low <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> include high force and low velocity contraction of the whole muscle. The pennation angle typically shows little variation. The muscle thickness will decrease.|$|R
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> These {{bicycles}} are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the bicycle.

25|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with only one}} gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. rear hub only or rear derailleur only), the number of possible <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is the same as}} the number of usable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> which is also the same as the number of distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The CVT’s variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the second}} {{generation}} Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually the original <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002-05 model years, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.|$|E
2500|$|Segmented musculature, like pennate muscle, has fibers aligned at {{an angle}} and due to this feature of design, when muscle fibers {{increase}} in angle {{with respect to the}} medial axis, along with the direction and amount of muscle bulging, the Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. A variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> based upon different anatomical position, loading and movement conditions, has since been dubbed spatially varying <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> The occurrence of spatially varying <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> gives rise to a new insight of muscle biology; “inhomogenous muscle mechanics.” ...|$|R
25|$|In pennate muscles, {{segments}} {{with higher}} pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of a pennate muscle {{is higher than}} the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of spindle like muscles (e.g. fusiform). A smaller fiber length neutralizes this higher architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> if the muscle fibers must be squeezed into the same space.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{worm gears}} provide a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 14:1. Versions with an 18:1 <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> also exist, trading better {{accuracy}} in fine tuning against slower initial string winding.|$|R
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} is {{that the}} overlapping gear ranges result {{in a lot of}} duplication or near-duplication of <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|E
25|$|Teams were {{no longer}} allowed to change their <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> from race to race to suit the {{individual}} demands of a circuit. Instead, they had to nominate eight <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> ahead of the first race of the season, and these eight ratios were used at every Grand Prix. They were given one opportunity to change their ratios once the season had started, but any subsequent changes would have incurred a grid penalty.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E

25|$|The Song Shi {{description}} of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. The <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled {{the diameter of the}} road wheels.

50|$|A 1:10 {{dual speed}} focuser has a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10 and R=4.5r. Thus the angular {{velocity}} ratio is actually 11. The <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> and velocity ratio {{should not be}} confused with each other.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} this {{arrangement}} was that the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between an engine and the output shaft depended on how many engines were driving the transmission. <b>Gear</b> <b>ratio</b> selection was accomplished not by [...] "changing gear" [...] in the conventional sense, but by filling or draining the hydraulic couplings to connect or disconnect the engines from the transmission. With only one hydraulic coupling filled with oil {{and the other three}} engines disconnected and their respective input shafts to the transmission locked by the one-way clutches, the single engine drove the output shaft through an effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4:1. With two engines driving, the effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> was 2:1; with three engines, 1.33:1; and with all four engines, unity. In other words, the effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the transmission was the inverse of the number of engines driving it.|$|R

25|$|Vehicles {{with two}} {{continuously}} variable transmissions, {{such as the}} DAF Daffodil. The Daffodil, and other similar vehicles which were made until the 1970s by the Dutch company DAF, had a type of transmission that used an arrangement of belts and pulleys to provide {{an infinite number of}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The engine drove two separate transmissions which ran the two driving wheels. When the vehicle turned, the two wheels could rotate at different speeds, making the two transmissions shift to different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> thus functionally substituting for a differential. The slower moving wheel received more driving torque than the faster one, so the system had limited-slip characteristics. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.|$|E

50|$|Crawl {{ratio is}} a term used in the {{automotive}} world to describe the highest <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that a vehicle is capable of. Note that <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> also known as speed <b>ratio,</b> of a <b>gear</b> train {{is defined as the}} ratio of the angular velocity of the input gear to the angular velocity of the output gear, and thus a higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> implies a larger speed reduction, i.e. the input speed is reduced more at the output. The highest <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is obtained at either first gear or reverse gear, but only first gear is typically taken into consideration while talking about crawl ratio. A potentially confusing terminology is that although a better crawl ratio is achieved by a higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> it is common to refer to a better crawl ratio as “lower crawl ratio” rather than “higher crawl ratio” as it is obtained by lowering the engine speed more.|$|R
25|$|The Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{explained}} through the segmented muscle model 3 proposed by Emanuel Azizi, where a muscle segment is shown {{as a single}} muscle fiber attached to the myosepta of a Siren lacertina an aquatic salamander at a certain acute, pennation angle. The model allows segments to bulge out differently in the horizontal, and vertical direction and was {{used to calculate the}} Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of each segment. Preliminary models results show that with muscle bulging, the Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> will increase. Different bulging conditions were studied, and shown in Fig. 2 The model results show the more a muscle bulges in dorsoventral height, the further the muscle fibers shorten, therefore providing a higher Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R
