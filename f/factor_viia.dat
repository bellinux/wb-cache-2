40|$|Background—The {{mechanisms}} by which lipid lowering reduces the incidence of acute thrombotic complications of coronary atheroma in clinical trials remains unknown. Tissue factor (TF) overexpressed in atheroma may accelerate thrombus formation at the sites of plaque disruption. A cell surface cytokine CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L) enhances TF expression in vitro. Methods and Results—To test the hypothesis that lipid lowering reduces TF expression and activity, we produced atheroma in rabbit aortas by balloon injury and cholesterol feeding for 4 months (Baseline group, n 515), followed by either a chow diet (Low group, n 510) or a continued high-cholesterol diet for 16 months (High group, n 55). Immunolocalization of TF, CD 40 L, and its receptor CD 40 was quantified by computer-assisted color image analysis. Macrophages in atheroma of the Baseline and High groups strongly expressed TF. Intimal smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells also contained immunoreactive TF. Regions of expression of CD 40 L and CD 40 colocalized with TF. Protein expression of TF diminished substantially in the Low group in association with reduced expression of CD 40 L and CD 40. In situ binding of TF to <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa</b> and X, detected by digoxigenin-labeled <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa</b> and X, colocalized with TF protein in atheroma and decreased after lipid lowering. We also determined reduced TF biological activity in the Low group by use of a chromogenic assay.

25|$|In DIC, the {{processes}} of coagulation and fibrinolysis are dysregulated, {{and the result is}} widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called tissue factor (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumor necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This {{plays a major role in}} the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This helps to explain why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon exposure to blood and platelets, TF binds with activated <b>factor</b> <b>VIIa</b> (normally present in trace amounts in the blood), forming the extrinsic tenase complex. This complex further activates factor IX and X to IXa and Xa, respectively, leading to the common coagulation pathway and the subsequent formation of thrombin and fibrin.|$|E

40|$|SummaryCoordinated enzymatic {{reactions}} regulate blood clot generation. To explore {{the contributions of}} various coagulation enzymes in this process, we utilized a panel of aptamers against <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa,</b> IXa, Xa, and prothrombin. Each aptamer dose-dependently inhibited clot formation, yet none was able to completely impede this process in highly procoagulant settings. However, several combinations of two aptamers synergistically impaired clot formation. One extremely potent aptamer combination was able to maintain human blood fluidity even during extracorporeal circulation, a highly procoagulant setting encountered during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Moreover, this aptamer cocktail could be rapidly reversed with antidotes to restore normal hemostasis, indicating that even highly potent aptamer combinations can be rapidly controlled. These studies highlight the potential utility of using sets of aptamers to probe the functions of proteins in molecular pathways for research and therapeutic ends...|$|R

Accumulating evidence suggests a relationship between dietary fatty acids and emerging hemostatic CVD risk factors, although much of this evidence is incomplete or conflicting. In order to improve our knowledge in this area, sufficient sample size in future studies are required to take into account of the genetic variation (gene polymorphisms for VII, PAI- 1), sex, physical activity, stage of life factors, and sufficient duration to account for adaptation for definitive conclusions. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|PARs (protease-activated receptors) are {{a family}} of four G-protein-coupled receptors for proteases from the circulation, {{inflammatory}} cells and epithelial tissues. This report focuses on PAR(2), which {{plays an important role in}} inflammation and pain. Pancreatic (trypsin I and II) and extrapancreatic (trypsin IV) trypsins, mast cell tryptase and coagulation <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa</b> and Xa cleave and activate PAR(2). Proteases cleave PAR(2) to expose a tethered ligand that binds to the cleaved receptor. Despite this irreversible activation, PAR(2) signalling is attenuated by beta-arrestin-mediated desensitization and endocytosis, and by lysosomal targeting and degradation, which requires ubiquitination of PAR(2). beta-Arrestins also act as scaffolds for the assembly of multi-protein signalling complexes that determine the location and function of activated mitogen-activated protein kinases. Observations of PAR(2) -deficient mice support a role for PAR(2) in inflammation, and many of the effects of PAR(2) activators promote inflammation. Inflammation is mediated in part by activation of PAR(2) in the peripheral nervous system, which results in neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia...|$|R

Here we aimed to develop a novel labeling strategy to detect and quantify procoagulant circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with metastatic cancer. We hypothesize that the enumeration of procoagulant CTCs may be prognostic for the development of venous thrombosis in patients with cancer. Our approach is based on the observation that cancer cells are capable of initiating and facilitating cell-mediated coagulation in vitro, whereby activated coagulation factor complexes assemble upon cancer cell membrane surfaces. Binding of fluorescently-labeled, active site-inhibited coagulation <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa,</b> Xa and IIa to the metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB- 231, nonmetastatic colorectal cell line, SW 480, or metastatic colorectal cell line, SW 620, was characterized in a purified system, in anticoagulated blood and plasma, and in plasma under conditions of coagulation.

40|$|Protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2) is a {{cellular}} receptor expressed prominently on epithelial, mesangial, and endothelial {{cells in the}} kidney and on macrophages.

It induces pleiotropic effects including vasodilatation, increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1) expression, mesangial cell proliferation, and cytokine production by macrophages. The role of PAR- 2 in renal inflammation was studied in antiglomerular basement membrane antibody-induced crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN) using PAR- 2 -deficient (PAR- 2 −/−) mice and wild-type littermate controls. PAR- 2 −/− mice had reduced crescent formation, proteinuria, and serum creatinine compared with wild-type mice 21 days after initiation of CGN. Glomerular accumulation of CD 4 + T cells and macrophages {{and the number of}} proliferating cells in glomeruli were similar in both groups. Glomerular fibrin deposition was significantly reduced in PAR- 2 −/− mice, and this was associated with reduced renal plasminogen activator inhibitor expression and increased renal matrix-metalloprotinase- 9 activity. These results demonstrate a proinflammatory role for PAR- 2 in CGN that is independent of effects on glomerular leukocyte recruitment and mesangial cell proliferation. PAR- 2 -mediated augmentation of renal plasminogen activator inhibitor expression and inhibition of matrix-metalloprotinase- 9 activity may contribute to increased glomerular fibrin accumulation and glomerular injury in CGN...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{solution}} {{structure for}} the complete zymogen form of human coagulation protein C is modeled. The initial core structure {{is based on the}} x-ray crystallographic structure of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) -domainless activated form. The Gla domain (residues 1 – 48) is modeled from the x-ray crystal coordinates of the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex and oriented with the epidermal growth factor- 1 domain to yield an initial orientation consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of porcine factor IXa. The missing C-terminal residues in the light chain (residues 147 – 157) and the activation peptide residues 158 – 169 were introduced using homology modeling so that the activation peptide residues directly interact with the residues in the calcium binding loop. Molecular dynamics simulations (Amber-particle-mesh-Ewald) are used to obtain the complete calcium-complexed solution structure. The individual domain structures of protein C in solution are largely unaffected by solvation, whereas the Gla-epidermal growth factor- 1 orientation evolves to a form different from both <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa</b> and IXa. The solution structure of the zymogen protein C is compared with the crystal structures of the existing zymogen serine proteases: chymotrypsinogen, proproteinase, and prethrombin- 2.

40|$|The {{effect of}} factors VIII and IX {{on the ability}} of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex to {{activate}} factor X was studied in a continuous-flow tubular enzyme reactor. Tissue factor immobilized in a phospholipid bilayer on the inner surface of the tube was exposed to a perfusate containing <b>factors</b> <b>VIIa,</b> VIII, IX, and X flowing at a shear rate of 57, 300, or 1130 sec- 1. Factor Xa in the effluent was determined by chromogenic assay. The flux of factor Xa (moles formed per unit surface area per unit time) was strongly dependent on wall shear rate, increasing about 3 -fold as wall shear rate increased from 57 to 1130 sec- 1. The addition of factors VIII and IX at their respective plasma concentrations resulted in a further 2 - to 3 -fold increase. The direct activation of factor X by tissue factor-factor VIIa could be virtually eliminated by the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor; however, when factors VIII and IX were present at their approximate plasma concentrations, factor Xa production rates were enhanced 15 - to 20 -fold. These results suggest that the tissue factor pathway, mediated through factors VIII and IX, produces significant levels of factor Xa even in the presence of an inhibitor of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex; moreover, the activation is dependent on local shear conditions. These findings are consistent both with a model of blood coagulation in which initiation of the system results from tissue factor and with the bleeding observed in hemophilia...|$|R

Novel circulating cardiovascular risk markers enabling a more accurate prediction of cardiovascular risk have been identified. Examination of these markers may clarify the increased risk in OSA and contribute {{to an analysis of}} the benefits of treatment. METHODS: Plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride and activated coagulation <b>factors</b> XIIa and <b>VIIa,</b> <b>factors</b> VII, VIII, XII, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWFAg), soluble P-selectin (sP-sel), and homocysteine were measured before and after treatment for 1 month with therapeutic or subtherapeutic (control) continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) in 220 patients with OSA. RESULTS: Levels of activated coagulation <b>factors</b> XIIa, <b>VIIa,</b> TAT and sP-sel were higher in OSA patients at baseline than in unmatched controls, but did not fall with 1 month of therapeutic CPAP treatment. The raised sP-sel levels correlated only with body mass index (p = 0. 002). There was a trend towards a significant fall in total cholesterol with therapeutic CPAP (p = 0. 06) compared with the control group. In the therapeutic group there was a clinically significant mean fall in total cholesterol of 0. 28 mmol/l (95 % confidence interval 0. 11 to 0. 45, p = 0. 001) which may reduce cardiovascular risk by about 15 %. CONCLUSION: A number of activated coagulation factors are increased in untreated OSA patients, potentially contributing to vascular risk, but they do not fall with 1 month of CPAP treatment. Nasal CPAP may produce a clinically relevant fall in total cholesterol level, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk, but this needs to be verified in a larger prospective study...|$|R

These proteases elicit cellular responses, but their receptor(s) have not been identified. We asked whether FVIIa and FXa might activate PARs if presented by their cofactors. Co-expression of tissue factor (TF), the cellular cofactor for FVIIa, together with PAR 1, PAR 2, PAR 3, or PAR 4 conferred TF-dependent FVIIa activation of PAR 2 and, to lesser degree, PAR 1. Responses to FXa were also observed but were independent of exogenous cofactor. The TF/FVIIa complex converts the inactive zymogen Factor X (FX) to FXa. Strikingly, when FX was present, low picomolar concentrations of FVIIa caused robust signaling in cells expressing TF and PAR 2. Responses in keratinocytes and cytokine-treated endothelial cells suggested that PAR 2 may be activated directly by TF/FVIIa and indirectly by TF/FVIIa-generated FXa at naturally occurring expression levels of TF and PAR 2. These results suggest that PAR 2, although not activatable by thrombin, may nonetheless function as a sensor for coagulation proteases and contribute to endothelial activation {{in the setting of}} injury and inflammation.
