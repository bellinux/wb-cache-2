2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sightings {{investigated}} the prison {{and claimed that}} they have evidence of ghostly activity caught on film at Alcatraz. A CBS news team was also reputed to have experienced strange activity in the prison hospital and in the laundry room. Psychic Daena Smoller and psychologist Larry Montz investigated the prison and found nothing in D-Block or the cellhouse but equipped with a magnetometer, they picked up a reading in the New Industries Building {{in the area where}} inmates had been employed in sewing. Smoller says that she picked up on the intense sound of buzzing of sewing machines and energy of the workplace and suddenly felt an intense pain <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Nothing happened for several minutes until the magnetometer reportedly [...] "jumped". Montz said that unless there was an electromagnetic device in the building which would cause it to have taken place, then there was [...] "definitely paranormal activity taking place".

2500|$|After reigning {{almost twenty}} years, working {{at least ten}} hours a day, Christina had what some have {{interpreted}} as a nervous breakdown. She suffered with high blood pressure, complained about bad eyesight and pain <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Grégoire François Du Rietz, since 1642 the court physician, was called when she suddenly collapsed in 1651. In February 1652 the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient sleep, warm baths and healthy meals, as opposed to Christina's hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five, and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and working so hard and to remove the books from her apartments. For years, Christina knew by heart all the sonnets from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician showed her the 16erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. She now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 [...] "laden in riches and curses".|$|E
