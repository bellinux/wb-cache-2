[...] Specifically, protesters demanded that the separatists cease <b>firing</b> <b>rocket</b> attacks from residential areas on the outskirts of Donetsk. Whilst all parties to the conflict continued to support implementation of the measures specified by Minsk II, minor skirmishes continued on a daily basis through June and July 2015.

The spacewalk {{was conducted in}} Russian Orlan spacesuits with red stripes. The two spacewalkers worked swiftly to complete their spacewalk goals that included the installation of a new work platform and test robot outside the Zvezda module. Sharipov and Chiao also relocated a Japanese space environment exposure experiment called MPAC SEEDS and plugged in an antenna for the robot test bed. They also studied ISS vents used by the station's Elektron oxygen generator and other life support systems. During the spacewalk, the space station's stabilizing gyroscopes repeatedly became overloaded with a mysterious torque, {{and they had to}} be relieved periodically by <b>firing</b> <b>rocket</b> thrusters located on the Russian half of the ISS. On at least one occasion these thrusters were appeared to have been activated when the Sharipov and Chiao were working dangerously close to them. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 28 minutes.|$|E

Residents in Dera Ismail Khan reported hearing loud blasts and gunfires. About hundred militants (who were armed with Guns, mortars, Rocket-propelled grenades and bombs) attacked the prison. Militants launched their attack with series of explosion. Militants have also launched an attack on buildings surrounding the prison, including a radio station and a hospital. A nearby house was also reportedly attacked where the militants took the residents hostage and laid an ambush for security forcesâ reinforcements.

MEYERUNITED STATES MARINE CORPSFor service as set forth in the following: [...] "For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with Marine Embedded Training Team 2-8, Regional Corps Advisory Command 3-7, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on 8 September 2009. Corporal Meyer maintained security at a patrol rally point while other members of his team moved on foot with two platoons of Afghan National Army and Border Police into the village of Ganjgal for a pre-dawn meeting with village elders. Moving into the village, the patrol was ambushed by more than 50 enemy fighters <b>firing</b> <b>rocket</b> propelled grenades, mortars, and machine guns from houses and fortified positions on the slopes above. Hearing over the radio that four U.S. team members were cut off, Corporal Meyer seized the initiative. With a fellow Marine driving, Corporal Meyer took the exposed gunner's position in a gun-truck as they drove down the steeply terraced terrain in a daring attempt to disrupt the enemy attack and locate the trapped U.S. team. Disregarding intense enemy fire now concentrated on their lone vehicle, Corporal Meyer killed a number of enemy fighters with the mounted machine guns and his rifle, some at near point blank range, as he and his driver made three solo trips into the ambush area. During the first two trips, he and his driver evacuated two dozen Afghan soldiers, many of whom were wounded. When one machine gun became inoperable, he directed a return to the rally point to switch to another gun-truck for a third trip into the ambush area where his accurate fire directly supported the remaining U.S. personnel and Afghan soldiers fighting their way out of the ambush. Despite a shrapnel wound to his arm, Corporal Meyer made two more trips into the ambush area in a third gun-truck accompanied by four other Afghan vehicles to recover more wounded Afghan soldiers and search for the missing U.S. team members. Still under heavy enemy fire, he dismounted the vehicle on the fifth trip and moved on foot to locate and recover the bodies of his team members. Meyer's daring initiative and bold fighting spirit throughout the 6-hour battle significantly disrupted the enemy's attack and inspired the members of the combined force to fight on. His unwavering courage and steadfast devotion to his U.S. and Afghan comrades in the face of almost certain death reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service." ...|$|E

The purpose of the nosecap FADS system was to test whether or not useful data could be obtained from a FADS system if it was placed {{in close proximity to}} <b>firing</b> <b>rocket</b> nozzles like the Attitude Control Motor (ACM) nozzles on the PA- 1 Launch Abort System. The nosecap FADS system used pressure measurements from a series of pressure ports which were arranged in a cruciform pattern and flush with the surface of the vehicle to estimate values of angle of attack, angle of sideslip, Mach number, impact pressure, and freestream static pressure. This paper will present the algorithms employed by the FADS system along with the development of the calibration datasets and a comparison of the final results to the Best Estimated Trajectory (BET) data for PA- 1. Also presented in this paper is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study to explore the impact of the ACM on the nosecap FADS system. The comparison of the nosecap FADS system results to the BET and the CFD study showed that more investigation is needed to quantify the impact of the <b>firing</b> <b>rocket</b> motors on the FADS system...|$|E
