5|$|In 1965, Rockefeller {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the Potantico <b>Expressway,</b> a connector from the to-be-constructed Hudson River <b>Expressway</b> (NY9A) to the Taconic State Parkway. Some opposition to the idea arose {{on the grounds that}} the new highway would only benefit the Rockefeller estate and not the residents. Nonetheless, construction began on the Potantico <b>Expressway</b> (now known as Phelps Way) in 1969. When the highway was completed in November1970, it became part of a rerouted NY117. NY117's former alignment along Bedford Road became NY448. The Hudson River <b>Expressway</b> project was cancelled in 1971, and the western stub of the <b>expressway</b> now serves Phelps Hospital.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the California Transportation Commission (CTC) {{approved}} shifting SR 111 {{onto the}} new SR 86 <b>expressway</b> {{after it was}} completed, using SR 195 to make the connection. When the SR 86 <b>expressway</b> was fully constructed, SR 195 was {{to be removed from}} the state highway system according to state law; that <b>expressway</b> was finished in 2001. However, this removed the connection from the highway portion of SR 111 to the new <b>expressway</b> carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system. Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009, leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing that was now bypassed by the <b>expressway.</b> In December 2014, with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting, the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195, from the new SR 86 <b>expressway</b> to SR 111, to become part of SR 111. SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street <b>Expressway,</b> a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze <b>Expressway.</b> The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze <b>Expressway</b> was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the <b>expressway</b> was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic circle on the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a dead-end street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the <b>expressway,</b> which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street <b>Expressway</b> to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the road}} {{go back to the}} 1930s, when a parkway was {{proposed}} between Camden and Atlantic City that was never built. Plans resurfaced {{for the road}} in the 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley pushed for a road to help the area economy. The New Jersey <b>Expressway</b> Authority was created in 1962 to be responsible for building an <b>expressway.</b> The Atlantic City <b>Expressway</b> was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of the road in 1991 from the New Jersey <b>Expressway</b> Authority.|$|E
5|$|The Cross Bronx <b>Expressway</b> Extension and the Clearview <b>Expressway</b> were {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} I-78, which was to continue south from Hillside Avenue through Southeast Queens, and west across Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel. Under these plans, the Clearview would have been extended south to NY27 (Conduit Avenue) and the Belt Parkway, or to the Nassau <b>Expressway</b> and Rockaway Boulevard, in Laurelton near JFK Airport. Later plans had the Clearview ending farther east, intersecting with the Belt Parkway at its interchange with the Southern State Parkway. A 1968 proposal from the Regional Plan Association had the Clearview extension running southeast along 212th Street/Hollis Court Boulevard and Hempstead Avenue, then south along the right-of-ways of the Cross Island and Belt Parkways before ending at the Nassau <b>Expressway.</b> Ultimately, nearly all sections of I-78 between the Holland Tunnel and Hillside Avenue, including the Lower Manhattan <b>Expressway,</b> Bushwick <b>Expressway,</b> and the Clearview extension were cancelled by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971. The only portion to be constructed was the short section of the Nassau <b>Expressway</b> near JFK Airport. This resulted in the renumbering of all of I-78 north of Hillside Avenue to I-295 on January 1, 1970.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street <b>Expressway</b> was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill <b>Expressway</b> to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street <b>Expressway</b> was opened from the Schuylkill <b>Expressway</b> to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction.
