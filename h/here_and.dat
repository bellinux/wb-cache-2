5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of NY18's routing {{south of the}} village of Lewiston was incorporated into the U.S. Highway System in the early 1930s after US62 and US219 were extended into New York and US104 was assigned. NY18 now began concurrent to US219 at the state line and overlapped the route northward {{to the city of}} Salamanca. US219 left NY18 <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> the latter continued independently to the town of Dayton, where it intersected US62. From there, US62 followed NY18 north to a junction with US104 (Main Street) in Niagara Falls. US62 ended <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> NY18 became concurrent to US104 upon turning onto Main Street. The overlap ended in the village of Lewiston, where US104 turned east to follow Ridge Road instead.|$|E
