25|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> of {{a regular}} hexagon (one where all sides and all angles are equal) are all 120degrees.|$|E
25|$|The inverse {{trigonometric}} functions {{can be used}} to calculate the <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> for a right angled triangle with the length of any two sides.|$|E
5000|$|The {{square of}} each <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> {{bisector}} of an integer triangle is rational, because the general triangle formula for the <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> bisector of angle A is [...] where s is the semiperimeter (and likewise {{for the other}} angles' bisectors).|$|R
50|$|Every <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> is {{strictly}} less than 180 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Every <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> is {{less than}} or equal to 180 degrees.|$|R
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a {{triangle}} is supplementary to the third, because {{the sum of}} <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> of {{a triangle}} is a straight angle.|$|E
25|$|If {{and only}} if one pair of <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> of two triangles have the same measure as each other, and another pair also have the same measure as each other, the triangles are similar.|$|E
25|$|While the {{measures}} of the <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> in planar triangles always sum to 180°, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180°, and a spherical triangle has measures of angles that sum to more than 180°. A hyperbolic triangle {{can be obtained by}} drawing on a negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface, and a spherical triangle can be obtained by drawing on a positively curved surface such as a sphere. Thus, if one draws a giant triangle {{on the surface of the}} Earth, one will find that the sum of {{the measures}} of its angles is greater than 180°; in fact it will be between 180° and 540°. In particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> is equal to 90°, adding up to a total of 270°.|$|E

50|$|No two non-congruent triangles {{share the}} same set of three <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> {{bisector}} lengths.|$|R
25|$|One way {{in which}} {{elliptic}} geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that {{the sum of the}} interior angles of a triangle is greater than 180degrees. In the spherical model, for example, a triangle can be constructed with vertices at the locations where the three positive Cartesian coordinate axes intersect the sphere, and all three of its <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> are 90degrees, summing to 270degrees. For sufficiently small triangles, the excess over 180degrees can be made arbitrarily small.|$|E
2500|$|For {{edge-to-edge}} Euclidean tilings, the <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> of the polygons {{meeting at}} a vertex must add to 360 degrees. A regular -gon has internal angle [...] degrees. There are seventeen combinations of regular polygons whose <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> {{add up to}} 360 degrees, each being {{referred to as a}} species of vertex; in four cases there are two distinct cyclic orders of the polygons, yielding twenty-one types of vertex.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Aquinas {{advanced}} {{a version}} of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in Summa contra Gentiles: ...|$|E

50|$|For a convex {{equiangular}} n-gon each <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> is 180(1-2/n)°; {{this is the}} equiangular polygon theorem.|$|R
2500|$|Complementary angles are angle pairs whose {{measures}} sum to {{one right}} angle ( [...] turn, 90°, or [...] radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because {{the sum of}} <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> of a triangle is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.|$|E
2500|$|Descartes {{separates}} external objects {{into those}} that are clear and distinct and {{those that are}} confused and obscure. [...] The former group consists of the ideas of extension, duration and movement. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined {{in a way that makes}} them false. [...] For example, if the idea of a creature with the head of a giraffe, the body of a lion and tail of a beaver was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, the answer would have to be invented. But, no mathematical re-arrangement of a triangle could allow its three <b>internal</b> <b>angles</b> to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. (In Descartes' formulation, this is a mathematical truth only pragmatically related to nature; the properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry remain mathematically certain) ...|$|E

The one is, of those trifling propositions which have a certainty in them, {{but it is only}} a verbal certainty, but not instructive. And, secondly, we can know the truth, and so may be certain in propositions, which affirm something of another, which is a necessary consequence of its precise complex idea, but not contained in it: as that, the external angle of all triangles is bigger than either of the opposite <b>internal</b> <b>angles.</b> Which relation of the outward angle to either of the opposite <b>internal</b> <b>angles,</b> making no part of the complex idea signified by the name triangle, this is a real truth, and conveys with it instructive real knowledge.|$|E
