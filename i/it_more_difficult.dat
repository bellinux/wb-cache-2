5|$|Haas and Creamer {{were cleared}} of the {{plagiarism}} charge by their institutions. The Chicago Field Museum of Natural History’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers. The dispute remains heated. Scholars have concerns {{that it could}} make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for United States archaeologists to gain permission to work in Peru.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|López {{was born}} on September 21, 1948 in Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico, to Aurelio López Hernández of Veracruz and Félix Rios Torres of Tecamachalco. He grew up with five siblings. In his youth, López enjoyed both soccer and {{baseball}} but chose to pursue the latter, which was in its peak in Mexico; he found <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to locate practice facilities for soccer. He studied public administration at the Autonomous University of Puebla.|$|E

5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for squirrels {{to get at the}} seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
5|$|The violent {{removal of}} the Hébertists and Dantonists {{provided}} only a mirage of stability. Their deaths caused deep resentment in the Convention, and their absence only made <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Jacobins to influence the dangerously unpredictable masses of sans-culottes. The elimination of the popular demagogues and the consequent loss of support in the streets would prove disastrous for Saint-Just and Robespierre during the events of Thermidor.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, {{according to the}} rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined {{the boundaries of the}} region's tribes.|$|E

5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the dressing rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which made <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking {{behind one of the}} goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E
5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears makes <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E

5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed to make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} {{almost as}} rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 made <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, {{it was close to}} zero.|$|E
5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
