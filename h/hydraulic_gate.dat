40|$|Hydraulic {{structures}} that {{are surrounded by}} flowing water can experience undesirable Flow-Induced Vibrations. These vibrations {{have a record of}} negative consequences. The most important cause of vibrations is self-excitation. This is a mechanism in which the forces acting on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate</b> are amplified by the movement of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate</b> itself which then further increases the vibration intensity. This mechanism potentially results in structural failure of hydraulic gates. Therefore, prevention of this type of excitations should be priority number one in the design stage of hydraulic gates One of the vertical self-excitation mechanisms is the galloping-type vibration and is addressed in this thesis. In this research the possible occurrence of galloping-type vibrations of a dynamic one degree of freedom system is simulated. CFD computations were used to obtain a force matrix that served as an input for the simulation of vertical vibrations of the one degree of freedom system. This research has shown that the force matrix, obtained using CFD software, can used to derive the hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to flow and hydrodynamic stiffness coefficients due to flow and buoyancy for a range of combinations of opening heights and accompanying vertical velocities of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate.</b> The damping coefficient that was required to obtain a fully stable situation for all initial opening heights complied with the results found by determining the negative hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to flow. Therefore, this research has shown that the stability to galloping-type vibrations and the required external damping coefficient can be derived from the force matrix obtained using CFD. The research performed has shown that the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate,</b> designed as an FRP laminate experienced roughly twice as high negative hydrodynamic damping values than a typical steel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate</b> consisting of a plate stiffened with ribs. This means that the FRP laminate requires twice as much external damping to neutralise the significantly higher negative hydrodynamic damping due to flow. The steel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate</b> experiences a larger range of negative hydrodynamic damping albeit with much lower negative hydrodynamic damping coefficients than the FRP laminate <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate.</b> Concluding this research, results show that FRP hydraulic gates are more susceptible to galloping-type vibrations than traditional steel hydraulic gates, meaning that either the design of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate</b> has to be altered or much more external damping, in this case twice as much, is required to compensate for the negative hydrodynamic damping due to flow, with respect to steel hydraulic gates.

Results were obtained thorough the coupling of Monte Carlo simulation with the response surface method. First of all, there is a brief introduction of used methodology, scope of input data and description of basic variables. For the numerical experiment of Moste dam TNO Diana finite element program was used to obtain displacements and stress components. Based {{on the results of}} numerical experiment approximate response surfaces were formed. The response surface method is a powerful reliability method that approximates the response function with a polynomial expression using the values of the function at specific points. Actual response function was then replaced by approximate response in the Monte Carlo simulation. The finite element model of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gate</b> on the Moste dam was developed using Radimpex Tower 6. Basic variables values for both this model and model of the dam were formed {{on the basis of a}} real measured data. The influence of the thickness of reinforcements on the value of displacement of the gate was considered. By doing so, the possibility of use of this method in a process of structure optimisation was shown. Finally, a response surface method was used for additional interpretation of laboratory measurements of the standing wave for water sports. We determined the probability of occurrence of certain wave height depending on the discharge. At the end the response surface method was presented as a powerful tool for analysis of broad variety of challenges in hydraulics and civil engineering...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study {{is combined with}} numerical modelling to investigate new ways to reduce cross-flow vibrations of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gates</b> with underflow. A rectangular gate section placed in a flume was given freedom to vibrate in the vertical direction. Horizontal slots in the gate bottom enabled leakage flow through the gate to enter the area directly under the gate which is known to {{play a key role}} in most excitation mechanisms. For submerged discharge conditions with small gate openings the vertical dynamic support force was measured in the reduced velocity range 1. 5 <Vr< 10. 5 for a gate with and without ventilation slots. The leakage flow significantly reduced vibrations. This attenuation was most profound in the high stiffness region at 2 <Vr< 3. 5. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed with the Finite Element Method to assess local velocities and pressures for both gate types. A moving mesh covering both solid and fluid domain allowed free gate movement and two-way fluid–structure interactions. Modelling assumptions and observed numerical effects are discussed and quantified. The simulated added mass in still water is shown to be close to experimental values. The spring stiffness and mass factor were varied to achieve similar response frequencies at the same dry natural frequencies as in the experiment. Although it was not possible to reproduce the vibrations dominated by impinging leading edge vortices (ILEV) at relatively low Vr, the simulations at high Vr showed strong vibrations with movement-induced excitation (MIE). For the latter case, the simulated response reduction of the ventilated gate agrees with the experimental results. The numerical modelling results suggest that the leakage flow diminishes pressure fluctuations close to the trailing edge associated with entrainment from the wake into the recirculation zone directly under the gate that most likely cause the growing oscillations of the ordinary rectangular gate...|$|R
