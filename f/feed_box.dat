40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{now under}} {{commissioning}} at CERN is a 26. 7 km collider based on several thousand high-field superconducting magnets, {{the majority of}} which operating in superfluid helium below 2 K and some isolated magnets operating in normal helium at 4. 5 K. Four superconducting links (DSLs) of about 76 m in length and one of about 517 m in length, were designed, constructed and installed over a three year period. Their purpose is to transport current over long distances whenever underground LHC space constraints prevents to put power converters, current <b>feed</b> <b>boxes</b> and magnets in each others’ proximity. The four 76 m long DSLs transport current between current <b>feed</b> <b>boxes</b> {{and several of the}} isolated magnets, whereas the 517 m long DSL transports current between two current <b>feed</b> <b>boxes.</b> The links are comprised of cryogenic, vacuum-insulated, transfer lines housing one or more superconducting cables.

5000|$|The Sterling submachine gun is {{constructed}} entirely {{of steel and}} plastic and has a shoulder stock, which folds underneath the weapon. There is an adjustable rear-sight, which can be flipped between 100 and 200 yard settings. Although of conventional blowback design firing from an open bolt, there are some unusual features: for example, the bolt has helical grooves cut into the surface to remove dirt and fouling {{from the inside of}} the receiver to increase reliability. There are two concentric recoil springs which cycle the bolt, as opposed to the single spring arrangement used by many other SMG designs. This double-spring arrangement significantly reduces [...] "bolt-bounce" [...] when cartridges are chambered, resulting in better obturation, smoother recoil and increased accuracy. Additionally, the Sterling uses a much-improved (over the Sten) 34-round curved double-column <b>feed</b> <b>box</b> magazine, which is inserted into {{the left side of the}} receiver. The magazine follower, which pushes the cartridges into the feed port, is equipped with rollers to reduce friction. The bolt feeds ammunition alternately from the top and bottom of the magazine lips, and its fixed firing pin is designed so that it does not line up with the primer in the cartridge until the cartridge has entered the chamber.|$|E

The seams {{in the body of}} the wagon were stuffed with tar to protect them from leaking while crossing rivers. Also for protection against bad weather, stretched across the wagon was a tough white canvas cover. The frame and suspension were made of wood, and the wheels were often iron rimmed for greater durability. Water barrels were built on the side of the wagon, toolboxes held tools needed for repair, and a <b>feed</b> <b>box</b> on the back of the wagon was used to feed the horses. The early freight wagon was not intended to be ridden upon. The wagon had a brake handle on the left side between the two wheels and a teamster either walked beside the wagon or could ride standing (and could sit for a rough ride) on a pull-out board, called a lazy board, that provided access to the brake handle.

40|$|This study {{hypothesized}} that permanently frustrated, appetitive-foraging behavior caused the stereotypic pacing regularly observed in captive carnivores. Using 2 adult female snow leopards (Uncia uncia), solitarily {{housed in the}} Zurich Zoo, the study tested this hypothesis experimentally with a novel feeding method: electronically controlled, time-regulated <b>feeding</b> <b>boxes.</b> The expected result of employing this ac-tive foraging device as a successful coping strategy was reduced behavioral and phys-iological measures of stress, compared with a control-feeding regime without <b>feeding</b> <b>boxes.</b> The study assessed this through behavioral observations and by evaluating glucocorticoid levels noninvasively from feces. Results indicated that the 2 snow leopards did not perform successful coping behavior through exercising active forag-ing behavior or through displaying the stereotypic pacing. The data support a possible explanation: The box-feeding method did not provide the 2 snow leopards with the external stimuli to satisfy their appetitive behavioral needs. Moreover, numerous other factors not necessarily or exclusively related to appetitive behavior could have caused and influenced the stereotypic pacing. Many types of stereotypy appear to be environmentally induced, presumably de-veloping in aversive situations involving lack of control, conflict, or frustration (Mason, 1991).

Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) are ideal models among anthropoids to study the information used during foraging at low light levels because they are unique by having a nocturnal lifestyle. Six Aotus nigriceps and four A. infulatus individuals distributed into five enclosures were studied for testing their ability to rely on olfactory, visual, auditory, or spatial and quantitative information for locating food rewards and for evaluating the use of routes to navigate among five visually similar artificial <b>feeding</b> <b>boxes</b> mounted in each enclosure. During most experiments only a single box was baited with a food reward in each session. The baited box changed randomly throughout the experiment. In the spatial and quantitative information experiment there were two baited boxes varying {{in the amount of}} food provided. These baited boxes remained the same throughout the experiment. A total of 45 sessions (three sessions per night during 15 consecutive nights) per enclosure was conducted in each experiment. Only one female showed a performance suggestive of learning of the usefulness of sight to locate the food reward in the visual information experiment.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{vibration}} on different engineering thermoplastic (Polyurethane Polyamide, Polyformaldehyde) and Constructional steel gear materials has been studied. The major parameters used in the research are the depth of cut and spindle speed. The depth of cut is varied while the spindle speed is kept constant for every gear material. The depth of cut used in this experiment are (0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00) mm. The cutting tool vibrations are measured by using measured using Piezoelectric Accelerometer model KB 12 and recorded for the four spindle speeds (360, 720, 1080, 1440) rev/min for the various gear materials of the <b>feed</b> <b>box.</b> The graphs are plotted between the cutting tool vibrations along y-coordinate and spindle speed along x-coordinate for different gear materials along with constructional steel gear as a reference.
