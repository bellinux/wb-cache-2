5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{tactical}} battle Liverpool {{were able to}} score in the 81st minute. A throw-in from Ray Kennedy found Alan Kennedy, whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught Real off-guard. Kennedy went past Real defender Rafael García Cortés <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> box, his subsequent shot beat the Real goalkeeper to give Liverpool the lead. Soon afterwards Liverpool replaced Dalglish with midfielder Jimmy Case {{in an attempt to}} see out the match. Although Liverpool had chances to extend their lead as Real went all out to score, Real keeper Agustín Rodríguez made a number of saves to keep his team in the game. The score remained 1–0 and Liverpool won their third European Cup, the first British club to do so. Liverpool's victory meant that Bob Paisley became the first manager to win the European Cup three times.|$|E

The performers wore prosthetics to make their characters resemble their cartoon counterparts-- mostly head pieces, but a full body suit in the cases of Buford and Perry. The 2011-2012 season of the tour began on August 21, 2011 in Lakeland, Florida and ended on April 22, 2012 in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

25|$|The late 1960s and the 1970s {{witnessed}} {{a reversal of}} the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> causes.|$|E

40|$|By the Riesz {{representation}} theorem {{using the}} Riemann-Stieltjes integral, linear continuous functionals {{on the set}} of continuous functions from <b>the</b> unit interval <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> can either be characterized by functions of bounded variation from <b>the</b> unit interval <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals,</b> or by signed measures on the Borel-subsets. Each of these objects has an (even minimal) Jordan decomposition into non-negative or non-decreasing objects. Using the representation approach to computable analysis, a computable version of the Riesz representation theorem has been proved by Jafarikhah, Lu and Weihrauch. In this article we extend this result. We study the computable relation between three Banach spaces, the space of linear continuous functionals with operator norm, the space of (normalized) functions of bounded variation with total variation norm, and the space of bounded signed Borel measures with variation norm. We introduce natural representations for defining computability. We prove that the canonical linear bijections between these spaces and their inverses are computable. We also prove that Jordan decomposition is computable on each of these spaces...|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed critical reviews, with [...] "Tweenlight" [...] generally being {{regarded as}} the best segment. John Griffiths of Us Weekly gave the episode three stars, writing that [...] "the three oddball tales run from mildly amusing to flat-out inspired. In one goofy vignette, Homer and a bikini-wearing Marge pluck a scary mystery man from the sea. However, watching Lisa crush on a brooding vampire in a dead-on poke at Twilight is the hilarious treat here." [...] Fred Topel of Screen Junkies wrote, [...] "The best jokes in all the segments are actually not the spoofs. They’re the cartoon physical comedy, the references to mundane frustrations like having to be the thimble when playing Monopoly. It’s also super gory. [...] I think “The Simpsons” {{are still on the}} creative upswing since The Simpsons Movie and this “Treehouse of Horrors” would hold up with classics like [...] "The Shinning" [...] and [...] "The Homega Man." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt {{that it was one of}} the best Treehouse of Horrors in years. He wrote, [...] "Of the three vignettes, the first segment 'War and Pieces,' while not the best, was the most original despite being a variation of the plot of 'Jumanji.' Unlike that book/movie, instead of the game coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world, the game brings other board games <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world. The satire on this show remains sharp as none of the games had the same name as their real world counterparts to prevent toy company litigation against Fox. [...] The final segment 'Tweenlight'... was the best of the three. It felt a little less dated than the first two." ...|$|E
