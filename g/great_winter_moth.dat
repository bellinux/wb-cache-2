This study characterized the forests of eastern Massachusetts invaded by <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> and related the duration of <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation estimated using dendrochronology to observed levels of tree mortality and understory woody plant density. Quercus basal area mortality in mixed Quercus and mixed Quercus—Pinus strobus forests in eastern Massachusetts ranged from 0 – 30 %; mortality of Quercus in these forests was related to site quality and the number of <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation events. In addition, <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation events lead to a subsequent increase in understory woody plant density.

40|$|Among cyclic {{populations of}} herbivores, inter-specific {{temporal}} synchrony has {{been attributed to}} both climatic factors and trophic interactions. In northern Europe, <b>winter</b> and autumnal <b>moths</b> undergo regular 9 – 11 year population cycles. The <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> cycle has typically been phase-locked with that of the autumnal moth, but with a 1 – 3 - year phase lag. We examined potential effects of natural enemies on this phase lag using field experiments and observational data. We found that larval parasitism was significantly higher in autumnal than in <b>winter</b> <b>moths.</b> Conversely, pupal predation by generalist invertebrates was clearly <b>greater</b> in <b>winter</b> than in autumnal moths. The difference in parasitism rates may contribute to the earlier collapse of the autumnal moth cycle. In addition, the phase lag may be strengthened by higher pupal mortality in <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> in the early increase phase of the cycles. As a consequence, we put forward a hypothesis on reversed effects of natural enemies, providing a potential explanation for phase-lagged population cycles of these moth species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>moth,</b> Operophtera brumata L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), {{has been}} defoliating {{hardwood}} trees in eastern Massachusetts since the 1990 s.

Using dendroecological techniques, this study related annual radial growth of individual host (Quercus spp. and Acer spp.) trees to detailed defoliation estimates. <b>Winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation was associated with up to a 47 % reduction in annual radial growth of Quercus trees. Latewood production of Quercus was reduced by up to 67 % {{in the same year}} as defoliation, while earlywood production was reduced by up to 24 % in the year following defoliation. <b>Winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation was not a strong predictor of radial growth in Acer species.

40|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> (Operophtera brumata) {{belongs to}} one of the most species-rich {{families}} in Lepidoptera, the Geometridae (approx. 23, 000 species). This family is of great economic importance as most species are herbivorous and capable of defoliating trees. Genome assembly of the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> allows the study of genes and gene families, such as the cytochrome P 450 gene family, which is known to be vital in plant secondary metabolite detoxification and host plant selection. It also enables exploration of the genomic basis for female brachyptery (wing reduction), a feature of sexual dimorphism in <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> and for seasonal timing, a trait extensively studied in this species. Here we present a reference genome for the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> the first geometrid and largest sequenced Lepidopteran genome to date (638 Mb) including a set of 16, 912 predicted protein-coding genes. This allowed us to assess the dynamics of evolution on a genome wide scale using the P 450 gene family. We also identified an expanded gene family potentially linked to female brachyptery, and annotated the genes involved in the circadian clock mechanism as main candidates for involvement in seasonal timing. The genome will contribute to Lepidopteran genomic resources and comparative genomics. In addition, the genome enhances our ability to understand the genetic and molecular basis of insect seasonal timing and thereby provides a reference for future evolutionary and population studies on the <b>winter</b> <b>moth...</b>|$|R

Two species of Cypoviridae (CPV) were isolated, Operophtera brumata CPV 18 and O. brumata CPV 19, with one host population suffering 46 % infection prevalence of OpbuCPV 19.

40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between an insect's developmental rate and temperature is crucial to forecast insect phenology under climate change. In the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> Operophtera brumata timing of egg-hatching has severe fitness consequences on growth and reproduction as egg-hatching has to match bud burst of the host tree. In the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> as in many insect species, egg development is strongly affected by ambient temperatures. Here we use laboratory experiments to show {{for the first time}} that the effect of temperature on developmental rate depends on the stage of development of the eggs. Building on this experimental finding, we present a novel physiological model to describe <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> egg development in response to temperature. Our model, a modification of the existing Sharpe−Schoolfield biophysical model, incorporates the effect of developmental stage on developmental rate. Next we validate this model using a 13 -year data-set from <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> eggs kept under ambient conditions and compared this validation with a degree day model and with the Sharpe−Schoolfield model, which lacks the interaction between temperature and developmental stage on developmental rate. We show that accounting for the interaction between temperature and developmental stage improved the predictive power of the model and contributed to our understanding of annual variation in <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> egg phenology. As climate change leads to unequal changes in temperatures throughout the year, a description of insect development in response to realistic patterns of temperature rather than an invariable degree-day approach will help us to better predict future responses of insect phenology, and thereby insect fitness, to climate change. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{seasonal}} environments {{the timing}} of various biological processes is crucial for growth, survival and reproductive success of an individual. Nowadays, rapid large-scale climate change is altering species’ seasonal timing (phenology) in many eco¬systems. In this thesis Lucia Salis focuses {{on the study of}} seasonal timing in the food chain of the oak-winter moth-great tit. As temperature increased over the last decades, both phenologies of the host plant, the oak, and the herbivorous insect, the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> have advanced. However, timing of egg-hatching in the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> has advanced more than the oak bud burst leading to the phenological mismatch and increased selection for later egg-hatching. In turn, {{as a result of the}} earlier phenology of the insects, a phenological mismatch has occurred between the great tit offspring’s food demand and the peak in caterpillars’ biomass, leading to enhanced selection for earlier egg-laying on the birds. The work presented in this thesis show that <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> have adapted to warmer temperatures via microevolutionary shift in timing of egg-hatching. Next, the influence of temperature and photoperiod on the phenology of the entire life-cycle in the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> and {{the timing of}} reproduction in the great tit is investigated. Finally, this research deepens our understanding of the mechanisms underlying seasonal timing and ultimately forecast the rate of adaptation to changing conditions...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{unresolved}} {{questions in}} studies on population dynamics of forest Lepidoptera is why some populations at times reach outbreak densities, whereas others never do. Resolving {{this question is}} especially challenging if populations {{of the same species}} in different areas or of closely-related species in the same area are considered. The present study focused on three closely-related geometrid moth species, autumnal Epirrita autumnata, winter Operophtera brumata and northern <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> Operophtera fagata, in southern Finland. There, winter and northern <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> populations can reach outbreak densities, whereas autumnal moth densities stay relatively low. We tested the hypothesis that a lower vulnerability to pupal predation may explain the observed differences in population dynamics. The results obtained do not support this hypothesis because pupal predation probabilities were not significantly different between the two genera within or without the Operophtera outbreak area or in years with or without a current Operophtera outbreak. Overall, pupal predation was even higher in winter and northern <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> than in autumnal moths.

We believe this approach is deeply flawed. Using Varley and Gradwell’s <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> study, we show that the problems with Hunter’s analysis lie in his misinterpretation of the population dynamics and his inappropriate use of statistical techniques. We also emphasize the importance of distinguishing clearly between two quite different things: firstly, top-down and bottom-up regulation of populations and secondly, the much simpler task of categorizing factors affecting changes in population density as either top-down or bottom-up processes...|$|R

A fatty-acyl-CoA desaturase gene that we found to be expressed in the abdominal epidermal tissue, the presumed site of biosynthesis for type II pheromones, was characterized and expressed heterologously in a yeast system.

40|$|Cyclic {{outbreaks}} of forest moth pest species have long remained a puzzle for foresters and ecologists.

In the latter area, also the population level of a moth species feeding entirely on lichens was negatively related to sunspot numbers. Low sunspot activity leads to a thinner ozone layer and thus higher surface ultraviolet (UV) -B radiation. As <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> larvae prefer leaves subjected to enhanced UV-B radiation, we suggest that the causal relationship between sunspots and moths is that the metabolic costs of producing UV-B-protective pigments during periods of low sunspot activity reduce trees' and lichens' resistance to herbivores, and thus increase the survival of moth larvae. Higher peak densities of moth cycles in mountain forests {{could be explained by}} the general higher UV-B radiation at higher altitudes...|$|R

40|$|To {{maximise}} their fitness, organisms need to synchronise their phenology {{with the}} seasonal variation in environmental conditions. Most phenological traits {{are affected by}} environmental abiotic cues such as photoperiod, temperature and rainfall. When individuals with complex life cycles fail to match one of the stages with the favourable environment, the negative conditions experienced may lead to carry-over effects and, thus, influence fitness in subsequent stages. In the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> an herbivorous insect with an annual life cycle, timing of egg-hatching in spring is strongly influenced by temperature and varies from year to year. To investigate whether the phenological variation in egg-hatching date affects subsequent stages, we analysed data on egg-hatching date and adult catching date (considered here to be a proxy for adult eclosion date) from our long-term study (1994 – 2014). Furthermore, we experimentally manipulated the photoperiod experienced by newly hatched larvae and recorded the phenology of their subsequent life cycle stages. In the long-term field study, {{we found that the}} timing of <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> egg-hatching in spring varied strongly from year to year. Interestingly, however, the timing of adult eclosion date in winter showed little inter-annual variation. In line with these findings, our experimental data showed that the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> shortened the duration of their pupal development when they experienced a late spring photoperiod as a larva, and prolonged pupal development when experiencing early spring photoperiod. The effects of the larval photoperiodic treatments persisted during egg development in the following generation. The results show that a phenological shift that occurs during an early life stage is partially compensated during subsequent stages and suggest that the mechanism underlying this compensation is mediated by photoperiod. <b>Winter</b> <b>moths</b> regulated their phenology {{in such a way that}} the variation in the egg-hatching stage was not carried over to the next life cycle stages. This has strong effects on fitness as it (1) ensures the synchronisation of adult eclosion during the mating period and (2) is likely to reduce potentially negative fitness consequences of phenological mismatches in egg-hatching in the following generation. Overall, these findings stress the importance of understanding phenological carry-over effects to forecast the impact of global change in species with complex life cycles...|$|R
