40|$|Abstract The water Savonius rotor is {{classified}} as a vertical axis water rotor like the Darrieus, <b>Gyromill</b> or H-rotor. The advancing blade with concave side facing the water flow would experience more drag force than the returning blade, thus forcing the rotor to rotate. In this work, we are interested {{on the study of}} the of the internal overlap effect of a water Savonius rotor. The experimental results is developed using a hydraulic test bench. The test bench consists on an intake, a control gate, a penstock, a canalization, a test section, an outflow and a pump. A detailed description of the global characteristics is presented such as power, dynamic torque, power and its coefficients...|$|E
