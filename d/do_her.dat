5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as <b>do</b> <b>her</b> letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater {{built in}} {{what was to be}} the Yiddish Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first {{purpose-built}} Yiddish theater in New York. His wife Sara had branched out to <b>do</b> <b>her</b> own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with an elevator, in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside Drive.) Around this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that Yiddish theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.|$|E

Altman allows Yang {{to come up with a}} wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to <b>do</b> <b>her</b> job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

5|$|Giles' dream {{presents}} a choice: either {{to remain a}} father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented {{by the presence of}} his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to <b>do</b> <b>her</b> job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only <b>do</b> <b>her</b> vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} {{that men have}} been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as they usually <b>do.</b> <b>Her</b> friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon).

5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will <b>do</b> <b>her</b> bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E

25|$|By 1871, Whistler {{returned}} to portraits and soon produced {{his most famous}} painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1, but usually (and incorrectly) referred to as Whistler's Mother. A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned {{to his mother and}} suggested that he <b>do</b> <b>her</b> portrait. In his typically slow and experimental way, at first he had her stand, but that proved too tiring so the famous seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.|$|E

Also, Marguerite served as a mediator between Roman Catholics and Protestants (including John Calvin). Although Marguerite espoused reform within the Catholic Church, {{she was not a}} Calvinist.

25|$|Although Artemis tried {{diligently}} {{to distinguish}} herself from her predecessor in both New York City and Boston, this {{proved to be}} rather hard to <b>do.</b> <b>Her</b> approach to various situations were often seen as more violent than beneficial. Because of this, and due to Man's World's respect of Diana, Artemis often would receive the cold shoulder from those she tried to help, extending even to her brief time in the Justice League. Superman once commented to Diana that Batman refused to allow Artemis to sit in Diana's chair during Justice League meetings. Diana's twin sister Donna Troy even showed resentment toward Artemis carrying the Wonder Woman title, which caused their first meeting to escalate into a heated argument.|$|E
