40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} regarding tribological characteristics of composite {{tops of the}} electrodes for spot welding. The solution aims to improve the resistance to deformation and high intensity <b>electric</b> current <b>conductibility</b> without loses and excessive local heating. The composite material was obtained by mechanical alloying process, from a mixture of tungsten carbide, chromium, CuNiAl alloy and cooper powder which has been heated in furnace at 1100 oC. The embedding process aims to avoid the toxic effects of metallic elements such as Be and Zr, which are usually introduced in cupper alloys for improving the mechanical characteristics. The tribological characteristics and microhardness of the melted zone were measured in order to estimate the strengthening effect obtained by the tungsten carbide presence for different mixture recipe...|$|R

Electron beam {{selective}} melting (EBSM) has many advantages for the titanium alloy parts manufactured, therefore, the material characteristics, scanning methods and the tensile properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V by EBSM are studied in this paper. Aimed {{at the lower}} density, poorer <b>electric</b> and heat <b>conductibility</b> of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, three scanning paths have been developed: reverse scanning, interlaced reverse and orthogonal scanning, and the surface of forming part made by the above three scanning methods is smooth and no bulge.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present the results of the {{investigation}} for the surface waters pollution with different ions, Ph, <b>electric</b> <b>conductibility</b> and organic substances from Smithfield-Periam swine breeding complex. Concentrations of magnesium, sulphates, sodium and potassium are situated under the limits accepted for the first class of the surface waters in the new system of cleaning. Electric conductivity values are over the limits accepted by STAS for the surface waters in the old cleaning system and framed in standard limits in the new wastewaters cleaning system. Ph of the analyzed wastewaters is framed in the standard of the surface waters for both cleaning wastewaters systems. With the exception of organic substances, the new system of wastewaters cleaning used in the Smithfield–Periam swine farm is better and in the same is avoiding the pollution for surface waters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The coupled magneto-thermal {{problem is}} analyzed, with {{reference}} to a particular heating applica-tion, {{by means of an}} equivalent thermal network, that is based on a first-approximation interpretation of the field equations. The connections between the thermal characteristics and the magnetic ones are taking into ac-count by considering the skin-effect and the dependence of <b>electric</b> <b>conductibility</b> on the temperature. Also the dependence of the produced heat – by Joule effect – on frequency is taken into account. A specific and straightforward applicative case is analyzed in order to underline the validity and the advantages of the proposed model. A single conductive loop is lighting by an impressed perpendicular magnetic field and both the forward and inverse problems are analyzed. An integration technique, based on Matlab-Simulink, is shown for the solution of the problem. Moreover, the dependence of the achieved results on the geometric characteristics of the analyzed system is studied...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{series of}} Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Cd(II) {{complexes}} have been synthesized from the Schiff base. Structural features {{were determined by}} analytical and spectral techniques like IR, 1 H NMR, UV–vis, elemental analysis, molar <b>electric</b> <b>conductibility,</b> magnetic susceptibility and thermal studies. The complexes {{are found to be}} soluble in dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. Molar conductance values in dimethylformamide indicate the non-electrolytic nature of the complexes. Binding of synthesized complexes with calf thymus DNA (CT DNA) was studied. There is significant binding of DNA in lanes 2, 3, and 5. Lanes 4 and 6 are showing more florescence when compared to the control indicating that these molecules are strongly bound to the DNA by inserting themselves between the two stacked base pairs and exhibiting their original property of fluorescence. Angiogenesis study has revealed that the compounds B- 2, B- 4 and B- 5 have potent antitumor efficacy and activation of antiangiogenesis {{could be one of the}} possible underlying mechanisms of tumor inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) is an {{attractive}} subtractive method for complex 3 d structurization of hard and very hard conductive and semi-conductive materials. The machining capabilities of a material do not depend on its hardness but on its <b>electric</b> <b>conductibility</b> and its melting point. The absence of any mechanical interaction between tool (the electrode) and machined part makes the electroerosion a well-adapted process for micro-structurization. In the passage from the macro to the micro-electroerosion (µEDM), some {{of the elements of}} the machine have to be adapted in order to improve the performances and to obtain accurate movements. The goal is to manufacture millimeters-sized shapes with an accuracy of a hundred of nanometers. This thesis deals the problem of the µEDM with a three degrees of freedom (DOF) mechanism, based on a parallel kinematics and flexure joints (the Delta 3 robot). In addition to its high accuracy (5 nm) and high bandwidth (500 Hz), the Delta 3 robot has the particularity of being free of backlash, wear and stick-slip phenomena. These performances have allowed to verify the importance of the time constants in the servo loop of the process, by many experiences of micro-drilling. Simulations have demonstrated the advantages brought by the dynamic, in the improvement of the µEDM process. Bad flushing conditions and very small gaps (< 10 µm), generate elevated gradients of contamination, to which the frequency response of the machine must be adapted. Simulations have shown that the balance between the material removal rate and the evacuation rate can be improved by adjusting the electrode-part distance at a frequency of a few hundreds of hertz. These back and forth movements have to be fast and accurate: first, to adjust quickly and precisely the breaking voltage distance and second, to guarantee a good machining accuracy. An industrial version of the prototype finalized during this thesis will be commercialized soon by AGIE (the company that supported this work) ...|$|E
40|$|Mt. Vulture volcano {{is located}} in the most {{external}} part of the Apennine orogene (southern Italy), almost {{at the edge of the}} Apulian foreland. The volcanic activity occurred up to 130 Kyrs ago. The volcano is formed by a main feldspar-bearing series of pyroclastic rocks and subordinate lava flows, ranging in composition from basanite and foidite to phonolites (Schiattarella et al., 2005). Rare lava flows and dykes, with distinctly more silica-undersaturated composition melilitites, melilite ankaratrites, and the ‘Melfi’ haüynophyre, were also emplaced. Carbonatite-melilite magmas fed the final phase of volcanism producing maar-type craters. The large Na and S contents of the Vulture magmas (Marini et al., 1994) result in the the widespread presence of sodalite-group phases among the feldespathoids (De Fino et al., 1982; Di Muro et al., 2004). Most groundwaters are characterized by gas bubbling. In order to investigate the origin of solutes a total of 25 springs and wells were analyzed for the major and minor element contents, the isotopic composition of carbon in the total dissolved carbon (TDC) and sulfur in the aqueous sulfate. The chemical data suggest that the effects due to water-rock interaction are largely controlled by the input of CO 2. The dissolution of CO 2 in the water causes a substantial increase in its acidity, thus promoting the alteration of the rocks. Good correlations exist among alkalinity, <b>electric</b> <b>conductibility</b> and Na +, Ca 2 +, SO 4 2 - concentrations. The alkaline-earthbicarbonate and alkaline-bicarbonate compositions of the waters are in keeping with the major role played by CO 2 in the alteration processes. The G 13 C values of TDC corroborate the involvement of two carbon sources. The first one is biogenic CO 2, while the second one is magmatic. The G 34 S values of SO 4 2 - are all positive and similar to those measured by Marini et al. (1994) in the haüynophyre magma, thus supporting for aqueous sulfate a main origin from leaching of volcanites. In few springs, however, some contribution of SO 4 2 - from dissolution of Triassic evaporite at depth cannot be excluded...|$|E
