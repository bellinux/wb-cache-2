O objetivo desse trabalho é identificar e analisar as principais estratégias de internacionalização da Petrobras, no segmento de abastecimento (Downstream), no período pós-quebra do monopólio, cujo foco direciona-se a dois países sul-americanos: Bolívia e Argentina. Para tanto, foi realizada uma pesquisa de abordagem qualitativa exploratória, caracterizando-se como um estudo de caso. Os dados foram coletados por meio de dois questionários: um de cunho estratégico, aplicado junto a cinco executivos da alta administração da área internacional da Petrobras e outro de caráter geral, aplicado a quinze executivos e técnicos da empresa, com o propósito de aprofundar o conhecimento, a respeito das opiniões e crenças dos profissionais, em relação ao processo de internacionalização. Os resultados mostram que, após a quebra do monopólio do setor petróleo e com a perspectiva de enfrentar a concorrência de outras empresas no mercado brasileiro, a alternativa encontrada pela Petrobras, no segmento analisado, foi a de expandir seus negócios no exterior, principalmente na América Latina, onde as vantagens logísticas, a integração dos mercados e a oportunidade de poder atuar como uma companhia integrada de petróleo foram fatores determinantes de sucesso. Em linhas gerais, a entrada no mercado internacional trouxe benefícios para a Petrobras, principalmente pela redução do custo de capital, o que alavancou o valor da marca, das ações e da empresa, impactados também pelo aumento da produtividade, da rentabilidade e pela expansão dos negócios. The {{market globalization}} has compelled the companies {{to consider the}} expansion of their businesses via internationalization process and, for that purpose, {{it is essential that}} companies are able to identify the best strategies to obtain a sustainable position, vis-a-vis the competition. The objective of this work is to identify and analyse the main internationalization strategies applied by PETROBRAS in the downstream segment, after the monopoly rupture and focusing two South American countries: Bolivia and Argentina. For that purpose, a research of a qualitative exploratory nature was conducted, characterized as a case study. The data was collected by means of two questionnaires: one of an strategic nature, submitted to five high administration executives within PETROBRAS international area and the other, of a general nature, submitted to 15 executives and technicians, aiming at a deeper knowledge of the opinions and convictions of the professionals, in relation to the internationalization process. The results indicate that, after the monopoly rupture and with the perspective of facing the competition from other oil companies in the Brazilian market, the alternative found by PETROBRAS, in the analysed segment, was to expand their presence abroad, mainly in Latin America, where the logistics advantages, the markets integration, as well as the opportunity to act as an integrated oil company were determinant factors for sucess. In general, <b>entrying</b> the international market brought benefits to PETROBRAS, mainly due to the reduction of capital cost which, in turn, levered the value of the brand, shares and the company itself, which were equally affected by the increase in productivity, rentability and business expansion...|$|E
40|$|Tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) 是一個與癌細胞生長有關的蛋白，在癌化細胞中是處於持續活化的狀態。文獻指出利用 {{antisense}} oligonucleotides 來抑制子宮頸癌細胞中 tNOX 蛋白表現量，則癌細胞在 soft agar 上形成細胞群落 (colonies) 的能力會因而下降，另一方面在非癌化細胞中大量表現 tNOX 會使非癌化細胞具有侵犯能力 (Invasion ability) ，這些研究皆指出 tNOX 和癌化細胞的特質之間具有關聯性。 在本實驗中，利用 RNAi 干擾技術抑制轉型細胞 HEK 293 中內生性 tNOX 的表現量，以探討 tNOX 對細胞生長的影響。實驗結果得知當 tNOX 表現量降低後，會使 HEK 293 細胞生長明顯受到抑制。我們進而探討是否因為細胞死亡比例增多而導致生長速率減少，結果顯示 tNOX 表現量減少所觀察到的細胞生長受抑制的現象，並非因為誘發細胞死亡或是發生衰老。這些初步的實驗結果，使我們推測 tNOX 可能是經由調控細胞週期而影響癌化細胞的生長。 在 tNOX-siRNA knockdown HEK 293 細胞中，細胞內 ROS 的生成以及 ERK 的磷酸化都有減少的現象，而 ERK 的磷酸化和細胞週期的 G 1 時期調控有關，所以進一步分析一些參與在細胞週期 G 1 到 S 時期調控的蛋白表現量或是磷酸化的多寡。在 tNOX-siRNA knockdown HEK 293 細胞中，我們觀察到 Cyclin D 和 Cyclin A 表現量以及 p-RB 和 CDK 2 的磷酸化皆有減少的現象，另一方面， CDK inhibitor-p 21 的表現量則增加，這些變化導致細胞週期進行發生了缺失，我們並證明 tNOX 表現量的減少會使 G 1 細胞較慢進入 S 時期。 由以上實驗結果可知， tNOX 可藉由 ROS 的產生，影響 ERK 的活化，進而調控轉型細胞 HEK 293 細胞週期的進行。The Tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) is a growth-related cell-surface protein. A previous study {{has reported that}} transfection of tNOX {{antisense oligonucleotides}} results in reduction of tNOX ability to grow in soft agar in human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells. On the other hand, overexpression of tNOX in MCF- 10 A (non-cancer human mammary epithelia) cells enhances cell invasiveness, suggesting a close link between tNOX and cancer phenotypes. In this project, endogenous tNOX expression inhibited by small interfering RNA in transformed HEK 293 cells was employed to investigate the role of tNOX in regulating cell growth. As expected, cell proliferation was dramatically inhibited by tNOX-siRNA. However, the suppression in cell growth mediated by tNOX-siRNA in HEK 293 cells was not due to apoptosis induction or senescence. These results prompted us to investigate the role of tNOX in cell cycle regulation. Our results showed that tNOX-knockdown decreased ROS generation and ERK activation. In addition, we found alterations in several proteins involved in regulation of cell cycle. Decrease in expressions of Cyclin D, p-RB, Cyclin A, and p-CDK 2 were observed in tNOX-siRNA knockdown HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, tNOX-knockdown increased expression of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1, leading to a delay from G 1 phase <b>entrying</b> to S phase in HEK 293 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased tNOX by RNAi results in a delay into S phase by modulating expression of cell cycle regulators in transformed HEK 293 cells. 中文摘要…………………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅱ 目錄………………………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅲ 圖表目錄…………………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅵ 壹、緒論 一、	Tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) …………………… [...] 	 1 二、	細胞週期………………………………………………………… [...] . 	 4 三、	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 參與的訊號傳遞……………	 7 四、	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 和癌症………………………	 9 五、	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 和細胞週期…………………	 10 貳、研究動機………………………………………………………………… [...] . 12 參、實驗材料…………………………………………………………………… 13 肆、實驗方法 一、	細胞培養與繼代 (Cell culture and subculture) ……………… [...] 	 20 二、	細胞冷凍與解凍 (Cell cryopreservation and recovery) …… [...] 	 20 三、	細胞轉染 (Cell transfection) ……………………………………. 	 21 四、	臺盼藍細胞存活率分析 (Trypan blue exclusion assay) …… [...] . 	 21 五、	細胞群落形成分析（Colony forming assay）…………………. 	 22 六、	細胞分裂分析（Cell division assay）………………………… [...] 	 22 七、	細胞凋亡分析（Apoptosis assay）………………………………	 23 八、	細胞衰老分析（Senescence assay）…………………………. 	 23 九、	細胞內活性氧分子分析（Reactive oxygen species assay）…	 24 十、	細胞週期分析（Cell cycle analysis）……………………………	 24 十一、	細胞RNA萃取（RNA extraction of cells）………………………	 25 十二、	反轉錄聚合酶連鎖反應（Reverse transcription-PCR, RT-PCR）… 26 十三、	西方墨點法（Western blotting）…………………………………. 	 27 伍、實驗結果 一、	利用反轉錄聚合酶連鎖反應 (Reverse transcription-PCR, RT-PCR) 及西 方墨點法 (Western blotting) 分析 HEK 293 RNAi tNOX 細胞中 tNOX 的 RNA 和蛋白表量 [...] . 29 二、	利用 Trypan blue exclusion assay 分析 tNOX 減少對細胞生長的影響 [...] 29 三、	利用 Cell tracker（CMFDA）標記細胞分析 tNOX 減少對細胞生長的影響 [...] 30 四、	利用 Colony forming assay 分析 tNOX減少對細胞增生的影響 [...] 30 五、	分析 tNOX 減少對細胞死亡的影響 [...] . 	 31 六、	分析 tNOX 減少對細胞衰老（Senescence）的影響 [...] . 	 31 七、	分析 tNOX 減少對 ROS 產生的影響 [...] 	 32 八、	分析 tNOX 減少對 ERK 磷酸化及早期 G 1 調控的影響 [...] . 	 32 九、	分析 Early G 1 時期轉錄因子 E 2 F 所調控的下游基因表現 [...] 	 33 十、	分析調控 Late G 1 和 S 時期的 CDK 2 活性 [...] . 	 33 十一、	細胞週期 S 時期的進行 [...] 	 34 十二、	分析 S 時期各時間點的 Cyclin A 表現量 [...] . 	 35 十三、	RNAi-tNOX 細胞中重新表現 tNOX 蛋白，分析細胞生長 [...] 	 35 十四、	tNOX 對細胞週期調控之影響圖 [...] 	 36 陸、討論………………………………………………………………………… 37 柒、實驗圖表……………………………………………………………………. 41 捌、附錄…………………………………………………………………………. 60 玖、參考文獻……………………………………………………………………. 6...|$|E

When the current market is a monopoly, <b>entry</b> is considered as excessive if the social welfare under the post-entry Cournot-Nash equilibrium, net of <b>entry</b> coast, is lower than that under monopoly. However, this paper argues that, even if this is true, limiting <b>entry</b> is not an optimal choice of the benevolent government.

Therefore, an <b>entry</b> regulation which imposes <b>entry</b> condition, rather than just limiting <b>entry,</b> that the new entrant produces enough to make <b>entry</b> welfare increasing, will be an optimal regulation against excess <b>entry</b> problem.

We focus on learning effects from cumulative <b>entry</b> experience of different modes within a host market. Moreover, we investigate the dynamic process of <b>entry</b> mode switch, and how cumulative <b>entry</b> experience reduces the expansion constraint. Using a dataset of sequential <b>entries</b> by US firms in China during 1979 – 2002, {{we find that the}} impact of cumulative <b>entry</b> experience on the pace of sequential <b>entries</b> varies across different modes. Further, firms with more cumulative <b>entry</b> experience can cope with the constraint of <b>entry</b> mode switch. ...|$|R

We find that under an {{open-loop}} information structure the incumbent anticipates <b>entry</b> by overinvesting, whereas in the Markov perfect equilibrium the incumbent slightly underinvests in the period before the <b>entry.</b> The <b>entry</b> cost level where <b>entry</b> accommodation passes into <b>entry</b> deterrence is lower in the Markov perfect equilibrium. Further {{we find that the}} incumbent’s capital stock level needed to deter <b>entry</b> is hump shaped {{as a function of the}} <b>entry</b> time, whereas the corresponding <b>entry</b> cost, where the entrant is indifferent between <b>entry</b> and non-entry, is U-shaped...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} the inviscid text <b>entry</b> rate: the point when the user’s creativity is the bottleneck rather than the text <b>entry</b> method. We then apply the inviscid text <b>entry</b> rate to define a grand goal for mobile text <b>entry.</b> Via a proxy measure we estimate the population mean of the sufficiently inviscid <b>entry</b> rate to be 67 wpm. We then compare existing mobile text <b>entry</b> methods against this estimate and find {{that the vast majority of}} text <b>entry</b> methods in the literature are substantially slower. This analysis suggests the mobile text <b>entry</b> field needs to focus on methods that can viably approach the inviscid <b>entry</b> rate.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} pre-bid R&D and auctions design {{literature}} {{to an independent}} private value setting where each bidder incurs a private-information valuation discovery cost upon <b>entry.</b> The seller commits to a mechanism before the bidders' <b>entry</b> decisions. The main findings are as follows. Firstly, a second-price auction with no <b>entry</b> fee and a reserve price equal to seller's valuation is ex ante efficient. Secondly, a second price auction with the same reserve price and appropriate ex ante <b>entry</b> fees is revenue-maximizing. Every bidder's ex ante <b>entry</b> fee equals the hazard rate of his <b>entry</b> cost distribution, evaluated at the desired entry-threshold for him. Thirdly, the revenue-maximizing <b>entry</b> differs from the ex ante efficient <b>entry.</b> Fourthly, even for the symmetric setting, the ex ante efficient/revenue-maximizing <b>entry</b> could be asymmetric. Lastly, for the symmetric setting, when the cumulative distribution function of the <b>entry</b> costs changes rather slowly with respect to its argument, the efficient <b>entry</b> must be symmetric across bidders {{and it is the}} unique <b>entry</b> equilibrium of the efficient auction. If the hazard rate of the <b>entry</b> cost distribution is additionally increasing, then the revenue-maximizing <b>entry</b> must also be symmetric and it is the unique <b>entry</b> equilibrium of the revenue-maximizing auction. These results mean that large dispersion in the <b>entry</b> costs restores the symmetry in the efficient/revenue-maximizing <b>entry.</b> ...|$|R
