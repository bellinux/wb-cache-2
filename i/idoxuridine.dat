5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA <b>idoxuridine,</b> IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

50|$|Epithelial {{keratitis}} {{is treated}} with topical antivirals, {{which are very}} effective with low incidence of resistance.

50|$|The {{level of}} {{thymidine}} kinase in serum or plasma {{is so low}} that the measurement is best based on the enzymatic activity.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Due to the immuncompromised {{status of}} AIDS patients, {{secondary}} infections and malignancies are common. Conditions secondary to AIDS for which patients require treatment include Karposi's sarcoma (treated with methotrexate), varicella-zoster (treated with antivirals such as acyclovir) and herpes simplex (also treated with antivirals like acyclovir or idoxuridme). However the clinical efficacy {{of these drugs}} is limited by poor skin permeability. Few reports, however, {{have dealt with the}} delivery of low molecular weight hydrophilic drugs from these vesicles (El Maghraby et al, 2000). The aim of our study was to investigate in vitro permeation of methotrexate, acyclovir and <b>idoxuridine</b> across human epidermal membrane from elastic liposomes. The intent was to establish whether formulation of these hydrophilic drugs into elastic liposomes would enhance their skin permeation parameters. We developed and validated high-performance liquid chromatographic techniques for quantitative analysis of methotrexate, <b>idoxuridine</b> and acyclovir. Elastic liposomes were prepared from various phospholipids- phosphatidylcholine 78. 6 %; phosphatidylcholine 50 %; hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine 90 %; phosphatidylcholine 95 % and surfactants - sodium cholate, sodium deoxycholate, Span 20, 40, 60, 80. These vesicles were characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The solubilities of methotrexate, acyclovir and <b>idoxuridine</b> were determined. Phospholipon G (95 % phosphatidylcholine) was chosen for the preparation of the liposomes with different surfactants. Permeation of methotrexate, acyclovir and idoxuridme from these vesicles across human epidermal membrane was investigated. Flux values for methotrexate, acyclovir and <b>idoxuridine</b> values (J) obtained by curve-fitting of data using Easyplot were compared to those obtained by linear regression.

40|$|Assessing the {{mechanical}} behavior (elastic properties, plastic properties, and fracture phenomena) of molecular crystals is often {{complicated by the}} difficulty in preparing samples. Pharmaceuticals and energetic materials in particular are often used in composite structures or tablets, where the individual grains can strongly impact the solid behavior. Nanoindentation is a convenient method to experimentally assess these properties, and it is used here to demonstrate the similarity in {{the mechanical}} properties of two distinct systems: individual crystals of the explosive cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) and the pharmaceutical <b>idoxuridine</b> were tested in their as-precipitated state, and the effective average modulus and hardness (which can be orientation dependent) were determined. Both exhibit a hardness of 1. 0 GPa, with an effective reduced modulus of 25 and 23 GPa for the HMX and <b>idoxuridine,</b> respectively. They also exhibit similar yield point behavior.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{distinctive}} {{architecture of}} the stratum corneum with its unique nature of an interstitial lipoidal environment plays the major role in regulating the barrier function of the skin. The major problem with the transdermal delivery of 5 -fluorouracil or <b>idoxuridine</b> is the permeation of sufficient amounts to the deeper layers of the skin and into the systemic circulation. In an attempt to enhance the transdermal permeability of 5 -fluorouracil and <b>idoxuridine,</b> {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate two lamellar gel phase systems (Physiogel dermaquadrille® and Physiogel NT®) and Emzaloids® as transdermal delivery vehicles for the two actives. Lamellar gel phase systems (LGPS) and Emzaloids® are both novel drug delivery systems. The epidermis of female abdominal skin was used in vertically mounted Franz diffusion cell experiments. An average amount of 250 mg of the 1 % m/m LGPS was applied to cover the entire diffusion area of 1, 075 cm 2 of the skin, which contained 2, 5 mg of the active. Samples of the actives in Emzaloids® were prepared and applied in the same way. The control solutions of the actives in water were prepared so that 1 ml of the applied solution contained the same amount of drug that was applied to the experimental cells. The entire receptor phase of the cells was removed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours and was replaced with fresh 37 °C receptor phase. The amount of active in the receptor phase was determined by HPLC analysis. Graphs of the cumulative amount of the active that permeated the skin over the 24 hour period were drawn and the slope of the graphs represented the flux in µg/ml/h. The average flux values of six experimental cells and six control cells were compared. Entrapment of the actives in the Emzaloid® vesicles was confirmed with the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results for the LGPS indicate an enhancement ratio in the order of 4, 2 for 5 -fluorouracil and 1, 7 for <b>idoxuridine</b> when compared to the control cells. There were no viscosity changes in the LGPS samples containing 1 % m/m of the active when compared with the blank LGPS samples, suggesting that no change in the internal structure of the LGPS occurred after the addition of the actives to it. There were also no significant changes in the pH of the samples. Entrapment of the actives in the Emzaloid® vesicles occurred readily. The Emzaloid® vehicle showed a lower rate of release for <b>idoxuridine</b> than the LGPS did during the VanKel dissolution experiments. This suggests that higher flux values would be obtained with the LGPS for <b>idoxuridine</b> than with the Emzaloid® formulation, since more drug was available for permeation through the skin. This was, however, not the case. The Emzaloid® formulation showed much higher flux values, showing that even with a smaller amount of active available to permeate the skin higher flux values were obtained. Enhancement ratios of 20, 33 and 3, 50 were achieved with the Emzaloid® formulation for 5 -fluorouracil and <b>idoxuridine</b> respectively. The internal LGPS structure which mimics the skins lipid components remained unchanged after the addition of the actives. Greater success might be achieved with the LGPS for different model drugs, since the drugs' physicochemical properties play an important part in its permeation through the skin. The Emzaloid® formulation, which is closely related to liposomes and transfersomes, showed great potential for commercially marketable formulations for the drugs tested but further research on the formulation has to be done.
