Thesis - English Abstract The excavated overburden from open-cast {{coal mines}} is end-dumped in <b>fills.</b> Clay type <b>soil</b> prevails among the <b>filled</b> <b>soils</b> in North-western Bohemia. As {{a consequence of}} the character and state of the soil, together with the mining and dumping technology, a typical lumpy structure of the clay fill is formed. The filled lumps range in size and vary in mechanical properties, but stiff to solid lumps up to 0. 5 m in size are prevalent. Large and open macrovoids between the single lumps are a characteristic feature of the clay fills. Clay fills exhibit a double porosity structure, consisting of intergranular porosity between the lumps and intragranular porosity inside them. The total porosity of the freshly <b>filled</b> <b>soils</b> can reach 70 %. This type of clay fill structure is metastable. This thesis focuses on the problematic behaviour of clay <b>fill</b> <b>soils</b> due to their metastable structure and their partly saturated state. Long-term monitoring of matric suction at depths up to 2 metres in two reclaimed clay fills revealed two different trends.

Building A Roemani Hospital, Semarang, Central Java is one of several location that have foundation failures after build up and being used. The right method to handle it is increase the carrying capacity of the soil with grouting. Grouting is one of soil improvement method, that was conducted by inject the cement paste into the ground with a certain pressure through the borehole, so that the ground’s strength will increase. This research uses the descriptive method, survey method, and analysis method. The method that used in analysis of increasing the land carrying capacity at Building A Roemani Hospital Semarang is soil mechanic laboratory analysis and calculation of land carrying capacity by field investigation. The field data that being used are conus resistance (qc), correlation coefficient (CLCPC, and pile range (Ap) Based on calculations of land carrying capacity, indicates an increase of conus resistance (qc), and foundation carrying capacity after grouting. The conus resistance (qc) of <b>filling</b> <b>soil</b> before grouting was 5 : 00 kg/cm 2. Eight days after grouting, it increases into 7 : 00 - 9 : 00 kg/cm 2.

40|$|The fall {{of a tree}} {{accompanied}} by its uprooting {{is the most common}} natural end of the tree life. To understand how soil is affected by treefalls, it is necessary to recognize their signs in soil profiles, even when their surface features (pit-and-mound topography) are erased. The paper reviews these signs of treefalls in soil profiles, which can be used to distinguish the patterns of old treefall-related pedoturbations. The paper is based on a literature analysis and results of authors’ long-term studies of forest soil in the European part of Russia and in the Western Siberia. Two main types of uprooting of a falling tree (hinge and rotational treefalls) are considered. The paper presents data on the sizes of 424 pit-and-mound soil complexes for nine tree species (Tilia cordata, Acer platanoides, Fraxinus excelsior, Ulmus glabra, Quercus robur, Betula pendula, Populus tremula, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris) and describes peculiarities of soil relocation in the process of different treefalls, which is necessary to recognize old treefall complexes in soil profiles. The following soil-profile signs of treefalls are considered: (1) treefall pits (cauldrons); (2) spotty or streaky structures of different degrees of contrast; (3) blocks of “buried material” from the upper soil layers; (4) washed (bleached) material depositing at the bottom of pits and <b>filling</b> <b>soil</b> pores and channels of various origins; (5) signs of hydrogenous changes of soil material resulting from water stagnation in the pits; (6) root channels {{at the bottom of the}} pit and (7) inclusions of litter and charcoal. As shown by our studies, treefall-related pedoturbations affect soil profiles at a depth larger than the depth usually described by the soil horizons A, E, Bhs, etc. A conclusion is made that in most forest soils, the middle and lower parts of profiles have patterns originating from the transfer of soil material upon treefalls...|$|E

Methods We divided the growing stages of winter wheat into recovering-jointing, jointing-flowering and late <b>filling.</b> <b>Soil</b> water levels based on field capacity were 75 %– 80 % (control, full water supply or well-watered), 65 %– 70 % (light drought stress), 55 %– 60 % (medium drought stress) and 40 %– 45 % (severe drought stress) from winter wheat seeding to maturity and were controlled by irrigation and mobile rain shelters. Important findings The drought resistant cultivar ‘Shijiazhuang 8 ’ had a higher grain yield than ‘Yanmai 20 ’ under drought stress, and medium drought stress in all the three durations can increase winter wheat yield. Drought stress in the jointing-flowering stage has the greatest effects on N assimilation and translocation in winter wheat, the second greatest being in the recovering-jointing stage, while that in late filling stage has few effects. Both medium and severe drought stress during different growth durations will lower the translocation of stored nitrogen before anthesis into grain, as well as N utilization rate and productivity; on the other hand, light drought stress in the recovering-jointing and late filling stages can improve the translocation of stored N into grain as well as N utilization rate and productivity. Under drought stress, N accumulation in grain of drought-resistant ‘Shijiazhuang 8 ’ relies more on the retranslocation of stored N before anthesis, while that of ‘Yanmai 20 ’ relies more on the N accumulation and translocation after anthesis. Considering yield and N translocation of wheat, light drought stress during the recovering-jointing and late filling stages is necessary, as well as sufficient irrigation during jointing-flowering stage, so as to improve N accumulation and partitioning...|$|E

The aim of this pot study {{was to assess the}} effects of a single application as mulch of two types of composts derived from different feedstocks, namely C 1 (from garden waste) and C 2 (from agricultural residues and manures) on three soils with different clay contents (46 %, 22 % and 13 %, hereafter referred to as S 46, S 22 and S 13) in terms of their physical, chemical and biological properties as well as on plant growth and nutrient uptake. The composts were placed as 2. 5 -cm-thick mulch layer on the soil surface, and wheat plants were grown for 35 days and to grain filling (70 days). The composts reduced the soil pH by 0. 3 – 0. 7 units, slightly increased total organic C, but increased soil electrical conductivity compared to unamended soil. Soil respiration was significantly higher in S 13 than S 46 in all treatments after 5 weeks. At grain <b>filling,</b> <b>soil</b> respiration was higher in S 13 than in the other two soils and higher with C 2 than with C 1 and in the non-amended soil. The addition of compost significantly increased soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) in S 22 and S 46, but not in S 13 which also had the lowest CEC among the soils. C 2 increased the available P concentration and macro-aggregate stability in all soils compared to C 1 and the unamended soil. Compost addition increased available N in S 46 and S 22 compared to the unamended soil with a stronger effect by C 1. Both composts increased wheat growth and shoot P concentrations with the effect of C 2 being greater than that of C 1. It is concluded that the effect of composts varies with soil type as well as compost type and that this interaction needs {{to be taken into account}} when composts are applied to improve specific soil properties.

40|$|Industrial stony {{residues}} {{were widely}} used for centuries as filling material {{in urban areas}} of the Walloon region (Belgium). Their composition and properties widely differ according to the industrial process which generated them. It is assumed, therefore, that the identification of such materials in the field can contribute to (1) better assess potential risks {{at an early stage}} when investigating such soil and (2) to devise remediation operations that are more appropriate. However, identification criteria for industrial residues are still poorly documented and might be affected by regional context. This study aims at establishing identification criteria for industrial stony residues of the Walloon region and linking the nature and amounts of such residues to the content of trace metal in a large population of soil samples from this area. On this purpose, we selected 75 reference samples of industrial stony residues in order to include a wide range of morphology and texture basing on hand specimen visual description. They were analyzed by ICP either after alkaline fusion (Li-borate) for major elements (Si, Ca, Fe, Al, Mn, Mg, K, Na, S and P) or after tri-acid dissolution for trace metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, As, Cd, Co). Associated industrial processes were identified (i) according to historical information on the sampling site, (ii) by comparing chemical composition to bibliographic data and (iii) by using morphologic and texture diagnostic criteria from literature, when available. Measured chemical compositions were compared to the composition of samples from literature using graphical and statistical methods. The samples were linked to 16 different industrial processes, mainly related to steel industry and coal power plants. On the basis of the 75 reference samples, we derived criteria for field hand specimen identification. They are based on both morphology and texture features (colour, shape, fracture, luster, vacuolar texture …) and simple tests commonly used in mineralogy (HCl reaction, streak colour, hardness, density …). We used these criteria to identify and quantify stony materials in 380 soils samples collected in 115 <b>filling</b> <b>soil</b> profiles in urban areas from Wallonia. Stony materials were also classified into 6 major classes: stones naturally occurring in soils, mining residues, demolition rubbles, industrial waste, household waste and unidentified materials. Industrial stony residues were found in 18 % of the surface layer and 25 % of deeper layers (down to a 1. 3 m depth). Industrial stony residues account on average for 7 % and 12 % (volumic percentages) of stony materials in surface and deeper horizons respectively. They mainly consist of coal combustion residues, blast furnace slags, steel slags and coke fragments. Results for all the stony materials were compared to the chemical data measured on the fine earth fraction (i. e. the granulometric fraction under 2 mm) of corresponding soil samples in order to detect the classes which are associated with a high pollutant content. Such information make it possible to rapidly assess on the field any potential risk for human health or and the environment and to devise cleaning or conservation measures appropriate to the type of material and to its industrial origin...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of geogrids as means of soil reinforcement is well known. Due to complex interaction mechanisms between soil and geogrids, however, the stress strain behaviour of the composite material “geogrid reinforced soil” is still hard to predict. The identification of major material parameters and {{the description of}} their effect to the compound behaviour is therefore of great importance. Within this thesis geogrid reinforced soil has been investigated in the laboratory with large scale “element” tests, such as triaxial and biaxial compression tests. Especially the apparatus developed for the plane strain testing of 800 mm wide specimens allows testing of soil reinforced with common geogrids with aperture widths of 30 to 40 mm. Test series {{have been carried out}} to investigate the effect of certain material parameters, i. e. soil density, stress level and tensile stiffness of the geogrids, to the composite material behaviour. Thereby {{attention has been paid to}} vary only one parameter at a time to allow the exact assignment of the observed effects to the changes in the stress strain behaviour of the compound material. In contrast to the stress strain behaviour of unreinforced soil test results have shown an initially increasing stiffness of the composite material under vertical compression. This is caused by a gradual activation of the geogrids due to the lateral specimen extension. Furthermore, the reinforcing or confining effect of the geogrids has been identified to be higher at lower stress levels where there is only little confinement within the soil itself. A good compaction of the <b>filling</b> <b>soil</b> as well as a higher tensile stiffness have shown to lead to an increase of both the stiffness and the bearing capacity of the reinforced soil. Apart from the possibility of testing of large specimens the apparatus that has been constructed specifically for the investigation of the reinforced soil under plane strain conditions allows the determination of the kinematic behaviour of the reinforced soil. This is achieved by recording the movement of soil particles through a transparent side wall of the test apparatus during testing and a subsequent evaluation using the digital image correlation (DIC) method. Evaluating displacements and rotations of soil particles the development of arching effects and shear zones within the soil has been visualized. Following the idea of the “confining effect concept” the corresponding stress paths of the materials investigated with biaxial compression tests have been determined. From the equations given in this thesis the additional confining pressure due to the geogrid activation can be calculated for any loading state as a function of the tensile stiffness of the geogrids employed in the tests. In addition to the experimental tests numerical calculations of the biaxial compression tests have been carried out using the finite element method. The calculation results show an excellent match of the kinematic behaviour of unreinforced and geogrid reinforced specimens determined with the lab tests. Using a constitutive law with stress dependant description of the soil stiffness even the initial increase of the stiffness of the composite material during loading could be modeled. Calculations with a constant stiffness value, however, lead to a significant overestimation of the deformations of the composite material at the peak stage. Apart from the fundamental “element”-testing of the composite material also model tests have been carried out to investigate the development of earth pressure and connection loads within the reinforced soil. The cross section of the specimens investigated was 1000 mm x 1000 mm (H x W). The results have shown a significant reduction of the earth pressure even below the active earth pressure of the unreinforced soil. It has to mentioned that the earth pressure reduction occurred already at very small displacements of the wall facing, similar to or even less as those required for the development of the active earth pressure. Furthermore, it has been shown that the decrease of the earth pressure was apparent under the topmost reinforcement layer, independent of the height of this layer within the specimen. Due to the holistic consideration of stresses and deformations within the reinforced soil and the determination of the relationship between stresses, strains and reinforcement activation the results presented in this thesis constitute a further step towards understanding and describing the mechanical behaviour of the composite material geogrid reinforced soil...|$|E
