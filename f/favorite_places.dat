25|$|Worf {{was born}} in 2340 on Qo'noS (the Klingon homeworld) {{as the son of}} Mogh. Five years later, his parents moved to the Khitomer colony. Worf's parents were killed during a {{surprise}} attack by the Romulans on the Khitomer outpost. The colony's distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS Intrepid. Chief Petty Officer Sergey Rozhenko found Worf in the rubble and took him in after failing to find any living relatives. Rozhenko and his wife Helena raised him on a small farm colony on the planet Gault, a world of about 20,000 inhabitants, almost all of them human. Worf also has a human brother, Nikolai, with whom he often quarreled. He also spent time on Earth in his parents' native city of Minsk, later recommending it to Miles O'Brien as one of his <b>favorite</b> <b>places</b> on Earth.|$|E

500|$|On July 2, MINAE again {{met with}} more than 30 {{environmental}} groups to discuss the situation. [...] Castro said that plans to make Moín Beach a protected area were moving forward. However, he said, making the area a national park was not feasible {{because of the number}} of people living on the beach. [...] "A national park is too closed off for this particular beach", he explained. [...] Environmentalists requested that the Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge, one of Mora's <b>favorite</b> <b>places,</b> be renamed in honor of him. The plan was endorsed by his family. [...] They also requested the formation of a [...] "truth commission" [...] to investigate Mora's murder and eight other deaths from the past 20 years.

[...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day.

[...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with your boss, or your teacher, or your mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] <b>favorite</b> <b>places</b> in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres.

60|$|Not a sound {{broke the}} oppressive stillness. No bird's note {{rose from the}} leafy {{wilderness}} around me; no voices spoke in the convent garden behind the scowling wall; no clock struck in the chapel-tower; no dog barked in the ruined outhouse. The dead silence deepened the solitude of the place inexpressibly. I began to feel it weighing on my spirits--the more, because woods were never <b>favorite</b> <b>places</b> with me to walk in. The sort of pastoral happiness which poets often represent when they sing {{of life in the}} woods never, to my mind, has half the charm of life on the mountain or in the plain. When I am in a wood, I miss the boundless loveliness of the sky, and the delicious softness that distance gives to the earthly view beneath. I feel oppressively the change which the free air suffers when it gets imprisoned among leaves, and I am always awed, rather than pleased, by that mysterious still light which shines with such a strange dim luster in deep places among trees. It may convict me of want of taste and absence of due feeling for the marvelous beauties of vegetation, but I must frankly own that I never penetrate far into a wood without finding that the getting out of it again is the pleasantest part of my walk--the getting out on to the barest down, the wildest hill-side, the bleakest mountain top--the getting out anywhere, so that I can see the sky over me and the view before me as far as my eye can reach.|$|E
