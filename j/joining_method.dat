5000|$|Being a <b>joining</b> <b>method</b> {{based on}} the plastic {{deformation}} of the sheets, the main limitation of clinching {{is represented by the}} sheet material formability (ductility). Since metal ductility increases with temperature, heat assisted clinching processes have been developed, thus increasing the material ductility and extending the clinching [...] "join ability". In addition, increasing the joining temperature results in a reduction in the material's yield stress and consequently a in reduction of the required joining force. Nevertheless, if prolonged heating is applied, an increase in the grain size as well as metallurgical changes of alloys may affect the mechanical behavior of the material at the joint vicinity.

50|$|The joint is {{the weakest}} {{part of the}} system, {{therefore}} the type of <b>joining</b> <b>method</b> used is very important if strength is an issue. The strength of a joint {{is defined as the}} force required to break the strap in uniaxial tension. This is then compared to the uniaxial strength of the strap and recorded as the percent difference (e.g., a sample of steel strap may have a 5000 lb break strength and the seal may fail at 3000 lb, so the seal is said to have a 60% strength). Hot knife welds have a minimum break strength of 55%. Friction welds have a minimum break strength of 65%. Well set up strapping machines or friction weld tools will aim for around 80% of break strength. Metal clips/seals are surprisingly low with circa 100 - 120 kg slip resistance.|$|E
50|$|If {{the angle}} {{standard}} taper fittings make with glassware is not perfectly set, {{the glass is}} extremely rigid and brittle, presenting a fracture risk on some setups. A ball and socket <b>joining</b> <b>method</b> allows some flexibility in the mating angles of the pieces being joined, which can be particularly important with heavy flasks or long pieces of glassware {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to support and potentially snap under bending loads. A common example of this is the collection flask on a rotary evaporator, whose weight increases significantly as it fills. A ball and socket allows the flask to plumb itself without placing a bending load on the joint. Such a socket might also be used on a larger, but more typical, distillation setup at the head and before the condenser. This allows the long span of the condenser, the non-perfect angle of the receiving bend and the filling flask to be supported more easily as their angle with the still head has a few degrees of positioning freedom.|$|E

In this experiment, 20 -mm-diameter solid shafts and 40 -mm-outer-diameter rings having a 20 -mm-inner-diameter step at the 18. 5 -mm-inner-diameter center hole were used. The material combinations of the shaft / ring were JIS S 45 C / SKD 11, A 5056 / S 45 C, and S 45 C / A 5056. The experiment was performed as follows. The shaft was put on the ring and pressed. Then, metal plastically flowed between the joining faces. The gap between them was filled with the flowing metal, and then, they were joined by high clamping pressure. The primary results were as follows. This <b>joining</b> <b>method</b> was completed with small amounts of metal flow because of highly precise fitting between the shaft and ring.

Hence, the use of light-weight and high-strength materials such as Al–Mg alloys, high-tensile-strength steel and carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) is essential to lighten the vehicle weight [1]. <b>Joining</b> <b>methods</b> for these dissimilar materials {{are the key to}} apply them into the structural part of the vehicles in combination.

The conventional Hash <b>Join</b> <b>Methods</b> specify the tuple distribution in buckets statically.
