50|$|TBS has {{a policy}} of {{accepting}} any brewer {{in the world to}} sell its product, as long as the brewer meets the requirements set by the LCBO. Furthermore, unlike many other retailers, a brewer is given flexibility with regards to how many and which stores it would like to sell its product in. Because The Beer Store operates on a cost-recovery basis, listing fees for smaller breweries can be kept at a minimum. In 2016 TBS implemented a new lower tier rate for qualifying small brewers that is significantly less than the basic service rate paid by the larger brewing companies. Smaller breweries who produce under 1,000,000 hectoliters a year of beer qualify for this lower tier rate on their first 50,000 hectoliters of beer produced that year. Additionally, qualifying small brewers who produce under 10,000 hectoliters a year are now provided with 2 free <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> listings at 7 of their most proximate Beer Stores.|$|E

ULWM and ULHA operators are respectively used in this paper to collect evaluation values of synthesized attribute and overall attribute values of groups. And thus the comprehensive evaluation information of alternatives will be obtained. Then, possibility formula is used to construct a possibility matrix based on which we can decide how to arrange the decision-making schemes.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three years the Australian {{biodiesel}} industry has struggled with rapidly increasing feedstock prices and an unfavourable taxation environment. These tough times have caused large scale producers to drastically curtail production with some even ceasing operation. Instead of sounding the end of the biodiesel industry in Australia, this can act as a stimulus for refocusing the scale of production. In this paper a new model of production is proposed that maintains the benefits of large production scales while taking advantage of the agility, low risk and decentralised nature of small scale production. This model consists of optimised small scale (1 - 5 million L/yr) production technology incorporated into a regional industry hub. The regional industry hub provides existing infrastructure as well as significant synergies with other industries to provide <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> markets and reduced transport costs.

40|$|Current {{developments}} in society requires increasing information on products at batch level. This holds {{especially true for}} the food industry. To {{be able to meet}} such requirements, data on the origin of products are an important factor, frequently including details of production conditions in preceding echelons. This paper discusses how code numbers, batches and particularly labels in multi-echelon supply chains can be applied to manage the enormous amount of detailed data which are vital to these usually complex supply chains. The research shows that the concept of labels is much more applicable than commonly understood. First, it enables efficient aggregation of data in complex supply networks. This is important to delimit the start and end of a network and in taking dynamic changes into account. Second, labels add value to the product. In business this concept is already known, e. g. as brand (Champagne, Parma ham) or as quality characteristics (environmentally kind, animal friendly). In information systems, however, application of the concept of a label is only marginally used. This puts too much emphasis on product data at batch level and it is a missed opportunity to contribute to a sound basis for <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> qualit...|$|E

40|$|Sustainability, {{variously}} {{described as}} a ‘journey rather than a destination’ to a ‘composite quality’ defies exact definition. Differentiation of sustainability into component indicators is somewhat easier to grapple with; sustained productivity, economic viability and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> quality {{are a few of}} the obvious parameters that may be easily quantified. Indeed, organic productions systems (OPS) are recognised as providing produce quantitatively free of agrochemicals, and with high nutritive value, but their impact (ideally positive) on landscapes, ecosystems and environmental quality, the substance of Environmental Management Systems, are less quantifiable. For better or worse, the expected environmental outcomes of OPS are wide-ranging, and possibly not achievable. A recent survey of organic customers (Meldrum 2006) shows that > 75 % believe OPS are better for the environment; and it is up to the scientific community to substantiate these beliefs and to develop guidelines to ensure that OPS are better for the environment. With a focus on intensive horticulture in the tropics and subtropics, I consider the contributions to OPS and environmental sustainability of live mulching and organic amendments. Their primary roles as nutrient sources, as conditioners of soil physical quality, as determinants of cation exchange capacity, and as major contributors to the maintenance of soil organic matter are discussed, as too are interactions between these, and their relationships to the topical issues of sequestration of atmospheric carbon. I argue that well defined criteria with respect to expectations for each of these roles must be adhered to in order to ‘journey towards the composite quality of sustainability’...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{membrane}} processes available for water treatment. Membranes {{have the advantage}} of currently decreasing capital cost, a relatively small footprint compared to conventional treatment, generally a reduction in chemicals usage and comparably low maintenance requirements. Three membrane processes applicable to water treatment, micro- (MF), ultra- (UF), and nanofiltration (NF), are compared in terms of intrinsic rejection, variation of rejection due to membrane fouling and increase in rejection by ferric chloride pretreatment. Twelve different membranes are compared {{on the basis of their}} membrane pore size which was calculated from their molecular weight cut-off. A pore size of 50 %) organics removal. For a fouled membrane this pore size is about 11 nm. UV rejection is higher than DOC rejection. Coagulation pretreatment allows a higher rejection of organics by MF and UF and the cut-off criterion due to initial membrane pore size is no longer valid. A water quality parameter (WQP) is introduced which describes the product water quality achieved as a function of colloid, DOC and cation rejection. The relationship between log (pore size) and WQP is linear. Estimation of membrane costs as a function of WQP suggests that open UF is superior to MF (similar cost at higher WQP) and NF is superior to tight UF. Chemical pretreatment could compensate for the difference between MF and UF. However, when considering chemicals and energy costs, it appears that a process operated at a higher energy is cheaper at a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> quality (less dependent on organic type). This argument is further supported by environmental issues of chemicals usage, as energy may be provided from renewable sources...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{coupling}} product formation {{with growth}} {{has proven to}} be a highly successful metabolic engineering strategy for the biotechnological production of numerous molecules, e. g., succinate (Hong, 2002). The guaranteed (high) product yield, the fast recuperation of cofactors and abundance of intermediates are some of the main advantages. Such a strategy was developed for the production of fructose- 6 -phosphate derived molecules in E. coli, as many high added value molecules, such as for example chito-oligomers, are derived from fructose- 6 -P. However, compared to previous examples of this strategy, fructose- 6 -phosphate is a key metabolite in central metabolism, that intervenes in the glycolysis, the pentose phosphate shunt, etc. which renders such a strategy intrinsically more challenging. The coupling between fructose- 6 -phosphate production and growth was achieved by using the heteromeric substrate sucrose, which is cleaved by a heterologously expressed sucrose phosphorylase into glucose- 1 -phosphate and fructose. A knock-out strategy was developed using metabolic models and C 13 labeled flux analysis to preserve the fructose moiety for the production of fructose- 6 -phosphate derived molecules, while growth is fueled by metabolizing glucose- 1 -phosphate, hence, resulting in <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> yields and a reasonable productivity. To achieve this split metabolism, since fructose- 6 -P is a key intermediate in the central metabolism, the fluxes of the central carbon metabolism have to be redirected severely, e. g., the glycolysis has to be split by knocking out the genes pgi and pfkAB, which prevents the flow from fructose- 6 -phosphate through the glycolysis to the Krebs cycle. Different additional knockouts were evaluated in order to achieve a complete split metabolism. C 13 labeled flux analysis, using OpenFlux, was performed to evaluate the fluxome of the various knock-out mutants, which ultimately showed that the fructose moiety of sucrose can be completely preserved for the formation of fructose- 6 -P derived products, rendering such a strain the ideal base strain for the development of a wide variety of production hosts...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Participatory {{research}} (PR) is the co-construction {{of research}} through partnerships between researchers and people affected by and/or responsible for {{action on the}} issues under study. Evaluating the benefits of PR is challenging {{for a number of}} reasons: the research topics, methods, and study designs are heterogeneous; the extent of collaborative involvement may vary over the duration of a project and from one project to the next; and partnership activities may generate a complex array of both short- and long-term outcomes. METHODS: Our review team consisted of a collaboration among researchers and decision makers in public health, research funding, ethics review, and community-engaged scholarship. We identified, selected, and appraised a large-variety sample of primary studies describing PR partnerships, and in each stage, two team members independently reviewed and coded the literature. We used key realist review concepts (middle-range theory, demi-regularity, and context-mechanism-outcome configurations [CMO]) to analyze and synthesize the data, using the PR partnership as the main unit of analysis. FINDINGS: From 7, 167 abstracts and 591 full-text papers, we distilled for synthesis a final sample of twenty-three PR partnerships described in 276 publications. The link between process and outcome in these partnerships was best explained using the middle-range theory of partnership synergy, which demonstrates how PR can (1) ensure culturally and logistically appropriate research, (2) enhance recruitment capacity, (3) generate professional capacity and competence in stakeholder groups, (4) result in productive conflicts followed by useful negotiation, (5) increase the quality of outputs and outcomes over time, (6) increase the sustainability of project goals beyond funded time frames and during gaps in external funding, and (7) create system changes and new unanticipated projects and activities. Negative examples illustrated why these outcomes were not a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>product</b> of PR partnerships but were contingent on key aspects of context. CONCLUSIONS: We used a realist approach to embrace the heterogeneity and complexity of the PR literature. This theory-driven synthesis identified mechanisms by which PR may add value to the research process. Using the middle-range theory of partnership synergy, our review confirmed findings from previous PR reviews, documented and explained some negative outcomes, and generated new insights into the benefits of PR regarding conflicts and negotiation between stakeholders, program sustainability and advancement, unanticipated project activity, and the generation of systemic change...|$|E
