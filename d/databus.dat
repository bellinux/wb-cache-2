Missiles like AS-30 {{and even the}} anti-ship Sea Eagle were added. Some IAF aircraft had the Agave radar system, purpusely for maritime strike. India later developed the DARIN system in its Jaguar fleet, with a modern 1553 <b>databus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Enhanced Lynx variant with Westland 30 {{tail boom}} and rotor, Gem 60 engines, new wheeled {{tricycle}} undercarriage and MIL-STD-1553 <b>databus.</b> Only one prototype built (serial/registration ZE477 / G-17-24) in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Many second-generation CPUs {{delegated}} {{peripheral device}} communications to a secondary processor. For example, while the communication processor controlled card reading and punching, the main CPU executed calculations and binary branch instructions. One <b>databus</b> would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU's fetch-execute cycle rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the PDP-1, the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took {{at least two}} memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the operand data fetch.|$|E

5000|$|... iDrive {{introduced}} the first multiplexed MOST Bus/Byteflight optical fiber <b>databusses</b> with very {{high bit rate}} in a production vehicle. These are used for high-speed applications such as controlling the television, DVD, or driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control, infrared night vision or head-up display.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, an {{additional}} 15 aircraft, designated Alpha Jet MS2, were ordered. The Alpha Jet MS2 bore {{high levels of}} similarity to Dassault's proposed Alpha Jet NGEA, featuring a Sagem-built Uliss 81 nav/attack system, a Thomson-CSF-built laser rangefinder and HUD, along with a digital multiplex <b>databus.</b> The Egptian Air Force used the Alpha Jet MS1 fleet to replace the Aero L-29 Delfín and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 in the trainer role, while the later-built MS2 standard aircraft served to replace the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 in the ground-attack role. In February 2000, Egypt was reportedly seeking to replace their Alpha Jet fleet, and was investigating several options, including the BAE Systems Hawk.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Germany began a {{comprehensive}} upgrade program, {{known as the}} Improved Combat Efficiency (ICE) program, for their Alpha Jet fleet; these upgrades were to involve the installation of a Mil Spec 1553B <b>databus,</b> new sensors integrated with the navigation/attack systems, modernized electronic countermeasures suite, measures to minimize the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures, protection measures around the fuel system, and new armaments such as the AGM-65 Maverick. In 1988, {{it was announced that}} the ICE program has been cancelled. A more austere upgrade program did proceed in its place, which integrated the AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile and navigation computer upgrades, along with several minor airframe and equipment refinements, such as the addition of a jettisonable gun pod.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 {{features}} {{a range of}} customizable avionics systems, dependent on customer selection and purpose. On some models, French firm Thales Group provides {{various parts of the}} avionics, such as the glass cockpit, full-colour multifunction displays, tactical mission and encrypted communication systems, the TopOwl helmet-mounted sight/display, IFF and autonomous navigation systems, and the electrical power generation system. Other systems include a forward looking infrared (FLIR), weather radar, digital map generation system, enhanced ground proximity warning system, personal locator system, and VHF/UHF/HF tactical radios. In 2015, the NH90 became the first helicopter to receive an laser-based airborne collision avoidance system. Onboard mission systems feature a dual-redundant <b>databus,</b> are compliant with MIL-STD 1553, and are comprehensively managed via sensor fusion functionality. Customer demand for future avionics improvements such as new data links and communication systems, as well as additional electro-optical sensors, have been anticipated by the manufacturer.|$|E
500|$|Four {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration during 1979–80, retaining their strike capability. The RF-111C carried a reconnaissance pack with four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit. Four ex-USAF F-111As were refitted to F-111C standard and delivered to Australia as attrition replacements in 1982. There F-111Cs were equipped to carry Pave Tack FLIR/laser pods in the mid-1980s. [...] They underwent an extensive Avionics Upgrade Program through 1998. [...] Under this program, the F-111C was upgraded to digital avionics. This included twin mission computers, modern digital <b>databus,</b> digital weapon management system, new AN/APQ-171 terrain-following radar, new AN/APQ-169 attack radar, and twin ring-laser gyro INS.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, {{work began}} on an [...] "Alternate Close Support" [...] {{version of the}} Alpha Jet, {{featuring}} a SAGEM ULISS 81 INS, a Thomson-CSF VE-110 HUD, a TMV630 laser rangefinder in a modified nose and a TRT AHV 9 radio altimeter, with all avionics linked through a digital <b>databus.</b> Initial flight was on 9 April 1982. Cameroon obtained seven (some sources claim 6) and Egypt obtained 15. As with the original Egyptian order for MS1 machines, Dassault provided four such machines under the designation of MS2 and AOI of Egypt assembled the other eleven from knockdown kits.|$|E

50|$|Agni-II {{introduced}} a new concept in missile control system by adopting MIL-STD-1553 <b>databus</b> for all on-board communication and control device interconnection mainly INS system, Flight Control Computer, actuators and sensors. It is the standard that is adopted in new civilian & military aircraft (circuit routing and device mounting) and all the software in the Agni-II has been designed around this bus. DRDO sources claim that this reduces the number of connections and also makes the missile more rugged. However, some missile analysts feel that a standard <b>databus</b> {{may not be the}} best path to follow. It is said that a customised <b>databus</b> is better because in a standard <b>databus,</b> one tends to use off-the-shelf electronic devices whose performance may not be optimal. However most new missiles are moving towards digital buses using commercial off-the-shelf technology and which enables affordable sub-system replacement.|$|E

50|$|Programming Language for Business or PL/B is a business-oriented {{programming}} language originally called <b>DATABUS</b> and designed by Datapoint in 1972 {{as an alternative}} to COBOL because Datapoint's 8-bit computers could not fit COBOL into their limited memory, and because COBOL did not at the time have facilities to deal with Datapoint's built-in keyboard and screen.|$|E
50|$|Entegra Release 9 is {{considered}} a 3rd-generation integrated flight deck because it is built on a brand new hardware platform using a modular architecture, dual Byteflight digital <b>databus,</b> all new fully digital radio designs, and incorporating a unique Page & Tab user interface and QWERTY-style FMS control/display unit {{that are designed to}} dramatically reduce workload during single-pilot IFR operations.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 80386 {{was subsequently}} renamed 80386DX to avoid confusion. However, Intel subsequently used the 'DX' suffix {{to refer to}} the floating-point capability of the 80486DX. The 80387SX was an 80387 part that was compatible with the 386SX (i.e. with a 16-bit <b>databus).</b> The 386SX was packaged in a surface-mount QFP, and sometimes offered in a socket to allow for an upgrade.|$|E
