2500|$|Speak is a first-person, diary-like narrative. Written in {{the voice}} of Melinda Sordino, it {{features}} lists, subheadings, spaces between paragraphs and script-like dialogue. The fragmented style mimics Melinda's trauma. The choppy sentences and blank spaces on the pages relate to Melinda's fascination with Cubism. According to Chris McGee and DeTora, Anderson's writing style allows the reader to see how Melinda struggles with [...] "producing the standard, cohesive narrative" [...] expected in a teen novel. Melinda's distracted narrative reiterates the idea that [...] "no one really wants to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have to say". In her article, [...] "Like Falling Up into a Storybook", Barbara Tannert-Smith says, By disrupting the present with flashbacks of the past, Anderson further illustrates the structure of trauma. Anderson organizes the plot around the four quarters of Melinda's freshman year, starting the story in the middle of Melinda's struggle. Anderson superimposed the fragmented trauma plot-line upon this linear high school narrative, making the narrative more believable.|$|E
