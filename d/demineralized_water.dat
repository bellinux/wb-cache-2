The World Health Organization has investigated {{the health effects of}} <b>demineralized</b> <b>water</b> since 1980. Experiments in humans found that <b>demineralized</b> <b>water</b> increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased blood serum potassium concentration.

Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10mg/L with 20–30mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20mg/L minimum and a 40–80mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4mmol/L. At water hardness above 5mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{roles of}} inherent mineral matters in lignite water slurry (LWS) electrolysis, lignite and demineralized lignite electrolyses {{were carried out}} in H 2 SO 4 system. The results showed that cell voltage for LWS electrolysis was lower than that for <b>demineralized</b> lignite <b>water</b> slurry (DLWS) under constant current condition. Some inherent mineral matters changed into the corresponding metal ions which entered into electrolyte, and thus improved the electrolysis oxidation reactions for coal organic structure. Meanwhile, the relative amount of O-containing functional groups in demineralized lignite increased with electrolysis time, improving its pyrolysis reactivity.
