[...] He praised the series art, noting that it [...] "does great work in impressing upon the {{audience}} {{the same sense of}} wonder Chise experiences throughout. The character designs are expressive and backgrounds ornate". [...] Commenting on the relationship between Chise and Elias, he wrote that [...] "having this story go in a legitimately romantic direction would likely raise thorny issues of power dynamics and consent", but remarked that, as it was, the story [...] "does a commendable job of making both Chise and Elias understandable and likable characters." [...] He concluded his review by writing: [...] "What conflict all these lovely details might be leading towards is a mystery so far, but the execution is so strong that I'm ready to follow wherever it leads." [...] In his review of the second volume, he admitted to coming to an appreciation of the main characters' relationship, writing that [...] "the ambiguities of their relationship actually seem like one more <b>fitting</b> <b>piece</b> of a world where every relationship is ambiguous". [...] He called the series' magic [...] "classic but still refreshing". [...] He also commented that the series art [...] "remains gorgeous and well-suited to the story all throughout this volume ... the backgrounds are lush and faces expressive, and the whole style has an ornate looseness to it that works perfectly for this kind of fantasy storytelling." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "If you have any appreciation for this style of classic fantasy storytelling, Ancient Magus' Bride is a can't-miss production." ...|$|E

40|$|The correct use and {{interpretation}} of models depends on several steps, two of which being the calibration by parameter estimation and the analysis of uncertainty. In the biological literature, these steps are seldom discussed together, {{but they can be}} seen as <b>fitting</b> <b>pieces</b> of the same puzzle. In particular, analytical procedures for uncertainty estimation may be masking a high degree of uncertainty coming from a model with a stable structure, but insufficient data. Under a likelihoodist approach, the problem of uncertainty estimation is closely related to the problem of composite hypothesis. In this paper, we present a brief historical background on the statistical school of Likelihoodism, and examine the complex relations between the law of likelihood and the problem of composite hypothesis, together with the existing proposals for coping with it. Then, we propose a new integrative methodology for the uncertainty estimation of models using the information in the collected data. We argue that this methodology is intuitively appealing under a likelihood paradigm...|$|R

Like solving {{a jigsaw puzzle}} by <b>fitting</b> <b>pieces</b> together bit by bit, the human mind makes {{sense of the world}} by transforming inputs into outputs throughout the nervous system, with the emergence of visual descriptions during such transformations relying heavily on perceptual integration. This thesis distinguishes emergent perceptual integration from non-emergent perceptual integration, with the former but not the latter resulting in visual descriptions unique to the whole and cannot be found in the parts; this distinction provides clues to the nature of unconscious processing (Chapter 1). Indeed, emergent properties, elusive as they sound, are tractable as revealed by emergent filling-in and its unique adaptation aftereffect (Chapter 2). To further understand the principles that constrain the emergence of visual descriptions, the thesis considers how spatial and temporal structures, two main types of contextual effects, regulate the emergence process. Rich contextual regularities are embedded in spatial configurations; a moving frame technique reveals that the coupling of objects to the contextual frames is pervasive and relatively automatic (Chapter 3), resulting in automatic deployments of exogenous visual attention to non-retinotopic, frame-centered locations (Chapter 4). Statistical regularities also abound in the vast associative knowledge one learns in the life time. Indeed, associated links can be established rapidly and without rewards, resulting in subsequent inventory attentional capture to the associated colors when the location of the target is uncertain (Chapter 5), and subsequent attentional inhibition of the associated colors when the location of the target is fixed (Chapter 6). These results thus reveal the importance in distinguishing emergent from non-emergent perceptual integration, and show that the emergence of visual descriptions is strongly constrained by spatial and temporal structures...|$|R

However, both the patchwork and the social participation in group projects often yield interesting combinatorial problems. This paper looks at the suitability of functional programming for solving these types of problems, considering two representative problems and their functional solutions. 1 INTRODUCTION People who participate in patchwork and quilting are generally referred to as quilters, and quilters frequently need to cope with mathematics, not just for calculations of fabric sizes and quantities, but also for combinatorial problems. Typically the problems fall into two categories: those concerning patchwork, and those concerning the social side of quilting.

[...] This article of clothing was stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf and provided no support to the male genitals. This allowed the scrotum unlimited movement under clothing and resulted in injury from carts, carriages with wooden planks for seats or the saddle as the body took all of the force of the motion. The suspensory, was developed around the early 1820s as a way to lift the scrotum away from the plank seat and saddle thereby preventing injury or while in a cart, carriage or horseback riding. Today the suspensory is used primarily as a medical device after genital surgery to aid in post operative healing. General Custer’s suspensory can be seen in the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument museum, near Crow Agency Montana.|$|R
