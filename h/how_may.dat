500|$|In The Rules of Sociological Method (1895), Durkheim {{expressed}} his will {{to establish a}} method that would guarantee sociology's truly scientific character. One of the questions raised by the author concerns the objectivity of the sociologist: <b>how</b> <b>may</b> one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, observation must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a [...] "perfectly objective observation" [...] in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its relation with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege comparison rather than the study of singular independent facts.|$|E
500|$|Battles {{are governed}} by a turn-based {{mechanic}} called the [...] "Press Turn" [...] system. Each character participating in combat, friend and foe alike, provides one or more Press Turns represented in the upper right-hand corner of the screen as icons. The rule behind this system is that any action (attacking, using skills, items, contacting demons, summoning commands) will normally cost one full turn. If a combatant scores a critical hit, exploits their opponent's weakness, or passes on making an action, they gain an additional turn marked by a pulsating icon. These added turns allow characters to perform all actions available within normal turns. If the player chooses to pass on an additional turn, that turn is lost. If an attack fails through missing or blocking, then multiple turns are lost: how many depends on <b>how</b> <b>may</b> combatants avoided or blocked it. An auto-attack option is available, where party members can use standard physical attacks or repeat their actions from the previous turn. Characters can escape from normal battles, with failure forfeiting a player turn. If the main character loses all health, the game ends.|$|E

[...] He pointed to the conduct of Samuel who was faced with similar circumstances and who combined [...] "sweetness with firmness, of consideration with energy, [...] constitute the temper of a perfect public man". Samuel was publicly dismayed at the Israelites' conduct and although he obeyed God in letting the people make their own way he protested [...] "in the most distinct and solemn tone, so as to throw the whole blame of what might ensue on their wilfulness".
