40|$|This study {{examined}} emotional modulation of word processing, {{showing that the}} recognition potential (RP), an ERP index of word recognition, could be modulated by different <b>emotional</b> <b>states.</b> In the experiment, participants were instructed to compete with pseudo-competitors, and via manipulation {{of the outcome of}} this competition, they were situated in neutral, highly positive, slightly positive, highly negative or slightly negative <b>emotional</b> <b>states.</b> They were subsequently asked to judge whether the referent of a word following a series of meaningless character segmentations was an animal or not. The emotional induction task and the word recognition task were alternated. Results showed that 1) compared with the neutral emotion condition, the peak latency of the RP under different <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> was earlier and its mean amplitude was smaller, 2) {{there was no significant difference}} between RPs elicited under positive and negative <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> in either the mean amplitude or latency, and 3) the RP was not affected by different degrees of positive <b>emotional</b> <b>states.</b> However, compared to slightly negative <b>emotional</b> <b>states,</b> the mean amplitude of the RP was smaller and its latency was shorter in highly negative <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> over the left hemisphere but not over the right hemisphere.

40|$|Recognizing <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> is {{becoming}} {{a major part of}} a user's context for wearable computing applications. The system should be able to acquire a user's <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> by using physiological sensors. We want to develop a personal <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> recognition system that is practical, reliable, and can be used for health-care related applications. We propose to use the eHealth platform 1 which is a ready-made, light weight, small and easy to use device for recognizing a few <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> like ‘Sad’, ‘Dislike’, ‘Joy’, ‘Stress’, ‘Normal’, ‘No-Idea’, ‘Positive’ and ‘Negative’ using decision tree (J 48) and k-Nearest Neighbors (IBK) classifiers. In this paper, we present an approach to build a system that exhibits this property and provides evidence based on data for 8 different <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> collected from 24 different subjects. Our results indicate that the system has an accuracy rate of approximately 98 %.

An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication.

The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to <b>emotional</b> <b>state,</b> which serves to communicate between individuals.

Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by Gnosis. KOS-MOS self-activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Federation officer Luis Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and her assistant Allen. KOS-MOS brings them along with Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a Gnosis attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife. During these periods, Shion becomes concerned that KOS-MOS is displaying aberrant behavior, and Allen worries about Shion's <b>emotional</b> <b>state.</b> Alongside these events, the cyborg Ziggy is dispatched to rescue the Realian MOMO from U-TIC, as data stored inside her could open the way to the original planet Miltia, lost in a disaster for which her creator Joachim Mizrahi is blamed.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the trajectories of <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> and their within-person synergies with perceived stress and recovery during a 4 -month training period preceding the French swimming championships. A Multilevel Growth Curve Analysis approach was used with 16 high level swimmers. Five waves of assessments of <b>emotional</b> <b>states,</b> perceived stress and recovery were completed. Results indicated that <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> were characterized by distinct trajectories during the training period preceding a major competition. Specifically, significant positive linear effects of time (i. e., linear increase over time) and negative quadratic effects of squared time (i. e., inverted U shape over time) on anxiety, dejection and anger were observed, whereas the opposite pattern of results was found for happiness and excitement. Moreover, level 2 perceived stress and recovery (i. e., inter-individual predictors) {{were significantly associated with}} athletes’ unpleasant and pleasant <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> respectively. At level 1, perceived recovery (i. e., intra-individual predictor) was positively associated with happiness and excitement and negatively related to anxiety, dejection and anger. Finally, within-person interactions of general stress and recovery with time and squared time reached significance for excitement, whereas within-person interactions of specific and total stress with time and squared time reached significance for anxiety. Overall, this study provided insights into the central role played by perceived stress and recovery on the <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> experienced by high level swimmers. Operational strategies were suggested in order to optimize the stress-recovery balance and in turn the athletes’ <b>emotional</b> <b>states</b> during a complete training program...|$|R
