5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E

5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open <b>floor</b> <b>plans,</b> unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova {{waiting for him in}} his bed and has sex with her; neither are aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at Hagia Sophia to drop off the <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor and, together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the Orient Express. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.|$|E

25|$|Bergfrieds {{very often}} have a square or round floor plan, but {{pentagonal}} towers are also frequently encountered; whilst octagonal towers are rather less common. There are even {{a few examples of}} bergfrieds with irregular polygonal <b>floor</b> <b>plans.</b> A rare form is the triangular bergfried of Grenzau Castle near HÃ¶hr-Grenzhausen or that of Rauheneck Castle near Baden bei Wien. Towers with triangular and pentagonal <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> invariably had a corner facing the main line of attack on the castle.|$|E

25|$|Over the 32 {{years that}} Sears offered homes by catalog, Sears offered 370 {{different}} models. In the early years, the models were identified with numbers. After several years, Sears also begin assigning names {{to the various}} models, a convention that carried {{through to the end}} of the program. Some models were offered with variations, the most common of those being expanded <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> and additional finished living spaces. Sears houses could also be ordered with reversed <b>floor</b> <b>plans.</b> While the vast majority of models were for single-family house designs, Sears did offer a smaller number of duplex family house designs and even a few larger multiple-family buildings.|$|E

50|$|The <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> of {{the church}} is octagonal. The timber roof {{structure}} is a double barrel vault, which is regarded as an elegant solution to roofing over such a <b>floor</b> <b>plan.</b> The overall appearance of the building is Gothic.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>planning</b> (<b>flooring)</b> {{vehicles}} {{is a way}} {{to acquire}} inventory, but can have negative consequences if payments (curtailments or payoffs) are not made on time. Curtailment schedules vary by <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> providers, but generally range from 5%-20% of the original loan proceeds on each vehicle every 30/60/90/120 days. If curtailments are not made or the dealer enters into default their obligations, <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> companies will take action to minimize their exposure. Those actions include attaching to the bond (not all states require dealers to have bonds), repossessing the collateral and other collection efforts.|$|R
25|$|University Suites, {{built in}} the late 1980s, include seven suite {{buildings}} which can also house 400 students. Two <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> consist of six bedroom units housing 12 students and 10 bedroom units housing ten students. All residents of the Suites share bathrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. University Suites are home to various sororities who have personalized suites in the area.|$|E
25|$|In his affidavit, Weir recounted when in March 1976 he {{had gone}} to the farm where between eight and ten men dressed in {{camouflage}} had been parading in the farmyard. Inside he had discussed with Mitchell and others the details of a planned bombing and shooting attack against a nationalist pub, Tully's in Belleeks. Mitchell had shown him the <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> of the pub's interior which he had drawn up highlighting the lack of escape routes for the pub's patrons. The plan was temporarily called off when it was discovered that the British Army's Parachute Regiment was on patrol that evening in the area. Weir returned to Belfast the next day and the attack went ahead that evening, 8 March. There were no casualties, however, as Mitchell's <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> had been inaccurate, and the customers had fled into the pub's living quarters for safety once the shooting had commenced outside, and the bomb only caused structural damage to the building.|$|E
25|$|Palenque-style {{architecture}} {{was apparently}} superimposed {{on the local}} buildings, giving further credence to the theory that Comalcalco was conquered by Palenque's B'aakal kingdom and perhaps even became a successor state. Similarities with Palenque's architecture abound and include <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> of temples, vaulted ceilings and built-in altars. Several bricks show drawings of temples with roof combs, another feature of Palenque, though no roof combs have survived into modern times.|$|E

25|$|Rooms {{sheathed}} in dazzling polished white marble were given richly varied <b>floor</b> <b>plans,</b> shaped with niches and exedras that concentrated or dispersed the daylight. There were pools in the floors and fountains splashing in the corridors. Nero took {{great interest in}} {{every detail of the}} project, according to Tacitus' Annals, and oversaw the engineer-architects, Celer and Severus, who were also responsible for the attempted navigable canal with which Nero hoped to link Misenum with Lake Avernus.|$|E
25|$|Architect James Hoban's {{original}} <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> show {{a similar}} room, but with single columns separating the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall, {{and with the}} Grand Stair entering into the Cross Hall. Mid-19th century photographs show the room as rebuilt by Hoban following the 1814 White House fire. In these photographs two Ionic columns support a series of shallow arches, and a frieze of bas-relief anthemion encircling the room. The shafts of Hoban's columns are recorded as being a blue marble.|$|E
25|$|The late 20th {{century has}} seen {{a change in the}} {{faithfulness}} of emulation of the style, since in a modern development it is common to have only a few basic <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> for buildings, these combined with variations in interior surface treatment and in the exterior in rooflines and setbacks to provide a visual variety to the street view. Owing to the smaller lots employed in modern developments (especially in the Western US), Tudor Revival may be placed directly next to an unrelated style such as French or Italian Provincial, resulting in an eclectic mix.|$|E

25|$|In March 2011, indoor maps {{were added}} to Google Maps for Android, giving users the ability to {{navigate}} themselves within buildings such as airports, museums, shopping malls, big-box stores, universities, transit stations, and other public spaces (including underground facilities). In July 2013, a revised version of Google Maps added support for Apple iOS devices, including iPads and iPhones. Google encourages owners of public facilities to submit <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> of their buildings in order to add them to the service. Map users can view different floors of a building or subway station by clicking on a level selector that is displayed near any structures which are mapped on multiple levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{two towers}} contain {{identical}} <b>floor</b> <b>plans.</b> The bottom 19 floors form an exposed spiral parking ramp operated by valet with approximately 896 parking spaces. The 20th floor of each contains a laundry room and gym with panoramic {{views of the}} Loop, while floors 21 through 60 contain apartments (450 per tower). A 360-degree open-air roof deck lies on the 61st and top story. The buildings are accessed from separate lobbies that share a common below-grade mezzanine level as well as ground-level plaza entrances beside the House of Blues. Originally rental apartments, the complex converted to condominiums in 1977, but still contains a number of rental units.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{ranch house}} style {{has its roots}} in North American Spanish colonial {{architecture}} of the 17th to 19th century. These buildings used single story <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> and native materials in a simple style {{to meet the needs of}} their inhabitants. Walls were often built of adobe brick and covered with plaster, or more simply used board and batten wood siding. Roofs were low and simple, and usually had wide eaves to help shade the windows from the Southwestern heat. Buildings often had interior courtyards which were surrounded by a U shaped floor plan. Large front porches were also common. These low slung, thick-walled, rustic working ranches were common in the Southwestern states.|$|E
40|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>plan</b> {{construction}} {{is the basis}} for fingerprint-based localization and people's activity learning, especially in the environments where the geometrical map is not available or does not exist. To this end, we propose a new received signal strength (RSS) fragment matching approach to identify the location points (LPs) in <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> as the overlapped pieces between the fragments. Then, by means of the Smith-Waterman alignment, each LP can be recognized as a winning path in scoring space. Finally, we use the Allen's interval algebra to assemble the time-stamped LPs into a <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> in target area. The experiments with the actual Wi-Fi RSS measurements recorded in HKUST campus demonstrate that our proposed approach performs better than the conventional K-means clustering and spectral clustering in <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> construction.
