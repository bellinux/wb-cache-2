500|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} was scientifically named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, based on Latham's description. The {{original}} binomial name Columba maculata means [...] "spotted pigeon" [...] in Latin. Latham himself accepted this name, {{and used it}} in his 1790 work Index ornithologicus. Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies' specimen, this can therefore be considered the holotype specimen of the species. Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species; James Francis Stephens suggested that it belonged in the <b>fruit</b> <b>pigeon</b> genus Ptilinopus in 1826, and Johann Georg Wagler instead suggested {{that it was a}} juvenile Nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) in 1827. Tommaso Salvadori listed the bird in an appendix about [...] "doubtful species of pigeons, which have not yet been identified" [...] in 1893. In 1898, Henry Ogg Forbes supported the validity of the species, after examining Nicobar pigeon specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development. He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the Nicobar pigeon, Caloenas. In 1901, Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert agreed that the pigeon belonged to Caloenas, but suggested that it was probably an [...] "abnormity", though more than one specimen had been recorded.|$|E

An example of this is afforded by the banded <b>fruit</b> <b>pigeon</b> of Timor, whose pure white head and neck, black wings and back, yellow belly, and deeply-curved black band across the breast, render it a very handsome and conspicuous bird. Yet this is what Mr. H.O. Forbes says of it: [...] "On the trees the white-headed <b>fruit</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Ptilopus cinctus) sate motionless during {{the heat of the day}} in numbers, on well-exposed branches; but it was with the utmost difficulty that I or my sharp-eyed native servant could ever detect them, even in trees where we knew they were sitting."[66] The trees referred to are species of Eucalyptus which abound in Timor. They have whitish or yellowish bark and very open foliage, and it is the intense sunlight casting black curved shadows of one branch upon another, with the white and yellow bark and deep blue sky seen through openings of the foliage, that produces the peculiar combination of colours and shadows to which the colours and markings of this bird have become so closely assimilated.|$|E

5000|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} was first {{mentioned}} and {{described by the}} English ornithologist John Latham in his 1783 work A General Synopsis of Birds. Latham stated {{that he had seen}} two specimens, in the collections of the British major Thomas Davies and the naturalist Joseph Banks, but it is uncertain how these ended up in the respective collections, and their provenance is unknown. Though Banks received many specimens from the British explorer James Cook, and Davies received specimens from contacts in New South Wales, implying a location in the South Pacific Ocean, there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources. After Davies' death, his specimen was bought by Edward Smith-Stanley, the 13th Earl of Derby in 1812, who kept it in Knowsley Hall. Smith-Stanley's collection was transferred to the Derby Museum in 1851, where the specimen was prepared from the original posed mount (which had perhaps been taxidermised by Davies himself) into a study skin. This museum later became World Museum, Liverpool, where the specimen is housed today (numbered WML 3538), but Banks' specimen is now lost. Latham also mentioned a drawing of a spotted green pigeon in the collection of Ashton Lever, but it is unknown which specimen this was based on; it could have been either, or a third individual. Latham included an illustration of the spotted green pigeon in his 1823 work A General History of Birds, and though it is unknown what he based his illustration on, it differs from Davies' specimen in some details. It is possible that it was based on the drawing in the Leverian collection, since Latham stated that this drawing showed the end of the tail as [...] "deep ferruginous" [...] (rust-coloured), a feature also depicted in his own illustration.The spotted green pigeon was scientifically named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, based on Latham's description. The original binomial name Columba maculata means [...] "spotted pigeon" [...] in Latin. Latham himself accepted this name, and used it in his 1790 work Index ornithologicus.

40|$|The flora at Crater Mountain Biological Research Station in Papua New Guinea is very diverse: 228 {{tree species}} (â‰¥ 10 cm DBH) {{on a single}} hectare. However, the {{vertebrate}} fauna (169 bird and 31 mammal species) is less diverse than many tropical sites. At least 47 % of bird species and 29 % of mammal species are partially frugivorous. Using data on relative abundance, mass, and degree of frugivory for all frugivorous vertebrates at Crater, we generated a crude "index of importance " for each species. Using the fruit size and mass data from 400 plant species, we exclude fruits either too large or too heavy for each frugivore to disperse, yielding a "possible diet " for each species. Four species (a cassowary, a hornbill, a <b>fruit</b> <b>pigeon</b> and a flying fox) stand out as being crucial dispersers for a large subset of the plant community. The frugivore with the highest importance ranking, Casuarius bennetti, is highly effective as a disperser. Cassowaries {{appear to be a}} keystone frugivore, especially for large-fruited plant species (67 species> 50 g at our study site). The method employed is fairly simple and quickly identifies candidates for keystone frugivore status. However, further life history studies are recommended for confirmation of importance when using this method...|$|E
40|$|Two main themes to the avian {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis are, 1. Deep resolution of birds generally, and 2. Investigation of specific aspects of the New Zealand avifauna. More specifically, this thesis covers phylogeny, and predictions about palaeognaths, pigeons, pelecaniforms and passerines. Significant progress is made in resolving the basal branches of Neoaves. This thesis examines whether the six-way basal Neoavian split of Cracraft (2001) is, in principle, resolvable. New mitochondrial genomes are added to improve taxon sampling, break up long branches, and allow testing of the prior assumptions of six Neoavian groups. This research shows the six-way split is resolvable, although more work is required for specific details. From a life-history perspective, {{it is interesting that}} the two bird-of-prey groups (falcons and buzzards) are very divergent, and may not be sister groups. Molecular dating supports major diversification of at least 12 Neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous. Additionally, novel avian mitochondrial gene orders are investigated and a hypothesis put forward suggesting gene conversion and stable intermediate forms allows an apparently rare event (gene rearrangement) to occur multiple times within Neoaves. One of Cracraftâ€™s six groups, informally called the â€˜Conglomeratiâ€™, is particularly difficult to resolve. The pigeons (Columbiformes) lie within the â€˜Conglomeratiâ€™, and this chapter examines two aspects along the continuum of pigeon evolution. Firstly the large South Pacific <b>fruit</b> <b>pigeon</b> radiation is examined with mid-length mitochondrial sequences. This clade contains a third of all pigeon species, and has been very successful in island colonisation throughout South East Asia and the Pacific. Secondly, candidates for the closest relative of pigeons are tested using analysis of whole mitochondrial genomes. Highest support was found for the grouping of sandgrouse and pigeon, although they are clearly very divergent. Also within the â€˜Conglomeratiâ€™ is the traditional order Pelecaniformes, and their close allies the Ciconiiformes. These orders (the P&C) are part of an adaptive radiation of seabird water-carnivores, including loons, penguins, petrels and albatrosses. This group is separate from the large shorebird water-carnivore group; although both appear to have begun radiating abut 70 million years ago. The tropicbird represents a separate, convergent life history and {{is not part of the}} Pelecaniformes, nor within the larger seabird water-carnivore group. Resolution of the basal phylogeny of oscine passerines is important for interpreting the radiation of this group out of the Australasian region. Many endemic New Zealand oscine passerines belong to â€˜basal corvidâ€™ lineages, but have not previously been investigated with mitochondrial DNA. This chapter shows that many â€˜basal corvidâ€™ lineages are actually â€˜basal passerineâ€™ lineages, and there is a discrepancy between nuclear Rag- 1 phylogenies (the most commonly used gene in passerine phylogenetics) and other phylogenies, including mitochondrial, that requires further investigation. Taken as a whole, this thesis adds significantly to our understanding of the evolution of birds, and provides a foundation for future research, not only of phylogenetic relationships, but also of avian life history, long-term niche stability and macroevolution...|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal via animal link vectors (endozoochoric dispersal) may explain how most Burseraceae {{were able to}} expand their range so efficiently across the globe. Beiselia, Boswellia, and Triomma have dry fruits better suited for wind dispersal, but most Burseraceae have fleshy, edible fruit that is eaten by many animal dispersers. The seeds may provide a high reward in fat (24-73%) and protein (2.7-25.9%) if digested, but many animals eat just the fleshy part of the fruit and either discard the endocarp right away or excrete it some time later. Some known Burseraceae fruit consumers include hornbills (Buceros bicornis, Ceratogyma atrata, C. cylindricus, Penelopides panini), oilbirds (Steatnoris caripensis), <b>fruit</b> <b>pigeons,</b> warblers, vireos, orioles, flycatchers, tanagers, woodpeckers, loeries, primates (Cercopithecus spp., Lophocebus albigena), lemurs (Varecia variegate subsp. variegate), and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus).

This thesis intended to collect and analyze the baseline data required {{for the management of}} pigeons, which take into account their importance as a resource but also their overall conservation value. For this, I used a combination of biological and social sampling methods. The results show that harvest of endemic pigeons is performed predominantly for commercial purposes by a small and specialized group of hunters, but is also widely practiced opportunistically by most hunters and rural inhabitants. The hunting pressure on the two least abundant species already determines their patterns of distribution and abundance, and their extraction is probably unsustainable. Harvesting of the most hunted species is potentially sustainable, but more research is essential to the definition of measures to manage the species. Only one species is not commercially hunted and exploitation for subsistence is sustainable. The conservation of the species on the long term requires the development of specific measures; it is essential to promote legal restrictions on hunting and trading, to search for economic alternatives for bird hunting and define strategies of education / awareness of consumersFCT - PhD grant and the I&D project â€œEndemic pigeons of SÃ£o TomÃ©: developing science-based conservation and sustainable use of African pigeons...|$|R
6000|$|In {{all cases}} the seeds {{themselves}} are protected from injury by various devices. They {{are small and}} hard in the strawberry, raspberry, currant, etc., and are readily swallowed among the copious pulp. In the grape they are hard and bitter; in the rose (hip) disagreeably hairy; in the orange tribe very bitter; and all these have a smooth, glutinous exterior which facilitates their being swallowed. When the seeds are larger and are eatable, they are enclosed in an excessively hard and thick covering, as in the various kinds of [...] "stone" [...] fruit (plums, peaches, etc.), or in a very tough core, as in the apple. In the nutmeg of the Eastern Archipelago we have a curious adaptation to a single group of birds. The fruit is yellow, somewhat like an oval peach, but firm and hardly eatable.
