In 1917, Herbert won a landmark lawsuit before the United States Supreme Court that gave composers, through ASCAP, a right to charge performance fees for the public performance of their music. ASCAP commissioned a statue in Herbert's honor in New York City's Central Park, erected in 1927.|$|E

[...] Following the president's remarks, an overture from Semiramide, [...] "On the Field of Glory", was played. [...] General Oliver O. Howard then spoke about his interactions with McClellan and General Grenville M.

Veterans' graves will be obliterated by time, but the grandest monument of the service of valor of the soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, the United States of America, the hope and joy of the world, consecrated to liberty by the blood and treasure of the nation, the undying testimonial of the patriotism of her people, will continue years and years."

2500|$|A {{gas panel}} or gas {{manifold}} is the control equipment for supplying the breathing gas to the divers. Primary and reserve gas is supplied {{to the panel}} through shutoff valves from a low-pressure compressor or high-pressure storage cylinders ("bombs", [...] "quads", or [...] "kellys"). The gas pressure may be controlled at the panel by an industrial pressure regulator, or it may already be regulated closer to the source (at the compressor, or at the storage cylinder outlet). The supply gas pressure is monitored on a gauge at the panel, and an over-pressure valve is fitted in case the supply pressure is too high. The gas panel may be operated by the diving supervisor if the breathing gas is air or a fixed ratio premix, but if the composition must be controlled or monitored during the dive it is usual for a dedicated gas panel operator, or [...] "gas man" [...] to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
