40|$|Abstract: The {{problem is}} {{considered}} of tracking and recognizing articulated and rigid dynamically interacting objects in complex scenes from a static camera. A novel approach is considered for tracking and recognition {{which is based}} on different feature selection strategies applied to an initially redundant set of significant shape points (i. <b>e.</b> <b>corners).</b> Short-term and long-term memory models are used in a cooperative scheme. The two level feature selection strategy used by long-term shape models is described: at the lower level a spatial-temporal voting method is used to assess temporal stability of spatial groups of corners; at the higher level, a supervised self-organizing scheme is used for feature selection preserving discriminating and expressive power of features related to examples of well-separated objects. It is shown that the proposed scheme fits well with requirements of a real-time surveillance system. ...|$|R

Experimental results are presented, showing the increase in reliability of the observed features after fusing information from both sensors. 1 Introduction Robu [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{data-driven}} approach that extracts prior information for segmentation {{of the left}} ventricle in car-diac MR images of transplanted rat hearts. In our approach, probabilistic priors are generated from prominent features, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>corner</b> points and scale-invariant edges, for both endo-and epi-cardium segmentation. We adopt a level set formula-tion that integrates probabilistic priors with intensity, texture, and edge information for segmentation. Our experimental re-sults show that with minimal user input, representative priors are correctly extracted from the data itself, and the proposed method is effective and robust for segmentation of the left ventricle myocardium even in images with very low contrast. More importantly, it avoids inter- and intra- observer varia-tions and makes accurate quantitative analysis of low-quality cardiac MR images possible.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multitarget tracking algorithm {{based on a}} particle filter framework that exploits a sparse distributed shape model to handle partial occlusions. The state vector is composed {{by a set of}} points of interest (i. <b>e.</b> <b>corners)</b> and it enables to jointly describe position and shape of the target. An efficient importance sampling strategy is developed {{to limit the number of}} used particles and it is based on multiple Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature trackers used to estimate local motion. The importance sampling strategy adaptively handles KLT failures and partial occlusions. Particles weights are computed exploiting a shape matching technique combined with object local appearance encoded in color histograms of patches centered on the points of interest constituting the state. The proposed approach does not require background subtraction techniques and overcomes several common difficulties in the tracking domain as partial occlusions, object deformations, scale changes, abrupt motion and non-static background. Extensive experimental results are provided on challenging sequences to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm. 1...|$|R
