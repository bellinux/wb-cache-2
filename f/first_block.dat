5|$|Georgian {{characters}} {{are found in}} two Unicode blocks. The <b>first</b> <b>block</b> (U+10A0–U+10FF) is simply called Georgian. Mkhedruli (modern Georgian) occupies the U+10D0–U+10FF range (shown in {{the bottom half of}} the first table below) and Asomtavruli occupies the U+10A0–U+10CF range (shown in the top half of the same table). The second block is the Georgian Supplement (U+2D00–U+2D2F), and it contains Nuskhuri.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is powered}} by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the <b>first</b> <b>Block</b> II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese Apache AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles for self-defense.|$|E
5|$|The season {{averaged}} 13.74 million American viewers per episode, ranking 17th in viewership {{and ninth}} {{in the key}} adults 18–49 demographic. The <b>first</b> <b>block</b> had an average close to four million more viewers than the second block, with the 14th episode meeting a ratings low for the series, with 11.52 million viewers. However, Lost was the most recorded program of 2007.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} <b>first</b> <b>block</b> of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 2010, the Naval Air Systems Command awarded Bell Boeing a $42.1 million {{contract}} to design an integrated processor {{in response to}} avionics obsolescence and add new network capabilities. By 2014, Raytheon will provide an avionics upgrade that includes Situational awareness and Blue Force Tracking. In late 2009, a contract for Block C upgrades upon the V-22 was awarded to Bell Boeing. In February 2012, the Marine Corps received the <b>first</b> <b>Block</b> C Ospreys; these aircraft feature a new radar, along with additional mission management and electronic warfare equipment. In 2015, options for upgrading all aircraft to the V-22C standard were examined.|$|E
5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The <b>first</b> <b>block</b> erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E

25|$|Any {{adjustment}} of water tariffs requires Cabinet approval. In September 2009, King Abdullah stated that water tariffs {{would not be}} increased. In June 2010 the government announced the first tariff increase since 1997, emphasizing that low-volume consumers would not be affected because the tariff in the <b>first</b> <b>block</b> remained unchanged. The tariff increase, said to amount to only 9% for volumes beyond the <b>first</b> <b>block,</b> would become effective in January 2011. At the same time, the billing cycle was changed from every three months to monthly. Furthermore, tariffs in five governorates were silently substantially increased to {{the same level as}} in Amman. In February 2012 the Cabinet decided to return to the quarterly billing cycle and to further increase tariffs in the higher blocks of consumption.|$|E

25|$|Pope Alexander VII, {{after the}} {{completion}} of the beautiful colonnade designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (built between 1656 and 1665), ordered the demolition of the <b>first</b> <b>block</b> in front of it. He created so the Piazza Rusticucci, the vestibule to Saint Peter's Square. Among the other buildings, which then went lost, there was Palazzo Branconio.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and sewer}} retails tariffs were {{increased}} in 2006 {{throughout the country}} by reducing {{the size of the}} <b>first</b> <b>block</b> of the increasing-block tariff from 8 to 6 cubic meters per month and by increasing the fixed portion of the bill. The volumetric tariff for each tariff block remained unchanged. These modifications were equivalent to an 11% (check) tariff increase.|$|E

25|$|However, {{delays in}} the block I CSM {{development}} pushed AS-204 into 1967. By December 1966, the original AS-205 mission was cancelled, Schirra's crew was named as Grissom's backup, and McDivitt's crew was promoted to prime crew for the LM test mission, re-designated AS-205/208. On January 26, 1967, they were training for this flight, expected to occur in late 1967, in the <b>first</b> <b>block</b> II Command Module 101 at the North American plant in Downey, California.|$|E
