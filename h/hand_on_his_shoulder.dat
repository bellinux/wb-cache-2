500|$|Thompson {{first met}} Janet Reno in November 1975, when {{he applied for}} {{a job as an}} {{assistant}} state's attorney in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was not hired. In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then-incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers. Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then put her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and responded, [...] "I'm only interested in virile men. That’s why I'm not attracted to you." [...] He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate. The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was [...] "a political ploy". Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay, to dismiss him as a [...] "kook".|$|E
500|$|The {{crew of the}} Enterprise {{responds}} to messages received from the SS Tsiolkovsky, a science vessel monitoring {{the collapse of a}} supergiant star. The messages suggest, amid their rounds of laughter, that the crew has been exposed to a sudden hull breach. After the Enterprise secures the Tsiolkovsky via tractor beam, an away team beams over and finds the crew frozen to death in various stages of undress—including one who was taking a shower fully clothed. A woman's body, frozen, falls into Lt. La Forge's (LeVar Burton) hands. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) orders full medical examinations of the away team on their return, and finds La Forge sweating profusely and complaining about the temperature. She orders him to stay in sickbay but he manages to escape, making his way to the quarters of Crusher's son, Wesley (Wil Wheaton). Unaware of La Forge's condition, Wesley shows him a portable tractor beam device and La Forge places an encouraging <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Meanwhile, acting on a hunch by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who had read a book on past starships named [...] "Enterprise" [...] and found a previous mention of someone taking a shower fully clothed in its pages, Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) locates a historical record identifying the ailment as similar to one encountered by Captain Kirk's USS Enterprise. La Forge returns to sickbay, where Dr. Crusher quickly becomes concerned when she realizes that the infection is spread by physical contact. Much of the ship's crew comes {{under the influence of the}} ailment, including Data, who engages in a sexual encounter with Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby). Dr. Crusher, struggling against the effects of the ailment, finds the original antidote documented by Kirk's Enterprise to be ineffective, and begins devising a new version of it.|$|E
2500|$|After {{burning the}} Crandall house down, {{he returns to}} the burial ground with his wife's corpse, {{thinking}} that if he buries the body faster than he did Gage's there will be a different result. The book ends with Louis sitting {{with his back to the}} door playing solitaire, listening to Rachel's reanimated corpse walk up behind him to drop a cold <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> while her voice rasps, [...] "Darling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tag {{opens with}} a {{sequence}} of shots of a modern metropolis, bustling with cars and pedestrian traffic. An unidentified person approaches {{a man on the}} street and places their <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> then flees before their target can turn around. The man looks exasperated for a moment as he realises that he has just been tagged as [...] "It" [...] in a city-wide game of Tag. People begin to scatter in all directions away from him. He runs down the street to a bus, which promptly shuts its door on him and pulls away. People lock themselves into their cars as he approaches, while others duck into nearby buildings; one hides himself in the opposite side of a revolving door to avoid being tagged. Crowds empty off the streets, while others huddle in lines behind the partial cover given by wastebins, scattering when they are spotted.|$|E
2500|$|In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died {{of illness}} earlier that year) as the {{frontline}} commander of Sun Quan's forces, he passed by Lü Meng's garrison {{on his way}} to Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and said, [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E
