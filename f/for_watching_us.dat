6000|$|... "Yes, I've seen them. At least, I {{saw them}} when we first came here. They hung around <b>for</b> a while, <b>watching</b> <b>us,</b> then after a time they disappeared." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{forest is}} also {{accessible}} to visitors <b>for</b> bird <b>watching.</b> Former <b>U.S.</b> President Jimmy Carter once visited {{the forest for}} that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|... "Our {{fighting}} is a savage Indian warfare. The troops and guns are concealed, and <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as we pass along and fire and flee." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went back}} home, {{deciding}} {{to say nothing}} to the women. They {{were sitting in the}} window seat <b>watching</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> mother and Alice and Lettie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish Comrade Downing {{could see}} us now,' said Psmith. 'He always set us down as mere idlers. Triflers. Butterflies. It {{would be a}} {{wholesome}} corrective <b>for</b> him to <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> perspiring {{like this in the}} cause of Commerce.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the best}} you have done for me yet, Mackellar," [...] says he. [...] "With this in my hand I will give him a shog. <b>Watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> at dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So say I, master. Listen. We can't {{get down}} the stair, <b>for</b> they are <b>watching</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> there, {{so we must}} drop from the trap-door and charge through the fire. Then, if we are lucky, back to back and fight it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not fear}} it," [...] said Ravenswood; [...] "there is a fate <b>watches</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and we too {{have a stake}} in the {{revolution}} that is now impending, and which already has alarmed many a bosom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I could bet a crown piece," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "that {{some one}} among this crowd {{is on the}} <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and that before another half hour the Duke of Chateaurouge will {{know that we have}} started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We both {{think that}} it will be {{impossible}} for us to travel north either to Egypt, or to Berber and thence to Suakim. They will be on the <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> everywhere. Our best plan will be to make for Massowah." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{be careful}} here, men," [...] he said. [...] "They may be {{scattered}} along yonder timber belt, <b>watching</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to uncover ourselves. We had better move {{to the right and}} the left, and give the old signal if any of the redskins appear in sight." ...|$|R
6000|$|They had by {{this time}} {{approached}} the castle. [...] "Look, father!" [...] Aline exclaimed, clapping her hands; [...] "they must {{have been on the}} <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> See! they are raising a flag on that staff on the turret, and see, there are your arms blazoned on it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Masouda; [...] "at {{least not}} straight, since {{to do so}} we must pass through the country of the Assassins, who by this day's light will be warned to <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> We must ride through the desert {{mountain}} lands to Emesa, many miles away, and cross the Orontes there, then down into Baalbec, and so back to Beirut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Now,’ said she, ‘come back to table, and to-day it is I that shall say grace, as I {{used to do}} in the old times, {{day about}} with Dick’; and {{covering}} her eyes with one hand, ‘O Lord,’ said she with deep emotion, ‘make us thankful; and, O Lord, deliver us from evil! For the love of the poor souls that <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in heaven, O deliver us from evil.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is monstrous, it is inhuman!" [...] Terence exclaimed, in Portuguese. [...] "Thus {{to seize}} {{harmless}} fishermen, who have so narrowly escaped drowning; {{the sea is}} less cruel than these men. They have taken our boat, too, our dear good boat. What will our mothers think, when we do not return? That we have been {{swallowed up by the}} sea. How they will <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> but in vain!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Peter Mansbridge {{signed off}} his {{broadcasts}} during that time, saying [...] "I'm Peter Mansbridge. Thanks <b>for</b> <b>watching,</b> {{those of you}} here in Canada, and viewers across the United States <b>watching</b> <b>us</b> on C-SPAN." ...|$|R
25|$|The same orbits, with slight adjustments, {{were also}} used by some Soviet spy satellites, with the apogee point over the {{continental}} United States. Although geostationary orbits are useful for observing the continental United States, Soviet sensor technology sometimes required high-contrast observing angles which could only be achieved from higher latitudes. One such example is the US-K early-warning satellite which <b>watches</b> <b>for</b> <b>US</b> missile launches, although improvements in these systems have since allowed them to move these to geostationary orbits.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said she, [...] "come back to table, and to-day it is I that shall say grace, as I {{used to do}} in the old times, {{day about}} with Dick"; and {{covering}} her eyes with one hand, [...] "O Lord," [...] said she with deep emotion, [...] "make us thankful; and, O Lord, deliver us from evil! For the love of the poor souls that <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in heaven, O deliver us from evil." ...|$|R
50|$|The Fleet Support Department is {{responsible}} for term analysis of foreign naval and maritime operations to the fleet, Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and U.S. law enforcement organizations. FSD integrates mainly with the Geo Oriented Cells of ONI. The 24/7 <b>Watch</b> <b>for</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Navy associates itself closely with FSD and Geo Oriented Cells. The Watch floor maintains situational awareness for naval activity {{going on in the}} world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see you understand," [...] he resumed. [...] "The {{worst is}} that you too are an object of suspicion; {{it is known that}} your father is a friend of the President and has {{business}} with him. Well, I have been warned that some of our enemies are in the neighborhood, and they might rouse the peons to attack us. They will know when we left the hacienda and <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> but we can outwit them by waiting a while and then taking another road." ...|$|R
6000|$|After that {{we found}} similar welcomes in many {{succeeding}} stopping-places; and though I did wave a towel out of the window, instead of a pocket handkerchief, and commit other awkwardnesses, from {{not knowing how to}} play my part, yet I fancied, after all, that Scotland and we were coming on well together. Who the good souls were that were thus <b>watching</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> through the night, I am sure I do not know; but that they were of the [...] "one blood," [...] which unites all the families of the earth, I felt.|$|R
60|$|Here the Vrouw Prinsloo was {{the first}} to greet us. We found her {{standing}} in the game path which we were following, quite {{a quarter of a mile}} from the wagons, with her hands set upon her broad hips and her feet apart. Her attitude was so defiant, and had about it such an air of premeditation, that I cannot help thinking she had got wind of our return, perhaps from having seen the smoke of our last fires, and was <b>watching</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> Also, her greeting was warm.|$|R
500|$|In 2004, St. George Illawarra Dragons coach Nathan Brown {{spoke about}} Hunt and a {{discussion}} {{he had with}} recruitment officer Craig Young a year earlier, when Hunt was still under contract with the Broncos. [...] "He's a terrific player. Craig Young who scouts <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>watched</b> him play last year and said give him $80,000 (to lure him to Sydney). I said 'where would we play him?' And he (Young) said 'wing, fullback, centre, five eighth, lock – doesn't matter because he'll play first grade and play for Australia for the next 12 years'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Online gamers {{have also}} used PureVPN to reduce ping issues while {{connecting}} to international gaming servers and preventing virus attacks by rival gamers. Many internet users have also showed interest using PureVPN to easily access content {{which was not}} available in their geo location, thus making it available by connecting to the required region via PureVPN software. In 2016 Netflix banned PureVPN users from accessing their content via VPN from different region by stating [...] "We protect the content and abide by licensing deals & Some providers, in fact, blatantly advertise that their service is <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> Netflix’s <b>U.S.</b> version". Another US based online streaming service Hulu did the similar thing in past, they tried to cut off access for users living outside the US by blocking VPNs and proxies back in 2014. PureVPN's DNS leak issue could be the problem for users but huge choice of servers and lengthy feature list does the repair work well. PureVPN also allows limited servers in few of the regions for Torrenting purposes as stated by TorrentFreak.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} king. 'Shift them near the frontier. Then while they <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> here--they will always <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> here now--we can buy an {{aeroplane}} abroad, and pick them up....' ...|$|R
6000|$|And then {{suddenly}} he {{gave way to}} panic. 'Pestovitch,' he said, clutching his minister's arm, 'they are <b>watching</b> <b>us.</b> I'm not going through with this. They are <b>watching</b> <b>us.</b> I'm going back.' ...|$|R
50|$|We're Seahawks! <b>Watch</b> <b>us</b> soar.|$|R
60|$|She ceased, and I {{could see}} that she was <b>watching</b> <b>us</b> intently through her thin veil. The Sultan also <b>watched</b> <b>us,</b> {{stroking}} his long beard, a look of speculation in his eyes, for evidently this play interested him and he wondered how it would end.|$|R
25|$|The Whatcom County Sheriff's Department {{received}} witness {{reports of}} Jenkins' black BMW SUV towing a boat towards the Canada–US border. Police later found the BMW SUV {{and an empty}} boat trailer at a marina in Blaine, Washington; the engine was still warm. At the time Jenkins was only {{a person of interest}} in the investigation and had not been charged, though Canadian authorities had been alerted to <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> him. <b>U.S.</b> Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) did confirm they had boats patrolling northwest Washington waters looking for Jenkins as early as Wednesday, August 19. Initial media reports were that the US Coast Guard and Canadian authorities chased Jenkins' speedboat as it crossed to Point Roberts, but these reports were later denied by officials.|$|R
60|$|I set my teeth. I {{could see}} that the Archduchess was <b>watching</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
60|$|Xodar <b>watched</b> <b>us</b> {{with his}} grim smile, partly of {{amusement}} and partly malicious gloating.|$|R
60|$|The Satyr and the Ape-man stood <b>watching</b> <b>us</b> {{and making}} other remarks to each other.|$|R
60|$|P.S.--Lance {{is quite}} himself this morning, and {{was up to}} <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> bathing before six o'clock.|$|R
60|$|This, therefore, is {{the reason}} why, {{notwithstanding}} all our weaknesses, and also the rage of Satan, we are kept and preserved in a wicked world; we are compassed round about. Hence, when God asked Satan concerning holy Job, he answered, 'Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?' (Job 1:10). I cannot come at him; thou compassest him, and keepest me out. By this, then, is that scripture opened, 'Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt preserve me from trouble, thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance' (Psa 32:7). And, indeed, it would be comely, if we, instead of doubting and despairing, did sing {{in the ways of}} the Lord: have we not cause thus to do, when the Lord is round about us with sword and shield, <b>watching</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> against the enemy, that he may deliver us from their hand? (Jer 31:12).|$|R
