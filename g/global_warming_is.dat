5|$|First Light is a {{young adult}} science fiction and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, first {{published}} in 2007. The novel follows Peter, who is in Greenland {{with his father and}} mother for research on global warming, and Thea, who lives in Gracehope, an underground colony located below Greenland. First Light explains how <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> melting Gracehope and Peter and Thea's attempt to persuade the people to leave. The novel addresses the effects of global warming as a theme.|$|E
5|$|<b>Global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also {{expected to}} recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. <b>Global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} that <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses {{the possibility of the}} collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 200 {{parasitic}} Plasmodium {{species have}} been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals, and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates. Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P.coatneyi (a model for P.falciparum) and P.cynomolgi (P.vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP {{are similar to those}} employed for humans. Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P.berghei. Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P.relictum is known {{to play a role in}} limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. <b>Global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.|$|E

5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E
5|$|In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two {{million years}} ago, {{there was another}} {{significant}} restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved {{in response to the}} drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH4) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane {{in the context of the}} global carbon cycle, because methane is a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO2 on a 100-year time scale. Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
