5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known clock with a water-powered escapement mechanism, which transferred {{rotational energy}} into intermittent motions, {{dates back to}} 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Iranian engineers inventing water clocks driven by <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> weights in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} is used {{to create}} many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, automotive parts and components, gameboys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including <b>gears),</b> <b>and</b> most other plastic products available today. Injection moulding {{is the most common}} modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.|$|E

50|$|When the {{additional}} predicates in p3 and p4 are functions, {{the results from}} matching p3 and p4 {{are similar to the}} results from p1 and p2 except there is an additional match between <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> circuit and the values for the match hypotheses between (inputgear <b>gear)</b> <b>and</b> (switch circuit), <b>and</b> (secondgear <b>gear)</b> <b>and</b> (div10 circuit), are lower. The next section describes the reason for this in more detail.|$|R
5|$|Laser {{data are}} also used {{horizontally}} in two dimensions. An algorithm provides a real-time position estimation of the robot when enough elements from the landing <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> engines are visible. A confidence index {{is calculated based on}} the number of items collected by lasers. If good data confidence is achieved, the position is updated. This mode is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper firstly {{established}} a three-dimensional modal of <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack transmission system. By using {{finite element analysis}} software the model is analyzed and the first six natural frequencies of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack transmission system are acquired. According to the natural frequencies, actual working speed can be adjusted to avoid resonance. In light of the modal analysis, the transient dynamic finite element model of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack transmission system is established for the transient dynamic analysis. According to the equivalent stress contour of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack in contact progress at various times and based on transient dynamic analysis, contact strength and bending strength of the <b>gear</b> are verified <b>and</b> the maximum equivalent stress position is found, providing a theoretical basis for the optimization of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input sun <b>gear,</b> a force-balancing <b>and</b> planet-alignment 'speeder' <b>gear</b> above the sun gear, a split ring gear that has a fixed lower ring gear coaxial with the sun <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> a rotating upper ring gear also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring gears together. Within the split ring gear is an even number of planet gears between the split ring <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> the sun <b>gear.</b> Each planet gear consists of an upper planet <b>gear,</b> <b>and</b> lower planet <b>gear</b> with the upper <b>and</b> lower planet <b>gears</b> splined together <b>and</b> pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper <b>and</b> lower planet <b>gears.</b> The lower planet gear meshes with the input sun <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> the fixed ring gear while the upper planet gear {{is driven by the}} lower planet <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> meshes with the rotating ring gear...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} larger {{diameter}} <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> chain ring, clearly, offers the best longevity, with much better wear characteristics than smaller <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> chain ring sets and less rounding of the teeth, over time.|$|R
5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
5|$|The story {{picks up}} {{approximately}} {{two weeks after}} the events of Guilty Gear X. In the time following Dizzy's disappearance, the mysterious Post-War Administration Bureau begins secretly investigating the <b>Gears</b> <b>and</b> fighters from previous tournaments for their own needs and ambitions. To achieve their goals the organization has created several mechanical copies of Ky Kiske, the “Robo-Kys”. In addition, fighters find themselves in a reality beyond their control, most notably in the manipulative hands of the villainess I-No, who is revealed to be a servant of “That Man”, the creator of the Gears. Each character provides a different ending to Guilty Gear X2.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, <b>gears,</b> <b>and</b> other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
