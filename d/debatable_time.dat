40|$|The {{concept of}} civil society has for so long been complex, elusive and <b>debatable.</b> <b>Time</b> and again it has {{increasingly}} dominated both political and academic discourses. For the last two decades, there has been proliferation {{of civil society}} organisations especially in developing world whereby the donor community regard them as a universal remedy for underdevelopment and authoritarianism. After failure of several development approaches {{to do away with}} poverty, underdevelopment and dictatorial regimes, civil society has been presented as the beacon of freedom, the fountain for the protection of civil rights and of resistance against state repression. It was also regarded as the mobilizing platform of society for the protection and projection of substantive interests, the compelling force for state moderation, the epitome of popular struggles and civil power as well as a centralforce in political and economic reforms. This report presents findings on a study of state-civil society relationship, the case of Uganda. The main objective {{of this study was to}} “describe and analyze the reality of civil society in Uganda in relation to the theoretical concept of civil society”, therein comprehending the functions, actors and relationship between state and civil society in Uganda. The study process consisted of a desk study of available documentation on civil society concept.  The main findings indicate that civil society organisations in Uganda are more active in the area of service delivery than policy advocacy. Therefore the bilateral function as service deliverers and policy advocates by civil society is far way from being a reality in Uganda. Findings also indicate that the state is less tolerant and uncomfortable with advocacy CSOs but largely cooperates with CSOs dealing in service delivery. The applicability of civil society concept in Uganda’s context is still far away from being achieved due to the fact that the political environment where civil society operates is constrained by the state. It was also revealed that donor funding is the cornerstone for civil society functioning in Uganda...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade many studies have {{exploited}} the BGP data provided by route collector projects to infer an Internet ASlevel topology to perform several analyses, from discovering its graph properties to assessing {{its impact on the}} effectiveness of worm-containment strategies. Nevertheless, the topology that can be extracted from this data is far from being complete, i. e. from this data {{it is not possible to}} infer all the AS connections which actually exist among ASes. This thesis analyses the available data and investigates the contribution of route collectors in terms of AS-level connectivity by taking into account economic and geographic characteristics of the Internet AS-level ecosystem. By leveraging on a new metric, named p 2 c-distance, this analysis shows that the largest amount of ASes currently connected to a route collector belongs to the Internet core, thus the collected data is highly biased and is missing a lot of connections established in the Internet periphery. To address this problem, it should be increased the amount of ASes participating to a route collector project. To this end, this thesis describes how to improve the coverage of route collectors by means of an optimization problem based on the p 2 c-distance metric, which solution quantifies the minimum number of ASes that should join a route collector in order to obtain an Internet AS-level topology as complete as possible. The results show that route collectors are rarely connected to the selected ASes, highlighting that much effort is needed to devise an ideal route collector infrastructure that would be able to capture a complete view of the Internet. These analyses require the ability to infer the economic relationships which rule the exchange of BGP messages between each pair of connected ASes of the topology. Existing economic tagging algorithms do not take properly into account that BGP data has to be purged from spurious routes, usually caused by router misconfigurations on BGP border routers and which shows up during the BGP path exploration phenomenon. In this thesis an economic tagging algorithm which is able to get rid of these spurious routes is described. This algorithm leverages on robust statistical concepts, rather than on <b>debatable</b> <b>time</b> thresholds and questionable graph metrics. The analyses provided in this thesis are further refined considering the geographical distribution of ASes, which in the global AS-level topology are all considered as a single node. A global analysis could lead to misleading results since an AS connection may hide multiple connections located in different geographic regions, possibly regulated by different economic relationships. From this analysis are indeed highlighted peculiar characteristics of regional topologies previously unrevealed, and it is showed that these considerations also affect the estimated number of feeder ASes needed to improve the completeness of the global AS-level topology...|$|E

50|$|Whether a {{particularly}} obsessive attachment is a fixation or a defensible expression {{of love is}} at <b>times</b> <b>debatable.</b> Fixation to intangibles (i.e., ideas, ideologies, etc.) can also occur. The obsessive factor of fixation {{is also found in}} symptoms pertaining to obsessive compulsive disorder, which psychoanalysts linked to a mix of early (pregenital) frustrations and gratifications.|$|R
25|$|The 1982–83 {{season was}} a {{noteworthy}} {{season for the}} club for numerous reasons: former Anderlecht favourite Paul Van Himst was named the new coach, they won the 1982–83 UEFA Cup and the rebuilding of the club stadium began. But in the domestic league, Anderlecht {{had to settle for}} second place behind Standard. Their bid to retain the UEFA Cup in 1983–84 failed at the final hurdle against English side Tottenham Hotspur. Anderlecht reached the final controversially by beating another English side, Nottingham Forest, with a <b>debatable</b> extra <b>time</b> penalty to win 3–2 on aggregate. It was later found Anderlecht had bribed the referee the equivalent of £27,000 to ensure passage to the final.|$|R
50|$|Sacroiliac joints are paired C-shaped or L-shaped joints {{capable of}} {{a small amount of}} {{movement}} (2-18 degrees, which is <b>debatable</b> at this <b>time)</b> that are formed between the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and the ilium bones. The joints are covered by two different kinds of cartilage; the sacral surface has hyaline cartilage and the ilial surface has fibrocartilage. The SIJ's stability is maintained mainly through a combination of only some bony structure and very strong intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments.|$|R
40|$|Classifying {{publication}} venues into top-tier or non top-tier {{is quite}} subjective {{and can be}} <b>debatable</b> at <b>times.</b> In this paper, we propose ConfAssist, a novel assisting framework for conference categoriza-tion that aims to address the limitations in the existing systems and portals for venue classification. We identify various features related to the stability of conferences that might help us separate a top-tier conference {{from the rest of}} the lot. While there are many clear cases where expert agreement can be almost immediately achieved as to whether a conference is a top-tier or not, there are equally many cases that can result in a conflict even among the experts. ConfAssist tries to serve as an aid in such cases by increasing the confidence of the experts in their decision. A human judgment sur-vey was conducted with 28 domain experts. The results were quite impressive with 91. 6 % classification accuracy...|$|R

To the Welsh and Irish looking east, Mercian rulers still kept all their old regality until Æthelflæd's death in 918, and Nick Higham argues that: [...] "Celtic visions of Æthelred and Æthelflæd as king and queen certainly offer a different, and equally valid, contemporary take on the complex politics of this transition to a new English state." ...|$|R
5000|$|The duc d'Enghien was {{the last}} {{descendant}} of the House of Condé; his grandfather and father survived him, but died without producing further heirs. It is now known that Joséphine and Madame de Rémusat had begged Bonaparte for mercy towards the duke; but nothing would bend his will. Whether Talleyrand, Fouché or Savary bore responsibility for the seizure of the duke is <b>debatable,</b> as at <b>times</b> Napoleon was known to claim Talleyrand conceived the idea, while at other times he took full responsibility himself. On his way to St. Helena and at Longwood, Napoleon asserted that, in the same circumstances, he {{would do the same}} again; he inserted a similar declaration in his will, stating that [...] "it was necessary for the safety, interest, and the honour of the French people when the Comte d'Artois, by his own confession, was supporting sixty assassins at Paris." ...|$|R
40|$|John Terborgh (1989) {{wrote a book}} {{entitled}} 2 ̆ 2 Where Have All the Birds Gone? 2 ̆ 2 and numerous other articles on the same theme. There was {{an article in the}} Lincoln, NE Sunday Journal-Star, June 19, 1994 concerning dwindling bird numbers on the grasslands. The answer to declining bird numbers is the degradation, fragmentation, and loss of habitats. Sometimes ornithologists disagree on whether the breeding habitats or wintering habitats are impacted most, yet there is nearly universal agreement that habitat is the key. Further evidence for the impact of humans on birds can be obtained by noting those species that are flourishing in human-modified environments. Examples of these include Cattle Egret, Ring-necked Pheasant, Northern Bobwhite, Rock Dove, European Starling, House Finch, and House Sparrow. The easy answer is to blame someone else - the Department of Roads, developers, farmers, or urban sprawl. However, I am to blame and so are you, your neighbor, and all other humans. In the rest of this article, I will discuss how we impact habitats. The causes are apparent, but how we deal with them will continue to be <b>debatable.</b> How much <b>time</b> do we have left to debate...|$|R
30|$|Our {{study shows}} that the mean time in bed was 7  h and 29  min in total, {{corresponding}} to 7  h and 37  min for males and 7  h and 20  min for females. As shown in Table 2, males from five sports and females from nine sports showed a mean time in bed of less than 7  h. The 2015 NHK Japanese Time Use Survey revealed that the sleep duration was 7  h and 27  min for males in their 20 s (n[*]=[*] 424) and 7  h and 18  min for females in their 20 s (n[*]=[*] 437) [38]. Since sleep duration is generally shorter than time in bed, our results may suggest that time in bed of Japanese athletes was {{not as long as}} those of age-matched general populations. At present, it is unclear and <b>debatable</b> whether a <b>time</b> in bed that {{is the same as the}} general population is sufficient for athletes. However, some researchers recommend a longer nocturnal sleep, i.e., 8 – 10  h [39 – 41] for athletes. Samuels and Alexander [40] recommend 8 – 10  h of nocturnal sleep plus a 30 -min nap between 2 and 4  pm for athletes. Bompa and Haff [41] reported that athletes require 9 to 10  h of sleep, 80 – 90 % of it during the night. Rountree [42] recommends sleep extension with a longer training-practice time. Our results suggest that the time in bed of elite Japanese athletes is inconsistent with their recommendations.|$|R
40|$|Open Educational Resources (OERs) are {{becoming}} a prominent tool to raise the profile of universities. Millions of pounds are being invested in Higher Education to {{enhance the quality of}} resources (Nikoi et al., 2011). However, it is <b>debatable</b> if this <b>time</b> and money is well spent (Littlejohn et al., 2008). It takes time for academics to learn the necessary skills to produce OERs, but are these fit for purpose from a students’ perspective? Richter et al., (2012, p. 171) have argued that ‘one of the main barriers identified by professionals, policymakers, and learners for (re) using OERs is the uncertainty as to whether higher education and adult education resources are appropriate and match the learners’ own educational contexts’. At the University of Northampton, we have a very small maths/statistics support unit, (1 full time tutor). Therefore it is important we have an online presence to complement the face to face interaction. The majority of our online provision takes the form of educational videos. This paper will disseminate the results of research collaboratively undertaken on what students at the University of Northampton actually want from, and think about Educational videos. Essentially, our primary goal was to determine what makes educational videos appealing to students to support learning development, and in particular, SPSS/statistics support. Specific aims included: •	Do students engage with these resources? •	Do they impact on the learning / confidence of the student? •	What are the key features (e. g. content, presentation, humour, music, production quality etc.) of ‘good’ educational videos? Data was collected initially from a questionnaire and subsequently from a focus group and, therefore, was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Examining what made videos appealing to students, and equally, investigating what disengaged students provided an insight to improve our current offering, and what should/should not, be included in the production of future statistic/SPSS videos at the University of Northampton...|$|R
40|$|This thesis report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Bachelors of Arts in English at the Department of English and Humanities of BRAC University, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 32 - 33). The study attempts to illustrate how Kurt Vonnegut, Martin Amis and Julian Burnes depict time in keeping with postmodernist practice and the three novelists present a new aspect of time. In the introductory part, the paper has talked about the long-established ideas on <b>time</b> and some <b>debatable</b> points of <b>time.</b> In the next part, the study has tried to depict how time is structured in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth century English literature. In {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} century, the novels are based on traditional concept of time. It indicates clock-governed fiction. The 20 th century novel talks about new psychology and the paper argues that psychology has a great connection with time. Later the research has explained that postmodern novelists talk about a new reality that it is a reality beyond over a reality. In Slaughterhouse- 5, time is connected with the glorification of science fiction. Time in Slaughterhouse-five is science fiction time. In Time’s Arrow, we realize that nothing is correct in the world. Neither Tod Friendly nor Tony Webster can comprehend reality as well as time. They even do not know themselves. So, it is not possible for them to realize time. In The Sense of an Ending, Julian Burnes demonstrates that memory and time are interconnected. Tony Webster tries to construct his memory but his memory is fragmented. Like Billy Pilgrim and Tod Friendly, we see divided self in Tony Webster’s personality. The research tries to discuss, compare and contrast Slaughterhouse-five, Time’s Arrow, and The Sense of an Ending with some theories and books. Finally, the research tries to elucidate that time in the postmodern novel is totally different from the novels of eighteenth and nineteenth century because new ideologies and World War I and World War II and there is no particular definition and ideology of time in postmodern novels.

6000|$|There was an inlaid ivory door, set in lintel and posts crusted with looking-glass--all {{apparently}} old work. This {{opened into}} a darkened room {{where there were}} gilt and silver charpoys, and portraits, in the native fashion, of the illustrious dead of Boondi. Beyond the darkness was a balcony clinging to the sheer side of the Palace, {{and it was then}} that the Englishman realised to what a height he had climbed without knowing it. He looked down upon the bustle of the Treasury and the stream of life flowing {{into and out of the}} Gate of the Fishes where the big drums lie. Lifting his eyes, he saw how Boondi City had built itself, spreading from west to east as the confined valley became too narrow and the years more peaceable. The Boondi hills are the barrier that separates the stony, uneven ground near Deoli from the flats of Kotah, twenty miles away. From the Palace balcony the road to the eye is clear to the banks of the Chumbul River, which was the <b>Debatable</b> Ford in <b>times</b> gone by and was leaped, as all rivers with any pretensions to a pedigree have been, by more than one magic horse. Northward and easterly the hills run out to Indurgarh, and southward and westerly to territory marked [...] "disputed" [...] on the map in the present year of grace. From this balcony the Raja can see to the limit of his territory eastward, his empire all under his hand. He is, or the Politicals err, that same Ram Singh who was installed by Tod in 1821, and for whose success in killing his first deer, Tod was, by the Queen-Mother of Boondi, bidden to rejoice. To-day the people of Boondi say: [...] "This Durbar is very old; so old that few men remember its beginning, for that was in our father's time." [...] It is related also of Boondi that, on the occasion of the Queen's Jubilee, they said proudly that their ruler had reigned for sixty years, and he was a man. They saw nothing astonishing in the fact of a woman having reigned for fifty. History does not say whether they jubilated; for there are no Englishmen in Boondi to write accounts of demonstrations and foundation-stone laying to the daily newspaper, and Boondi is very, very small. In the early morning you may see a man pantingly chased out of the city by another man with a naked sword. This is the mail and the mail-guard; and the effect is as though runner and swordsman lay under a doom--the one to fly with the fear of death always before him, as men fly in dreams, and the other to perpetually fail of his revenge.|$|R
