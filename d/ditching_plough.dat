The old steward opened the park-gate in such a hurry, that he hung up his pony's chin upon the spikes, and, for aught I know, it hangs there still; but he jumped off, and gave chase to Tom. The ploughman left his horses at the headland, and one jumped over the fence, and pulled the other into the <b>ditch,</b> <b>plough</b> and all; but he ran on, and gave chase to Tom.

Sir John looked out of his study window (for he was an early old gentleman) and up at the nurse, and a marten dropped mud in his eye, so that he had at last to send for the doctor; and yet he ran out, and gave chase to Tom. The Irishwoman, too, was walking {{up to the house}} to beg,--she must have got round by some byway--but she threw away her bundle, and gave chase to Tom likewise. Only my Lady did not give chase; for when she had put her head out of the window, her night-wig fell into the garden, and she had to ring up her lady's-maid, and send her down for it privately, which quite put her out of the running, so that she came in nowhere, and is consequently not placed.|$|R
5000|$|The old road {{is still}} used, {{save a few}} local diversions, from the {{crossing}} with the main Birmingham-Lichfield road (A 38(T), to Littleover {{on the outskirts of}} Derby and here the highway is very straight and well raised, by two to three feet in places, a fine example of a Roman road still in use. William Stukeley wrote that [...] "part of Rigning Way north from Wall was very fair with a high straight bank" [...] and that [...] "upon the hill south of Littleover, Rigning is under the eye as far as Etocetum, and the hills beyond it." [...] At Littleover the road turns to the east as the modern A5250, but named Rykneld Street and later Pastures Hill where a section of road has been examined adjacent to Derby High School and Pineview Gardens, 4 km south west of Derventio, the Roman fort at Little Chester. The buried remains of the Roman road are not visible above ground but include drainage features and construction pits flanked by shallow boundary <b>ditches.</b> <b>Plough</b> scars cutting the Roman road surface indicate that in the post-Roman period the site was used for arable land whilst in the 18th century, it formed part of the Birmingham to Derby turnpike but {{it is also possible that}} by this time, the main road had been diverted onto its present course at Pastures Hill. Archaeological excavation in 2003 by the Birmingham University Field Archaeology Unit identified the presence of a Bronze Age cremation cemetery in the area between the road and Pastures Hill. A Bronze Age cremation urn was recovered as well as evidence for Iron Age occupation indicating the area may have served as a long lived ritual landscape, including Bronze Age to Roman activity in the Roman road’s alignment. It has been suggested that the Bronze Age cremations could have been laid out along the line of a Bronze Age trackway which continued to use into, or was returned to use, during the Roman period.The course appears to have been on the west side of Derby passing close to a Roman fort, occupied in 50 AD, at Strutts Park (some finds of pottery from the excavations of the fort are in the collection of Derby Museum). Swan doubts that Ryknild Street went to Strutts Park, which was replaced around 80 AD by the fort at Chester Green on the other side of the River Derwent, the construction of Ryknild Street being contemporary with that of the later fort. Stukeley traced the track of the wall at Chester Green all round enclosing an area, according to his plan, 120 paces from east to west, and 100 paces from north to south, the foundation of the bridge he said could be felt with a staff. and Bishop Bennet in 1817 said that the piers of the bridge could be felt in a dry summer.|$|R

A tanulmány célja az eddigi eredmények rövid bemutatása. 			 | 				The {{idea of the}} {{cooperation}} was raised in 2005 by Aiman Dosymbaeva, archaeologist and Head of the Department of Turkic Heritage. As a leader of a research group consisted mainly of young specialists, she took aim to a previously hardly investigated area of the early mediaeval archaeology, namely, the early Turkic heritage – primarily burials, barrows and sanctuaries located in mountains. The research group very soon had to face many questions, answering which their own efforts seemed to be insufficient. Among these questions the main concerned the problem of relations between nomad tribes and the early towns (mostly located on the Silk Road). Aiman Dosymbaeva suggested us to join their project, but focusing especially on urban and fortified settlements. These settlements, mainly early urban centres were located on the northernmost route of the Silk Road, and existed as early from the 8 th– 9 th C until 13 th– 15 th C. Two institutes participated in this project: Archaeological Institute A. Kh. Margulan of the Ministry of Culture and Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Almaty, and Institute of Archaeological Sciences, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. The cooperation includes two decisive courses: early Turkic Heritage and fortified settlements. The early urban centres of the studied period cannot be considered as Turkic because of their – according to the contemporary written and epigraphic sources – sogdic (iranian) population. The cooperation started in 2007, when a systematic field walking and topographic survey of four sites in South Kazakhstan, Dzhambul region was made (Fig. 1). Two of the investigated objects are early urban fortified settlements (Merke and Aspara), one is a small castle (Tolebi) and one is an opened rock-settlement in Dzhaysan (Dzhaysan 27 –Terekti 1). Merke Merke {{used to be the}} most important early medieval town between Bishkek and Taraz. Located on the river Kara-Su, the settlement was enclosed by at least three lines of city walls, only the inner of which have partially survived. The south-western corner of the city included an impressive citadel, still appearing as the highest point of the former fortifications. Today the territory of the medieval city is almost completely built up, and what has remained is under persistent destruction. The first mention of Merke is known from the 9 th C geographic work compiled by Ibn Khordadbeh. In 928 – 929 Qudamah Ibn Ja’far describes the place as a rich village, and the name Merke also appears in Hudud al-’alam written in 982. The most important and the most detailed is the description made by al-Muqaddisi: “Mirki – medium [city], fortified, has a citadel. The central mosque earlier used to be a church. Emir Amid addaula Fa’iq made a rabat built out of the walls. ” According to later sources, the mongol invasion destroyed the place and it survived until nowadays only as a small village. Some sporadic excavations took place at Merke in 1964, 1986 – 1987 and 2004 – 2006. In 2007 a detailed topographic survey was carried out of the central remains of the medieval town (Fig. 2). Aspara Aspara is a large fortified settlement located 2 km from the border with Kyrgyzstan in the present-day Chaldyvar village. It has a complex layout approximately rectangular in plan and consisted of a still visible moat, gate tower, outer and inner bailey and of an inner moat (Fig. 3). There are clearly visible traces of a palace within the inner bailey. The first source concerning this place is an itinerary from Tang-period (7 th– 8 th C). Ibn Khordadbeh and Ja’kut also mention Aspara in the 9 th– 10 th C. After a long decay, by the late 14 th C Aspara revives as an important castle of Timur. Although the last sources for the castle are known from the 16 th C, its survived toponym indicates the continuous inhabitance of the site up to the present. The object was investigated only in 1964, but neither the material was published, nor the layout was made since then. The only available sketch was prepared around 1940 by A. Bernstam. The new survey carried out in August 2007 resulted in a new detailed plan (Fig. 3, a). Dzhaysan 27 –Terekti 1 Settlement Dzhaysan 27 –Terekti 1 was discovered after an intensive steppe fire in spring, 2007. These were the first known traces of a seemingly permanent settlement in this region. No written sources are available concerning the site or the region inhabited predominantly by nomad Kazakhs. Three main parts of the settlement were identified during the survey. The main one on the northern side of the Terekti stream is consisted of more than thirty dwellings (or rooms) attached to each other. The second part located on the opposite side of the stream is an empty territory encircled by stonewalls seems to have been an irrigated garden. The water was led there from the third part of the site situated cca 250 m west from the settlement itself. This is a well preserved reservoir connected by double or triple ditches with the “garden” (Fig. 4). Tolebi The small castle is located north-east of Tolebi (some 20 km from the regional centre Chu). The object is the best preserved among the investigated sites. The height of its walls in some places reaches 8 – 10 m. The rectangular castle is situated on the former bank of Chu river and surrounded by a moat. Its walls are articulated with corner and middle towers (Fig. 6). The gates seem to have been on the western wall. There are no known written sources concerning the castle and its identification with known from the 11 th-C Khiam is very doubtful. There were neither excavations nor any other research in the castle before 2007. Adetailed plan was made during the first season of cooperation (Fig. 5). Based on the results of the year 2007, Tolebi was chosen for the further and closer research. The reasons of choosing this particular object were: 1. This is a relatively small site and its excavation brings relatively more information concerning the whole structure. 2. This has the best preserved fortifications and architectural features. 3. This one has never been studied before. 4. Its territory is free of serious modern disturbances and was not built in. Since none from the Hungarian team had practice working with structures made of adobe, the first year of excavations was a “teaching” season for getting familiar with the methodology. Due to this a small territory beside the northern wall of the castle was chosen, including some visible remains of a probable inner building, for the first trenches. As the result, three main periods of the settlement were identified datable to the relatively close period. The pottery from all three groups of layers was almost identical, and represented very low variability. The castle was abandoned and bore no traces of intentional destruction. The period of existence of the castle can be dated to the 9 th– 10 th C. There were some traces of the reuse of the remains but no building activity was detected. Remains of a suburban settlement were discovered some 100 m north-west of the castle during a systematic field walk. Unfortunately, the settlement was completely destroyed by irrigation <b>ditches</b> and <b>ploughing.</b> Among the most notable finds a Christian amulet is noteworthy. Conclusion The castle located near Tolebi village was inhabited for a very short period. It can be dated according to the present state of our research to the 9 th– 10 th C. The cause of its abandoning is yet unknown, but must have been peaceful, because the population could left the site taking all the movable and usable objects. It is very important that this date of the castle does not allow us to identify it with Khiam known from the 11 th-C written sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Land {{degradation}} in {{the form}} of soil erosion and nutrient loss is a major constraint to farming activities and agricultural development in the highlands of Ethiopia. Though large-scale conservation projects have been initiated and carried out by the government during the past few decades, the conservation measures introduced have not been sustained by most farmers and land degradation continued to be a problem. The main objective of this research was to examine soil and water conservation practices in the Beressa watershed of the Ethiopian central highlands and identify the constraints and opportunities for a better conservation intervention. The analysis was carried out in view of the history of land use dynamics, farming and livelihood changes, past conservation activities, and policy regime changes. Chapter  2 : Long-term dynamics in land resource use and the driving forces   The dynamics in land resources use between 1957 and 2000 was analysed. It was revealed that the watershed area underwent through substantial land use changes during the 43 -year period. The most important changes were destruction of the natural vegetation cover, increased plantations, and expansion of grazing land. Cropland, which comprised of the largest proportion of the watershed area, increased slightly despite a quadrupling in the density of human population. The land use changes were driven by a combination of several factors; demographic pressure, soil degradation and water scarcity, introduction of cattle breeding program, and policy (land, economic) regime changes. It was indicated that farmers tended to change gradually from sole dependence on annual cropping to tree planting and livestock production to cope with the problems of soil degradation and smaller farm size. Functioning rural markets stimulated farmers to participate in tree planting and selling dung-cakes. Apparently, little {{attention has been paid to}} investments in SWC and local soil fertility amendments to combat degradation problems. It was concluded that increased erosion and related nutrient losses due to limited conservation investments as well as the removal of potentially available soil nutrients through the sale of manure are real threats to the future of agriculture in the area.   Chapter  3 : The dung-cakes threaten agricultural development   The extent of farmers' involvement in making and selling dung-cakes and the implications on agricultural activities in general and soil fertility management in particular was investigated. Estimates of the amount of dung-cakes households sell annually and the loss of soil nutrients was analysed. Data were obtained by employing a combination of methods that include socio-economic survey, soil sample analysis, market survey, discussions with the local farmers and literature review. It was shown that farmers in the downstream part of the watershed area were more involved in dung-cake selling. Most farmers process about 90 % of their cattle manure into the dung-cakes. It was revealed that 40 % of the household income was obtained from the sale of the dung-cakes in the market in Debre Birhan town. On average a farm household exports about 43. 5 kg N, 9. 0 kg P, and 41. 4 kg K y - 1 through the sale of the dung-cakes. While there is increased demand for chemical fertilizers by the farmers, actual utilization is constrained by high and increasing market prices, lack of credit services and risks associated with rainfall failure. It was concluded that poverty, market access, and soil degradation were the most important factors influencing farmers' participation in selling dung-cakes. Chapter  4 : Farmers' knowledge and practices A survey was conducted to explore farmers' perception of erosion problems and soil fertility changes as well as their conservation knowledge and practices in the watershed area. The results showed 72 % of the 147 interviewed farmers recognized erosion problems. But most of the farmers associated severity of erosion problems with the appearance of visual evidence (rills and gullies) only. It was indicated that the majority of the farmers believe erosion could be stopped, and they applied a range of practices for erosion control and fertility improvement; stone terraces/bunds, waterways, drainage <b>ditches,</b> and contour <b>ploughing.</b> It was found that farmers have been changing and adapting the measures to fit local requirements. Apart from erosion control, the farmers also applied various practices for soil fertility maintenance which include crop rotation and animal manure. Though farmers were aware of the multiple benefits of organic matter for fertility improvement, intensity of manure application was largely limited by the use for fuel and sale as well as distant farm locations that impose labour constraints. Farmers tend to accept and use conservation practices that offer them short-term benefits instead of technologies that require long-term investments. It was concluded that conservation interventions should consider farmers' knowledge and practices in the design of conservation technologies.     Chapter  5 : Determinants of adoption and continued use of stone terraces  In this section, the determinants of sustained adoption of introduced stone terraces that have been widely promoted in past conservation interventions were analysed. A sequential decision-making model using the bivariate probit approach was employed to identify the factors influencing farmers' adoption decision and continued investments. The results revealed that adoption was influenced by farmers' age, farm size, perception of the technology's profitability, slope, livestock number, and soil fertility, while the decision to continue using the practice is influenced by actual technology profitability, slope, soil fertility, family size, farm size and participation in off-farm work. The results indicated the importance of household/farm and plot level factors in farmers' conservation decision. It was concluded that: analysis of the determinants of adoption per se may not provide a full understanding of the range of factors influencing farmers' decision of continued investments conservation interventions should not focus only on the biophysical performance of the measures but also on economic benefits that can be obtained to the farmers in the short run a 'blanket approach' to conservation intervention could make the measures inappropriate to local circumstances and eventually unacceptable by the farmers Chapter  6 : Participatory evaluation of soil and water conservation practices A farmer participatory evaluation of currently used SWC practices was carried out. The Regime method in multicriteria analysis was employed to identify the best measures on the different categories of cultivated land based on farmers' evaluation criteria and rankings. It was revealed that farmers consider a range of criteria in choosing the conservation measures. Most of these criteria account for the costs and the benefits relating to the use of the conservation practices. The results indicated stone terraces the best measures on the steep slopes, followed by the waterways. On the medium slopes, soil bunds were considered best measures followed by contour ploughing. And on the gentle slopes where drainage problems were more serious than soil loss, drainage ditches were found to be the best measures. The results further underlined the relevance of farmers' knowledge and experience in the development of appropriate conservation technologies. Chapter  7 : Creating enabling conditions for soil and water conservation A framework for better conservation intervention in the watershed area and other areas of the highlands with comparable situations was developed. The framework comprised of a set of enabling conditions that should be considered at three levels of decision-making, viz. local/household, village/community, and national/regional levels. Participatory technology development and farmers' participation in local level conservation activities were indicated most important. At the village/community level, the interaction between the farmers and extension workers should be improved. In addition, monitoring and evaluation of conservation activities, together with the farmers, was indicated necessary for checking the progress of interventions. It was also noted that national/regional level decisions should support and encourage local level actions by the farmers. Policies related to demographic pressure, security of land tenure, and efficient market and credit services require serious attention...|$|R
