5|$|The {{naturally}} occurring enantiomer of RNA is D-RNA composed of D-ribonucleotides. All chirality centers {{are located in}} the <b>D-ribose.</b> By the use of L-ribose or rather L-ribonucleotides, L-RNA can be synthesized. L-RNA is much more stable against degradation by RNase.|$|E
25|$|In biology, <b>D-ribose</b> must be {{phosphorylated}} by {{the cell}} {{before it can}} be used. Ribokinase catalyzes this reaction by converting <b>D-ribose</b> to <b>D-ribose</b> 5-phosphate.
