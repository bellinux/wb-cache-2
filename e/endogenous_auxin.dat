40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{regulation of}} adventitious root formation induced by flooding {{of the root}} system was investigated in the wetland species Rumex palustris Sm. Adventitious root development {{at the base of}} the shoot is an important adaptation to flooded conditions and takes place soon after the onset of flooding. Decreases in either <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxin</b> or ethylene concentrations induced by application of inhibitors of either auxin transport or ethylene biosynthesis reduced the number of adventitious roots formed by flooded plants, suggesting an involvement of these hormones in the rooting process. The rooting response during flooding was preceded by increased endogenous ethylene concentrations in the root system. The <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxin</b> concentration did not change during flooding-induced rooting, but a continuous basipetal transport of auxin from the shoot to the rooting zone appeared to be essential in maintaining stable auxin concentrations. These results suggest that the higher ethylene concentration in soil-flooded plants increases the sensitivity of the root-forming tissues to endogenous indoleacetic acid, thus initiating the formation of adventitious roots...|$|E

40|$|Polar {{transport}} {{of the natural}} auxin indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) is important {{in a number of}} plant developmental processes. However, few studies have investigated the polar {{transport of}} other <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxins,</b> such as indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA), in Arabidopsis. This study details the similarities and differences between IBA and IAA transport in several tissues of Arabidopsis. In the inflorescence axis, no significant IBA movement was detected, whereas IAA is transported in a basipetal direction from the meristem tip. In young seedlings, both IBA and IAA were transported only in a basipetal direction in the hypocotyl. In roots, both auxins moved in two distinct polarities and in specific tissues. The kinetics of IBA and IAA transport appear similar, with transport rates of 8 to 10 mm per hour. In addition, IBA transport, like IAA transport, is saturable at high concentrations of auxin, suggesting that IBA transport is protein mediated. Interestingly, IAA efflux inhibitors and mutations in genes encoding putative IAA transport proteins reduce IAA transport but do not alter IBA movement, suggesting that different auxin transport protein complexes are likely to mediate IBA and IAA transport. Finally, the physiological effects of IBA and IAA on hypocotyl elongation under several light conditions were examined and analyzed {{in the context of the}} differences in IBA and IAA transport. Together, these results present a detailed picture of IBA transport and provide the basis for a better understanding of the transport of these two <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxins...</b>|$|R

We have proved that constitutive overexpression of PaLAX 1 is accompanied by changes in the content and distribution of free indole- 3 -acetic acid, the major <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxin.</b> The increase in free indole- 3 -acetic acid content in transgenic plants resulted in various phenotype changes, typical for the auxin-overproducing plants.

Exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and the cytokinins benzyladenine (N 6 -benzyladenine, BA) and zeatin {{did not affect}} opening. Jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were slightly inhibitory, but an inhibitor of ABA synthesis' (norflurazon) was without effect.

The auxins indoleacetic acid (IAA) and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) strongly promoted elongation and opening. An inhibitor of auxin transport (2, 3, 5 -triodobenzoic acid, TIBA) and an inhibitor of auxin effects [alpha-(p-chlorophenoxy) -isobutyric acid; PCIB] inhibited elongation and opening.

40|$|Abstract Background One form {{of plant}} {{immunity}} against pathogens involves a rapid host {{programmed cell death}} {{at the site of}} infection accompanied by the activation of local and systemic resistance to pathogens, termed the hypersensitive response (HR). In this work it was tested (i) if the plant growth regulator auxin can inhibit the cell death elicited by a purified proteinaceous HR elicitor, (ii) how far down the process this inhibition can be achieved, and (iii) if the inhibition affects reporters of immune response. The effect of constitutive modulation of <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxin</b> levels in transgenic plants on this cell death program was also evaluated. Results The HR programmed cell death initiated by a bacterial type III secretion system dependent proteinaceous elicitor harpin (from Erwinia amylovora) can be reversed till very late in the process by the plant growth regulator auxin. Early inhibition or late reversal of this cell death program does not affect marker genes correlated with local and systemic resistance. Transgenic plants constitutively modulated in endogenous levels of auxin are not affected in ability or timing of cell death initiated by harpin. Conclusion These data indicate that the cell death program initiated by harpin can be reversed till late in the process without effect on markers strongly correlated with local and systemic immunity. The constitutive modulation of <b>endogenous</b> <b>auxin</b> does not affect equivalent signaling processes affecting cell death or buffers these signals.

A method was developed to monitor the transport of auxin from the shoot to the root in whole seedlings. Subsequently, the transport was monitored after inoculation of roots with the nodulating symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. The sunn mutant showed an increased amount of auxin transported from the shoot to the root compared to the wild type. The auxin transport capacity of excised root segments was similar in wild type and sunn, suggesting that the difference in long-distance auxin transfer between them is due to loading in the shoot. After inoculation, wild-type seedlings showed decreased auxin loading from the shoot to the root; however, the sunn mutant failed {{to reduce the amount}} of auxin loaded.

In the flowers in which fertilization was prevented by emasculation (unfertilized) or entire reproductive organs were removed (depistillated), the elongation of the peduncle was reduced by 20 to 30 %, and vascular development, particularly lignin deposition in sclerenchyma was arrested. Chlorophyll accumulation in sepals and their photosynthetic efficacy was up to 80 % lower in comparison to fertilized flowers. <b>Endogenous</b> <b>auxins</b> were investigated in floral and fruit tissues and their potential roles in these processes were discussed.

This deficiency resulted {{from the lack of}} synthesis of the precursor aminolevulinic acid (ALA) through the chloroplastic Beale pathway; the low productive unusual ALA synthesis through the mitochondrial Shemin pathway (commonly used by animals and fungi) functioned but further at a limited rate due to inhibition of ALA-dehydratase by benzoic derivatives, predominant among the phenolic acids of these cells (compared to normal ones). A thorough investigation of the metabolic and hormonal functioning of these neoplastic cells showed that the above deviation originated from a disturbed nitrogen metabolism that diverted glutamate from the Kreb's cycle into polyamine (over) synthesis, which had also as consequence a low ethylene production. The Kreb's cycle could be replenished by oxaloacetate and malate deriving from the anaplerotic fixation of CO 2 onto phosphoenolpyruvate. A privileged pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) allowed the formation of substrates for a non-limited biosynthesis of (<b>endogenous)</b> <b>auxins</b> and cytokinins. The PPP, through NAD(P) H formation, enhanced nitrogen metabolism, but also, together with a putative H 2 O 2 accumulation (originated from high superoxide dismutase activity and high polyamine oxidation combined with low catalase activity), favoured the alternative respiratory pathway.

We identify elevated auxin levels at the root apex in columella cells, the site of gravity perception, and an asymmetric auxin flux from these cells to the lateral root cap (LRC) and toward the elongation zone after gravistimulation. We differentiate between an efflux-dependent lateral auxin transport from columella to LRC cells, and an efflux- and influx-dependent basipetal transport from the LRC to the elongation zone. We further demonstrate that <b>endogenous</b> gravitropic <b>auxin</b> gradients develop even {{in the presence of}} an exogenous source of auxin. Live-cell auxin imaging provides unprecedented insights into gravity-regulated auxin flux at cellular resolution, and strongly suggests that this flux is a prerequisite for root gravitropism...|$|R
40|$|The <b>endogenous</b> {{levels of}} <b>auxin</b> and {{cytokinin}} in teratoma and unorganized tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. var Wisconsin # 38) crown gall tumor tissues were determined. Teratoma tissues contain levels of auxin and cytokinin favorable for shoot formation, whereas unorganized tumors contain levels of auxin that suppress shoot formation. This conclusion {{is based upon}} the observation that when levels of auxin and cytokinin similar to those found in a teratoma were added to the growth medium of nontumorous tobacco tissue, shoot formation resulted; when levels similar to those found in unorganized tumors were added, the normal tissue grew as unorganized callus...|$|R
40|$|Christmas rose (Helleborus niger L.), {{a native}} {{perennial}} of southeastern Europe, {{is characterized by}} an interesting phenomenon {{in the world of}} flowering plants: after fertilization perianth becomes green, photosyntheticaly active, and persists during fruit development. Removal of the reproductive organs (anthers and camels) affects the elongation and vascular anatomy of flower stalk, prevents complete perianth greening, and promotes perianth senescence. <b>Endogenous</b> plant hormones <b>auxins,</b> gibberellins and cytokinins, identified and quantified in floral and fruit tissues, are shown to regulate reproductive development. Dynamics of these signaling molecules are summarized and their potential role in coordination of floral organ development are discussed...|$|R
