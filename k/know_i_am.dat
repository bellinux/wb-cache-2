Steinitz actively supported this endeavor, as {{he thought he was}} becoming too old to remain world champion– he wrote in his own magazine [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not fit to be the champion, and I am not likely to bear that title for ever".|$|E

[...] Colbert also dressed as Flickerman on his show, prior to the stunt, to announce the candidates who had ended their runs in the 2016 election.|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 2013, it was {{announced}} that Chamakh had been loaned to West Ham United {{until the end of the}} 2012–13 season. The loan deal was confirmed on West Ham's official site with the striker saying, [...] "I didn't have opportunities to play recently, but I did well before and I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a very good striker. We played only one striker at Arsenal, so I didn't play a lot, so I hope to do so more with West Ham." [...] He played only three games for West Ham without scoring.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Hutchins {{was with}} Hillenburg in Rocko's Modern Life working on {{animation}} sound. Hutchins {{was approached by}} Hillenburg to do music for the show. He was asked for [...] "20 things, like an ocean liner horn," [...] and Hutchins knew he had the music Hillenburg was looking for. Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes." [...] He recorded the sound to a tape and met Hillenburg by the gate. Hutchins said [...] "He was about as happy as you could imagine, and off he went. Next thing you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> working on the show." [...] Hutchins became the regular series sound designer.|$|E

I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing... Regrettably, this is not to be." [...] Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said, of Armstrong, [...] "He was the best, and I will miss him terribly." [...] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that: [...] "As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own".|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I want him to <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E
500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in a Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham {{may have been a}} better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." [...] Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E

2500|$|Debussy {{spent years}} {{trying to find a}} {{suitable}} venue for the premiere of Pelléas et Mélisande, realising he would have difficulties getting such an innovative work staged.

2500|$|In 1922, Taft {{proposed}} {{that members of}} the Court accompany him to Philadelphia on a ceremonial occasion, but McReynolds refused to go, writing: [...] "As you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not always to be found when there is a Hebrew abroad. Therefore, my 'inability' to attend must not surprise you." [...] McReynolds refused to sit next to Brandeis (where he belonged on the basis of seniority) for the Court photograph in 1924. [...] "The difficulty is with me and me alone," [...] McReynolds wrote Taft. [...] "I have absolutely refused to go through the bore of picture-taking again until there is a change in the Court, and maybe not even then." [...] Taft capitulated, and no photograph was taken that year.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E
