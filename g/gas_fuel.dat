40|$|Currently, {{nearly all}} {{refrigeration}} systems in industrial processes {{are driven by}} electric motors. Natural gas has a negligible share of the industrial refrigeration market. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify opportunities for and potential barriers to the use of <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> refrigeration in industrial processes. A large number of industrial processes were surveyed to determine their potential for <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> refrigeration. Three processes were selected for further analysis using Pinch Technology. Cogeneration proved to be the most cost-effective way to incorporate <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> refrigeration in all three processes. Significant energy cost reductions can be achieved at paybacks of less than three years. It was concluded that the thermodynamically most efficient system to provide <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> refrigeration must, in general, include a heat engine. ...|$|R

25|$|Power to gas is a {{technology}} which converts electrical {{power to a}} <b>gas</b> <b>fuel.</b> There are 2 methods, {{the first is to}} use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{energy content}} of waste {{products}} can be harnessed directly by {{using them as}} a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating {{and the use of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> (see above), to fuel for boilers to generate steam and electricity in a turbine. Pyrolysis and gasification are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited oxygen availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high pressure. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as activated carbon. Gasification and advanced Plasma arc gasification are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas (syngas) composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam.|$|E

2500|$|Sulfuric acid is used {{in large}} {{quantities}} by the iron and steelmaking industry to remove oxidation, rust and scaling from rolled sheet and billets prior to sale to the automobile and major appliances industry. Used acid is often recycled using a spent acid regeneration (SAR) plant. These plants combust spent acid with natural gas, refinery <b>gas,</b> <b>fuel</b> oil or other fuel sources. This combustion process produces gaseous sulfur dioxide (...) and sulfur trioxide (...) which are then used to manufacture [...] "new" [...] sulfuric acid. SAR plants are common additions to metal smelting plants, oil refineries, and other industries where sulfuric acid is consumed in bulk, as operating a SAR plant is much cheaper than the recurring costs of spent acid disposal and new acid purchases.|$|E
2500|$|A 2011 {{study by}} noted climate {{research}} scientist, Tom Wigley, {{found that while}} carbon dioxide (...) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in [...] forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due {{to changes in the}} emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced [...] emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al. (2013) and Alvarez et al. (2012) note that estimated that leakage from gas infrastructure is likely to be underestimated. These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a [...] "cleaner" [...] fuel is questionable. A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage.|$|E
