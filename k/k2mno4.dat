5000|$|KMnO4 (violet) → <b>K2MnO4</b> (green) → MnO2 (brown/yellow suspension) ...|$|E
50|$|This {{reaction}} {{illustrates the}} relatively rare role of hydroxide as a reducing agent. Solutions of <b>K2MnO4</b> are generated by allowing {{a solution of}} KMnO4 in 5-10 M KOH to stir for a day at room temperature followed by removal of MnO2, which is insoluble. The concentration of <b>K2MnO4</b> in such solutions can be checked by measuring their absorbance at 610 nm.|$|E
5000|$|In the laboratory, <b>K2MnO4</b> can be {{synthesized}} by heating {{a solution}} of KMnO4 in concentrated KOH solution followed by cooling to give green crystals: ...|$|E
5000|$|The salt is isostructural with <b>K2MnO4,</b> K2SO4, and K2CrO4. The solid {{consists}} of K+ and the tetrahedral FeO42− anion, with Fe-O distances of 1.66 Å. [...] The poorly soluble barium salt, BaFeO4, is also known.|$|E
5000|$|<b>K2MnO4</b> is a salt, {{consisting}} of K+ cations and MnO42− anions. X-ray crystallography {{shows that the}} anion is tetrahedral, with Mn-O distances of 1.66 Å, ca. 0.03 Å longer than the Mn-O distances in KMnO4. [...] It is isostructural with potassium sulfate.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{manganate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula <b>K2MnO4.</b> This green-colored salt is an intermediate {{in the industrial}} synthesis of potassium permanganate (KMnO4), a common chemical. Occasionally, potassium manganate and potassium permanganate are confused, but they are different compounds with distinctly different properties.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium {{manganate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula Na2MnO4. This deep green solid is a rarely encountered analogue of the related salt <b>K2MnO4.</b> Sodium manganate is rarely encountered because it cannot be readily prepared from the oxidation of manganese dioxide and sodium hydroxide. Instead this oxidation {{stops at the}} level of Na3MnO4, and this Mn(V) salt is unstable in solution. [...] Sodium manganate can be produced by reduction of sodium permanganate under basic conditions: ...|$|E
5000|$|The manganate(VI) ion is a d1 ion and is {{tetrahedral}} with bond {{angles of}} approximately 109.5°. The Mn-O bond lengths in BaMnO4 and <b>K2MnO4</b> are identical at 1.66 Å. In comparison, the Mn-O bond length in MnO4 2- {{is longer than}} in MnO4− of 1.56 Å and shorter than the Mn-O bond found in MnO2, 1.89 Å. Barium manganate is isomorphous with BaCrO4 and BaSO4. Barium manganate can appear as a dark blue or green to black crystals. [...] Barium manganate is indefinitely stable, active and can be stored for months in dry conditions.|$|E
50|$|Concentrated {{sulfuric acid}} reacts with KMnO4 to give Mn2O7, {{which can be}} explosive. The {{reaction}} of permanganate with concentrated hydrochloric acid gives chlorine. The Mn-containing products from redox reactions depend on the pH. Acidic solutions of permanganate are reduced to the faintly pink manganese(II) ion (Mn2+) and water. In neutral solution, permanganate is only reduced by three electrons to give MnO2, wherein Mn is in a +4 oxidation state. This is the material that stains one's skin when handling KMnO4. KMnO4 spontaneously reduces in an alkaline solution to green <b>K2MnO4,</b> wherein manganese is in the +6 oxidation state.|$|E
