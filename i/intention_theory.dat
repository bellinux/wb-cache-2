40|$|This {{qualitative}} study among 591 business students from four European countries investigated cross-country {{differences in the}} kind of barriers people perceive to business start-up.

Normative structures, defined as national culture, did not explain cross-country differences in perceived risk as start-up barrier. In Norway and The Netherlands, students reported risk perceptions more often than in Romania and Russia, whereas the latter countries are known to be more uncertainty avoidant. These results aid in developing a theory of entrepreneurial barriers, which could be used to extend current entrepreneurial <b>intentions</b> <b>theories</b> in order to predict actual start-up behaviour better.

By drawing on theory of planned behavior, we investigate how intentional founders, successors, and employees differ {{in terms of}} locus of control and entrepreneurial self-efficacy as well as independence and innovation motives. We find that transitive likelihood of career intent depends on degree of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the independence motive. Unexpectedly, we see that high levels of {{internal locus of control}} lead to a preference of employment, which challenges traditional entrepreneurship research and suggests that the feasibility of an entrepreneurial career path does not automatically make it desirable.

In it, the robot selects a target for interaction based on the perceived desire of human subjects to interact with it.

40|$|Despite a {{worldwide}} {{growth in the}} number of boycott campaigns, the results of studies are inconclusive as the motives behind individual participation are still largely ignored. Drawing on a socio-cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, this research investigates whether the direct variables of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control, help predict consumers' boycott intention. Conducted in Lebanon, this work employs a survey design administered to a randomized systematic sample of 500 Muslim and Christian consumers. The sample is split into two sub-samples reflecting the main religious groups in the Middle-East. Results show that although the Muslim participants appear more prone to participate in the boycott, still attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are all significant predictors of intentions in both communities with the attitudinal component carrying the most weight. This application of a social psychology theory to the consumers' passive resistance to purchasing yielded significant contributions at the theoretical, empirical, and managerial levels.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Theories {{of voter}} turnout have focused almost {{exclusively}} on {{the costs and benefits}} of voting, even though one potentially important aspect of turnout is what takes place after a citizen has decided she intends to vote but before she arrives at the polls. I test two social psychology theories affecting this process: self-prophecy and implementation intentions. The self-prophecy effect occurs when an individual is asked to predict whether he will vote, and this act of prediction alters his future behavior by making him more likely to vote. Applying the implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>theory</b> to voting, citizens would be more likely to vote if they focused on the concrete actions involved in getting to the polling location rather than simply on the end-state of having voted. The field experiment consisted of phone calls to 5, 609 registered voters with scripts intended to test these theories. Neither treatment generates a statistically significant result, which undermines the reliability of very large effects found in prior research on voting self-prophecy effects, and suggests the impact of implementation intentions may be limited with respect to voting. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} progress in multiagent teamwork, existing research {{does not address the}} optimality of its prescriptions nor the complexity of the teamwork problem. Thus, we cannot determine whether the assumptions and approximations made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the losses in overall performance. To provide a tool for evaluating this tradeoff, we present a unified framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP) model, which is general enough to subsume many existing models of multiagent systems. We analyze use the COM-MTDP model to provide a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing optimal teams under problem domains divided along the dimensions of observability and communication cost. We then exploit the COM-MTDP's ability to encode existing teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint <b>intentions</b> <b>theory,</b> including STEAM. We then derive a domain-independent criterion for optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two joint intentions instantiations.

40|$|A much {{discussed}} {{feature of}} Grice’s (1957) account of intentional communication {{is the line}} he drew between showing and meaning, where meaning typically involves a linguistic convention or code. This distinction has had substantial effects {{on the development of}} pragmatics: pragmatists have focused on the notion of meaning and abstracted away from cases of showing. This paper explores the central differences between Gricean meaning <b>intentions</b> and relevance <b>theory</b> <b>intentions.</b> Firstly, relevance <b>theory</b> does not attempt to draw the line Grice drew, and recognises both showing and meaning as instances of overt intentional or ostensive-inferential communication. Rather than there being a sharp cut-off point between the two notions, there is a continuum of cases in between. Secondly, in contrast to the kind of intention proposed by Grice, the relevance-theoretic informative intention is not characterised as an intention to modify the hearer’s thoughts directly—‘to produce a particular response’. This intention, it is argued, is not always reducible to an intention to communicate simply a single proposition and propositional attitude (or even a small set). This second move sheds new light on how better to analyse some of the weaker, vaguer aspects of communication, including the communication of impressions, emotions, attitudes, feelings and sensations...|$|R

40|$|Habit {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{construct}} of marginal interest {{in the literature on}} attitude-behaviour relations. We argue that this is undeserved, particularly given the current interest in principles of automaticity in social psychology. Basic features of habits, such as goal-directed automaticity, their dependency on situational constancy, and functionality, as well as the measurement of habit strength, are discussed. Research is reviewed that contrasted habit with deliberate action, as approached from the theory of planned behaviour, spontaneous vs. deliberate attitude-behaviour processes, implementation <b>intention</b> <b>theory,</b> and decision-making models. Habits thus appear as boundary conditions of the validity of models of planned behaviour and rational decision-making. A habit seems to be accompanied by an enduring cognitive orientation, which we refer to as 2 ̆ 2 habitual mind-set 2 ̆ 2, that makes an individual less attentive to new information and courses of action, and thus contributes to the maintenance of habitual behaviour.
