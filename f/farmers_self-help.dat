SHGs created awareness among member farmers about storage of their produce in the local warehouse. The sorghum commodity is graded by machine, and the groups are responsible for standardization in packaging. This small intervention adds value to the commodity, which eventually results in increased income for the farmer. When graded commodity is stored in the accredited warehouse, farmers become eligible {{to participate in the}} Negotiable Warehouse Receipt Scheme. Under this scheme, the farmer can take out a loan against their warehouse receipt, from nationalized Banks, for up to 70% valuation of their commodity. This helps farmers to avoid distress sales.|$|R

Farmer support is being switched away from a production basis to one which is both decoupled and more closely linked with maintaining the environment. In connection with this the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) launched a pilot scheme, to be delivered by agricultural colleges and university departments in England, to investigate the use of <b>farmer</b> <b>self-help</b> groups to communicate cross-compliance requirements under the new scheme.

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{persistent}} rural poverty, an incomplete agrarian transition, the predominance of small and marginal farms and an emerging feminization of agriculture, this paper argues for a new institutional approach to poverty reduction, agricultural revival and social empowerment. It {{makes a strong case}} for a group approach to agricultural investment and production through promoting collectivities of the poor which, it argues, would be much more effective on all these counts than the traditional individual-oriented approaches. The collectivities proposed here, however, are small-sized, voluntary, socio-economically homogeneous, and participatory in decision-making, and in keeping with the principles emphasized in a human-rights approach to development. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} largely failed historical efforts at early socialist collectivization, and some similar thrusts in non-socialist developing countries in the 1960 s and 1970 s, which were massive in scale, top-down, and typically coercive and non-participatory. The paper outlines the potential benefits of bottom-up agricultural production collectivities and describes a range of successful cases from the transition economies and South Asia. It also reflects on the contexts in which such collectivities may be expected to succeed, and how these efforts could be replicated for wider geographic coverage and impact.

40|$|Increased milk {{production}} in India will require improved yields of higher-quality crop residues for animal fodder. In Andhra. Pradesh State;'. on. the Deccan Plateau, groundnut crop residues are the. {{main source of}} dry fodder for dairy animals. However, the nutritive value of crop residues is often low, and both, sorghum and groundnut are susceptible {{to a number of}} diseases that reduce production and quality. Additionally, the development of mycotoxins by fungi on the residues is a serious threat to animal health and, through milk, to human health. In an attempt to tackle these constraints, disease-resistant; dual-purpose cultivars have been distributed to farmers, and village-level seed multiplication/distribution systems following integrated management of foliar diseases have been successfully developed; Farmers identified groundnut cultivar ICGV 91114 - as outstanding for both grain and haulm production and quality. Farm surveys confirmed the higher yields of the new cultivar, and laboratory analyses and on-farm feeding trials showed improved nutritive value and {{milk production}}. The use of ICGV 91114 as part of an integrated disease management strategy will lead to improved food security and increased incomes. To achieve this, farmers must have assured access to good-quality seed. Unlike sorghum, for which the private seed industry can serve as a multiplier of jmproved cultivars, community-based seed-production systems for groundnut, will need to be established through <b>farmer</b> <b>self-help</b> qroups and NGOs in order' to achieve widespread seed dissemination...|$|R

40|$|In {{much of the}} {{developing}} world, many farmers grow crops for local or personal consumption despite export options {{that appear to be}} more profitable. Thus many conjecture that one or several markets are missing. This paper reports on a randomized controlled trial conducted by DrumNetin Kenya that attempts to help farmers adopt and market export crops. DrumNet provides smallholder farmers with information about how to switch to export crops, makes in-kind loans for the purchase of the agricultural inputs, and provides marketing services by facilitating the transaction with exporters. The experimental evaluation design randomly assigns pre-existing <b>farmer</b> <b>self-help</b> groups to one of three groups: (1) a treatment group that receives all DrumNet services, (2) a treatment group that receives all DrumNet services except credit, or (3) a control group. After one year, DrumNet services led to an increase in production of export oriented crops and lower marketing costs; this translated into household income gains for new adopters. However, one year after the study ended, the exporter refused to continue buying the cash crops from the farmers because the conditions of the farms did not satisfy European export requirements. DrumNet collapsed in this region as farmers were forced to sell to middlemen and defaulted on their loans. The risk of such events may explain, at least partly, why many seemingly more profitable export crops are not adopted.

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that much of Africa fails to meet basic criteria of agricultural sustainable development and environmental preservation. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the management of natural resources by <b>self-help</b> <b>farmer</b> cooperatives. The study was carried out in five local government areas of Southwest Nigeria. These local government areas are forest zones covered by derived savannah. The raining season normally starts around April and ends in October/November, followed by a dry season. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people. Several methods were used to collect information. These included group discussions and questionnaires. Results from the study show that women have played a major role in almost every aspect of agriculture. Farmers possess valuable knowledge of the natural resources in their environment. They have made use of changes in soils and topography, which have resulted in planting patterns in the scattered farms around the villages and distant farm plots. With the help of cooperatives, farmers are taught how to develop innovatory regenerative techniques to conserve the tree stock on the farm. These techniques focus around the preservation of forest species. This study has shown that given the opportunity, local farmers can face the environment and tackle the problems when given the required support. farmers, cooperative and natural resources management, Farm Management, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

An evaluation of enhancing income and employment generation and environmental externalities due to plantations on wastelands through cooperatives and self-help groups was done. The development process was set up in leased degraded lands in three north Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The capacity building processes like savings and micro-enterprise skills empowered resource-poor farmers. An internal rate of return of 11. 5 to 17. 0 % in the phase I of the project imply tangible economic benefits at the end of 17 years, which improved to 13. 9 to 20. 4 % by including environmental benefits like carbon sequestration, soil conservation, soil salinity reclamation, etc. By extrapolating the trend till the end of 30 years, the estimated IRR increased further. The incremental net return due to afforestation of wastelands ranged between Rs. 2283 and 9514 (US $ 51 - 211) ha- 1 yr - 1 over the pre-developed status. The organization of stakeholders through cooperative societies for developing plantations on degraded lands and managing them for deriving benefits has demonstrated the viability of these models. The model can be replicated by dovetailing the same with the government schemes like food-for work programme and the recently enacted national rural employment guarantee programme. common pool resources, environmental evaluation, <b>farmers,</b> micro enterprises, <b>self-help</b> groups, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{agricultural}} {{output from}} a smaller land {{area is the}} challenge facing all countries with rapidly rising populations. In Kenya, to meet the growing demand for dairy products, milk production has to double {{in a period of}} less than 15 years. Currently, 60 % of the milk in Kenya is produced by smallholder herds, and it is this sector of the dairy industry in particular that is being encouraged to adopt a zero grazing system. The Government of Kenya, in collaboration with the Netherlands Government, set up the National Dairy Development Project (NDDP) in 1980, the project now covers 22 Districts throughout Kenya. The project started in 6 Districts by developing a package for zero grazing which included the design of animal housing, growing of napier grass as the main fodder crop, and the development of an extension and monitoring service. Plots of napier grass were established where farmers could obtain planting material and research could be conducted into its management. Farm visits, field days and courses were held {{and at the end of}} the initial phase 553 farmers had adopted the zero grazing system. <b>Self-help</b> <b>farmers</b> groups were formed and more Districts were covered by the project until, by the end of 1990, 4, 500 farmers were recorded practising zero grazing. There is hope that double that number will be participating in the project in the next four years. The impetus for farmers reacting very positively to the idea of zero grazing has been greatly assisted by a good policy on milk-prices. There has been good extension back-up with the field staff being provided with motorbikes. Regular staff training, courses and video productions have all raised farmer awareness and together farmers and extension staff work out a Stall feeding of cut and carried forage farm-plan. The project also assists with the buying of dairy animals, organizing credit schemes and marketing.

40|$|Following a {{dramatic}} expansion of tsetse {{distribution in the}} potentially agriculturally productive southwestern area of Ethiopia, assistance was sought to start a national tsetse control programme. The development and small-scale testing of suitably modified odour-baited and insecticide-treated attractive devices (tsetse targets) were successfully achieved through two TCP projects, TCP/ETH/ 4523 and TCP/ETH/ 6765. By the end of these operations in April 1988, tsetse {{had been reduced to}} below detectable levels and, concurrently, livestock and crop production significantly increased over a test area of approximately 50 km 2 in the Upper Didessa River ValleyThe purpose of this project was to consolidate the gains achieved and to assist in extending tsetse eradication over an adjacent 500 km 2 area where trypanosomiasis continued to constrain agricultural production severely. These activities have achieved considerable success. Some 400 kmý of previously infested area has been cleared of tsetse, and affected farmers have markedly increased production. The control technique has been proved to be effective for large-scale sustainable use under local conditions, and is suitable for implementation by <b>farmers</b> on a <b>self-help</b> basis. Subsidiary trials have also indicated that the strategic low-density placement of targets along the altitude limits of tsetse distribution can result in a market reduction in the seasonal incidence of trypanosomiasis in highland cattleFormal and in-service training provided by the project and supplemented by a one-month, in-country, practically-orientated course through the regional project RAF/ 85 / 015, Lusaka, has significantly strengthened the capability of national personnel in this specialized disciplineIn the light of the success achieved, it was recommended that vector control be expanded into a sustainable programme over the southwestern region in order to consolidate gains and increase further the area available for production. Such operations should be supported by further field trials to adapt the control techniques for use against other tsetse species. Consideration also should be given to the use of insecticide-treated livestock as an alternative to artificial baits. Both formal and in-service training should be continuedAny future operations should aim initially at continuing eradication along the Didessa River Valley and tributaries which, because of altitude separation, are largely protected from lateral re-invasion. A two-year bridging project to support this was presented to the World Bank for funding within the Fourth Livestock Development Programme. This recommendation was made to ensure the integration of tsetse control with the national development and settlement policy, which recognizes the production potential of this area as confirmed by land-use studie...|$|R
