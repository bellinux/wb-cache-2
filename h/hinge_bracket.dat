2500|$|Mr Justice Philp {{presented}} the Court's {{report to the}} Governor-General on 10 April 1945. The Court found that the accident {{was caused by a}} fatigue crack in the lower boom of the main spar in the left wing. It found that the presence of a crack in the elevator <b>hinge</b> <b>bracket</b> could not be determined but even if a crack had been present it had not contributed to the cause of the accident. [...] It also found that the change of engines {{was not part of the}} cause of the accident but the increase in maximum weight had caused the accident to occur a little earlier than would have happened otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Joseph Clark, {{a member}} of parliament, had flown in Tokana five days prior to the crash. [...] Two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{aircraft}} mechanics who were fellow-passengers had shown him a small crack in the aircraft's elevator <b>hinge</b> <b>bracket.</b> Clark had advised the two to tell the pilot about the crack if {{they thought it was}} serious. After the crash, Clark reported this conversation to the Minister for Civil Aviation and made a statement to the press. [...] He repeated his statement in the House of Representatives. There was also criticism from Mr Thomas White that the Investigation Panel's report had not focussed attention on the major alteration involved in the conversion from a three-engined aeroplane to a two-engined aeroplane. Thomas White was {{a member of}} parliament and a former RAAF group captain. Following this criticism in the Parliament House of Representatives the Minister for Civil Aviation, Arthur Drakeford, appointed Mr Justice Philp of the Supreme Court of Queensland to conduct an inquiry into the accident using the powers of the National Security Act.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a new approach}} to aircraft engine parts designing using the topological optimization algorithm for production by additive manufacturing. The full mathematical formulation which includes the problem statement within the elasticity theory and the SIMP optimization procedure is presented. The criterion particularities for evaluation of strength properties of the gas turbine engines parts according to the Aviation Regulations are specified. Optimization of the typical <b>hinge</b> <b>bracket</b> topology is performed, and the stress state of the part with the initial geometry and the optimized geometry is evaluated...|$|E

50|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to hear The Clitheroe Kid, Listen to Les, and <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> on BBC Radio 4 Extra.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> had toured in theatre {{for several}} years before {{appearing}} on radio. Their first series, The Enchanting World of <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> ran on BBC Radio 4 for three seasons from 1977 to 1979. Produced by James Casey at BBC Radio in Manchester and scripted by Mike Craig, Laurie Kinsley and Ron McDonnell, these programmes were a mixture of period songs and situation comedy. Actress Daphne Heard was a series regular as The Dear Ladies' housekeeper, Maud, and each show featured an appearance by a guest artist. In an interview with Edmund Whitehouse of Evergreen magazine in 2010, Casey admitted {{when he first saw}} <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> that he was completely fooled and thought they were two old ladies. It was not until a highly amused Mike Craig spelt it out the following day that he realised they were two men in drag.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{baritone}} soloist with <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> {{appearing at}} their famous Prom Nights, culminating in their 21st Anniversary Gala at The Royal Festival Hall in 1995.|$|R
50|$|All {{traffic is}} legally {{required}} to stop if {{one or more}} signs are being displayed. The stop signs used are mounted onto the pedestrian crossing poles which have a <b>hinged</b> <b>bracket</b> attached, allowing the students to easily and quickly extend (swing) the sign out onto the roadway, during breaks in the traffic. These signs are removed from the poles and stored away while the crossing is not in operation and are usually constructed from aluminum, allowing them to be light and relatively easy to carry by younger students.|$|R
50|$|In interview, George Logan has {{acknowledged}} that the overall style of <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> harked back to the era of Ealing comedy and owed a great debt to Joyce Grenfell.|$|R
5000|$|The T4 {{was also}} {{available}} {{with a permanent}} 4WD system that uses a Viscous coupling unit as a centre differential to regulate the distribution of torque to the rear axle. These models are called [...] "syncro" [...] and were available with the 2.4D, 2.5Tdi and 2.5 petrol engines on all body types and both wheelbases. Some syncro models also have a mechanically locking rear differential. Since the rear differential precludes {{the placement of the}} spare wheel in the usual place under the body, syncro vans either store it inside the body or on an external, <b>hinged</b> <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> {{then spent}} two years {{performing}} around London pubs and clubs. This included the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, a popular gay venue, and the Kensington restaurant, AD8, owned by transsexual April Ashley.|$|R
50|$|The name, {{if not the}} location, of Acton Trussell was {{borrowed}} by Staffordshire-born entertainer Patrick Fyffe (aka Dame Hilda Bracket) {{in creating}} the fictional village Stackton Tressel, home of eccentric spinster musicians <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket.</b>|$|R
50|$|Logan applied {{his formal}} {{training}} to producing all the musical {{arrangements for the}} act. Mainly because of the atypical vocal range of the performers, most of <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket's</b> material required transposition or adaptation for performance.|$|R
50|$|The Pygmy was hand-built in the Ford {{development}} shop in Dearborn, Michigan using {{parts from}} Ford's commercial and agricultural lines. It {{was the first}} of the pilot vehicles to feature a flat grill with headlamps positioned behind it for protection, an intermediate bow for the canvas top, its fuel tank mounted inside the body under the driver’s seat, and a two‐piece opening/folding windshield with a round tubing frame. Another innovation was headlamps positioned on <b>hinged</b> <b>brackets</b> which allowed them to be pivoted to illuminate the engine compartment at night. All of these design features were ultimately incorporated into the standard World War II jeep, the Willys MB.|$|R
50|$|The final radio series, At Home with <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> had {{the format}} of {{informal}} musical evenings with a celebrity guest, and ran for a single season in 1990. Guests included Anthony Newley, Rosalind Plowright, Benjamin Luxon, June Whitfield, Evelyn Laye and Jack Brymer.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that Ivor Novello's mother wrote the lyrics {{for the song}} (propagated—for example—by patter in recorded performances of British musical comedy duo <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket)</b> but Lena Ford (an American) was a friend and collaborator of Novello, not a blood relation.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Glasgow, Logan {{worked in}} London as a {{computer}} programmer, but continued to use his piano skills around the London clubs and pubs, accompanying the stage acts. In 1970 he met and became friends with Patrick Fyffe, and together they formed <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> making their first appearance in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Kent {{has worked}} for almost twenty years in musical theatre as a singer, instrumentalist, musical {{director}} and composer. He has performed backing vocals for various artistes including <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> Stig Rossen and Russell Watson and {{in the role of}} musical director has conducted, amongst others, Lucy Montgomery and Daniel Boys.|$|R
50|$|Another {{successful}} {{comedy series}} Casey produced was <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> whom he initially thought were two old ladies. It was Mike Craig who, highly amused, {{pointed out that}} they were actually two young men in drag. The closing credits on the resulting series included a reference to producer “Gentleman James Casey”, a typically Northern epithet.|$|R
50|$|Between 1983 and 1985, <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> {{appeared}} {{in their own}} television series entitled Dear Ladies on BBC 2. The theme music was written and performed by Logan and Fyffe themselves and the scripts were written by Gyles Brandreth. Locations were picturesque Cheshire towns and villages, including Knutsford, Great Budworth and Nantwich. Three series were made, including a pilot.|$|R
50|$|His {{most notable}} discoveries {{during his career}} at BBC Radio in Manchester, between 1954 and 1982, were the radio comedian Jimmy Clitheroe, the comedian Les Dawson, the comedian Ken Dodd, and the comedy double-act known professionally as <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> each of whom he {{launched}} into a career in radio light entertainment with their own BBC series.|$|R
5000|$|He {{went on to}} {{have long}} success {{as one of the}} acts on Granada Television's popular series The Comedians (and his notable [...] "who is it?" [...] parrot and plumber sketch). He made regular {{appearances}} on the show from 1971 to 1993. In 1977 he appeared on BBC Radio as Mr. Fewster in an episode of <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket.</b>|$|R
25|$|Afterwards, {{he had a}} brief {{government}} service career and sang on the concert stage. He worked with several more Gilbert and Sullivan companies for three more decades, playing some of his old D'Oyly Carte roles {{and more than a}} dozen new ones. He also appeared with <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> and on cruise ships, and he performed his own autobiographical musical show.|$|R
50|$|The RVT survived local {{redevelopment}} {{throughout the}} 1970s and 1980s and maintained its independence {{as a gay}} venue. Many of London's top drag artists performed there, including <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket,</b> Regina Fong and Adrella. Diana Dors also appeared there. Lily Savage, the drag persona of Paul O'Grady, was a regular performer for eight years, with shows four times per week.|$|R
50|$|Their stage {{partnership}} spanned theatre, stage shows, {{radio and}} television, and continued for 30 years until {{the death of}} Patrick Fyffe in 2002. Logan retired from the stage in 2004, but briefly came out of retirement in 2014 to promote Dr. Evadne's autobiography 'The Naked Doctor' and again in 2015 to pay tribute on hearing {{the news of the}} death of Paul Bishop, a much loved member of the <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> tribute site.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the winter}} of 1965/66 the pub become {{predominantly}} known for a homosexual clientele, and in the later 20th century it became known for its drag queen cabaret, and promoted itself as the [...] "Palladium of drag". Drag acts under the 'Baton' of Tony Page, who became the first Resident Compére from 1969 until 1976 and Resident Duo Frankie Rae and David Thallon, <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> started their careers at the pub.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s Brandreth {{has written}} various books about Scrabble, words, puzzles and jokes, {{for adults and}} children.He wrote an {{authorised}} biography of John Gielgud, the actor, as well as lipogrammic reworks of Shakespeare. In the 1980s, Brandreth wrote scripts for Dear Ladies, the television programme featuring <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket.</b> Brandreth is also the creator of a stage show called Zipp! which enjoyed success at the Edinburgh Festival and had a short run in the West End.|$|R
50|$|In retirement, she {{was closely}} {{involved}} with the International Association of Wagner Societies in the UK and elsewhere. Unlike some retired singers she enjoyed attending performances and she was frequently present in the audience at Covent Garden, up {{to the time of}} her death. Evidencing a genial sense of humour about her craft, she was a regular patron of <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> concert and gala performances, often seen enjoying their affectionate tribute to the operatic and performance style of an earlier age.|$|R
50|$|It {{was from}} this circuit that <b>Hinge</b> and <b>Bracket</b> were {{recruited}} {{to appear at}} the 1974 Edinburgh Festival. The show was a one-hour scripted vignette, which presented them in a Victorian church hall setting, along with a visiting baritone. In this intimate atmosphere, Evadne and Hilda handed around glasses of sherry to the audience. News of the show (or perhaps the sherry) spread quickly around the festival; and after {{the first couple of}} nights, they were playing to packed houses.|$|R
