Springback or shape {{change has}} been one of the major {{challenges}} in sheet metal fabrication, particularly with increase application of high strength steel (HSS) and aluminum alloys in automotive stamping. Springback, an elastic material recovery after the unloading of stamping tools, causes variations and inconsistencies of final part dimensions. Minor or mild springback usually can be corrected in the re-strike process. Excessive springback must be corrected so the part will be produced within the given design tolerance and dimension. The commonly used Spring Forward approaches and shape compensations such as over-crown and over-bending are proven effective to alleviate excessive springback. To enhance these approaches, a new strategy of Die Face Engineering (DFE) based processing is proposed to quickly and easily to achieve the maximum allowable compensation using the under cut (or <b>die</b> <b>lock)</b> as the primary criteria. The implementation of the die face compensation through iterative FEA calculation, automatic surface mapping, projection and manual morphing are crucial to meet production environment requirements in terms of generating NC quality CAD surfaces of the compensated or morphed die face. In this paper, the strategy of the die face compensation with the consideration of the under cut criteria is presented. The implementation of various processes to enable user to perform the die face compensation task in a production environment is also discussed. Finally, two examples are shown to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed springback compensation scheme based on the combined CAE/CAD methodology...|$|E

Equipment was designed to test the thermal state of the die steel in different thermal loading conditions. The results of stress analysis showed that, the value of thermal stress (maximum 1. 5 GPa) caused in the die filling and die spraying stages was larger than the mechanical stress (maximum 85 MPa) caused in the <b>die</b> <b>locking</b> stage. The results of the thermal check experiment showed that there were three stages of die dissolving, and that the stress distribution shown by the samples' cracking routine was close to the die surface stress analysis...|$|R

In this research help to peoples who are staying remote also to find problem in heart on which location {{and how much}} problem to near and finally gives best analysis methodology for automated analysis for MultiSlice CT Angiogram images. Multi slice CT scanner is used to identify heart disease. Multi-detector CT is considered convenient and reliable non-invasive imaging modality for assessment of human angiogram 3 D images. Automatic hart segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) is highly demanded. Accurate hart segmentation is a crucial for computer-aided heart disease diagnosis and treatment planning. After segmentation and future extraction then identify whether the patient angiogram waveform has disease or not. For that, Support Vector Machine method is used to confirm the presence of disease. Neural Networks can solve different types of nonlinear problems in image classification and retrieval process. After that majorly focus on research learning methodologies for improve performance of the Multi Slice CT Angiogram images. So, in this research is summarizing the problem with liner of RBF neural network, Non-Liner SVM and RBF NN with liner and non-liner. Final, RBF NN with liner and non-liner provided more value and proved as best compare with other existing methodologies. This methodology consumes less time for both learning as well as testing comparatively than any other methods like back propagation. This issue drastically improves the estimation efficiency and accuracy for real time 128, 256 slices CT scan angiogram image...|$|R

5000|$|Die-casting {{became popular}} in the early 1930s among lock makers. Not only was it a very {{inexpensive}} way to make padlocks, but it allowed designers to design padlocks with {{a broad range of}} geometrical features and ornate designs that sand casting and machining wouldn't allow. Some lock makers, like Junkunc Brothers, augmented their machined solid body padlock products with the less expensive and more attractive die-cast bodied padlocks. The Wise Lock Company embraced this new medium in making a novel padlock that, with the key inserted, would split lengthwise along the body in order to create an opening in the shackle. Chicago Lock pioneered their new [...] "double bitted wafer" [...] and [...] "ACE" [...] products by installing them into a die cast body.
