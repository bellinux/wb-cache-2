This study examines the changes in starch molecular structure in <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> under optimal conditions for sprouting. Two barley varieties were tested: Schooner and Grimmett, which are low and moderate dormancy grains, with > 90 and 0. 05). The starch chain-length distributions, analyzed from enzymatically debranched starch molecules with size-exclusion chromatography, indicated that the shorter amylopectin branches of Schooner were degraded at a faster rate than its longer amylopectin branches, which was also confirmed by the decreasing degree of branching with germination time. The changes in starch molecular structure of Grimmett grains were less apparent.

40|$|The fibrous barley hull is {{the main}} reason for barley’s low {{available}} energy relative to corn. <b>Barley</b> <b>grain</b> contains hydroxycinnamic acids (mainly ferulic acid (FA) and ñ-coumaric acid (PCA)) which are cross-linked to polysaccharides, therefore, limit cell wall degradability in the rumen. Paricle size of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> also affects the digestion of barley in the rumen. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a set of barley varieties grown in Saskatchewan (Canada) and provided by Crop Development Center (CDC, Canada) and find a variety with low hull, FA, PCA and fiber content, while maintaining large particle size after mechanical processing, and having high nutrient availability. Three studies were conducted to determine the content of barley hull, FA, PCA, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) in various barley varities. Mean/median particle size of the <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> after coarse dry-rolling was also determined. The relationships among these parameters and the digestibility of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> in ruminants were then assessed. Six barley varieties (AC Metcalfe, CDC Dolly, McLeod, CDC Helgason, CDC Trey and CDC Cowboy) from samples grown in three years (2003, 2004 and 2005) were evaluated in each study. The first study determined the original content of barley hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL, and mean/median particle size of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and evaluated the effects of barley variety. The results showed barley variety had a significant impact on the chemical and physical profiles of <b>barley</b> <b>grain,</b> with CDC Helgason and CDC Dolly showing relatively lower content of barley hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL, hemicellulose and cellulose, and moderate mean/median particle size, whereas McLeod and CDC Cowboy showed the opposite. The second study involved two consecutive trials. Trial 1 was to assess differences in the in situ rumen degradability of dry matter (DM), FA, PCA, NDF, ADF and ADL at 12 and 24 h of rumen incubations. Results revealed that CDC Dolly consistently showed relatively lower rumen residues of DM, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF and ADL at 12 and 24 h, with McLeod being opposite. Barley variety displayed some effects on the digestibility of DM, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF and ADL at 12 and 24 h. Since CDC Dolly demonstrated relatively less content of hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL and mean/median particle size and higher rumen digestibility among the six barley varieties, while McLeod was the opposite, CDC Dolly and McLeod were selected for the third trial in order to compare differences in the rumen degradation kinetics of DM, FA and PCA. Trial 2 did not show significant differences in effective degradation of DM, FA, except for PCA. In general, CDC Dolly exhibited better degradability of DM, FA and PCA than McLeod. The third study analyzed the correlation and regression between the original content of barley hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL and mean/median particle size in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and rumen residual content of the corresponding parameters at 12 and 24 h of rumen incubation. Results showed that FA content in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> had a predominantly negative effect on DM degradability, while barley hull content affected the degradability of NDF and ADF. In summary, the present studies show that hull and FA content in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> have negative effects on the degradability of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> in ruminants and also showed that CDC Dolly could be an ideal feed <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> for ruminants due to its lower hull and FA content and higher rumen dry matter degradability...|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} use of specific biochemical compounds identified in wheat grains was evaluated for monitoring <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> tissues during fractionation. First <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> anatomy was studied through microscopic observation and quantification {{of the relative}} proportion of each anatomical part in four distinct barley samples from both hulled and hulless genotypes. As expected from cereal phylogeny and irrespective of the possible presence of hull, common features were observed between <b>barley</b> and wheat <b>grains,</b> but the aleurone layer predominated in the outer layers. The specific location of the coumpounds identified in wheat was established. Phytic acid was specifically localized in the aleurone layer and alkylresorcinols in the composite layer containing the testa, even if their concentration differed from that observed in wheat grain tissues. Thus, these two markers identified in wheat {{can be used to}} monitor the corresponding barley tissues, independent of the presence of hulls. Conversely, phenolic compounds, either ferulic acid trimer or p-coumaric acid, cannot be used to monitor respectively the outer pericarp or the aleurone cell walls in <b>barley</b> <b>grains.</b> p-coumaric acid was identified as an efficient marker of the hull and could be used to distinguish hulled or hulless <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> and to help monitor the dehulling process...|$|R
40|$|Malting is the {{controlled}} germination of <b>barley</b> <b>grains,</b> under specific conditions {{and up to}} the point of grain modification, and is the keystone of the brewing and distilling industries. Protease enzyme activity is an important constituent of this process as not only does this catalyse the degradation of the grains protein stores, but it also has involvement in other aspects of the germination process such as the activation of β – amylase. However, despite their importance, little is known of the identities and specific roles of the protease classes in the malting and germination process. With this in mind a biochemical and proteomic approach was taken in order to attempt to identify protease enzymes from malted and germinating <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> and also to identify the roles of specific protease classes in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> malting and germination. FPLC based protein fractionation, SDS – PAGE analysis and MALDI – ToF mass spectroscopy were used in an attempt to purify metallo and serine class proteases from extracts of four day micro malted malt and germinating <b>barley</b> <b>grains.</b> A combination of class specific protease inhibitors, germination studies, enzyme assays of both <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> proteases and specific starch degrading enzymes, and western blotting were employed to investigate the roles of the different protease classes in both overall grain physiology during germination and specifically, in the regulation of enzymes involved in starch breakdown. These investigations show that the serine and aspartate class proteases have a role in the positive regulation of the amounts of α – amylase present in <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> during germination in a process that may involve gibberellic acid signalling. Furthermore, it was also shown that the serine class proteases have a role in the negative regulation of β – amylase activity during germination, thus revealing the complexity of the regulatory roles of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> proteases during grain germination. In addition, germination studies carried out in the presence of both the divalent cation chelator 1, 10 phenanthroline and different divalent cations revealed the potential importance of transition metal ions such as zinc, iron and manganese in the onset of grain germination...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present experiment was to {{study the effects of}} partial replacement of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> with <b>barley</b> fibre (BF) on animal performance, carcass traits and diet digestibility of growing dairy bulls. The feeding experiment comprised 20 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 12 Holstein-Friesian bulls, and four treatments (8 bulls per treatment). There were four diets with two offered at stage 1 (from the initiation of the study to 450 kg live weight) and four at stage 2 (from 450 kg live weight to slaughter). The control diet (BF 0) included grass silage (460 g kg 1 dry matter) and <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (540), BF 25 diet included grass silage (460), <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (405) and BF (135), BF 50 diet included grass silage (460), <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (270) and BF (270), and BF 75 diet included grass silage (460), <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (135) and BF (405). At stage 1 there were only two treatments (BF 0 and BF 50) and at stage 2, all four treatments were included. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The mean initial live weight of the bulls was 261 kg and the mean final live weight 650 kg. At stage 1 there were no significant treatment differences in dry matter, energy or protein intakes or in live weight gain. At stage 2, replacing <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> with BF led to a linear decrease of daily live weight gain (P < 0. 05) and a linearly reduced feed conversion (kg dry matter kg 1 live weight gain) (P < 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of the organic matter and neutral detergent fibre decreased linearly with increasing BF supplementation (P < 0. 001). The dressing proportion and the carcass fat score decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) with partial replacement of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> with BF. On carcass conformation, treatment had a significant (P < 0. 05) quadratic effect: the BF 25 and BF 50 diets were classified highest. The results indicate that 50 % of barley starch can be replaced with BF without affecting growth, but feed efficiency factors may decrease when barley starch is replaced with BF. At 75 % replacement, feed intake was reduced, which resulted in a lower energy intake and reduced level of performance. ...|$|R
