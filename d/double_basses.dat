5|$|The symphony is scored for solo soprano, four flutes (two players {{doubling}} on piccolos), four clarinets in B, two bassoons, two contrabassoons, four horns in F, four trombones, harp, {{piano and}} strings. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, and 8 <b>double</b> <b>basses.</b> For {{most of the}} score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate staff.

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), two <b>double</b> <b>basses</b> (contrabassi de viola), and two small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass viola da gamba, and a regal or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E

25|$|Cello {{manufacturer}} Luis & Clark constructs cellos from carbon fibre. Carbon fibre {{instruments are}} particularly {{suitable for outdoor}} playing because {{of the strength of}} the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Josephine van Lier. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum <b>double</b> <b>basses</b> and violins).|$|E
25|$|Early {{recordings}} {{were made}} entirely acoustically, the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus. Sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was very irregular, giving acoustic recordings an instantly recognizable tonal quality. A singer practically {{had to put}} his or {{her face in the}} recording horn. Lower-pitched orchestral instruments such as cellos and <b>double</b> <b>basses</b> were often doubled (or replaced) by louder instruments, such as tubas. Standard violins in orchestral ensembles were commonly replaced by Stroh violins, which became popular with recording studios.|$|E

25|$|String bands provide {{elaborate}} performances. Limited to unamplified strings, reeds, and percussion, string bands feature banjos, saxophones (alto, tenor, baritone and bass), accordions, <b>double</b> <b>basses,</b> drums, glockenspiels and violins {{in musical}} arrangements {{tied to a}} theme presented by the captain, beautiful costumes and props (some people call them floats). Historically, string bands performed mostly in military-drill formations. Harrowgate (now Uptown) String Band's first-prize-winning railroad tunes with Broadway-style dance in 1976 changed that. String-band performances are now the most elaborate of the parade, outdone only by the fancy brigades indoor performance.|$|E

25|$|The modern symphony {{orchestra}} typically calls for two bassoons, {{often with a}} third playing the contrabassoon. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as Maurice Ravel's Boléro and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in Peter and the Wolf. Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous running line (doubled in the violas and cellos) in the overture to The Marriage of Figaro. In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and <b>double</b> <b>basses,</b> and harmonic support along with the French horns.|$|E
25|$|To this day, the {{mastering}} of the Beethoven {{double bass}} symphonic parts {{are considered a}} basic standard for all orchestral double bass players. Dragonetti came back to Vienna for an extensive stay in 1808-1809. On that second trip he became friends with composer Simon Sechter, who would become the court organist in 1824, and professor of composition at the Vienna Conservatorium in 1851. He wrote piano accompaniments {{to some of his}} concert pieces, and they maintained a lifelong correspondence. Dragonetti was again in Vienna in 1813 and got to meet once more Beethoven, who had just written Wellington's Victory, to celebrate the victory of Wellington over the French armies of King Joseph Bonaparte at the Battle of Vitoria. The premiere of this work, as well as of Beethoven's seventh symphony was performed on 8 December 1813 in the University's Festsaal, with Dragonetti leading the <b>double</b> <b>basses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Music for {{the cello}} is {{generally}} {{written in the}} bass clef, but both tenor clef and treble clef are also used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a cellist or violoncellist. In a small Classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the bass part, the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In orchestra, in Baroque era (ca. 1600-1750) and Classical period (ca. 1725-1800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally an octave higher than the <b>double</b> <b>basses.</b> In Baroque era music, the cello is used to play the basso continuo bassline, typically along with a keyboard instrument (e.g., pipe organ or harpsichord) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., lute or theorbo). In a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined by other bass instruments, playing double bass, viol or other low-register instruments.|$|E

500|$|Typically 27 {{minutes in}} duration, the first {{movement}} equals the combined {{length of the}} second and third movements, and is based on a late 15th-century lament of Mary from the Lysagora Songs collection of the Holy Cross Monastery (Św. Krzyż Monastery) in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Comprising three thematic sections, the movement opens with a canon based on a 24-bar theme, which is repeated several times. [...] The canon begins in 2 parts; then, for each repetition of the theme, an extra part is added, until the canon is in eight parts (with the top two parts doubled at the octave, making for ten voices total), using a 24-bar melody in the Aeolian mode on E. It begins with the <b>double</b> <b>basses,</b> 2nd part, with each succeeding entry occurring one measure later (i.e., a new entry begins every 25 measures), each starting a diatonic fifth above the last.

500|$|The symphony is scored for a {{very large}} orchestra, in keeping with Mahler's {{conception}} of the work as a [...] "new symphonic universe", a synthesis of symphony, cantata, oratorio, motet, and lied in a combination of styles. La Grange comments: [...] "To give expression to his cosmic vision, it was... necessary to go beyond all previously known limits and dimensions." [...] The orchestral forces required are, however, not as large as those deployed in Arnold Schoenberg's oratorio Gurre-Lieder, completed in 1911. The string section is conventional in that it contains violins divided, violas, cellos, and <b>double</b> <b>basses.</b> The woodwind section includes two piccolos (one doubling 5th flute), four flutes, four oboes, an English horn, three B clarinets, an E clarinet, a B bass clarinet, four bassoons and a contrabassoon. The brass section requires eight horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba and an offstage ensemble of four trumpets and three trombones. The percussion forces consist of timpani, cymbals, bass drum, tamtam, triangle, 2 low-pitched bells in A and A and glockenspiel. Other instruments include an organ, a harmonium, a piano, two harps (although at least four are preferred), a celesta, and a mandolin. Mahler recommended that in very large halls, the first player {{in each of the}} woodwind sections should be doubled and that numbers in the strings should also be augmented.|$|E
50|$|Slightly smaller string {{works with}} the <b>double</b> <b>bass</b> include six string sonatas by Gioachino Rossini, for two violins, cello, and <b>double</b> <b>bass</b> written {{at the age of}} twelve over the course of three days in 1804. These remain his most famous {{instrumental}} works and have also been adapted for wind quartet. Franz Anton Hoffmeister wrote four String Quartets for Solo <b>Double</b> <b>Bass,</b> Violin, Viola, and Cello in D Major. Frank Proto has written a Trio for Violin, Viola and <b>Double</b> <b>Bass</b> (1974), 2 Duos for Violin and <b>Double</b> <b>Bass</b> (1967 and 2005), and The Games of October for Oboe/English Horn and <b>Double</b> <b>Bass</b> (1991).|$|R
