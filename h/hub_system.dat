5|$|Back on Earth, {{the world}} is {{suddenly}} terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to conclude that Uka Uka is up to something. A confrontation with Uka Uka confirms his suspicions and nearly results in his destruction {{at the hands of}} the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to Crash and Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only way to stop the Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality <b>Hub</b> <b>System,</b> Crash and Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals have been put in their hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small ice floe.|$|E

500|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} the player controls Crash and Coco Bandicoot, who must gather 25 Crystals and defeat the main antagonists of the story: Doctor Neo Cortex, his new superweapon Crunch Bandicoot and Crunch's power sources, the renegade Elementals. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} [...] "Virtual Reality (VR) Hub System" [...] created by Coco to help Crash gather the Crystals. The VR <b>Hub</b> <b>System</b> is split up into five [...] "VR Hubs"; initially, only the first VR Hub is available. Each VR Hub has five teleportation portals to different levels. The goal in each level is to find and obtain the Crystal hidden in the area. In some levels, the Crystal will be located {{at the end of a}} level or must be earned by completing a specific challenge. Most levels contain a [...] "Bonus Platform" [...] that leads to a special bonus area, where the player must navigate through a maze and collect everything in sight. Once a bonus area is completed, it cannot be played again unless the level is replayed. After completing all five levels in a VR Hub, a sixth teleportation portal to a boss fight with Crunch will appear. By defeating the boss, the next VR Hub will become available for play. When all 25 Crystals are collected and Doctor Cortex and Crunch are defeated, the game is won.|$|E

5000|$|Some of {{the ideas}} from the Doom Bible, though {{discarded}} for Doom, showed up in later games. Instead of employing separate levels, Doom was initially supposed to use a <b>hub</b> <b>system</b> to enable a large, continuous world; in the game, the different areas would be connected by a monorail. Hubs were later used in id Software's Quake II, Doom RPG and Raven Software's Hexen: Beyond Heretic. Monorails also make an appearance in Doom 3, although not as a <b>Hub</b> <b>system.</b> The game would include interactive computer terminals; this first appeared in Doom 3. Tom Hall additionally used concepts from the Doom Bible in Rise of the Triad and Terminal Velocity, which he designed after leaving id Software for Apogee and 3D Realms. Also, a laser weapon referred to as [...] "the Unmaker" [...] in the Doom Bible made its only appearance in Doom 64.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to illustrate the steps involved in developing a multibody dynamics analytical model to simulate the aeroelastic stability and blade loading of a soft-inplane tiltrotor wind tunnel model and to correlate those simulations with experimental data. Development of soft-inplane tiltrotor technology is beneficial for providing viable lightweight hub design options for future heavy lift transport rotorcraft application. Experimental verification of such advanced configurations using either subscale models in wind tunnels or full-scale flight testing is becoming prohibitively expensive. Advanced modeling and simulation of complex tiltrotor hub configurations using multibody dynamics analyses offers an alternative to such expensive experimental verifications. Comprehensive rotorcraft-oriented multibody analyses enable the modeling and simulation of rotor <b>hub</b> <b>systems</b> {{to a level of}} detail that allows the complex kinematics and nonlinear effects associated with rotor <b>hub</b> control <b>systems</b> and drive train free play to be considered. The influence of these and other nonlinear effects on the aeromechanical behavior of a tiltrotor model is examined in this study...|$|R

40|$|Providers of {{transportation}} services may reduce their average unit costs by bundling flows and channeling them between hubs (also known as concentrators or routers). The resulting facility locations are interdependent {{because of the}} flows between them. This paper analyzes mathematical models of <b>hub</b> <b>systems</b> {{in an effort to}} enhance understanding of the optimal location of interactive facilities. The paper examines the behavior of solutions to several alternative models that require the location of a hub at either of two similar locations. A model employing a concave cost function favors the assembly of flows, penalizes fractional facility locations, and produces local minima that have integer facilities.

40|$|The growing {{excess demand}} for airport {{capacity}} makes an {{efficient use of}} capacity at congested airports in Europe in increasingly urgent issue. The key question addressed here focuses on the perspectives for a more efficient use of existing airport capacity through various market based options, {{especially with regard to}} hub airports in Europe. To that end the following steps are taken. First, the existing allocation system for scarce airport capacity is described and the inefficiencies in the system are identified. More efficient market based approaches are introduced, ranging from congestion pricing to primary slot auctioning and secondary slot trading. The exemption of the ‘grey’ slot trading market in London is explained. Thereafter, we describe the controversy between the two objectives of slot allocation, i. e. efficient use of slots in the upstream market and sufficient competition in the downstream air transport markets. The substantially different approaches chosen by the US and the EU with respect to preferred market based slot allocation options is analysed in this context of conflicting objectives. We also take account of the Commission’s decision to tolerate slot trading at coordinated airports in Europe. Finally, we discuss the impact of secondary slot trading at hub airports in Europe. We confront the slot trading approach with the <b>hubbing</b> <b>system</b> operated at major congested airports in Europe. Since hubbing results in a daily sequence of peak and off-peak periods, the use of hub airport capacity is inefficient, especially during periods of idle capacity. Finally, we address whether slot trading will improve an efficient use of hub airport capacity and if so, how will the <b>hubbing</b> <b>system</b> adapt to these new conditions. We will use Amsterdam Airport as an example...|$|R
