5|$|Forbes Field had an {{original}} capacity of 25,000, {{the largest in}} the league at the time. Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity of 41,000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35,000seats. On opening day, ticket prices ranged from $1.25 (equal to $ today) for box seats and $1 (equal to $ today) for reserved grand stand sections; temporary bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $0.50. Ticket prices were considered high for the day and steel pillars supporting the roof occasionally blocked fans' views of the field. 2,000 bleachers were situated along the left <b>field</b> <b>side,</b> tickets were sold for a maximum of $1. When winning streaks would attract high attendance to games, fans were permitted to sit on the grass in right field, provided they would agree to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area. The lowest season of attendance came in 1914 when 139,620people attended games; the highest at the stadium came in 1960, when 1,705,828people watched the Pirates play. On September 23, 1956, the stadium's largest crowd, 44,932, gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers. The game was cut short {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, after a rain delay forced it past the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew. The Dodgers won the game 8–2 the following day. At 200people, June 10, 1938 marked the smallest crowd to ever attend a Pirates game. On September 30, 1962, a crowd of 40,916people saw the Steelers defeated by the New York Giants, at the Steelers' highest-attended game at the stadium.|$|E
25|$|The Chapelton (old) House was {{demolished}} {{in around}} 1908, possibly following a fire {{as this is}} the strong local tradition for {{the demise of the}} house. A Miss Mary McAllister may have been the last occupant of the house. Some of the dressed stonework may have been used in the building of the new house, garden and drive walls, the sides of the Chapel burn and elsewhere. The walling around the <b>field</b> <b>side</b> of the Chapel Hill mound is not entirely built with stones from Chapelton (old) House as some old building rubble was brought in from elsewhere at a much later date by the owner of Chapeltoun Mains, Mr. A. Robinson.|$|E
500|$|It is {{customary}} to fly flags from sunrise until sunset, {{unless they}} are directly illuminated. [...] At {{the beginning of each}} day, the cross-shaped [...] "masthead" [...] atop the center field scoreboard displays the American flag at the top, and three strands of flags bearing the colors and nicknames of each of the National League clubs, one strand per Division in order of that day's standings. Immediately after the game, one of the strands of flags is lowered, and either the W or the L-lettered flag is raised in its place. The W-lettered flag is raised on the left <b>field</b> <b>side</b> of the board, above the blue light that also indicates a win. The L-lettered flag is raised on the right <b>field</b> <b>side</b> of the board, above the white light that indicates a loss. Once the Win or Loss Flag has been raised, the other flags are lowered and also stowed away inside the scoreboard.|$|E

2500|$|The part of {{the plate}} under the rail base is tapered, setting the cant of the rail, an inward {{rotation}} from the vertical. The usual slope is one in forty ( [...] 1.4 degrees [...] ). The top surface of the plate has one or two shoulders that fit against {{the edges of the}} base of the rail. The double-shoulder type is currently used. Older single-shoulder types were adaptable for various rail widths, with the single shoulder positioned on the outside (<b>field</b> <b>side)</b> of the rails. Most plates are slightly wider on the <b>field</b> <b>side,</b> without which the plates tend to cut more into the outsides of the tie, reducing cant angle.|$|E
2500|$|On August 16, after {{a two-day}} delay because of inclement weather, the Phillies, led by Steve Carlton and Jimmy Rollins, and hosted by Phillies public address {{announcer}} Dan Baker, unveiled a [...] tall bronze statue of Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas {{in the left}} <b>field</b> <b>side</b> of the Ashburn Alley outfield concourse at Citizens Bank Park, between the Harry the K's restaurant and the center field statue of Kalas' best friend, Richie Ashburn. [...] Privately commissioned and funded entirely by donations by fans, this statue shows Kalas standing cross-legged {{on top of a}} home plate, with a microphone in his right hand, which is also on top of a baseball bat, which Kalas is leaning upon. [...] A bronze plaque embedded in the concrete walkway {{at the foot of the}} statue carries the originally planned August 14 unveiling date.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the stadium}} opened for the 1955 season, Carpenter's first, {{advertising}} billboards {{first appeared on}} the walls and roofs of the outfield: Formost dairy, Goldenberg's Peanut Chews, Philco, Cadillac, Alpo, Coca-Cola and Mertz Tours signs became familiar sights to stadiumgoers and to fans watching on television. A new straight-across fence covered the square corner in center field and most of the remaining [...] "terrace", reducing the distance to a still-formidable 447feet. Distance markers also appeared on the walls for the first time. In addition to the foul poles (334 and 331) and the center field area (447), a 400 marker was posted just to the center <b>field</b> <b>side</b> of the scoreboard, and a 405 marker in the corresponding area of deep left center field. A few years later, wooden fencing covered the rough bricks along the right field wall, and eventually the 331 sign was changed to read 329, although that change had no impact on the actual home run distance.|$|E

2500|$|An umpire {{will not}} give a batsman out unless an appeal is made by the <b>fielding</b> <b>side,</b> though a batsman may walk if he knows himself to be out. This is {{nowadays}} rare, especially in Tests and first-class matches for contentious decisions; however, it is the norm for a batsman to walk when he is out bowled or out to an obvious catch. If the <b>fielding</b> <b>side</b> believes a batsman is out, the <b>fielding</b> <b>side</b> must appeal, by asking [...] "How's that?"(HowzThatt), [...] "Wot Wot" [...] or [...] "How was he?" [...] (or by any other means that either umpire deems {{as a method of}} appealing).|$|R
2500|$|Lancashire won {{its first}} county {{championship}} in 1897, a productive bowling attack {{made up of}} Johnny Briggs, Willis Cuttell, Albert Hallam, and Arthur Mold took 420wickets between them. In 1898 Lancashire bought the ground and some adjoining land from the de Traffords for £24,732 (£ in [...] ). In 1902, amateur and professional players began walking onto the <b>field</b> <b>side</b> by side in a break with tradition. Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as “the brightest {{in the history of}} Lancashire cricket”. That season, James Hallows completed the feat of 1,000runs and 100wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as Walter Brearley, Harry Dean, and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances. In 1914, Lancashire sank to its lowest position of eleventh, whilst during World War I the pavilion was used by the Red Cross and 1,800 patients were treated there.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the <b>field</b> <b>side</b> of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E

Saton's face darkened as he {{recognised}} the tall figure. His first impulse was to stop, but with Lois by his side he saw at once that it was impossible. With the courage that waits upon the inevitable, he opened the gate and passed out into the lane.|$|E

50|$|Functionally, {{the field}} and the city side have very {{different}} designs. While the city side is richly decorated with windows, this would be inappropriate on the <b>field</b> <b>side</b> considering the possibility of combat situations. On the <b>field</b> <b>side</b> there are accordingly only a few small windows. In addition, the walls are interspersed with embrasures. Also, the wall thickness on the <b>field</b> <b>side</b> is greater than on the city side: 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre. The reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency, so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark.|$|E

50|$|Back in {{its early}} days, the club had trouble <b>fielding</b> <b>sides,</b> or to be more precise, <b>fielding</b> <b>sides</b> punctually. In those days the Civil Service worked on Saturday mornings, and as most matches were played on that day, {{starting}} at noon, the club was almost always a late starter. This situation gradually improved as office managers in Dublin Castle and the Custom House developed a blind eye on match days.|$|R
25|$|There {{are certain}} playing {{restrictions}} {{that apply to}} all League fixtures.
