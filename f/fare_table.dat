25|$|A <b>fare</b> <b>table</b> must be {{displayed}} clearly inside the taxi, by law. The same legally-enforceable <b>fare</b> <b>table</b> is also {{listed on the}} government's website. Fares are charged according to distance travelled and waiting time, measured by a meter on board. There is a starting fare, and there are surcharges for luggage and tolled tunnels and bridges, as well as surcharges for telephone-arranged ordering. Along some restricted kerbs, there are designated pick-up and drop-off points exclusively for taxis. Some taxi operators will offer discounts to attract repeat business. Fares {{are determined by the}} government and revised from time to time upon the recommendation of the Transport Advisory Committee. From April 2017, the flag fall – including the fare for the first two kilometres – was HK$24 for red taxis, HK$20.50 for green taxis and HK$19 for the blue Lantau cabs; thereafter, the meter adds $1.70 and $1.50 for every 200 metres in Urban Taxis and New Territories Taxis as well as Lantau Taxis respectively.|$|E

25|$|Until the Stagecoach takeover, {{ticketing}} {{was done}} via ticket machines provided by Abberfield Technology of Australia. These blue ticket machines dispensed adult single ride tickets, senior citizen concessionary tickets and child concessionary tickets. As well as singles, the machines sold multi-packs at a discount. <b>Fare</b> <b>tables</b> were {{shown on the}} machines with {{the validity of the}} different prices.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Shimo-kitazawa Station {{is the use}} of a single ticket gate serving two {{independent}} lines and ticketing systems; this is a legacy of the Inokashira Line's former ownership by Odakyu. Additionally, there is no ticket gate between the two lines. The south and north exits are run by Odakyu, and the West exit is run by Keio. For this reason, the time and <b>fare</b> <b>tables</b> displayed within the station are in the formats used by each company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lines as}} built {{constituted}} the two routes {{operated by the}} company. The first route - described on running boards and <b>fare</b> <b>tables</b> as [...] "Rhodes and Oldham" [...] - running from Rhodes, a village south-west of Middleton via Middleton Town Centre to the Chadderton boundary with Oldham, east of Middleton. At Rhodes, the trams met those of Salford Corporation who ran a service from Rhodes to Eccles from 1902 until 1925. The lines were not connected - indeed there was a 50-yard gap.|$|R

50|$|Except {{for very}} short {{railways}} and some tram systems {{with a flat}} fare, fare varies by distances or number of zones travelled. The pricing based {{on the time of}} travel (peak or off-peak) is not common in Japan. Children fare (shōni-unchin) for children between 6 and 12 is half of adult fare. Recent development in the fare collection system is the stored-value card systems shared by multiple operators in large cities, such as Suica and PiTaPa, by which passengers can avoid consultation with complicated <b>fare</b> <b>tables</b> and lineups for ticket machines before each train ride.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} {{area in the}} concourse level is where the two linear spaces mentioned so far intersect. This is where the station control booth, ticketing machines and ticket gates are located, as well as various maps and <b>fare</b> information <b>tables.</b>|$|R

50|$|Yarborough Street halt was a Compulsory Stop {{throughout}} its life. It opened {{with the line}} in 1912 and was mentioned in the 1914 and 1922 timetables, {{as well as the}} 1948 version reproduced in the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway article. Although it always appeared in timetables, it never appeared on any ticket or <b>fare</b> <b>table,</b> or maps specifically commissioned to show the line.|$|E
50|$|Taxi fares {{are charged}} {{according}} to the taximeter; however, additional charges on the <b>fare</b> <b>table</b> may apply, such as road tolls and luggage fees. Urban taxis are the most expensive, while Lantau taxis are the cheapest. The standard of service among different kinds of taxis is mostly the same. The reason for having three types of taxis is to ensure service availability in less populated regions, as running in the urban centre {{is considered to be}} more profitable.|$|E

40|$|In {{many public}} {{transport}} oriented {{cities in the}} world, especially Asian cities, the public transport system has been developed extensively, {{to the extent that}} it has become increasingly difficult to navigate. Although inter-modal transfers are common and often necessary, a complete set of the routes across transport modes is generally not presented in a form that is accessible to travelers, as each operator would only publish its own routes. Moreover, the common nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>tables</b> together with inter-modal fare discounts pose challenges to travelers in deciding their best routes. This study develops a multi-modal passenger route guidance system, called eFinder, to aid travelers with their combined mode-route choices. We discuss the architecture and features of this system in this study. This system forms a platform for disseminating public transit information and should complement further development and use of the public transport network by enabling travelers to make informed choices. 2...|$|R
50|$|The fare of MTR {{between any}} two {{particular}} stations is not calculated using a particular formula, {{and must be}} {{looked up from the}} <b>fare</b> <b>table.</b> Fares for the Airport Express Line are significantly higher. Services to checkpoint termini are also more expensive than ordinary fares. Adult fares range from HK$3.6 to $52.6 (US$0.46-6.74). Concessionary fares are usually half the adult fare, and range from HK$1.50 to $27.00. Student fares are the same as child and elderly fare on the urban lines, but are the same as the Adult fares for journeys to or from checkpoint termini, and range from HK$1.50 to $51.00. The fare is subject to adjustment in June every year.|$|E
50|$|On 29 December 1978, the {{students}} issued a press note announcing {{their decision to}} pay only concessional fare from January 1979 should the government delay their demand. They fixed the concessional <b>fare</b> <b>table</b> {{and set up a}} committee to deal with any complaints of resistance from bus operators. Student commuters were told to immediately report any resistance to student representatives. The agitation spread across Goa like wildfire. Buses were burnt as violence erupted. Bandhs were observed and students held protest marches. The students braved lathi charges and tear gas. Student leaders such as Desmond D'Costa were detained too. But after hectic parleys, the Kakodkar government finally conceded to the demand of {{the students}} on 12 January 1979.Many leaders of the 50% bus fare concession movement subsequently became towering figures in Goa's public life. These include journalist Sandesh Prabhudesai; lawyers such Aires Rodrigues and Satish Sonak; District & Sessions Judge Desmond D'Costa, etc.|$|E
50|$|Mutton snapper, {{especially}} adults, {{tend to be}} solitary, but can be seen {{in smaller}} schools.

25|$|The {{fighting}} prowess {{and good}} <b>table</b> <b>fare</b> attract anglers to the species {{in many parts}} of the world, with easily accessed areas such as Florida having a strong recreational fishery for the species, as well as more remote areas such as Thailand and a number of Pacific and Indian Ocean islands.|$|R
50|$|The American silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura, is an American fish. Widespread on {{the eastern}} seaboard, the silver perch is {{commonly}} caught by inshore anglers in search of larger species. This fish rarely attains 9 in. Silver perch are an underutilized resource as they are excellent <b>table</b> <b>fare</b> and a welcome addition to any Southern fall fish fry.|$|R
50|$|Ocean-caught coho is {{regarded}} as excellent <b>table</b> <b>fare.</b> It has a moderate to high amount of fat, which {{is considered to be}} essential when judging taste. Only spring chinook and sockeye salmon have higher levels of fat in their meat. Due to the lower fat content of coho, when smoking, it is best to use a cold-smoking rather than hot-smoking process.|$|R
25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} is {{of minor}} importance to fisheries throughout its range, caught using hook and line, bottom trawls, beach seines, and various fish traps.

25|$|The {{large size}} and good <b>table</b> <b>fare</b> {{offered by the}} African pompano have made the species popular with both {{recreational}} and commercial fishermen, although different sources rate the flesh quality differently. The species has been implicated {{in a number of}} ciguatera cases, suggesting larger fish should probably not be consumed. The attractive appearance of juveniles make them possible aquarium fish, but they do not survive well in captivity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a read-optimized relational DBMS that contrasts sharply with most current systems, which are write-optimized. Among the many differences in its design are: storage of data by column rather than by row, careful coding and packing of objects into storage including main memory during query processing, storing an overlapping collection of columnoriented projections, rather than the current <b>fare</b> of <b>tables</b> and indexes, a non-traditional implementation of transactions which includes high availability and snapshot isolation for read-only transactions, and the extensive use of bitmap indexes to complement B-tree structures. We present preliminary performance data on a subset of TPC-H and show that the system we are building, C-Store, is substantially faster than popular commercial products. Hence, the architecture looks very encouraging. 1...|$|R
