40|$|Traceability {{systems can}} provide {{detailed}} information about the origin, processing, transfer and distribution of a food item. The information reported on the labels {{can be considered as}} an instrument to improve consumer trust and perception of food safety and quality. However, if too much information is provided, information overloads may occur, causing consumers to spend too much time on information processing. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} which kind of information that consumers are really interested in. Based on three criteria, namely food safety, food quality and food trust, this study investigates consumer preferences for information on traceability systems used in Taiwan’s pork sector. Since there is interdependence among the three criteria. This study adopts a hybrid of Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method to conduct the multi-criteria evaluation. This study first extracts 17 attributes of traceability information from previous literature and then measures the relative weights (consumer preferences) of the attributes using a system of pairwise comparison. Results indicate that national certification, certification marks, retailer, date of slaughter and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> are attributes of traceability information that consumers are more concerned about when purchasing pork products. The findings of this research can be a reference for the government and related industries on how to strengthen the usefulness of the current pork traceability system...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a {{situation}} in which a broker must manage the procurement of a short-life-cycle product. As the broker observes demand for the item, she learns about the demand process. However, {{as is often the case}} in practice, it becomes either more difficult or more expensive to procure the item as the selling season advances. Thus, the broker must trade off higher procurement costs against the benefit of making ordering decisions with better information about demand. Problems of this type arise, for example, in the travel industry, where a travel agent's cost of procuring airline and hotel reservations increases as the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> a vacation <b>package</b> approaches. We develop a newsvendor-like characterization of the optimal procurement policy. In a numerical analysis, we demonstrate how broker procurements tend to cluster just before price increases and how brokers can benefit from explicitly considering the effects of information about demand in their ordering policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Background/Purpose: We {{describe}} {{an investigation of}} an incident of failed sterilization procedure in a dental clinic. We aim to illustrate the principles in performing such investigations and to highlight some of the important checkpoints in sterilization procedures. Methods: In response to this incident, proper sterilization of all equipment was performed immediately. On-site investigation was conducted by the investigation panel to identify the cause and risks, to coordinate post-exposure management in affected patients, and to make recommendations to prevent similar occurrence of such incidents in the future. Results: The incident was due to a rare lapse of monitoring during the autoclaving cycle. A total of 127 sources and 250 exposed patients were identified within 24 hours {{of the discovery of}} the incident for risk assessment and testing for blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A protocol was devised to manage the exposed patients against HBV, HCV, and HIV. Immunization and hyperimmune globulin for hepatitis B, and tetanus toxoids were given to the exposed patients where indicated. Exposed patients were followed-up for 6 months. We came to the decision that <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> instrument <b>packages</b> and signed documentation of each autoclave printout, color change of chemical indicators of each load and daily autoclave performance should be made mandatory with immediate effect. Conclusion: Rapid response is extremely crucial in minimizing the impact of this incident and relieving the anxiety of the affected patients.

Here we discuss a marine record of eruptive and mass-wasting events spanning ? 250 ka offshore of Montserrat, using new data from IODP Expedition 340, as well as previously collected cores. By using a combination of high-resolution oxygen isotope stratigraphy, AMS radiocarbon <b>dating,</b> biostratigraphy <b>of</b> foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils, and clast componentry, we identify five major events at Soufriere Hills volcano since 250 ka. Lateral correlations of these events across sediment cores collected offshore of the south and south west of Montserrat have improved our understanding of the timing, extent and associations between events in this area. Correlations reveal that powerful and potentially erosive density-currents traveled at least 33 km offshore and demonstrate that marine deposits, produced by eruption-fed and mass-wasting events on volcanic islands, are heterogeneous in their spatial distribution. Thus, multiple drilling/coring sites are needed to reconstruct the full chronostratigraphy of volcanic islands. This multidisciplinary study will be vital to interpreting the chaotic records of submarine landslides at other sites drilled during Expedition 340 and provides a framework that {{can be applied to the}} stratigraphic analysis of sediments surrounding other volcanic islands...|$|R
