40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an evaluation <b>of</b> the European <b>type-approval</b> test procedure for evaporative emissions from passenger cars based on real-world mobility data. The study relies on two large databases of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected {{by means of}} on-board GPS systems in the Italian provinces of Modena and Firenze. Approximately 28, 000 vehicles were monitored, corresponding to approximately 36 millionkilometres {{over a period of}} one month. The driving pattern of each vehicle was processed to derive the relation between trip length and parking duration, and the rate of occurrence of parking events against multiple evaporative cycles, defined on the basis <b>of</b> the <b>type-approval</b> test procedure as 12 -hour diurnal time windows. These results are used as input for an emission simulation model, which calculates the total evaporative emissions given the characteristics of the evaporative emission control system of the vehicle and the ambient temperature conditions. The results suggest that the evaporative emission control system, fitted to the vehicles from Euro 3 step and optimised for the current type-approval test procedure, could not efficiently work under real-world conditions, resulting in evaporative emissions well above the type-approval limit, especially for small size vehicles and warm climate conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how central <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> (possibly infinite-dimensional) Lie algebras {{integrate}} to central <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> étale Lie 2 -groups. In finite dimensions, central <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> Lie algebras integrate to central <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> Lie groups, a fact which is due to the vanishing of pi 2 for each finite-dimensional Lie group. This fact was used by Cartan (in a slightly other guise) to construct the simply connected Lie group associated to each finite-dimensional Lie algebra. In infinite dimensions, there is an obstruction for a central <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Lie algebras to integrate to a central <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Lie groups. This obstruction comes from non-trivial pi 2 for general Lie groups. We show that this obstruction may be overcome by integrating central <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> Lie algebras not to Lie groups but to central <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> étale Lie 2 -groups. As an application, we obtain a generalization of Lie’s Third Theorem to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras...|$|R

The first characterization is a one-to-one correspondence between <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P and pairs of upsets and downsets of certain suborders of P. The second one characterizes the <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P in terms <b>of</b> linear <b>extensions</b> and sequences <b>of</b> downsets. Both characterizations lead to algorithms that generate all the <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P. Further, we discuss the notion of passive pairs of an order.
