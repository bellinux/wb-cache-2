5|$|Combined (or multi-discipline) {{events are}} {{competitions}} in which athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's <b>heptathlon</b> (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's <b>heptathlon</b> and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} four medals were won, one gold, two silver and one bronze. UK Athletics {{performance}} director Dave Collins stood down after the Games. This was {{due in part to}} the team's failure to meet the UK Sport target of winning five medals,. Ironically, a series of retests ordered in the wake of the Russian doping scandal in 2015 and 2016 found that Great Britain athletes had been deprived of medals in a further four events by athletes later confirmed to have doped – the women's <b>heptathlon</b> (Kelly Sotherton), the men's and women's 4 x 400-metre relay teams and women's javelin (Goldie Sayers). When these medals are redistributed, Great Britain's 2008 athletics total of eight medals will be its most successful since the second world war, and 75% over target.|$|E
