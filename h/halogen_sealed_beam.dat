50|$|A {{sealed beam}} {{is a type}} of lamp with a {{parabolic}} reflector, one or more filaments, and a glass or polycarbonate lens sealed permanently together as a unit. Originally introduced for road vehicle headlamp service, sealed beams have since been applied elsewhere. <b>Halogen</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps incorporate a halogen lamp within a quartz or hard glass envelope.|$|E
50|$|Sealed beam {{headlamps}} {{were introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year. Cars prior and subsequent to that date could {{have a variety of}} shapes of headlamps, using any {{of a wide variety of}} replaceable bulbs. <b>Halogen</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the sealed beam lamp market.|$|E
25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. <b>Halogen</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> now dominate the <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standardized}} [...] round <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamp, one per side, {{was required}} for all vehicles sold in the United States from 1940, virtually freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s, for Americans. In 1957, the law was amended to allow smaller [...] round <b>sealed</b> <b>beams,</b> two per side of the vehicle, and in 1974 rectangular <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> were permitted as well.|$|R
25|$|US laws {{required}} <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, {{and other}} countries such as Japan, United Kingdom and Australia also made extensive use of <b>sealed</b> <b>beams.</b> In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.|$|R
50|$|On 31 May 2003, the 'C' type <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps were {{replaced}} by 'D' type <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps. Today the lighthouse lights up the skies every night, and offers a solitary light {{that can be seen}} from the Baby beach and as far as Payyambalam.|$|R
5000|$|In stage lighting, <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps {{are often}} used. A common size, {{also used in}} rock concerts, as well as outdoor {{architectural}} lighting, is the parabolic aluminized reflector 64 (PAR64). PAR64 <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps are typically available with 250, 500 or 1000 watt power ratings. The fixtures that such <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lights go into are called [...] "PAR cans". Beam spreads are designated as FL (flood), SP (spot), NSP (narrow spot), and VNSP (very narrow spot), as stamped {{on the back of}} the lamp's reflector.|$|R

25|$|Headlamp systems require {{periodic}} maintenance. <b>Sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps are modular; {{when the}} filament burns out, the entire <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made {{since the late}} 1980s use headlamp lens-reflector assemblies that are considered {{a part of the}} car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. Headlamp aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.|$|R

50|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} differences between UN and US regulations was the design and performance of headlamps.

25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the headlamp bulb or <b>sealed</b> <b>beam.</b> Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|R
50|$|In early models (PJ5000), {{the light}} source was a 650 watt xenon bulb (<b>sealed</b> <b>beam)</b> {{similar to the}} units in modern 35mm film projectors, and {{produced}} 250 lumens at a 75:1 contrast ratio. The later 3LV model produced as much as 3500 lumens at a 250:1 contrast ratio.|$|R
50|$|The {{light source}} was two stacks of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps, {{installed}} on a revolving table. It had {{red and green}} sectors. While the light itself was fully automatic, the station was manned due to the signal station. Four houses were constructed outside the station to accommodate the staff.|$|R
