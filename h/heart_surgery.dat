5|$|Bloodless <b>heart</b> <b>surgery</b> was {{pioneered by}} American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon {{spread around the}} world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless <b>heart</b> <b>surgery</b> was cost-effective in India, as it did not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless <b>heart</b> <b>surgery</b> was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E

5|$|First-team coach Ronnie Moran {{took charge}} of team affairs for several weeks before Graeme Souness was named as Dalglish's successor. Under Souness, Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1992, but nothing else. He made way for Roy Evans, who also won just one trophy, the League Cup, before Gérard Houllier was {{appointed}} joint manager with Evans in 1998. This arrangement lasted only 18 games before Evans resigned, leaving Houllier—Liverpool's first non-British manager—in sole charge. Houllier won nothing until a treble in 2001, consisting of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major <b>heart</b> <b>surgery</b> during the 2001–02 season, but the squad was unaffected and managed {{to hold on to}} a second-place finish. Although Phil Thompson stepped in as temporary manager while Houllier was recovering from <b>heart</b> <b>surgery,</b> the matches played under Thompson are included in Houllier's record. Another League Cup was won in 2003, but this was to be Houllier's last trophy as Liverpool manager as he and the club parted by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, to be replaced by Valencia manager, Rafael Benítez.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Open <b>heart</b> <b>surgeries</b> under {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass {{are associated}} with excessive perioperative bleeding that often requires reoperation. Antifibrinolytics like epsilon aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid are widely used to control bleeding. There are limited studies primarily showing {{the impact of these}} drugs on the incidence of reopening following open heart surgical procedures. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare incidence of reopening following open <b>heart</b> <b>surgeries</b> in patients who were administered either epsilon amino caproic acid or tranexamic acid for control of perioperative bleeding. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed among seventy-eight patients of either sex in the age group of 18 to 65 years scheduled for open <b>heart</b> <b>surgeries</b> under cardiopulmonary bypass. They were randomly allocated into three groups where group A (n= 26) received epsilon aminocaproic acid, group B (n= 26) received tranexamic acid and group C (control group, n= 26) received intravenous 0. 9 % normal saline. Patients had similar anaesthetic protocols, and were monitored for twenty-four hours postoperatively to assess reopening rates because of excessive bleeding. RESULTS: Two patients in each group receiving either tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid had excessive bleeding requiring reopening after surgery whereas three patients in the control group had undergone reopening for excessive bleeding (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Epsilon aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid exhibit similar and comparable effect to placebo on incidence of reopening for excessive bleeding following open <b>heart</b> <b>surgeries</b> under cardiopulmonary bypas...|$|R
