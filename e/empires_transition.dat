How do polytheistic and monotheistic societies differ in how they view sexuality? In the pre-Christian days of the early Roman Empire, polytheism fostered a remarkable tolerance toward both same-sex relations and various expressions of sexuality, as evident in social expectations, literature, and written law. In contrast, a closer examination of the Roman <b>Empire’s</b> <b>transition</b> from a polytheistic to Christian society in the 4 th and 5 th centuries reveals that the rise of Christianity corresponded with, and likely contributed to, increasingly strict attitudes towards homosexuality...|$|R

Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, to the 6th or 7th century. And from the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of Zoroastrianism.|$|R

50|$|From {{very early}} on the {{imperial}} period, but accelerating in the third century AD, {{the centre of the}} Roman Empire moved towards the eastern half of the Mediterranean basin. The Empire became Christianized, and the use of Latin declined in favour of exclusive use of Greek: in the early Roman period, both languages had been used. The <b>empire</b> after this <b>transition</b> is known today as the Byzantine Empire due to its focus on the imperial capital at Constantinople, the old Greek city of Byzantion. The division is historically useful, but misleading, with an unbroken chain of emperors continuing up until the thirteenth century, and all citizens identifying themselves as fully Roman ("Rhomaioi"). The conversion of the empire from paganism to Christianity greatly affected Athens, resulting in reduced reverence for the city. Ancient monuments such as the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the Hephaisteion (Theseion) were converted into churches. As the empire became increasingly anti-pagan, Athens became a provincial town and experienced fluctuating fortunes. Many of its works of art were taken by the emperors to Constantinople.|$|R
40|$|This project {{compares the}} {{financial}} and monetary histories of Egypt, Greece and the Ottoman <b>Empire</b> in <b>transition</b> to the gold standard c. 1900. During this period, all these countries experimented {{with a variety of}} monetary regimes- combinations of silver, gold and fiduciary currencies - to bring existing monetary systems in line with the international monetary order, and opened their financial markets to foreign capital flows in the form of sovereign debt. Following defaults, creditors established ad hoc multilateral enforcement mechanisms, namely international financial control organisations (IFCs), which resulted in a partial loss of fiscal sovereignty in each country. Foreign supervision also implied institutional change, as IFCs were partly transplanted fiscal institutions. In Egypt the establishment of an IFC (in 1876) led to a direct takeover of the state finances; in Greece (1898) its role was restricted to particular measures concerning fiscal and monetary discipline; in the Ottoman Empire (1881) to administrative and tax reforms, which facilitated fiscal centralisation. By identifying differences and similarities amongst the countries, the project analyses the effect of IFCs on monetary systems and sovereign risk. The thesis relates partial loss of fiscal autonomy with monetary sovereignty, and challenges conventional interpretation of monetary regimes of the three countries. It discusses differences between "core" and "peripheral" characteristics of the gold standard, and casts light on distinctive features of monetary systems by focusing on fiduciary, gold and silver currency, exchange rates, currency zones and monetary authorities, i. e. issue banks and mints. The research combines a wide variety of archival evidence with econometric techniques such as structural break tests and volatility modelling of historical bond spreads, and concludes that IFCs had a crucial role in reinstating sovereign credibility and the financial integration of peripheral economies into international capital markets.

5|$|During George's reign, the {{break-up}} of the British <b>Empire</b> and its <b>transition</b> into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated. The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct {{mention of the}} monarch from the country's constitution {{on the day of}} his accession. The following year, a new Irish constitution changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of President. From 1939, the Empire and Commonwealth– except Ireland– was at war with Nazi Germany. War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, George remained king of both countries, but relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948. Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. He was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth II.|$|R
5000|$|The {{executive}} magistrates of the Roman Empire {{were elected}} individuals {{of the ancient}} Roman <b>Empire.</b> During the <b>transition</b> from monarchy to republic, the constitutional balance of power shifted from the executive (the Roman King) to the Roman Senate. During the transition from republic to empire, the constitutional balance of power shifted back to the executive (the Roman Emperor). Theoretically, the senate elected each new emperor, although in practice, it was the army which made the choice. The powers of an emperor, (his imperium) existed, in theory at least, {{by virtue of his}} legal standing. The two most significant components to an emperor's imperium were the [...] "tribunician powers" [...] (potestas tribunicia) and the [...] "proconsular powers" [...] (imperium proconsulare). In theory at least, the tribunician powers (which were {{similar to those of the}} Plebeian Tribunes under the old republic) gave the emperor authority over Rome's civil government, while the proconsular powers (similar to those of military governors, or Proconsuls, under the old republic) gave him authority over the Roman army. While these distinctions were clearly defined during the early empire, eventually they were lost, and the emperor's powers became less constitutional and more monarchical.|$|R
40|$|Since 1970, {{the period}} covered by Millennium: Jahrbuch zu Kultur und Geschichte des ersten Jahrtausends n.

There is no (well-founded) disagreement about roughly when and where Islam started; but late Antiquity’s boundaries remain fluid. The Roman <b>Empire’s</b> painful third-century <b>transition</b> from Principate to Dominate amidst war against Sasanids and Germans, and the sixth century’s Justinianic consolidation of Christian East Rome, have often been attached to the core fourth and fifth centuries. A terminus c. 600 is widely accepted, coinciding with Gregory the Great’s reforming papacy, {{and the start of}} the last and most dangerous war between East Rome and the Sasanids, leading to the former’s crushing defeat and the latter’s annihilation by Muslim armies emerging unforeseen from Arabia after 629. Such a cataclysm does at first sight suggest the end of an epoch, considering also the narrowing of cultural horizon it imposed on the surviving East Roman rump, and {{the emergence of a new}} empire, the caliphate. Yet, given the symbolism ancient historians attach to the Persian Wars from Marathon to Plataea (490 – 79 BCE), and to Rome’s wars with its eastern neighbour starting at Carrhae (53 BCE), it is perverse to exclude the last, most dramatic of these encounters, running from 603 to 628, from the canonical narrative. Is it that adding those extra three decades would bring one so close to the Arab invasions that their Qurʾanic inspiration would become impossible to ignore, and therefore unavoidable to study? And the caliphate these wars spawned: did it not, in many respects, perpetuate the earlier empires under new management, just as its religion, Islam, responded to the earlier scriptural monotheisms, Judaism and Christianity?This is the author accepted manuscript.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} that developed amongst Ghana, Great Britain, and the United States from Ghana's independence in 1957 to the coup d'état that ended the regime of Ghana's first post-colonial leader, Kwame Nkrumah in 1966. Ghana's position as the first self-governing nation in sub-Saharan Africa {{captured the attention of}} the world. Aspiring nationalists, colonial rulers, and Cold Warriors anticipated the impact of Ghana's experience on colonial Africa, and the global balance of power. For Ghana, the transition to independence brought tremendous possibility and complex challenges. While possessing the economic, political, and administrative resources for success, the management of those resources posed rigorous obstacles for Kwame Nkrumah. Nkrumah attempted to unify and strengthen Ghana, making it a leader in African affairs and the world community. For Great Britain, the transfer of power in Ghana began the dismantling of its African <b>empire.</b> The peaceful <b>transition</b> to self-government across British Africa depended upon the results of the Ghanaian experiment. Britain intended to prepare Ghana for success and stability by providing training and governmental models before independence, and securing Ghana's introduction to Western society during its transition. To provide longer-term support for Ghana, Britain enlisted the assistance of the United States. This coincided with an increased US interest in Africa, especially Ghana, as the newest vulnerable front in the Cold War. The United States hoped that positive relations with Ghana would prevent a Soviet foothold in Africa. Despite a rhetoric of support for democracy and self-determination, the United States favored stability above all else in Ghana, even when this came at the price of decreasing freedoms for Ghanaians and the growing authoritarianism of Kwame Nkrumah. The relationship amongst the three nations continued to develop across the 1960 s, bringing periods of prolonged mutual interest and success as well as intervals of heightened tension, culminating in the CIA-aided overthrow of Nkrumah's regime. By exploring the goals and strategies of each country, this narrative contributes {{to an understanding of the}} transition from colonial rule to independence; the international context of American foreign relations; and the impact of the Cold War in Africa...|$|R
40|$|U radu se na temelju izvorne građe i relevantne historiografske {{literature}} daje sustavna analiza svjedočanstava o hunskoj prisutnosti u južnoj Panoniji i uloge Huna u rastakanju državnopolitičkog ustroja kasnoga Rimskog Carstva na hrvatskome povijesnom prostoru. Posebna se pozornost posvećuje značajkama i posljedicama hunske vladavine u južnopanonskim pokrajinama. Također, propituje se u kojoj je mjeri hunska premoć utjecala na promjenu u dotadašnjim odnosima između Istoka i Zapada u vezi sa zapadnoiliričkim prostorom. On {{the basis}} of original documents and the relevant historiographic literature, this contribution lays out a systematic analysis of accounts {{of the presence of}} Huns in South Pannonia and of the role the Huns had in the decomposition of the government structures of the late Roman Empire on the historical lands of Croatia. Special attention is paid to the features and effects of the Hun rule in Southpannonian provinces. Also, we address the issue of the extent of impact the Huns had on the changes in the relations which then obtained between the East and the West in respect of Westillyric areas. The Hun appearance in Southpannonian regions was first noted at the end of 370 s when a group of three peoples headed by Alatheus and Saphrax raided the area. Probably no Pannonian regions were spared these raids, nor were parts of neighbouring regions (the raiding of Mursa, Stridon and Poetovio). Soon the situation abated, after Alatheus 2 ̆ 7 and Saphrax 2 ̆ 7 Ostrogoths, Alans and Huns probably settled in Pannonia as imperial federates (in 380). Assuming the duties of frontier soldiers, they were able to provide a short break from external dangers in Pannonia, eventhough their presence was always felt to be a potential source of instability because of their violent bursts of dissatisfaction, their unreliability and even their internecine feuds. From the second half of 390 s, crisis practically never ceased to exist in the mid- Danube area, the Hunnic federates largely contributing to such a condition. Their first withdrawal from Pannonia {{can be seen as a}} result of Ataulph 2 ̆ 7 s joining in Alaric 2 ̆ 7 s raid against Italy in 408. They were finally forced to abandon the area 19 years later (in 427). That was the time when Pannonia was already under threat from the socalled Great Huns, who as early as from the beginnings of the 5 th century (especially given the great barbaric invasion across the mid-Danube in 405 / 406) were exercising a great impact on Pannonia. The year 433 was, of course, the crucial year, when the Western imperial government let the Huns take over probably three of four Pannonian provinces (the First Pannonia, Valeria and the Second Pannonia). The perilous vicinity of Huns and the West 2 ̆ 7 s interest in avoiding any conflicts with them contributed significantly to the decision that the major portion of West Illyricum (all the four Pannonian provinces, and perhaps Dalmatia as well) be submitted to the Eastern Empire. It is possible that around that time, in the first half of 430 s, a new province was established, the so called Valeria Media, along the southwest border of Savia, probably around Poetovio. It was to serve as the pre-Alpic portion of the defense system of the Western Roman Empire. A direct Hun impact in the Southpannonian area was marked only once, in 441, when the Huns, having captured Sirmium, succeeded in their violent takeover of Second Pannonia. This also marked the end of the outstanding role this Southpannonian city had for a long time as center of military and administrative power in the history of the Roman <b>Empire.</b> The <b>transition</b> of Atilla 2 ̆ 7 s forces in 452 through the region between the Sava, the Drava and the Danube did not leave any damage behind as no resistance was met in Southpannonian provinces. Fear of the Huns and other barbaric tribes as they stormed through Pannonia, sparked off as of the end of the 4 th century, and especially in the first half of the 5 th century, a massive flight of the romanized inhabitants to the southwest (Noricum, Italy) and south (Dalmatia), and later on to the southeast (East Illyricum). A part of Southpannonian peoples fell under the Hunnic rule (after the fall of Sirmium in 441), while some Pannonians later even served under the Huns; either forced to do so or voluntarily. The Pannonian area captured not only served the Huns their militarystrategic purposes, but it was also economically exploited. Although South Pannonia (the provinces of Second Pannonia and Savia) were only partially or marginally affected by the great transition of peoples in the first half of the 5 th century and by the Hun raids, the circumstances still radically changed in the aftermath. The Hunnic impact indirectly influenced the fate of West Illyricum and opened the gate for Germanic peoples who eventually captured Pannonia after the breakdown of the Hunnic megastate...|$|R
