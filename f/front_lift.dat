5000|$|Tests started {{secretly}} with a 250 GT, bodied by Mario Boano, with {{chassis number}} #2643GT, Bizzarrini's personal car. This car {{was developed and}} {{was used as a}} test mule for technical solutions later seen in the GTO. This car was known as the Bizzarrini Ugly Duck. (He said, [...] "We dubbed the car 'Il Monstro'".) Experiments with the SWB chassis indicated considerable speed loss due to aerodynamic drag, so Bizzarrini reduced the frontal area and increased the bonnet length, to reduce both drag and tendency to <b>front</b> <b>lift</b> at high speeds. Bizzarrini moved the engine well back into the chassis and lowered it (by using a dry sump lubrication system) to improve weight distribution and handling. The result was the 250 GTO. In 1962, when the GTO was launched, it was the ultimate in aerodynamics. Carroll Shelby's 289 AC Cobras had an advantage on slow tracks, but the GTO achieved a superior top speed and dominated the GT class.|$|E
40|$|Automotive {{aerodynamics}} {{measurements and}} simulations now routinely use a moving ground and rotating wheels (MVG&RW), {{which is more}} representative of on-road conditions than the fixed ground-fixed wheel (FG&FW) alternative. This {{can be understood as}} a combination of three elements: (a) moving ground (MVG), (b) rotating front wheels (RWF) and (c) rotating rear wheels (RWR). The interaction of these elements with the flow field has been explored to date by mainly experimental means. This paper presents a mainly computational (CFD) investigation of the effect of RWF and RWR, in combination with MVG, on the flow field around a saloon vehicle. The influence of MVG&RW is presented both in terms of a combined change from a FG&FW baseline and the incremental effects seen by the addition of each element separately. For this vehicle, noticeable decrease in both drag and rear lift is shown when adding MVG&RW, whereas <b>front</b> <b>lift</b> shows little change. The same trends are seen in both CFD and experimental data. The addition of MVG alone increases both drag and <b>front</b> <b>lift,</b> whereas rear lift decreases significantly. The addition of RWF alone has little effect on the global results (aside from lift), whereas the addition of RWR alone decreases both drag and rear lift significantly. Combining the incremental changes produces values that align well to the MVG&RW case, with the exception of <b>front</b> <b>lift.</b> This shows similar trends to previously published work, both the noticeable drag decrease due to the addition of MVG&RW, and the contributions of the individual components...|$|E

40|$|The {{endoscopic}} {{approach to}} forehead and midface lifting has become popular method of face rejuvenation with minimal incisions. We have performed 67 endoscopic facelift {{procedures in the}} last four years. Forehead lifting technique included five small scalp incisions, wide subperiosteal elevation, endoscopic myotomy and forehead tissue fixation with srews, superficial temporal fascia (STF) suture to deep temporal fascia (DTF). Midface lifting technique included temporal 2. 5 cm and 1. 5 cm vertical intraoral incision, midface subperiosteal undermining and midface elevation with cable sutures Bichat’s fat to DTF. Age mediana of patients who underwent endoscopic <b>front</b> <b>lift</b> was 46, patients who had endoscopic <b>front</b> <b>lift</b> and midface lift procedure age mediana was 40. Postoperative complication rate was 7. 5 % and included frontal branch weakness (n= 2), hematoma (n= 1), infraorbital nerve paresthesia (n= 1) and asymmetrical smile (n= 1). The main question is the quality of the results. We have reviewed 49 patients who were followed 6 months or more. Preoperative and postoperative life-size photographs were analyzed. The mean elevation mediana at medial canthus was 2. 2 mm, at medial limbus 2. 3 mm, at lateral limbus 2. 5 mm, at lateral canthus 2. 9 mm. Midface – lift effect resulted cheek elevation from 1. 07 till 4. 71 mm lip corner elevation 1. 03 mm to 3. 27 mm.

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{and wind}} tunnel during the {{aerodynamic}} {{development of new}} vehicles. In the past VCC main {{focus has been on}} the drag force correlation to the wind tunnel measurements but in recent years improved methods for lift force correlations has been highly wanted. Three objectives were considered in this study to improve the lift force correlation between the CFD simulations and wind tunnel measurements for geometrical configurations of the V 60 and S 60 models. Poor mesh resolution for the wall bounded flow existed for the VCC mesh method and therefore prisms layers were considered in this thesis to increase the mesh resolution inside the boundary layer. As slick tyres generally were used in the CFD simulations better geometrical correlation was wanted to be studied as it could improve the lift force correlation between CFD simulations and wind tunnel measurements. Therefore detailed tyres were considered in this study. As the coarsest surface mesh size was used for the underbody and the components inside the engine bay, where some of the highest flow velocities occurred, mesh refinements were investigated for engine bay and underbody in this study. The prisms layers improved the predicted behavior for the boundary layer as it captured the large velocity gradients more accurately. Due to this, the skin friction prediction was also improved. Different flow behavior around the front wheels and rear wake occurred due to earlier separation. The different flow field caused an improved correlation for the lift force but worsened correlation for the drag force due to increased pressure {{at the rear of the}} cars. However, the <b>front</b> <b>lift</b> force trend correlation for the considered configurations was improved with the prisms layer mesh method. The detailed tyres caused slight more disturbances for the underbody flow which caused more attached flow around the rear of the car hence lowered pressure. Earlier separation around the front wheels also occurred for the detailed tyre geometry as the disturbed flow around the wheels was increased. Slight improved correlation for the front and rear lift forces to the wind tunnel measurements could be seen with the detailed tyre compared to the slick tyre. The mesh refinements for the engine bay and underbody showed significant differences for the flow at the underbody which had significant impact on the flow at the rear wake for the V 60 model. Minor differences could be seen for the aerodynamic forces for the baseline configuration for the V 60 model while great differences occurred for the configurations affecting the underbody. Due to this significant improved correlation for the front and rear lift force trends were achieved for the underbody configurations with the refined engine bay and underbody mesh method. Conclusions could be drawn that the prisms layer caused earlier separation due to its increased mesh resolution for the wall bounded flow. However, finer mesh resolution was needed inside the boundary layer to ensure consistent separation behavior for both the considered models. Improved correlation for the <b>front</b> <b>lift</b> force could however be seen. The detailed tyre only had minor effects on the flow field and aerodynamic forces and therefore not so important to include for further studies. The refined engine bay and underbody caused significant improved lift force trend correlation to the wind tunnel measurements and should be considered for future studies. To improve the correlation between CFD simulations and wind tunnel measurements increased mesh resolution for the wall bounded flow should be considered to better capture the large velocity gradients close to the wall...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} design of Heavy Duty Pavement which is when a pavement loading exceeds highway levels. The environment where these conditions occur are for example at ports, industrial areas and airport because {{of the use of}} heavy vehicles as handling of containers by Straddle Carriers, <b>Front</b> <b>Lift</b> Trucks or Reach Stackers, airplanes and more. The main emphasis here will be on heavy duty pavements for ports. Different design methods are discussed and compared for the pavement design of ports. In this research two different design methods are thoroughly analyzed, the British Ports Associations Heavy Duty Pavements Manual which is a chart based procedure and the HIPAVE program which is an Australian Heavy Duty Pavement Design Guide. Both those methods are widely used around the world. Furthermore, an analysis is performed to research the plastic properties of the pavement. In most design methods, the material properties of the granular materials are assumed as elastic when they are not, they are elasto-plastic. A Finite Element Analysis is performed to determine if this assumption has significant effect on the design of pavements by comparing models of a design pavement section with elastic granular materials and elasto-plastic granular materials. The main conclusions from the comparison study of different pavement design methods are when using the HIPAVE program the total thickness of the design pavement section is smaller than using the British Ports Manual. Smaller thickness result in less materials needed for and therefor lower cost for the pavement section. Regarding the plasticity analysis, it is concluded that the assumption to model the behavior of unbound granular materials as elastic in pavement design is correct. The Finite Element Analysis determined that plasticity does have effect on the behavior of the materials with respect to elastic behavior, but there is not a considerable difference in pavement displacement between the two analysis...|$|E

40|$|Frontal rain is {{rain that}} comes from a weather front. For example, a cold <b>front</b> <b>lifts</b> warm, moist air. This parcel of air is raised to the LCL, and higher. Saturation occurs first, and then {{precipitation}} forms. The prevailing mesoscale model WRF (V 2. 2) is used to simulate a heavy rain case caused by interaction between a move-in front and topographical heterogeneities on plain land. It is found that both thermodynamic and dynamic fields along the front are heterogeneous in time and space. The heterogeneity becomes more significant as the effect of topography is added on. The heterogeneous distribution of physical variables along the front is the main reason for the heterogeneous frontal rain band; the optimum cooperation of the low level and upper level jet is another reason for the development of rain band. Topography can strengthen the rainfall and causes extremely heavy rain cells. Updraft induced by topography extends to a rather low level, while the uplifted air by frontal circulation can reach to higher levels. The quasi-steady topography circulation overlaps the frontal circulation when the front moves over plain land; the adventageous cooperation of various mesoscale condition causes the large upward velocity on windward side of the land...|$|R
