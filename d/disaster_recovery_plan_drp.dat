40|$|Abstract—As <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> (<b>DRPs)</b> for IT {{systems have}} been {{improving}} over the past decades; some metrics became widely accepted such as recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). However, <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> and solutions vary in their design, sophistication and their required RTO/RTO. Therefore, a need to categorize <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> into tiers has become necessary. Fortunately, a number of classifications exist but sometimes they are not fully explained; so, independent researchers may find the classification confusing or inappropriate for {{the current state of}} technology with significant overlap among tiers. Moreover, advances in communication and technology and the introduction of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> as a service (DRaaS) by several cloud service providers (CSPs) has reshaped the area of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> and development of DRPs. Therefore, one can argue that the old classification of 7 -tiers of DRPs is obsolete and a new classification is needed. Here, we try to survey these classifications, understand the common grounds and the differences and try to suggest some improvements to gap them...|$|R

These, {{as well as}} the feeling that “we have never had a problem, ” have made companies hesitate in implementing plans to resume business activities to prepare for a catastrophic event. However, several factors have caused companies to change their attitude towards their need for DRP and BRS.

The increasing dependence of organizations on data processing to perform the basic functions of corporate America, the fear of lawsuits by shareholders for their failure to prepare, recent accounting regulations that address an entity’s ability to survive as an “ongoing ” entity (AICPA, 1988) in event of a disaster have caused management to address the need to develop DRP and BRS, and federal regulations that call for the existence or development of <b>DRP</b> and BRS <b>plans</b> (Garcia...|$|R

40|$|The <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> have {{increased}} their dominance, after 11 September 2001, in which thousands of international organizations based in the Twin Towers were forced to put in test plans, most of which failed with different impacts ranging from their disappearance to the affectation in their operation, with recovery periods that took months and years, in some cases, to reach {{the same level of}} operation they had before the disaster. Large business groups {{in the first decade of}} the XXI century have been looking greater flexibility in their IT services through the called “Service Oriented Architecture" (SOA), which has given them, in general: •	Greater interoperability between existing applications, external and future applications •	Agility in business processes that enable faster time implementation of required changes in the business processes of the company. •	Lower maintenance costs to ensure the business capabilities (software components) are consolidated in a small amount of shared services. Service-oriented architectures (SOAs), based on Web service standards, have emerged as the leading industry wide enabler for interoperability with mechanisms to exchange processes and I or data between heterogeneous systems. In the web environment, interoperability is a necessary condition to have full access to the information available. Companies that are embracing SOAs are finding huge benefits, but could be lost if we don 't have an effective <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Plan,</b> based on SOA's approach.

40|$|The Information Technology (IT) {{industry}} has grown {{and has become}} an integral part in the world of business today. The importance of information, and IT in particular, will in fact only increase with time (von Solms, 1999). For a large group of organizations computer systems form the basis of their day-to-day functioning (Halliday, Badendorst & von Solms, 1996). These systems evolve at an incredible pace and this brings about a greater need for securing them, as well as the organizational information processed, transmitted and stored. This technological evolution brings about new risks for an organization’s systems and information (Halliday et. al., 1996). If IT fails, it means that the business could fail as well, creating a need for more rigorous IT management (International Business Machines Corporation, 2000). For this reason, executive management must be made aware of the potential consequences that a disaster could have on the organisation (Hawkins,Yen & Chou, 2000). A disaster could be any event that would cause a disruption in the normal day-to-day functioning of an organization. Such an event could range from a natural disaster, like a fire, an earthquake or a flood, to something more trivial, like a virus or system malfunction (Hawkins et. al., 2000). During the 1980 ’s a discipline known as <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Planning</b> (<b>DRP)</b> emerged to protect an organization’s data centre, which was central to the organisation’s IT based structure, from the effects of disasters. This solution, however, focussed only on the protection of the data centre. During the early 1990 ’s the focus shifted towards distributed computing and client/server technology. Data centre protection and recovery were no longer enough to ensure survival. Organizations needed to ensure the continuation of their mission critical processes to support their continued goal of operations (IBM Global Services, 1999). Organizations now had to ensure that their mission critical functions could continue while the data centre was recovering from a disaster. A different approach was required. It {{is for this reason that}} Business Continuity Planning (BCP) was accepted as a formal discipline (IBM Global Services, 1999). To ensure that business continues as usual, an organization must have a plan in place that will help them ensure both the continuation and recovery of critical business processes and the recovery of the data centre, should a disaster strike (Moore, 1995). Wilson (2000) defines a business continuity plan as “a set of procedures developed for the entire enterprise, outlining the actions to be taken by the IT organization, executive staff, and the various business units in order to quickly resume operations in the event of a service interruption or an outage”. With markets being highly competitive as they are, an organization needs a detailed listing of steps to follow to ensure minimal loss due to downtime. This is very important for maintaining its competitive advantage and public stature (Wilson, 2000). The fact that the company’s reputation is at stake requires executive management to take continuity planning very serious (IBM Global Services, 1999). Ensuring continuity of business processes and recovering the IT services of an organization is not the sole responsibility of the IT department. Therefore management should be aware that they could be held liable for any consequences resulting from a disaster (Kearvell-White, 1996). Having a business continuity plan in place is important to the entire organization, as everyone, from executive management to the employees, stands to benefit from it (IBM Global Services, 1999). Despite this, numerous organizations do not have a business continuity plan in place. Organizations neglecting to develop a plan put themselves at tremendous risk and stand to loose everything (Kearvell-White, 1996) ...|$|R

40|$|Not {{much can}} be done to prevent the {{occurrence}} of a disaster, but one can be prepared in the event of such a disaster. Pre-positioning of aid supplies has become a crucial part of disaster management, providing the means to overcome the impact of a disaster and to reduce the suffering and loss of life associated with these events. Natural and man-made disasters are largely unpredictable, therefore disasters need to be researched and their impact fully understood so that the aid supplies required to maintain survival during and after disaster events will be available. The member states within the South African Development Community (SADC) are the countries of interest for this project, as research conducted on inventory pre-positioning for disaster response in these countries has been insufficient. It is imperative to anticipate the needs of disaster victims for potential disasters. This need is evaluated according to the types and amounts of aid supplies required. All the natural and man-made disasters that have manifested in these countries over the last 30 years are identified, as well as the appropriate aid supplies required to successfully address the impact of such disasters. General research contributions applied to humanitarian operations have progressed signif- icantly, whilst operations research methods have not yet been comprehensively introduced to cater for disaster-related problems. A literature review examines the problems associated with the disaster preparedness phase and the existing models used to solve these problems. This project proposes two generic mathe- matical models {{that can be used to}} effectively determine the types and quantities of aid supplies required in pre-positioning facilities within the SADC.

SBA plays {{a critical role in}} assisting the victims of natural and other declared disasters. SBA provides financial assistance through its Disaster Loan Program to help homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofits recover from disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks. Since the agency's inception in 1953, SBA has approved more than $ 46 billion in disaster loans for homeowners, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. After the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes (Katrina, Rita, and Wilma), SBA faced an unprecedented demand for disaster loans, while also being confronted with a significant backlog of applications; therefore, hundreds of thousands of loans were not disbursed in a timely way. Many criticized SBA for what was perceived to be a slow and confusing response to the disasters and one that exposed many deficiencies in the agency's Disaster Loan Program and demonstrated the need for reform. For example, as we stated in our February 2007 report, SBA did not engage in or complete comprehensive disaster plans before the Gulf Coast hurricanes, and this limited logistical disaster planning likely contributed to the initial challenges the agency faced in responding to the 2005 hurricanes. As a result, Congress and SBA agreed that the program needed significant improvements.
