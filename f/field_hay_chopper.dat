5000|$|Straw mulch or <b>field</b> <b>hay</b> or salt hay are {{lightweight}} and normally sold in compressed bales. They have an unkempt look {{and are used}} in vegetable gardens and as a winter covering. They are biodegradable and neutral in pH. They have good moisture retention and weed controlling properties but also {{are more likely to}} be contaminated with weed seeds. Salt hay is less likely to have weed seeds than <b>field</b> <b>hay.</b> Straw mulch is also available in various colors.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between standing vegetation and dung from hay-fed cattle and sheep. In an experimental study, hay is retrieved from a known <b>hay</b> <b>field,</b> surrounded by a semi-open landscape of hedgerows, forests and heather <b>fields.</b> The <b>hay</b> is fed to cattle and sheep, after which the dung is collected and from which the botanical remains are analysed, according to archaeobotanical standards. The results from the macro-remains are compared to vegetation relevés from the <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b> The pollen analysis is compared to both the <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> and the surrounding vegetation. Results from the plant macro remains provide an excellent representation of the vegetation in the field itself on the presence/absence level. Pollen analysis reflects the regional vegetation very well and are comparable with 'surface samples'...|$|R

40|$|Plant growth {{regulators}} were aerially applied on April 26, 1996, to two alfalfa fields, one (Cibola) in {{its first}} year of production and the other field (CUF 101) in its third year. The first year field was approximately 50 % through the cutting cycle and the third year field was approximately 30 % through the cutting cycle when applications were made. No statistical differences were noted in hay tonnage the first cutting after application. Yield increases due to treatments were noted in the second cutting and maximum increases ranged from 277 - 461 lbs of hay per acre. No yield or quality differences were noted the third cutting after application. The two fields differed in their response. The lowest rates of plant growth regulators produced higher yields in the first year field, but these treatment rates had greatly lowered hay quality the previous cutting. These effects were not noticed in the third year stand <b>field.</b> Increased <b>hay</b> tonnage was noted in the third year field from the 16 oz/acre rates, but was not evident in the first year <b>field.</b> <b>Hay</b> quality was usually highest in the check the first two cuttings after treatment.

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of the advances {{made during the}} last few years with respect {{to the study of the}} electrodynamics in the earth's middle atmosphere. In a report of the experimental work conducted, attention is given to large middle atmospheric electric fields, the downward coupling of high altitude processes into the middle atmosphere, and upward coupling of tropospheric processes into the middle atmosphere. It is pointed out that new developments in tethered balloons and superpressure balloons should greatly increase the measurement duration of earth-ionospheric potential measurements and of stratospheric electric field measurements in the next few years. Theoretical work considered provides an excellent starting point for study of upward coupling of transient and dc electric <b>fields.</b> <b>Hays</b> and Roble (1979) were the first to construct a model which included orographic features as well as the classical thunderstorm generator...|$|R
40|$|Within {{recent years}} the nodding thistle or musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.) has be-come {{naturalized}} and abundant in northwestern Ohio {{in at least two}} areas, the Castalia-Bellevue-Sandusky area and the Carey area. In the summers of 1967 and 1968, the total detailed distribution of Carduus nutans in these two areas was mapped by noting its occur-rence and abundance in relation to the general geologic conditions, topographic features, and habitats. The thistle was most abundant in moderately grazed pasture <b>fields,</b> <b>hay</b> <b>fields,</b> and along grassy roadsides on high, dry ridges and hillsides where the limestone or dolomite bedrock was less than six feet below the surface. Plants were rare or infre-quent where the bedrock was deeper, in flatter terrain, in cultivated fields, and along railroad tracks. Detailed maps of the two areas depict, by the use of three different sizes of dots, the aproximate abundance of the plants at each site and the correlation of this distribution with the geologic substrate. Expansion of the plant's local range by natural means is slow, because many of the heads do not have fully developed achenes, the achenes do not readily become separated from the head, and the heads tend to drop to the groun...|$|R

40|$|Many factors affect forage quality, {{including}} {{moisture level}} at baling, compaction, bulk density, and maturity at harvest. Losses of dry matter and nutrient value occur during <b>field</b> curing. <b>Hay</b> baled {{at or above}} 18 % moisture should have less nutrient loss in the <b>field.</b> However, <b>hay</b> baled at these moisture levels {{has the potential to}} heat during storage, causing dry matter loss and nutrient degradation. Also, as particle length of forage decreases, packing ability of forage and bulk density of bales increase. Although particle length is reduced by grinding baled forage, this can result in nutrient losses. Also, when cattle are fed free choice in a ring feeder, precutting forage may help reduce waste because the smaller particles fall within the ring and are not pulled out by the animals and lost on the ground. Objectives of these experiments were to compare the effects of precutting alfalfa during round baling and conventional baling on heifer performance, forage wastage, and eating preference...|$|R
