Hearing about the {{invasion}} of Normandy and believing the war was over, they got <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Walker began {{monitoring}} Riley and denying him {{access to}} liquor, but Riley {{found ways to}} evade Walker. At {{a stop at the}} Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room. He became too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E
50|$|When needed, the department's first {{officers}} commandeered private wagons or conveyed <b>drunks</b> <b>to</b> {{the station}} in a wheelbarrow. In 1883, the department obtained two horse-drawn carts for use as wagons. In 1906, motorized trucks replaced the horse-drawn wagons.|$|R
5000|$|The band's {{name comes}} from a poem written by Richard Brautigan, in which he {{compared}} roadside <b>drunks</b> <b>to</b> exotic flowers. This led to the name [...] "Brautigan Flower", which eventually became [...] "b-flower". b-flower's work often contains references to Brautigan's writing.|$|R
25|$|In 1820, Ephraim Lyon {{founded the}} Church of Bacchus in Eastford, Connecticut. He {{declared}} himself High Priest, and added local <b>drunks</b> <b>to</b> {{the list of}} membership. He maintained that those who died as members {{would go to a}} Bacchanalia for their afterlife.|$|R
5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to avoid the worst of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> improve their chances of a win.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the first shots from the Royal Battery, the French {{defenses}} opposite fell silent, the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries. British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment, and at 16:30 flags of truce were raised over the city's bastions. Clermont's offer requested a 24-hour ceasefire to negotiate terms, but Braithwaite allowed only until 08:00 the following morning, during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue. Clermont, isolated and unsupported, accepted the terms, and the following morning Braithwaite's army entered the city and took possession, although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> surrender formally.|$|E

25|$|The eating {{of bitter}} herbs symbolized the miseries of the Egyptian bondage. In the evenings four cups of wine were <b>drunk,</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the four world-kingdoms.

25|$|Fun House {{was also}} poorly {{received}} by critics {{and the general}} public. Alexander was dismissed in August 1970 after arriving at the Goose Lake International Music Festival too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> play. He {{was replaced by a}} succession of new bass players, including former roadie Zeke Zettner and James Recca. Around this time, the band expanded their line-up by adding a second guitar player, roadie Bill Cheatham, who was eventually replaced by James Williamson, a childhood friend of the Ashetons and Alexander.|$|E

25|$|The {{legend of}} the Lee Penny gave rise to Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman. The amulet was placed in water, which was then <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> provide the cure. No money was ever taken for its use. In 1629 Isobel Young, burned as a witch later that same year, sought to borrow the stone to cure cattle. The family of Lockart of Lee would not lend the stone in its silver setting; however, they gave flagons of water in which the coin had been steeped.|$|E
25|$|God {{resolves}} {{to destroy}} the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah {{for the sins of}} their people. Abraham protests and gets God to agree not {{to destroy the}} cities if 10 righteous men can be found. Angels save Abraham's nephew Lot and his family, but his wife looks back on the destruction against their command and is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot's daughters, concerned that they are fugitives who will never find husbands, get him <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> become pregnant by him, and give birth to the ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites.|$|E
25|$|Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, {{just before}} he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his {{military}} service, Wilson returned {{to live with his}} wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation.|$|E

Then, in order to obtain an {{authentic}} Cardassian secure data rod, he is forced to trade a large quantity of bio-mimetic gel, a rare, dangerous, and highly regulated material. Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig) strongly objects, and relents only when Sisko orders him unequivocally, still vowing to lodge a formal complaint. Matters are complicated when Tolar stabs Quark (Armin Shimerman) in an altercation while <b>drunk.</b> <b>To</b> keep Tolar out of trouble, he bribes Quark and convinces Odo (René Auberjonois) to drop the matter.|$|E
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that {{the sight of a}} glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} time Wright's command was {{arriving}} in Washington, Early's corps began {{to arrive at the}} breastworks of Fort Stevens, yet Early delayed the attack because he was still unsure of the federal strength defending the fort, much of his army was still in transit to the front, and the troops he had were exhausted due to the excessive heat {{and the fact that they}} had been on the march since June 13. Additionally, many of the Confederate troops had looted the home of Montgomery Blair, the son of the founder of Silver Spring, Maryland. They found barrels of whiskey in the basement of the mansion, called Blair Mansion, and many troops were too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> get a good start in the morning. This allowed for further fortification by Union troops.|$|E

25|$|Empire Cowdray {{was built}} for the MoWT. She was {{initially}} operated under {{the management of the}} Alexander Steamship Company. Following completion in October 1944, two days of sea trials were held before the ship entered service. Following these, a cargo of coal was loaded at Hendon Docks. Once loading was complete, the crew were given a brief shore leave so that they could have a beer before the ship sailed to join a convoy. When it was time to sail, the crew ignored orders to return to their ship, not returning until being threatened with being put in jail. When the crew did return to the ship, they were too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> sail, causing the ship to miss the convoy. After they had sobered up, the crew were all fined for refusing the lawful command of the Captain and causing the ship to miss the convoy.|$|E
25|$|In August 1784, Aurora {{went into}} Portsmouth {{to undergo a}} small repair which took until December to complete. She {{returned}} to Portsmouth between July and October 1787 for a refit, being recommissioned under John Sutton in the September. In May 1788, Sutton took Aurora back to the West Indies, setting sail for Jamaica on the third. While there, her carpenter Nicholas Rodgers was court martialled on charges of drunkenness. First Lieutenant Crofton and a midshipman, Thomas Vanderdussen, presented evidence that Rodgers would regularly drink himself into a stupor in his cabin {{or one of the}} ship's boats, and would refuse, whilst <b>drunk,</b> <b>to</b> let any of the crew carry out carpentry tasks in his absence. On 23 July Rodgers had gone ashore at Bluefields and failed to return until arrested by the marines. Later he ascended the quarterdeck to shout abuse at the boatswain. Rodgers denied all charges other than one of abusive language, for which he said he was provoked by others. Rodgers was found guilty on all counts and he was dismissed from naval service.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{experiences}} two separate flashbacks that reveal {{the true nature}} of the Origami Killer. The first takes place 34 years earlier, with two twin brothers playing in a construction site. One of the two, John Sheppard, falls into a broken pipe and gets his leg trapped, just as a rainstorm causes the pipe to begin filling with water. The second occurs shortly after, with John's brother running home to warn their father, only to find him too <b>drunk</b> <b>to</b> help. Scared and confused, the boy could only watch helplessly as his brother drowned. Thus, the Origami Killer was born: a killer who searches for a father willing to sacrifice himself. He kills his victims the same way his brother died. The boy turns out to be Scott; after he reached adulthood, he changed his surname to Shelby. His actions as an investigator are not meant to get justice for his victims; rather, he needed to collect the evidence of his crimes, which he burns in his office wastebasket.|$|E
