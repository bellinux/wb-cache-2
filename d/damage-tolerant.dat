50|$|The Cabri G2 is a two-seat light {{helicopter}} with a three-bladed fully articulated {{main rotor}} and a Fenestron-type tail rotor. The main rotor {{is designed to}} enable flight within a wide envelope of weather conditions, while the composite rotor blades are <b>damage-tolerant</b> and have no set life span. The use of the Fenestron has been credited as having made the Cabri noticeably quieter than competing rotorcraft such as the Sikorsky S-300, {{in addition to its}} favourable safety, handling, and maneuverability attributes. The Cabri uses a skid landing gear arrangement; unusually, the skids are attached to the fuselage by elastomeric mounts rather than being directly bolted on to reduce ground resonance and provide greater articulation. The fuselage features a damage-resistant all-composite monocoque construction, reducing weight and maintenance requirements while increasing strength.|$|E

40|$|The {{residual}} strength of specimens with damage and the sensitivity to damage while subjected to an applied inplane compression load were determined for flatplate specimens and blade-stiffened panels.

This step consists in plant identification using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Next step is a synthesis of appropriate neural controller. An adaptive control scheme based on inverse dynamics problem (IDP) approach is used to achieve control goals for the conditions mentioned above. The scheme is implemented basing on ANN tools.

40|$|In this report, an {{approach}} to <b>damage-tolerant</b> aircraft structural design is proposed based {{on the concept of}} an equivalent "Level of Safety" that incorporates past service experience in the design of new structures. The discrete "Level of Safety" for a single inspection event is defined as the compliment of the probability that a single flaw size larger than the critical flaw size for residual strength of the structure exists, and that the flaw will not be detected. The cumulative "Level of Safety" for the entire structure is the product of the discrete "Level of Safety" values for each flaw of each damage type present at each location in the structure. Based on the definition of "Level of Safety", a design procedure was identified and demonstrated on a composite sandwich panel for various damage types, with results showing the sensitivity of the structural sizing parameters to the relative safety of the design. The "Level of Safety" approach has broad potential application to <b>damage-tolerant</b> aircraft structural design with uncertainty...|$|E

Electrophoretically deposited fibre preforms {{were placed in}} a high-load pressure filtration assembly, leading to formation of consolidated compacts with high green densities. After sintering at 1200 degreesC for 3 h, the compacts had a density of 86. 4 % of theoretical density and showed <b>damage-tolerant</b> behaviour up to 1300 degreesC, with flexural strength values of 235 MPa and 224 MPa at room temperature and 1300 degreesC, respectively. No significant microstructural damage was detected after thermal cycling the samples between room temperature and 1150 degreesC for up to 300 cycles. The thermomechanical test results combined with detailed electron microscopy observations indicate that the overall composite behaviour in terms of damage-tolerance, thermal capability and thermal cycling resistance is mainly controlled by two microstructural features: (1) {{the presence of a}} dense NdPO 4 interphase but weak bonding with the matrix or fibre and (2) the presence of homogeneously distributed nano pores (< 350 nm) within the mullite matrix.

40|$|This article aims {{to obtain}} <b>damage-tolerant</b> designs with minimum weight for a {{laminated}} composite structure using genetic algorithm. Damage tolerance due to impacts in a laminated composite structure {{is enhanced by}} dispersing the plies such that too many adjacent plies {{do not have the}} same angle. Weight of the structure is minimized and the Tsai-Wu failure criterion is considered for the safe design. Design variables considered are the number of plies and ply orientation. The influence of dispersed ply angles on the weight of the structure for a given loading conditions is studied by varying the angles in the range of 0 degrees- 45 degrees, 0 degrees- 60 degrees and 0 degrees- 90 degrees at intervals of 5 degrees and by using specific ply angles tailored to loading conditions. A comparison study is carried out between the conventional stacking sequence and the stacking sequence with dispersed ply angles for <b>damage-tolerant</b> weight minimization and some useful designs are obtained. Unconventional stacking sequence is more damage tolerant than the conventional stacking sequence is demonstrated by performing a finite element analysis under both tensile as well as compressive loading conditions. Moreover, a new mathematical function called the dispersion function is proposed to measure the dispersion of ply angles in a laminate. The approach for dispersing ply angles to achieve damage tolerance is especially suited for composite material design space which has multiple local minima...|$|E

40|$|All {{turbofan}} engines work on {{the same}} principle. A large fan {{at the front of}} the engine draws air in. A portion of the air enters the compressor, but a greater portion passes on the outside of the engine this is called bypass air. The air that enters the compressor then passes through several stages of rotating fan blades that compress the air more, and then it passes into the combustor. In the combustor, fuel is injected into the airstream, and the fuel-air mixture is ignited. The hot gasses produced expand rapidly to the rear, and the engine reacts by moving forward. If there is a flaw in the system, such as an unexpected obstruction, the fan blade can break, spin off, and harm other engine components. Fan casings, therefore, need to be strong enough to contain errant blades and <b>damage-tolerant</b> to withstand the punishment of a loose blade-turned-projectile. NASA has spearheaded research into improving jet engine fan casings, ultimately discovering a cost-effective approach to manufacturing <b>damage-tolerant</b> fan cases that also boast significant weight reduction. In an aircraft, weight reduction translates directly into fuel burn savings, increased payload, and greater aircraft range. This technology increases safety and structural integrity; is an attractive, viable option for engine manufacturers, because of the low-cost manufacturing; and it is a practical alternative for customers, as it has the added cost saving benefits of the weight reduction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring its duplication, DNA, {{the carrier}} of our genetic information, is {{particularly}} vulnerable to decay, and the capacity of cells to deal with replication stress has been recognised as a major factor protecting us from genome instability and cancer. One of the major pathways controlling the bypass of DNA lesions during replication is activated by ubiquitylation of the sliding clamp, PCNA.

Macroporous biphasic calcium {{phosphate}} bioceramics, {{for use as}} bone substitutes, have been fabricated by cold isostatically pressing and conventional sintering, using naphtalen or saccharose particles to produce macropores.
