5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The men {{selected}} for Operation Musketoon were two officers and eight men from No. 2 Commando and two Norwegian corporals from the Norwegian Independent Company 1, {{part of the}} Special Operations Executive. The raid was commanded by Captain Graeme Black, from Ontario in Canada. The second in command was Captain Joseph Houghton. The other men from No. 2 Commando were: Company Sergeant Major Miller Smith, Lance Sergeant Richard O'Brien, Lance Bombardier William Chudley and privates John Fairclough, Cyril Abram, Eric Curtis, Reginald Makeham and Fred Trigg. The two Norwegian corporals were Erling Djupdraet and Sverre Granlund. For a fortnight before leaving for Norway, the team had been training on a large country estate in Scotland. During the planning stage the commandos {{were supposed to be}} picked up after the raid, by a Short Sunderland flying boat. This was cancelled before they left, due to risks to the aircraft. Instead they would head for neutral Sweden. To assist in this, each man was issued with special equipment, which included a silk map of Norway and Sweden, a rice paper map of Russia and Norwegian Kroner notes. They also carried two compasses (one sewn into each collar tab), a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade,</b> a fighting knife and a Colt pistol. The only other small arm taken was a suppressed Sten gun, carried by Captain Houghton.|$|E
25|$|On May 31, 2017 {{nineteen}} {{members and}} associates of the Lucchese crime family were indicted {{and charged with}} racketeering, murder, narcotics (cocaine, heroin, marijuana, prescribed medication), and firearms offenses. Those charged in the indictment included the crime family's current administration Street Boss Matthew Madonna, Underboss Steven Crea Sr. and Consigliere Joseph DiNapoli. The indictment builds on charges previously filed against Lucchese soldier Christopher Londonio and Lucchese associate Terrence Caldwell who were charged in February 2017 with racketeering offenses, including the murder of Michael Meldish in the Bronx on November 15, 2013; Madonna, Crea and Crea Jr., were charged and suspected of serving as co-conspirators in the Meldish gangland exuection too. Caldwell was indicted while {{in prison for the}} 2013 attempted murder of another Bonanno crime family soldier based in Queens, Caldwell shot him in the chest but the victim survived. The court heard in September 2017, by the FBI information gathered from a prison informer, Londonio was plotting to break out of a Brooklyn federal jail involving dental floss, a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> smuggled in by a priest and a rope made out of hoarded sheets. Three attempted murders were also listed among the charges, Crea was alleged to have ordered a murder contract on a Bonanno crime family associate after he disrespected him. The FBI also alleged that Crea gave his approval in October 2016 to 66-year old Lucchese soldier Joseph Datello to drive to New Hampshire and murder an informant. Crea was personally charged with mail and wire fraud in connection of his skimming involvement with the construction of a New York City hospital. All but two of the indicted mobsters face the death penalty or life in prison.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1915 by ten {{employees}} to produce <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades.</b> In 2003, American Saw was acquired by Newell Rubbermaid. In 2017, Stanley Black & Decker purchased the tools business of Newell Brands, including Lenox.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} in prison, he had become acquainted with many criminals and outlaws of the [...] "public enemy era" [...] and helped smuggle <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> to bank robber Ray Hamilton to escape from jail in McKinney, Texas on January 27, 1932.|$|R
500|$|However, in R v. Hill and Hall (1989), the Court of Appeal {{introduced}} an objective element to part (b) of the defence. The defendants {{had been convicted}} of possession of a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> outside a US naval base in Wales, having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base's perimeter fence. They claimed a lawful excuse in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base; their reasoning was that the base would {{at some point in the}} future attract a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Given that Hill was [...] "forced to admit that she did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall today or tomorrow", the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out, however honest the belief had been.|$|E
500|$|Back {{in jail in}} Glenwood Springs, Bundy {{ignored the}} advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating {{steadily}} as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible. [...] "A more rational defendant might have realized that he stood {{a good chance of}} acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as {{a year and a half}} to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had Ted persevered, he could have been a free man." [...] Instead, Bundy assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the jail and a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> from other inmates, and accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period, he later said, by visitorsâ€”Carole Ann Boone in particular. During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, he sawed a hole about one foot (0.30 m) square between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell's ceiling and, after losing , was able to wriggle through it into the crawl space above. In the weeks that followed he made a series of practice runs, exploring the space. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.|$|E

5000|$|Linear {{cutting tools}} include tool bits (single-point cutting tools) and broaches. Rotary cutting tools include drill bits, {{countersinks}} and counterbores, taps and dies, milling cutters, reamers, and cold saw blades.

50|$|Paul's hammers follow {{tradition}} {{and contribute to}} his unique style. He uses long, flexible hammers made from ground-down <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades,</b> with wooden blocks attached to the ends. The wooden blocks are then covered with pieces of thin glove leather. These hammers are very similar in design to the ones his grandfather used.|$|R
5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar {{in one of}} its windows had been sawed {{completely}} through at the top and bottom and glued back in place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|R
50|$|Pickersgill {{served the}} first two years of the war in Saint-Denis Internment Camp (Stalag 220) as an enemy alien. He escaped by sawing out a window with a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> smuggled into the camp in a loaf of bread.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> specifications: The {{most common}} blade is the 12 inch or 300 mm length. Hacksaw blades have two holes near the ends for {{mounting}} {{them in the}} saw frame and the 12 inch / 300 mm dimension refers to the center to center distance between these mounting holes.|$|E
50|$|Spettekaka is {{frequently}} served accompanied by dark coffee, {{vanilla ice cream}} and port wine. A <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> is used to gently saw the dessert into serving sized pieces, as it will crumble or shatter if a knife is used or too much pressure is applied with the saw blade.|$|E

5000|$|Traverse methods also {{feature in}} the {{production}} of edge components, such as paper knives, leather knives, lawnmower bottom <b>blades,</b> and <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades.</b> These types of application normally utilise a hairpin coil or a transverse flux coil which sits {{over the edge of the}} component. The component is progressed through the coil and a following spray quench consisting of nozzles or drilled blocks.|$|R
50|$|Further {{investigations}} discovered used <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> {{and cloth}} used {{to disguise the}} broken line at the scene. Investigators believe the saboteurs took several nights {{to cut through the}} rail, which was remote enough that no one would see them at work. Later reports agreed that the crash was caused by sabotage. No terrorist organisation took credit, and no motive for causing the crash could be established.|$|R
50|$|The police {{suspect that}} the {{jailbreak}} occurred after midnight. The fugitives had cut through the cylindrical â€˜dead latchâ€™ of the padlocked cellâ€™s grilled door, possibly with a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade,</b> and scaled the relatively low wall of the block. (The wall had been fortified and topped with an electrified barbed wire fence in 2011 to house terror suspect Thadiyantavide Nazeer.) They proceeded to the prisonâ€™s infirmary and stole bed sheets and clothes left out to dry on clothes lines.|$|E
5000|$|A growler is an {{electrical}} device used for testing insulation of a motor for shorted coils. A growler {{consists of a}} coil of wire wrapped around an iron core and connected to a source of AC current. When placed on the armature or stator core of a motor the growler acts as the primary of a transformer and the armature coils act as the secondary. A [...] "feeler", a thin strip of steel (<b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade)</b> {{can be used as}} the short detector.|$|E
50|$|Each graptolite colony {{is known}} as a rhabdosome and has a {{variable}} number of branches (called stipes) originating from an initial individual (called a sicula). Each subsequent individual (zooid) is housed within a tubular or cup-like structure (called a theca). In some colonies, there are two sizes of theca, and {{it has been suggested that}} this difference is due to sexual dimorphism.The number of branches and the arrangement of the thecae are important features in the identification of graptolite fossils. Their general shape has been compared with that of a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
50|$|Less {{than three}} weeks later, Dunn and his {{partners}} were arrested by federal agents in Denver, Colorado on July 21, 1942. He {{and the rest of}} his gang were convicted on federal charges and received 15 years. Two women associated with the gang were also charged as accessories and sentenced to six years each. Prior to sentencing, <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> were found in Dunn's cell and he later confessed to planning a jail break.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> are {{normally}} quite brittle, so care {{needs to be}} taken to prevent brittle fracture of the blade. Early blades were of carbon steel, now termed 'low alloy' blades, and were relatively soft and flexible. They avoided breakage, but also wore out rapidly. Except where cost is a particular concern, this type is now obsolete. 'Low alloy' blades are still the only type available for the Junior hacksaw, which limits the usefulness of this otherwise popular saw.|$|R
5000|$|On August 31, 1934, when Gladys {{was living}} in Calumet City, Illinois, she {{inserted}} a dozen broken <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> into pears and traveled to Gary, Indiana, to visit {{her husband in the}} Lake County jail. As she passed the pears to her husband, Chief deputy sheriff Carroll Holley became suspicious and intervened. (Carroll Holley was the nephew of Sheriff Lillian Holley, whose car was stolen by John Dillinger when he used a wooden gun to escape from that same jail earlier that summer.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, the Emperor Showa made {{a tour of}} the Kansai {{district}} to inspect industries as part of the encouragement of domestic production, and personally inspected a Fujikoshi <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> that was on display as an example of an outstanding domestic product at the Osaka Prefectural Office. Overjoyed at the honor of entertaining the Emperor's special attention, Kohki Imura decided to name his product [...] "NACHI" [...] after the name of the latest naval cruiser to be made in Japan, the very same vessel that the Emperor was sailing on for his tour.|$|E
50|$|If {{it was not}} {{possible}} to pull the fillers out, then the protruding sections could have been simply cut off. The gap fillers were made of a cloth impregnated with ceramic - they were stiff and could be easily cut with a tool similar to a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade.</b> Protruding gap fillers were a problem because they disrupted the normally laminar air flow under the orbiter during reentry, causing turbulence at lower speeds. A turbulent air flow would result in a mixing of hot and cold air, which could have a major effect on the shuttle temperature.|$|E
50|$|On {{discovering}} his retention, {{and with}} the RAF short of experienced pilots, MI9 urged O'Leary to get a group of pilots including Higginson back to Britain, under the Special Operations Executive's Operation Titania. Using Polish priest Father Myrda as a go-between, O'Leary smuggled a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> into the prison. On the night of 6 August during a noisy inmate-contrived concert in the forts courtyard, Higginson and four other pilots escaped through a coal shute, {{and out of the}} fort via an operational sewer. Reaching Cap d'Ail without his supplied ID card, Higginson reached the Scottish tea house in Monte Carlo, a safe house run by spinster Eva Trenchard.|$|E
50|$|On hacksaws, as {{with most}} frame saws, the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, {{resulting}} in cutting action on either the push or pull stroke. In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a bench vice, <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> should be set to be facing forwards. Some frame saws, including Fret Saws and Piercing Saws, have their blades set to be facing the handle because {{they are used to}} cut by being pulled down against a horizontal surface.|$|R
25|$|Several {{traditional}} {{players have}} used hammers that differ substantially {{from those in}} common use today. Paul Van Arsdale (b. 1920), a player from upstate New York, uses flexible hammers made from <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades,</b> with leather-covered wooden blocks attached to the ends (these are modeled after the hammers used by his grandfather, Jesse Martin). The Irish player John Rea (1915â€“1983) used hammers made of thick steel wire, wound with wool. He made these himself from old bicycle spokes. Billy Bennington (1900â€“1986), a player from Norfolk in England, used cane hammers bound with wool.|$|R
2500|$|There are two living {{groups of}} hemichordates. The solitary enteropneusts, {{commonly}} known as [...] "acorn worms", have long proboscises and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to [...] long, and burrow though seafloor sediments. Pterobranchs are colonial animals, often less than [...] long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected.

The extinct graptolites, colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades,</b> lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.|$|R
50|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{search of the}} island revealed nothing; guards found only the abandoned wrench. An extensive, multi-day search ensued; portions of the island were flooded with tear gas {{in an attempt to}} flush out the escapees, with no result. Subsequent investigation revealed that Cole and Roe had prepared for the escape well in advance, using a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade</b> to weaken the window bars, and disguising the damage with a mixture of grease and shoe polish. At the beach, the men presumably entered the water, relying on floats improvised from tires or fuel canisters. There was no evidence to suggest they had constructed or launched a raft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} the teeth can be {{anywhere}} from fourteen to thirty-two teeth per inch (tpi) for a hand blade, with as few as three tpi for a large power <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade.</b> The blade chosen {{is based on the}} thickness of the material being cut, with a minimum of three teeth in the material. As hacksaw teeth are so small, they are set in a [...] "wave" [...] set. As for other saws they are set from side to side to provide a [...] or clearance when sawing, but the set of a hacksaw changes gradually from tooth to tooth in a smooth curve, rather than alternate teeth set left and right.|$|E
50|$|Mata Ortiz potters {{generally}} work {{in their}} homes, with bedrooms often doubling as studios. The work space generally consists of just a table, with simple tools such as a <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blade,</b> a butter knife, broken spoons, sandpaper, a small stone and paintbrushes generally made from clippings of childrenâ€™s hair, sometimes just four or five strands tied on a stick. The shaping of the clay is relatively faithful to the original PaquimÃ© techniques, but each potter has their own variation in how they make their pots. However, they are generally based on Quesadaâ€™s single-coil method, using the gray, yellow, orange, red and white clays from the area just as those in PaquimÃ© did. The paints are made from clay or from crushed minerals such as manganese, also mined locally.|$|E

50|$|While saws {{for cutting}} metal {{had been in}} use for many years, {{significant}} improvements in longevity and efficiency {{were made in the}} 1880s by George N. Clemson, a founder of Clemson Bros., Inc of Middletown, New York, United States,. Clemson conducted tests which involved changing the dimensions, shapes of teeth, styles of set, and variable heat treatments of blades. Clemson claimed enormous improvements to the cutting ability of blades and built a major industrial operation manufacturing <b>hacksaw</b> <b>blades</b> sold under the trade name Star Hack Saw. In 1898, Clemson was granted US Patent 601947, which details various improvements in the hacksaw.|$|R
