40|$|In the New Property Rights {{approach}} {{the degree of}} incompleteness of markets is taken independently {{of the cost of}} the public ordering and of their efficiency relatively to private orderings. In this approach "public markets", similarly to a Swiss cheese, are either assumed to be non-existent empty holes (because of infinite third <b>party</b> <b>verification</b> costs) or assumed to be smooth and efficient (because of zero third <b>party</b> <b>verification</b> costs). When we allow for positive but not infinite third <b>party</b> <b>verification</b> costs we are necessarily pushed back to the insights of Commons, Coase, Fuller and Williamson. The degree of (in) completeness of public markets becomes an endogenous economic problem and managers can be seen as agents that make "second order" specific investments to run specific relations that cannot be efficiently run by public markets. Managers and the public authorities build respectively private and public "legal equilibria" that set the working rules within which transactions can take place. Private and public legal equilibria are not only substitutes but also complements. This complementarity is an important source of the path dependency that characterises the development of different legal systems. The framework is applied to GM's acquisition of Fisher Body. We claim that, contrary to the claims of the New Property Rights approach, the advantages of the acquisition cannot be due to the incentives of private property but should be rather related to the replacement of public markets by the new private ordering set up by Alfred Sloan. public markets, private orderings...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – <b>First</b> <b>party</b> {{fraud is}} fraud {{committed}} by an account holder or customer {{that does not}} involve {{the use of a}} stolen identity. This type of fraud has grown substantially in recent times due to increased online shopping and is becoming a major concern for online retail businesses, hereby referred to as e-tailers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide insights into the motives and nature of <b>first</b> <b>party</b> fraud in e-tailing. Design/methodology/approach – Systematic literature review was used to synthesise existing research on <b>first</b> <b>party</b> fraud. The authors used scholarly literature as well as grey literature to help understand the motives and nature of this growing business problem. Findings – Findings reveal a myriad of schemes and motives for engaging in <b>first</b> <b>party</b> fraud. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this paper employed very little literature due to availability. However, the authors believe that the findings are still useful for advancing the knowledge in this emerging research area. Practical implications – This study will be useful to researchers as well as practitioners in the retail industry in helping understand the nature and motives of <b>first</b> <b>party</b> frauds which could in turn help devise preventive strategies. The study also makes a case for increased managerial interest and involvement in reducing <b>first</b> <b>party</b> fraud.

40|$|Raised {{public concern}} in the European Union (EU) about the {{legality}} of its timber imports, the need to combat illegal logging and deforestation, and for promoting sustainable forest management practices, have pushed the EU commission to raise its standards and legality demands for wood imports. Combining literature review, structured interviews of importers and end-users of hardwood timber, and trade data analysis this study assesses the combined potential influence from the policy mechanisms FLEGT, the EU Timber regulation (EUTR), and different third <b>party</b> <b>verification</b> schemes on the timber trade between tropical countries and Europe. As this combined impact is more readily traced at national level, this study focuses on {{the implications of the}} abovementioned policy instruments on the trade in tropical timber between Indonesia and the UK, being important suppliers and consumers of tropical timber respectively. The results indicate that FLEGT and EUTR could reinvigorate the, until now, rather ineffective (in the narrow sense of stopping illegal timber trade) third <b>party</b> <b>verification</b> schemes. The literature as well as answers from interviews and questionnaires indicates that FLEGT and the EUTR could reinforce the current trend of decreasing imports of tropical timber to EU. The substitution of oak lumber for tropical hardwood lumber mentioned in the literature as well as in interviews and questionnaires is confirmed by the results of econometric analysis. The interviews also indicate a diversion of exports of tropical timber to destinations with less stringent regulatory framework than the EU...|$|R
