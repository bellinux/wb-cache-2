Mali's cotton production has grown from 500,000 tonnes in 1997 to a record 635,000 tonnes in 2003, which has pleased the African Association of Cotton Producers, but has also led to a claim that cash crops are being put before food and <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> in Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.|$|E
25|$|Green fodders {{are used}} widely for {{intensive}} milk production and for fattening. Many <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% {{of the standard}} feed mixture.|$|E
25|$|Grassland based {{livestock}} production relies upon plant material such as shrubland, rangeland, and pastures for feeding ruminant animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned {{directly to the}} grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30â€“40 million pastoralists. Mixed production systems use grassland, <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.|$|E

25|$|Centre pivot {{irrigation}} {{is often}} used for grass and <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> where the water can be distributed over a considerable period of time. In other crops where moisture stress is a complex concern, for example during the growing of cauliflower, water is required to be distributed quickly two or three specific times per day {{at a rate of}} about 140% the evaporation replacement rate and for this impact sprinklers set every 12 square metres or butterfly sprinklers set every 6 square metres are required. Drip sprinklers can be used on many spaced planting locations but typically will be found as gravity fed systems on vineyards.|$|E
500|$|For farm work, such as {{ploughing}} and harrowing, the {{draught horse}} utilized {{for this purpose}} was called an affrus (or stott), which was usually smaller and cheaper than the cart horse. [...] While oxen were traditionally used as work animals on farms, horses began {{to be used in}} greater numbers after the development of the horse collar. [...] Oxen and horses were sometimes harnessed together. [...] The transition from oxen to horses for farm work was documented in pictorial sources (for example, the 11th-century Bayeux tapestry depicts working horses), and also clear from the change from the Roman two-field crop-rotation system to a new three-field system, which increased the cultivation of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> (predominantly oats, barley and beans). [...] Horses were also used to process crops; they were used to turn the wheels in mills (such as corn mills), and transport crops to market. The change to horse-drawn teams also meant a change in ploughs, as horses were more suited to a wheeled plough, unlike oxen.|$|E
500|$|Agricultural {{output in}} 1980 was 21% {{higher than the}} average {{production}} rate between 1966 and 1970. Cereal crop output increased by 18%. These improved results were not encouraging. In the Soviet Union the criterion for assessing agricultural output was the grain harvest. The import of cereal, which began under Khrushchev, had in fact become a normal phenomenon by Soviet standards. When Brezhnev had difficulties sealing commercial trade agreements with the United States, he went elsewhere, such as to Argentina. Trade was necessary because the Soviet Union's domestic production of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> was severely deficient. Another sector that was hitting the wall was the sugar beet harvest, which had declined by 2% in the 1970s. Brezhnev's way of resolving these issues was to increase state investment. Politburo member Gennady Voronov advocated for the division of each farm's work-force into what he called [...] "links". These [...] "links" [...] would be entrusted with specific functions, such as to run a farm's dairy unit. His argument was that the larger the work force, the less responsible they felt. This program had been proposed to Joseph Stalin by Andrey Andreyev in the 1940s, and had been opposed by Khrushchev before and after Stalin's death. Voronov was also unsuccessful; Brezhnev turned him down, and in 1973 he was removed from the Politburo.|$|E
