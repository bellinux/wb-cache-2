500|$|In February 2008, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sean Gulick at the University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than was previously assumed. They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. According to the press release, that [...] "could have made the impact deadlier in two ways: by altering climate (sulfate aerosols in the upper atmosphere can have a cooling effect) and by generating acid rain (water vapor can help to flush the lower atmosphere of sulfate aerosols, causing acid rain)." [...] This was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring (the rocks found were from deep within the <b>earths</b> <b>crust</b> instead), the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{states that the}} <b>Earths</b> <b>crust</b> {{is made up of}} rigid plates that [...] "float" [...] on top of the mantle and move relative to one another. As the plates move, the crust deforms dominantly along the plate margins. Intraplate deformation differs from that respect by the observation that deformation can occur anywhere the crust is weak and not just at plate margins.|$|E

However, the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability. Several entities, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy. The International Centre for Geothermal Research (IGC), a German geosciences research organization, is largely focused on geothermal energy development research.|$|E

Joscelyn Godwin writes that his Atlantean theory involves the earth being struck by a comet in 3100 BC which in turn caused the <b>earths</b> <b>crust</b> to shift causing various land masses to shrink and rise. Dunbavin claims that the submerged land around the British Isles can be eqauted with the description of Atlantis by Plato. He claims that the city of Atlantis lies in the Irish Sea between Wales, Scotland and Ireland.|$|E

5000|$|Es Vedrà {{consists}} predominantly of mesozoic [...] limestone, {{and contrary}} to the esoteric urban myth of being a special magnetic place, has no (magnetic) metal accumulations. The island we see today is {{as a result of}} a geological tumble. 155 million years ago, continuous seismic movements in the <b>earths</b> <b>crust</b> caused great shifts in the Betica Mountain Range. Eventually this caused the splitting of the range resulting in the formation of the Balearic Islands. Continued movement of the ridge which formed the islands caused portions to sheer and split away from the islands. Es Vedrà, along with the satellite island of Illa Vedranell and the Illa Tagomago, are examples of this action.|$|E
50|$|The Aravalli Range, an eroded stub {{of ancient}} {{mountains}}, {{is the oldest}} range of fold mountains in India. The natural history of the Aravalli Range dates back to a pre-Indian subcontinental collision with the mainland Eurasian Plate. The Proterozoic Aravalli-Delhi orogenic belt in north west India {{is similar to the}} younger Himalayan-type orogenic belts of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic era (of the Phanerozoic) in terms of component parts and appears to have passed through a near-orderly Wilson supercontinental cycle of events. The range rose in a Precambrian event called the Aravalli-Delhi Orogen. The Aravalli Range is a northeast-southwest trending orogenic belt that is located in the northwestern part of Indian Peninsula. It is part of the Indian Shield that was formed from a series of cratonic collisions. In ancient times, Aravalli were extremely high but since have worn down almost completely by millions of years of weathering, where as the Himalayas being young fold mountains are still continuously rising. Aravalli, being the old fold mountains, have stopped growing higher due to the cessation of upward thrust caused by the stopping of movement of the tectonic plates in the Earth's crust below them. The Aravalli Range joins two of the ancient earth's crust segments that make up the greater Indian craton, the Aravalli Craton which is the Marwar segment of <b>earths</b> <b>crust</b> to the northwest of the Aravalli Range, and the Bundelkand Craton segment of <b>earths</b> <b>crust</b> to the southeast of the Aravalli Range. Cratons, generally found in the interiors of tectonic plates, are old and stable parts of the continental lithosphere that has remained relatively undeformed during the cycles of merging and rifting of continents.|$|E

50|$|By mass, {{human cells}} consist of 65-90% water (H2O), and a {{significant}} portion of the remainder is composed of carbon-containing organic molecules. Oxygen therefore contributes a majority of a human bodys mass, followed by carbon. Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. The next 0.75% is made up of the next five elements: potassium, sulfur, chlorine, sodium, and magnesium. Only 17 elements are known for certain to be necessary to human life, with one additional element (fluorine) thought to be helpful for tooth enamel strength. A few more trace elements may play some role in the health of mammals. Boron and silicon are notably necessary for plants but have uncertain roles in animals.

5000|$|The Rabbitkettle (Gahnîhthah) Hotsprings and tufa mounds (...) are {{the largest}} of tufa mounds in Canada. The largest of the mounds, the North Mound, is 27 m high and 74 m across. The source of the springs comes from deep in the <b>earths</b> <b>crust,</b> near {{the base of the}} granite batholiths that form the Ragged Range. The {{volcanic}} activity that raised the mountains still heats the water deep {{below the surface of the}} earth. The heated water percolates upwards, dissolving calcium carbonate from limestone deposits on its way by. When it reaches the surface springs, the water cools and the calcium carbonate particles are released. These microscopic particles settle to form porous calcite rims around the pools of water. These pools range in size from that of a bathtub to that of a fingernail. This process takes a great deal of time, and it is believed that the mounds themselves are around 10,000 years old, their creation beginning at the end of the last ice age.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{impressive}} sights along the Jurassic Coast are the sea stacks at Ladram Bay. The sandstones contain numerous vertical fractures and joints that were formed deep in the <b>Earths</b> <b>crust</b> during past mountain building periods. The sea picked out these planes of weakness to form caves and natural arches that have since collapsed to produce sea stacks. The “Otter Sandstone” that forms the cliffs and sea stacks were deposited in a hot dry climates in the Triassic Period about 220 Million years ago. The stacks are composed of the same rock, which is relatively soft, {{but they have a}} harder band of sandstone at their base which prevents their rapid erosion by the sea. The striking red colour of the rock is caused by iron oxide, which tells us that the layers were formed in a desert. The presence of ripple marks and channels in the sandstones, together with the remains of the long-extinct plants, insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles, show that the desert was crossed by fertile river valleys.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} longer term cycles, the mini ice-age {{that preceded the}} medieval warm period {{may have been a}} {{transition}} to an ice age, the last ice-age lasted from ~130,000 years ago until the onset of the Holocene. This ice-age may have been aborted by other factors including global warming. Such a stalling of long-term cycles is believed to be a factor in the Dryas period, a warming interrupted by surface impacts of extraterrestrial origin may have occurred over hundreds of years. But the anthropogenic greenhouse effects and changing insolation patterns may have unpredictable long-term effects. Reductions of glacial ice on land masses can cause isotatic rebounds, and may affect earthquakes and volcanism over a wide range. Rising sea levels can also affect patterns, and was seen in Indonesia, simply drilling a gas well in the wrong place may have touched off a mud volcano and there are some signs that this may precede a new caldera formation for a volcano. Over the very long term, the change in temperature of the <b>earths</b> <b>crust</b> on geothermal and volcanic processes is unknown.
