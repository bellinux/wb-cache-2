5000|$|DNA <b>De-Scrambler</b> (First used: [...] "The World is My Circus"): The DNA <b>De-Scrambler</b> {{counteracts}} {{the effect}} of Otto's DNA Scrambler, returning anything that was affected by the latter to regular form. Normally it would take {{at least two weeks}} before one could be made, but Tech said he could make one in five minutes with Rev's super-speed. Tech first used it on the transformed children, then himself and the other Loonatics, and finally Zadavia. In the battle with the Ringmaster Oddity, it was destroyed when one of its tentacles smashed it.|$|E
30|$|The fourth part {{includes}} the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation {{obtained by the}} JWLS estimator as mentioned in Section 2. This part is also responsible for the channel estimation and the demodulation and decoding of the received data. Taking advantage of the scattered pilots contained in preamble 3 of the neighborhood discovery packets, accurate channel state information (CSI) can be acquired using the shifted raised cosine interpolator [14]. The CSI is then {{used to calculate the}} receive beamforming vector by the maximum ratio combining method. Finally, {{with the help of the}} receive beamforming vector and the estimated CSI, the four spatial streams received by the four receive antennas are combined into one data stream, which then passes through the one-tap equalizer, de-mapper, de-interleaver, Viterbi decoder, and <b>de-scrambler</b> to recover the transmitted bits. The receiver also estimates the noise power from the CSI and the correctly received symbols, which are then used to calculate the equivalent SINR.|$|E
