However, the interactions with iron have to be constrained, because Fe is commonly thought to buffer oxygen fugacity into planetary mantles.

The U-Th-Pb systematics of Asuka- 31,combined with previous results, suggest a scenario for the early Pb isotope evolution of the Moon.

Study of these sulfide mineral systems is of interest for the mineralogy and petrology of planetary mantles.

We review observational constraints, and investigate stirring properties of numerical models of mantle convection. Conditions in the early Earth may have supported layered convection with rapid stirring in the upper layers. Material that has been altered near the surface is transported downwards by small-scale convection. Thereby a layer of homogeneous depleted material develops above pristine mantle. As the mantle cools over Earth history, the effects leading to layering become reduced and models show the large-scale convection favoured for the Earth today. Laterally averaged, the upper mantle below the lithosphere is least affected by material that has experienced near-surface differentiation. The geochemical signature obtained during the previous episode of small-scale convection may be preserved there for the longest time. Additionally, stirring is less effective in the high viscosity layer of the central lower mantle [1, 2], supporting the survival of medium-scale heterogeneities there. These models are the first, using 3 -d spherical geometry and mostly Earth-like parameters, to address the suggested change of convective style.

These models show a sharp bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track arising from the interplay of plume tilt and the lateral advection of plume sources. The different trajectories of the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspot tracks arise from asymmetric deformation of thermochemical structures under the Pacific between 100 million years ago and 50 million years ago.

Although the origin of such lavas remains enigmatic, geochemically they may originate from Earth 2 ̆ 7 s oldest and deepest mantle reservoir, transported by a mantle plume or by entrainment in passive upwelling beneath a fast spreading center.

Our new Sr-Nd-Pb isotope and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data show complex age relationships along these volcanic structures, and a Pb isotope anomaly that is found in a cluster of small and distinct volcanoes that are geographically grouped. The geographical distinction relates to the plate tectonic structure of the area, limited to the north and south by fracture zones that bounded a captured Pacific microplate. We argue here that very high mantle flow beneath the triple junctions during the highly active Cretaceous period may have sampled dense material {{from the top of the}} Pacific large low shear velocity province.

The timing of the dominant late accretionary period of the Earth and Moon is still poorly known. The abundances of HSE in the lunar mantle could provide important constraints on when the late veneer was added. The material that ultimately became the silicate portion of the Moon was likely stripped of most of its HSE prior to and during coalescence of the Moon. Consequently the initial lunar mantle likely had very low concentrations of the HSE. Unlike Earth, the generation of permanent lunar crust by ~ 4. 4 Ga prevented subsequent additions of HSE to the lunar mantle via continued accretion. Thus, if {{a substantial portion of the}} late veneer was added after 4. 4 Ga, the lunar mantle should have retained very low HSE concentrations.

We do not yet have siderophile element analyses of venusian or mercurian basalts, but we assume that Venus, too, as a terrestrial planet, has a metallic core. For the Earth, Moon, Mercury, and Mars, the moments-of-inertia of these bodies are consistent with metallic cores of various sizes. Because Venus rotates so slowly, {{it may be difficult to}} determine the moment-of-inertia of Venus in order to confirm this assumption. However, despite many possible complexities, it seems likely that most of the major and minor terrestrial planets have experienced some sort of metal/silicate equilibration, and we will use this as a boundary condition. One immediate contrast between the Earth and Moon is the difference in FeO content between lunar and terrestrial basalts. Both bodies presumably formed near 1 AU and formed from the same feeding zone of planetesimals, judging by their oxygen isotopes [13].

Alternatively, the bulk silicate Moon may be dominated by material from the impactor.

Several volatile siderophile elements are depleted in Earth <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> relative to the chondrites, something which continues to puzzle many scientists. This depletion is likely due to a combination of volatility and core formation. The Earth s core is composed of Fe and some lighter constituents, although the abundances of these lighter elements are unknown [4]. Si is one of these potential light elements [5] although few studies have analyzed the effect of Si on metal-silicate partitioning, in particular the volatile elements. As, In, Ge, and Sb are trace volatile siderophile elements which are depleted in the mantle but have yet to be extensively studied. The metal-silicate partition coefficients of these elements will be measured to determine the effect of Si. Partition coefficients depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and metal and silicate composition and can constrain the concentrations of volatile, siderophile elements found in the mantle. Reported here are the results from 13 experiments examining the partitioning of As, In, Ge, and Sb between metallic and silicate liquid. These experiments will examine the effect of temperature, and metal-composition (i. e., Si content) on these elements in or-der to gain a greater understanding of the core-mantle separation which occurred during the Earth s early stages.

To explore this further, we developed a model that evaluates the area of emerged continental crust as a function of mantle temperature, continental area and hypsometry. In this paper, we investigate the continental freeboard predicted using different models for the cooling of the Earth. We show that constancy of the continental freeboard (± 200 m) is possible throughout the history of the planet as long as the potential temperature of the upper mantle was never more than 110 - 210 °C hotter than present. Such numbers imply either a very limited cooling of the planet or, most likely, a change in continental freeboard since the Archaean.

40|$|To better {{understand}} high pressure behavior of solids, both silicates and oxides {{have been investigated}} to clarify the high pressure melting, phase transformations and thermal parameters {{as well as their}} size dependences, both theoretically and experimentally. ^ To judge the precision of data determined experimentally, the reliabilities of different high pressure techniques have been discussed. A thermodynamic model has been developed and demonstrated to be able to closely reproduce the melting of solids by comparison between results calculated and data obtained experimentally, including metals (Al, Ni and Pt), Silicates (Mg 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 and CaMgSi 2 O 6), Halides (NaCl, CsCl and LiF) and Oxides (MgO, FeO and Al 2 O 3). The melting data obtained have been discussed to address the dynamics of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s interior. ^ Results obtained with Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction show that solids including silicates (andradite and pyrope) and oxides (CeO 2 and TiO 2) undergo a series of pressure-induced phase transformations. The effects of particle size under high pressures have been investigated. The results obtained indicate that the reduction of particle size leads to the enhancement of the bulk modulus and a significant decrease of transition pressure in TiO 2 (rutile) and CeO 2. The pressure-induced amorphization in anatase also results from the size effects. ^ Combining the data obtained with global seismic tomography, the physics and chemistry of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> and the dynamics of the core-mantle interaction have been discussed. The high pressure phases of Al 3 +- and Fe 3 +-bearing minerals play important roles in the dynamics of the lower mantle. ...|$|R
