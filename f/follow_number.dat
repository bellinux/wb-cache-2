5000|$|Number Two and Number Fourteen <b>follow</b> <b>Number</b> Six {{to where}} he drops a {{document}} in the cabin of the stone boat. They retrieve it, but the pages are all blank. After having them tested, Two suspects the technician of working with Number Six. Number Six then goes to place an ad (a quotation from Don Quixote) in the next issue of the Tally Ho. He then calls the head of Psychiatrics, posing as a superior who wants a report on Number Two's mental state. Two monitors the call and starts to become more paranoid at the behavior of Number Six and those around him. Later, Six asks the town band to play the Farandole from the same Bizet piece. He leaves a fake message in a dead drop that is from a deceased person, wishing him a happy birthday.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} two nights, Number Six is sedated through his evening tea, brought to Number Fourteen's laboratory, {{injected}} with the drug, and connected to the machine. Numbers Two and Fourteen watch events unfold in Number Six's visions of the party, and then insert, separately, the dossiers for [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B", agents with known ties to Number Six. During the first night with [...] "A", a defector, Number Six refuses to sell his secrets to [...] "A", and then escapes from being kidnapped by [...] "A" [...] and his henchmen. During the second night with [...] "B", a female spy, Number Six avoids answering her questions regarding his departure. Number Fourteen uses the machine to speak directly to Number Six via [...] "B", but he becomes suspicious and when [...] "B" [...] is dragged off by hostile agents to be killed, he does not stop to save her. Number Two determines that neither [...] "A" [...] nor [...] "B" [...] is the person they seek, and Number Six is returned each night to his home. After the second night, dim memories of the experiment lead Number Six to <b>follow</b> <b>Number</b> Fourteen around the Village, eventually coming across her laboratory. He dilutes the final injection after verifying the dossier for [...] "C". That night Number Six fakes drinking the drugged tea, and instead acts drugged before he is taken back to the laboratory.|$|E

40|$|Com o objetivo de padronizar normas técnicas para obtenção de modelo animal com tumor de Walker 256 e de estabelecer o número de células tumorais necessárias para que esse tumor tenha grande porcentagem de pega e longevidade, possibilitando o desenvolvimento de pesquisas em várias áreas da saúde, foi realizado trabalho em duas etapas. Na primeira foram utilizados 120 ratos para treinamento e definição da técnica. Na segunda etapa foram utilizados 84 ratos, sendo estes separados em 7 grupos (G) de 12 animais cada. O tumor, na forma ascítica, foi inoculado no tecido celular subcutâneo do dorso dos ratos com os seguintes números de células: GI, 1 x 10 (7); GII, 5 x 10 (6); GIII, 2, 5 x 10 (6); GIV, 1 x 10 (6); GV, 5 x 10 (5); GVI, 3 x 10 (5) e GVII, 2 x 10 (5). Foram avaliadas a porcentagem de pega e a longevidade nos grupos. Os animais dos GI, GII, GIII e GIV obtiveram 100 % de desenvolvimento tumoral, porém baixa longevidade. Os dos GV e GVI obtiveram desenvolvimento tumoral em frequência maior que 90 % e longevidade satisfatória. Os do GVII não apresentaram desenvolvimento tumoral. Concluiu-se que todos os procedimentos devem ser exaustivamente treinados e que o número de células tumorais viáveis para inoculação, em tecido celular subcutâneo de ratos, deve estar na faixa entre 5 x 10 (5) e 3 x 10 (5). The aim of {{this work}} was {{standardize}} technical norms to obtain a model of Walker 256 tumor in animals and get the tumorous cells number needed to increase the tumorous join percentage and longevity, it makes possible the research development in several health areas. The work was realized in two stages. In first were used 120 rats to crew’s training and technicals definitions. In second stage were used 84 rats, these separated in 7 groups (G) with 12 animals each one. The tumor, in ascitic form was inoculated on subcutaneous cellular tissue on dorsal of rats with the <b>follow</b> <b>number</b> of cells : GI, 1 x 10 (7); GII, 5 x 10 (6); GIII, 2, 5 x 10 (6); GIV, 1 x 10 (6); GV, 5 x 10 (5); GVI, 3 x 10 (5) e GVII, 2 x 10 (5). Were evaluate the join percentage and longevity in groups. The animals of GI, GII, GIII e GIV obtained 100 % of tumorous development, however low longevity. The two GV and GVI had tumorous development often high that 90 % and satisfactory longevity. The GVII didn’t show tumorous development. The conclusion was made all procedures must be exhaustivelly trained {{and the number of}} tumorous cells passable to inoculation, in subcutaneous cellular tissue of rats, must be in the range of 5 x 10 (5) and 3 x 10 (5) ...|$|E
