5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days,</b> at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days.</b> On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers was {{distributed}} both {{on television and}} online. It ran for a single series of eleven episodes: the first ten episodes lasted for five minutes each, with the final compilation episode running {{for half an hour}} and gaining a viewership peak of half a million. Chartjackers premiered on BBC Two on 12 September 2009 at 12:50p.m., as part of the channel's two-hour-long BBC Switch segment – it was uploaded to the YouTube channel BBCSwitch the same day. This practice of broadcasting an episode on BBC Two and uploading it to the BBCSwitch channel the same day continued throughout the series. Episodes were also streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after their initial broadcast. The show was not broadcast outside of the UK and, , is not available on DVD.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began in}} spring 480 BC, when the Persian army crossed the Hellespont and marched through Thrace and Macedon to Thessaly. The Persian advance was blocked at the pass of Thermopylae {{by a small}} Allied force under King Leonidas I of Sparta; simultaneously, the Persian fleet was blocked by an Allied fleet at the straits of Artemisium. At the famous Battle of Thermopylae, the Allied army held back the Persian army <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days,</b> before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the Allied rearguard was trapped and annihilated. The Allied fleet had also withstood two days of Persian attacks at the Battle of Artemisium, but when news reached them of the disaster at Thermopylae, they withdrew to Salamis.|$|E

5|$|A Greek {{force of}} {{approximately}} 7,000 men marched north {{to block the}} pass {{in the middle of}} 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000), arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, fighting to the death.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers was devised in 2009 by Davenport and Andy Mettam of Hat Trick Productions, and was {{commissioned}} for development by Geoffrey Goodwin and Jo Twist of BBC Switch. Alongside the programmes Off the Hook and The Cut, it was featured {{as part of}} a season of multi-platform content designed to appeal to teenagers. The show was also directly linked to the 2009 annual appeal for the British charity Children in Need – profits from sales of the completed pop song were donated to the charity. Chartjackers aired weekly at approximately 1:10p.m. on Saturday afternoons on BBC Two, with the first episode premiering on 12 September 2009 during the channel's two-hour long BBC Switch segment. The series garnered a viewing figures peak of almost half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Each episode was streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after its initial airing. The series was not broadcast outside the UK and, , is not available to buy on DVD.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E

5|$|The current tag team champions are Negro Casas and Shocker, having {{defeated}} the team known as Los Ingobernables ("The Unruly"; La Máscara and Rush) on June 13, 2014. This is the sixth reign for Casas {{and the third}} for Shocker, they are the 37th overall champions and, the 28th championship team. Los Guerreros de la Atlantida (Dragón Rojo Jr. and Último Guerrero) hold the record for longest reign as a team, at 640 days. Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero hold {{the record for the}} longest combined reigns of any team: 1,185 days divided over three reigns. Individually, Último Guerrero has held the championship six times for a total of 1,923 days, the longest of any individual. The team of Último Guerrero and Dr. Wagner Jr. held the championship <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days,</b> the shortest reign of any championship team. Casas and Último Guerrero have the most title reigns with six each, while the combinations of Casas and El Hijo del Santo, Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero and Averno and Mephisto are the only teams to have won the championship three times.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued <b>for</b> <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|There were {{assertions that}} Odex had charged 10% {{interest}} for settlements paid through an instalment plan, but {{a press release}} by the company denied that it had required any such interest payments. By September 2007, 105 out of the 300 SingNet subscribers who had received letters had negotiated with and paid Odex, although, in a news conference, Odex said that it had neither forced payment from nor fined anyone. The company explained {{that it would not}} profit from the enforcement process and intended to donate to charity any excess amount received. It would also release a financial audit of all the money collected at the close of proceedings. On 31 August 2007, in an attempt to address criticisms of late releases, Odex began to offer video on demand (VOD) on its relaunched website.
