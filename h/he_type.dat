In his book Covering Islam Said stated that Miller's book God Has Ninety-Nine Names [...] "is like a {{textbook}} of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam." [...] He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that [...] "nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject." [...] He concludes, [...] "she fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn't bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world." [...] However, Miller asserted that {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks she argued that militant Islamism of <b>he</b> <b>type</b> represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance.|$|E

To increase understanding of the underlying causes of HE, the Naval Safety Center in Norfolk, VA, developed the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). The HFACS taxonomy consists of 17 <b>types</b> of basic <b>HE.</b> This HFACS taxonomy {{has been used as a}} data analysis tool to classify 141 Class A and B Naval Tacitcal Aircraft (TACAIR) flight mishaps (FM) from fiscal year (FY) 90 and FY 97.

40|$|Abstract: A {{petrographic}} {{study was}} conducted on a suite of bottom ash samples from 28 municipal solid waste incinerators in Switzerland. Chemical and mineralogical nalyses of bottom ash from waste combustors with comparable t chnology show similar major oxide composition. A significant decrease of SiO 2 was observed in comparison tothe chemi-cal composition ofbottom ash from 10 years ago. Incontrast to major oxide contents, heavy metal concentrations vary significantly in the bottom ash samples, but without any corre-lation {{to the type of}} input waste or plant operating conditions. Similar types and contents of crystalline phases were observed in all samples. The content of newly formed melilite increases with decreasing bulk Si/Ca ratio, indicating that <b>he</b> <b>type</b> of Ca-Mg-Al-silicates crystallizing during incineration and cooling follow petrogenetic rules. A considerable recy-cling potential for ferrous and non-ferrous metals was identified in the bottom ash. Opti-mized mechanical metal separation technologies could reduce the waste volume, heavy metal content, H 2 production, and exothermic reactions of the bottom ash in landfills and might be economically viable.

40|$|Type A {{behavior}} and hardiness were examined {{as predictors of}} cardiovascular responses to stress in 68 male undergraduates. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate were monitored while subjects performed a difficult mirror-tracing task. Type A assessments based on the Structured Interview, but not those based on the Jenkins Activity Survey, were associated with significantly enhanced SBP and DBP elevations. Hardiness was associated with significantly reduced DBP responsiveness. In addition, asignificant interaction i dicated that <b>he</b> <b>Type</b> B-high hardiness group showed the least DBP reactivity. A near-significant i eraction (p =. 06) suggested that Type B-high hardiness subjects also reported the least anger. Further exploration of the data indicated that the challenge component of hardiness accounted for its relationship toDBP reactivity. These results have implications both for the psychophysiologic study of Type A {{behavior and}} for under-standing the health-promoting effects of hardiness.

40|$|Sorption to 'hard carbon' (black carbon, coal, kerogen) in {{soils and}} sediments is of major {{importance}} for risk assessment of organic pollutants. We argue that activated carbon (AC) {{may be considered}} a model sorbent for hard carbon. Here, we evaluate six sorption models on a literature dataset for sorption of 12 compounds onto 12 ACs and one charcoal, at different temperatures (79 isotherms in total). A statistical analysis, accounting for differences {{in the number of}} fitting parameters, demonstrates that the dual Langmuir equation is in general superior and/or preferable to the single and triple Langmuir equation, the Freundlich equation, a Polanyi-Dubinin-Manes equation, and the Toth equation. Consequently, the analysis suggests the presence of two types of adsorption sites: a high-energy (<b>HE)</b> <b>type</b> of site and a low-energy (LE) type of site. Maximum adsorption capacities for the HE domain decreased with temperature while those for the LE domain increased.

40|$|Antigen priming of naive CD 4 T {{cells can}} {{generate}} effector CD 4 T cells that produce interleukin 4 (T helper [Th] 2 - 1 ike) or interferon-y (Thl-like). Using {{a system in}} which priming leads to responses dominated by {{one or the other of}} these cell types, we show that varying either the antigenic peptide or the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule can determine whether Thl-like or Th 2 - 1 ike responses are obtained. Our results show that peptide/major histocompatibility complex class II complexes that interact strongly with the T cell receptor favor generation of Thl-like cells, while those that bind weakly favor priming of Th 2 - 1 ike T cells. Thus, signals from the T cell receptor can influence the differentiation of CD 4 T cells into specific types of effector cells. T <b>he</b> <b>type</b> of effector CD 4 T lymphocyte activated during an adaptive immune response determines the efficacy of the response in protective immunity to pathogens.

40|$|Basic {{problems}} of a microscopic theory of many body quantum systems and different aspects of a new approach which can help in solving them are discussed in detail. To this effect we make a critical study of the wave mechanics of two hard core quantum particles and discover its several untouched aspects, viz. : (i) the useful details of ψ_k(r) (representing the relative motion of two particles), (ii) the expectation value of hard core (HC) repulsion (), (iii) the inconsistency of the statements, r π/d.
