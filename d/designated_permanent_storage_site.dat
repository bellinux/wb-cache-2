The DOE has recently withdrawn the licensing application for the Yucca Mountain Repository leaving the nuclear industry responsible for the safety of more than 800 waste-containing concrete casks currently on the open surface at 34 sites. It also has not undertaken measures to reduce the volume of additional waste produced by both existing and newly planned reactors. The DOE has instead opted to undertake research to develop new cycles that "burn" the radioactive waste. This policy appears subordinated to obvious political pressures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We review {{evidence}} from experiments conducted in our laboratory on retrograde amnesia in rats with {{damage to the}} hippocampal formation. In a new experiment reported here, we show that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -induced hippocampal damage produced retrograde amnesia for both hidden platform and two-choice visible platform discriminations in the Morris water task. For both problems {{there was a significant}} trend for longer training-surgery intervals to be associated with worse retention performance. Little support is offered by our work for the concept that there is a process involving hippocampal-dependent consolidation of memories in extrahippocampal <b>permanent</b> <b>storage</b> <b>sites.</b> Longterm memory consolidation may take place within the hippocampus. The hippocampus may be involved permanently in storage and/or retrieval of a variety of relational and nonrelational memories if it was intact at the time of learning, even involving information which is definitely not affected in anterograde amnesia after hippocampal damage.

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{inability}} to recall memories before onset of amnesia. One {{may be able}} to encode new memories after the incident. Retrograde is usually caused by head trauma or brain damage to parts of the brain besides the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for encoding new memory. Episodic memory {{is more likely to be}} affected than semantic memory. The damage is usually caused by head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism. [...] People suffering from retrograde amnesia are more likely to remember general knowledge rather than specifics. Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but older memories will be easier to recall due to strengthening over time. Retrograde amnesia is usually temporary and can be treated by exposing them to memories from the loss. Another type of consolidation (process by which memories become stable in the brain) occurs over much longer periods of time/days, weeks, months and years and likely involves transfer of information from the hippocampus to more <b>permanent</b> <b>storage</b> <b>site</b> in the cortex. The operation of this longer-term consolidation process is seen in the retrograde amnesia of patients with hippocampal damage who can recall memories from childhood relatively normally, but are impaired when recalling experiences that occurred just a few years prior to the time they became amnesic.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Past weapons {{production}} activities {{have resulted in}} mass quantities of trans-uranic waste being buried in drums at several sites in the United States. In an effort to relocate these waste drums to more <b>permanent</b> <b>storage</b> <b>sites,</b> Fluor Hanford has begun characterizing their contents to ensure compliance with various shipping and storage requirements. Non-destructive analysis techniques are regularly employed, among them passive radiation detection using a Canberra Gamma-Energy-Analyzer germanium detector vault. Necessary strict legal tolerances require strong quality assurance. The detectors are frequently calibrated in the traditional method with check sources, {{but it would be}} advantageous to have an estimate of system minimum detectable activity (MDA). However, any estimate is {{complicated by the fact that}} sources are distributed stochastically in the waste drums. In this study, a method was developed to predict system detector efficiency for a variety of detector configurations and drum fill materials and calculate MDA based on these efficiencies. The various system designs were modeled in Monte Carlo N-Particle Code, version 4 b, to determine photopeak detection efficiency. An external code written in C programming language was used to randomly assign between one and 20 sources to volumetric regions of the waste drum. Twenty simulations were performed for each design and drum fill material combination, each time redefining the stochastically distributed source. This provided a normally distributed spectrum of 20 efficiencies for each situation. From this, mean and lower 95...|$|R

GAO was asked to examine alternative uses for the Yucca Mountain site. This report examines: (1) the characteristics of the Yucca Mountain site; (2) stakeholders' proposed alternative uses, and experts' evaluations of them; and (3) challenges, if any, in pursuing alternative uses. We selected a nonprobability sample of experts that included experts affiliated with nationally recognized research organizations, universities, and national laboratories, and that did not represent or benefit from any of the stakeholders' proposed alternative uses of the site. Using a data collection instrument, we elicited comments from these experts on stakeholders' proposed uses. The alternative uses discussed in this report reflect the alternative uses these stakeholders proposed; they may not reflect all potential uses of the site. This report contains no recommendations.

The origin of mercury in foliage {{has been found}} to be mostly atmospheric. In this study, we developed and tested an extraction technique to study mercury distribution within leaves of various temperate deciduous tree species. Knowing the exact location of mercury within the leaf structure will allow us to evaluate its potential to leach, to volatilize, or to accumulate. Additionally, we monitored mercury concentration in foliage during the entire foliage growing season to understand the intra-season variations and to compare the accumulation rates of different species. We also studied the inter-annual accumulation of Hg in foliage by comparing end of season foliage Hg concentrations of two different seasons. Mercury levels in foliage were reported in leaf area- and mass- normalized concentrations/ uptake rates. Additionally, mercury levels on the surface, in the cuticle and in the inner tissues of tamarack (Larix laricina L.) needles were monitored during an entire growing season to understand the dynamics of mercury in these three compartments. The results of this study showed that the extraction technique developed and used for separating Hg associated with the three compartments of the leaf is reliable and that leaf mercury can be separated into three fractions each associated with the surface (2 %- 4 %), the cuticle (2 %- 6 %), and the inner tissue of the leaf (90 %- 96 %). While the surface and the cuticle seemed to act as transitory compartments, leaf inner tissue behaved as a <b>permanent</b> <b>storage</b> <b>site,</b> and Hg concentration increased steadily in this compartment. The results of the season long leaf mercury monitoring confirmed a strong and positive correlation between leaf mercury levels and the age of leaves (r 2 > 0. 81). Tamarack (43. 13 ± 1. 7 ng g- 1 – 2981. 12 ± 116. 3 ng m- 2) and elm (41. 01 ± 6. 8 ng g- 1 – 1519. 44 ± 175. 4 ng m- 2) showed the highest end of season foliage mercury concentrations, while gingko (19. 03 ± 2. 8 ng g- 1 – 1421 ± 180. 5 ng m- 2) and oak (25. 17 ± 5. 5 ng g- 1 – 1144 ± 250. 1 ng m- 2) showed the lowest. The difference between the coniferous species and the broadleaf species was more pronounced when surface normalized concentrations were used for the comparison. Lastly, foliage accumulation rate of mercury was found to be the highest in mid-growing season (15. 76 ng m- 2 day- 1) when photosynthesis is known to be at its peak...|$|R
