Less clear is what leads firms to invest in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> in the first place. The latter is particularly important since, {{at least for the}} Italian manufacturing sector, firms exhibit a very strong heterogeneity in their level of <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> investments. In line with the capability-based theory of the firm we argue that the firmâ€™s propensity to invest in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> can be explained by factors that are internal and specific to the firm. Making use of a rich dataset we test and provide support for our hypotheses. In particular we find that the propensity to invest in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> increases with the firmâ€™s size, human capital and organizational complexity and with the past level of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> This points toward the existence of a cumulative dynamics in the process of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> accumulation that may account for most of the heterogeneity observed in the data.

40|$|Background and Problem Discussion: <b>Intangible</b> <b>assets</b> {{are getting}} more and more {{important}} to companies and their owners. The {{reason for this is that}} the economy has changed from being industrial to knowledge-based. It is no longer the industrial value chain that creates value, it is innovation and constantly seeking new ways of meeting market demands. Companies can no longer differentiate themselves or create competitive advantages without <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> With increased importance of values in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> the need for financial information about companies has changed. However, current accounting systems have not been able to keep up with this development. Because of the uncertainty connected with <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> accounting cannot capture their increasingly important value. Consequently, investors and other users of financial information are not provided with sufficient information to make good decisions. This poses the question whether relevance has been lost in accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets?</b> Further, because of this possible lost of relevance, perhaps alternative approaches on reporting of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> are needed? Purpose: The main purpose of this essay is to discuss whether relevance in accounting for increasingly important <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> has been lost. Method: To be able to discuss whether relevance in accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> has been lost, we have laid a foundation consisting of existing regulations of accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> as well as literature and articles on the subject. Further, we have examined the accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> in two Swedish groups, AstraZeneca and the Volvo Group, in order to get a more practical view on the subject. The investigation of the two groups has been made by contducting interviews and studying their financial reports. Delimitations: The discussion of this essay will be delimited to the accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> in big Swedish groups listed on the stock market. Consistently, the discussion will be based on the accounting regulations for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> applied in these groups, namely IAS 38 â€“ <b>Intangible</b> <b>assets</b> and IFRS 3 â€“ Business Combinations. Results and Conclusions: The lack in current accounting systems lies in the fact that it cannot capture all important intangible values. This results in traditional incomes statements and balance sheets being misleading to investors and other users of financial information. Further, because great values in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> are kept hidden in todayâ€™s accounting, investors are compelled to make difficult assessments about these values in order to make their decisions. However, we do not find the solution in taking all <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> into the balance sheet at any cost. The important qualities of todayâ€™s accounting, such as reliability, cannot be jeopardized. Information about hidden <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> would therefore be better provided through some kind of alternative reporting. However, this kind of reporting has its errors in possibly being too subjective...|$|R

The first three concern LIS directors seeking to understand the value of the distinct type of <b>intangibles</b> (<b>i.</b> e. human capital â€“ structural capital â€“ relational capital) in academic libraries. The fourth suggestion regards the interrelation of library investments to both specific <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> and certain quality / efficiency indicators. The last suggestion calls MOPAB for the augmentation of the groups of indicators with new performance indicators based on intangibles and the new economy...|$|R
