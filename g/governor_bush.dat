25|$|In 1994, Bush {{made his}} first run for office, losing the {{election}} for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent, Lawton Chiles. Bush ran again in 1998 and defeated Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the vote. He ran for reelection in 2002, defeating Bill McBride and winning with 56 percent, to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as <b>governor,</b> <b>Bush</b> pushed an ambitious Everglades conservation plan, supported caps for medical malpractice litigation, launched a Medicaid privatization pilot program, and instituted reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice.|$|E
25|$|The Texas Renewable Portfolio Standard was {{originally}} created by Senate Bill 7 {{and signed by}} <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> in 1999, which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S. The RPS was part of new laws that restructured the electricity industry. The Texas RPS mandated that utility companies jointly create 2000 new MWs of renewable energy by 2009 based on their market share. In 2005, Senate Bill 20, increased the state’s RPS requirement to 5,880 MW by 2015, of which, 500 MW must come from non-wind resources. The bill {{set a goal of}} 10,000 MW of renewable energy capacity for 2025, which was achieved 15 years early, in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Gonzales was an {{attorney}} in private practice from 1982 until 1994 with the Houston law firm Vinson and Elkins, where he became a partner – {{one of the first}} Hispanic partners in its history – and where he worked primarily with corporate clients. In 1994, he was named general counsel to then-Texas Governor George W. Bush, rising to become Secretary of State of Texas in 1997 and subsequently named to the Texas Supreme Court in 1999, both appointments made by <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush.</b> Gonzales won his election bid to remain on the court in the Republican Primary in 2000, and was subsequently elected to a full six-year term on the State Supreme Court in the November 2000 general election.|$|E

5000|$|State Representative Byron Cook of Corsicana, {{the seat}} of Navarro County located within Senate District 22, {{endorsed}} Sibley's unsuccessful effort {{to return to the}} Senate in 2010.

25|$|As Governor Bush's {{counsel in}} Texas, Gonzales also {{reviewed}} all clemency requests. A 2003 article in The Atlantic Monthly asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, {{and failed to}} second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales' deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush. Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency {{even if he had}} wanted to do so in a case. The fact remains that only one death sentence was overturned by <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush,</b> and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.|$|E
25|$|While <b>governor,</b> <b>Bush</b> {{presided over}} a state {{government}} that reduced taxes by 19 billion and he vetoed 2 billion in new spending, according to The Wall Street Journal. An analysis conducted by economist Martin Sullivan, which eliminated {{the effects of the}} federal estate tax repeal (which did not require legislative action to go into effect) and inflation, estimated the cumulative reduction in taxes by the state at closer to 13 billion during Bush's tenure, resulting in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. A substantial amount of the tax savings in the higher estimate came from the phasing out of the federal estate tax law implemented in 2001 under President George W. Bush, for a total tax savings of 848 million per year; Jeb Bush did not push for a replacement with a state tax. The biggest reduction in taxes was due to the elimination of the state's Intangible Personal Property Tax, which applied to holdings of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds.|$|E
500|$|On October 15, 2003, Schiavo's {{feeding tube}} was removed. Within a week, when the Schindlers' final appeal was exhausted, State Rep. Frank Attkisson and the Florida Legislature hastily passed [...] "Terri's Law," [...] giving Governor Jeb Bush the {{authority}} {{to intervene in the}} case. <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> immediately ordered the feeding tube reinserted. <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> sent the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to remove Schiavo from the hospice. She was taken to Morton Plant Rehabilitation Hospital in Clearwater, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted. She was then returned to the hospice. Part of the legislation required the appointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL), Dr. Jay Wolfson, to [...] "deduce and represent the best wishes and best interests" [...] of Schiavo, and report them to <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush.</b> Wolfson's report did not change Michael's role as her legal guardian and did not otherwise obstruct him legally.|$|E

500|$|In early 2005, Keyes {{sought to}} {{intervene}} in the Terri Schiavo case, arguing that Schiavo's life was protected by the Florida constitution, and that Governor Jeb Bush had final authority to determine the outcome of the case under state provisions. He attempted to meet with Bush to discuss the provisions of Florida law that authorized the governor to order Schiavo's feeding tubes reinserted—something Bush claimed he wished to do, but for which he said he lacked authority—but the governor declined to meet with Keyes. Keyes subsequently wrote an essay directed openly at <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> titled [...] "Judicial review and executive responsibility", days after Schiavo's feeding tube had been removed.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 2005, Judge Greer {{denied a}} {{petition}} for intervention by the Department of Children & Families (DCF) and signed an order forbidding the department from [...] "taking possession of Theresa Marie Schiavo or removing her" [...] from the hospice and directed [...] "each and every and singular sheriff {{of the state}} of Florida" [...] to enforce his order. The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. If Bush (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer's order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued. In jest, one official said local police discussed [...] "...whether we had enough officers to hold off the National Guard." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{counsel to}} <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush,</b> Gonzales helped advise Bush in {{connection}} with jury duty when he was called in a 1996 Travis County drunk driving case. The case led to controversy during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign because Bush's answers to the potential juror questionnaire did not disclose Bush's own 1976 misdemeanor drunk driving conviction. Gonzales made no formal request for Bush to be excused from jury duty but raised a possible conflict of interest because as the <b>Governor,</b> <b>Bush</b> might {{be called upon to}} pardon the accused party. Gonzales' work in this case has been described as [...] "canny lawyering".|$|E

2500|$|As <b>governor,</b> <b>Bush</b> {{proposed}} and passed into law major reform {{to the medical}} liability system. The Florida Senate, a majority of which were Republican, opposed Bush's proposed caps on non-economic damages for injury and wrongful death. Bush insisted, and called the legislature into five special sessions. The contentious debate even included a senior Bush staffer calling for primary opposition to Republicans who disagreed with the Governor on the reforms. Eventually, the legislature agreed to the caps and Bush's reforms passed. In 2014, after Bush left office, the Florida Supreme Court ruled the damage cap - the [...] "centerpiece" [...] of the 2003 legislation that Bush had pushed for - to {{be a violation of}} the state Constitution's equal protection clause, discriminating against [...] "those who are most grievously injured, those who sustain the greatest damage and loss, and multiple claimants." ...|$|E
