25|$|With {{significant}} sprawl {{occurring in}} the following decades, public transport {{became more and more}} influenced by the decentralised, relatively low-density urban area, where private motor vehicle transport outpaced public transport. However, the growth of the city and of car use have led to serious traffic problems, which, together with the lack of good public transport, have been cited by many Aucklanders as one of the strongest negative factors in living there. Since car usage costs fall slightly with decreasing urban density while public transport costs rise sharply (even for less capital-intensive services like buses), Auckland's public transport will for the foreseeable future <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with a handicap compared to cities of similar population but higher density.|$|E
25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on {{as a means to}} transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E

2500|$|The Hoverbarge {{technology}} is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft, which {{has traditionally been}} constructed using aircraft technology. The initial concept of the air cushion barge {{has always been to}} provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area, such as diesel engines, ventilating fans, winches and marine equipment. The load to move a 200ton payload ACV barge at [...] would only be 5tons. The skirt and air distribution design on high-speed craft again is more complex, as they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact. The slow speed and large mono chamber of the hover barge actually helps reduce the effect of wave action, giving a very smooth ride.|$|E
2500|$|Alternative {{certificate}} {{programs were}} introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states {{in response to the}} dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education. This program has been very controversial. It is, [...] "booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success. there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since {{they are more likely to}} end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations." [...] Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation.

60|$|Among the watchers of {{the course}} of the world of thought, some view with delight and some with horror, the {{recrudescence}} of Supernaturalism which manifests itself among us, in shapes ranged along the whole flight of steps, which, in this case, separates the sublime from the ridiculous--from Neo-Catholicism and Inner-light mysticism, at the top, to unclean things, not worthy of mention in the same breath, at the bottom. In my poor opinion, the importance of these manifestations is often greatly over-estimated. The extant forms of Supernaturalism have deep roots in human nature, and will undoubtedly die hard; but, in these latter days, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with an enemy whose full strength is only just beginning to be put out, and whose forces, gathering strength year by year, are hemming them round on every side. This enemy is Science, in the acceptation of systematised natural knowledge, which, during the last two centuries, has extended those methods of investigation, the worth of which is confirmed by daily appeal to Nature, to every region in which the Supernatural has hitherto been recognised.|$|E
