The operative criterion {{is the notion of}} juvenile pre-delinquency (pre-deviance or potential deviance), because it refers to all the acts violating the norm of moral behaviour, which in certain circumstances may lead a teenager to appear before the court, and in other circumstances not. The <b>deviant</b> <b>conducts</b> of minors do not necessarily have a criminal nature and not under all circumstances. If these different acts of them do not violate the criminal norms, representing only deviations from ethical rules of behaviour, they are not legally sanctioned, but only in moral forms. Thus, this approach is meant to be a criminological transition from the criminological plan to the criminal illegality...|$|R

40|$|The Jacobs' {{syndrome}} {{consists in}} the presence of a Y chromosome in excess. The prevalence of XYY sex chromosome abnormalities in newborns is as high as 1 : 1000, but they are often unidentified because they are not necessarily associated with gross physical or cognitive impairments, and so they may never come to medical attention. The only common and obvious features are high stature and a strong build. During the 1960 s and the 1970 s, some studies postulated that the Jacobs' syndrome could lead to aggressive behavior, but the statistical certainty was questioned. More recent developments in genetics and neuroimaging have led to new publications on the relationship between the presence of an extra Y chromosome and social function, trying to explain the possible increasing tendency to commit a crime and to search for a biological nature of human behavior and <b>deviant</b> <b>conducts.</b> The authors conduct a review of the literature of the last 50. years concerning this chromosome trisomy, focusing on a possible connection between 47,XYY and deviance.

40|$|Several {{scholars}} have highlighted {{the importance of}} examining moral disengagement (MD) in understanding aggression and <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> across different contexts. The present study investigates the role of MD as a specific social-cognitive construct that, in the organizational context, may intervene in the process leading from stressors to counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Assuming the theoretical framework of the stressor-emotion model of CWB, we hypothesized that MD mediates, at least partially, the relation between negative emotions in reaction to perceived stressors and CWB by promoting or justifying aggressive responses to frustrating situations or events. In a sample of 1, 147 Italian workers, we tested a structural equations model. The results support our hypothesis: the more workers experienced negative emotions in response to stressors, the more they morally disengaged and, in turn, enacted CW...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Oppositional de®ant disorder, {{one of the}} {{disruptive}} behavior disorders, has far-reaching consequences for the individual, family, school, community, and society. Early recog-nition allows interventions geared toward promotion of prosocial behaviors, possibly halting pro-gression to the more <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> disorder. Awareness of this disorder and associated comor-bidities is the ®rst step that enables the school nurse to use assessment techniques and to assist in planning of interventions for the child. Children at risk often show tendencies toward oppo-sitional de®ant disorder as early as preschool. Interventions should be {{in place by the}} elementary school years to interrupt the pathways that may be dif®cult or impossible to change once ado-lescence begins. The school nurse can be instrumental in educating staff about risk factors, early associated behaviors, and referrals. Implementation of an individualized healthcare plan targets speci®c behaviors and provides a means of observing and documenting a child's improvements.

40|$|Undeniably, {{crime is}} a {{pervasive}} phenomenon in contemporary society. Many times, we wondered why people commit crimes. Surely, the answer depends on diverse academic backgrounds. What {{we see is}} the effect of crime and the ways of committing it, but what is really important is its causality, the reasons that determine individuals to have a <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct.</b> Regarding criminal causality, different theories have emerged along time, grouped into three categories: biological, psychological and sociological. No theory {{is more important than the}} other, because they complement each other, trying to unravel the mystery of crime causality. Sociological theories question, among other causes, migration and unemployment. Their role in the dynamics of crime is overwhelming. Studies have confirmed that the two criminological factors have a major input into the quantitative and qualitative analysis of crime. Unemployment is closely linked to migration, and this, in turn, is inextricably linked to living standards. Unemployment, as an exogenous crime factor, is related to the individuals’ poverty and free time. When they decline, crime will also decrease...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the results of research investigating the relation between inter-personal factors and personality disorders and intra-familial versus extra-familial child molesters. The sample contained 41 intra-familial and 43 extra-familial child molesters as well as a matched comparison group of 80 subjects. The analysis of the research results show that interpersonal factors, such as parental sensitivity, trust, and adult romantic attachment, discriminate between intra-familial and extra-familial child molesters. These findings struc-ture the heterogeneous field of child molesters, as intra-familial child molesting seems to be related to relational attitude as well as personality disorders, whereas extra-familial child molesting is mainly related to personality disorders without showing significant deficits in the interpersonal factors that were measured. These results contribute to the explanation of this <b>deviant</b> sexual <b>conduct</b> and to the development and differentiation of the treatment of child molesters...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} said that {{international}} humanitarian law (IHL) “accounts for” military necessity, but its meaning and normative consequences have remained obscure. This thesis develops a theory that offers a coherent explanation of the process through which IHL generates its rules. 					 					To planners, commanders and historians concerned with the effectiveness of fighting, military necessity embodies a truism {{that it is in}} each belligerent’s self-interest to maximise successes and minimise failures. To those concerned with articulating IHL standards of behaviour, military necessity offers weighty reasons for which the belligerent should be left at liberty to pursue necessities and avoid non-necessities – or to forgo opportunities and commit blunders at its own peril. To judges, observers and others concerned with IHL compliance, military necessity functions as a ground on which <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> may sometimes be exempt from the main rule. 					 					In none of these contexts does military necessity obligate necessary acts or prohibit unnecessary ones. Rather, it permits any belligerent action. Military necessity’s normative indifference means that it never affirmatively conflicts with humanitarian considerations, despite suggestions to the contrary. It also invalidates the popular idea that conduct in conformity with positive IHL rules becomes unlawful if it lacks military necessity. ...|$|E

They include behavior which may reflect illness and which requires medical and therapeutic attention (such as drunkenness), as well as behavior condemned as varying from moral or social standards and leading to harmful behavior (such as vagrancy and curfew violations).

The emphases of this study rest on the dual intentions of social control [...] to control both human behavior and the mind [...] in China through officially planned political, social and legal measures and the convergence between the Chinese legal tradition and the Maoist revolutionary agenda of social conformity. To explore the historical depth, discussions of the early Legalist introduction of law, the Confucianization process of Chinese imperial law, and the penetration of familism, collectivism, and the patriarchally arranged hierarchal system into the administration of law outline the major characteristics of the Chinese legal tradition. The dual intentions of social control are vigorously substantiated in Mao Zedong 2 ̆ 7 s concept of revolutionary justice and in particular legal issues such as judicial independence and the Party 2 ̆ 7 s role, class division and differential status before law, thought control and counterrevolutionary crime in Chinese law, and thought reform and voluntariness in the Chinese judicial process. ^ In conclusion, although China has been a Marxist state for the past four decades, Chinese traditional attitudes toward the role of law, the state authority, and social conformity have provided enormous moral and psychological preparation to help the Communist state leaders mobilize their social and economic resources in shaping the consequences of justice administration and social control. ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{control theory}} focuses on {{why some people}} do not commit deviant behaviours, such as illicit drug use. It proposes that bonding to {{conventional}} society constrains <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct.</b> In the book Causes of Delinquency, Hirschi distinguished four elements of social bonds: attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief.

This study also uses the element of attachment to interpret gender and rural/non-rural area differences in cannabis use. Two hypotheses are offered: (1) females are less likely to use cannabis than males because females have greater attachment to others; (2) rural residents are less likely to use cannabis than non-rural residents because rural residents have greater attachment to others. The research methods in the study are cross-tabulation analysis and binary logistic regression. The statistical analysis results support both hypotheses: females have a significantly lower rate of cannabis use than males and rural residents have a significantly lower rate of cannabis use than non-rural residents. Having greater attachment to others may be associated with a decreased rate of cannabis use. Policy and further research recommendations are made...|$|E

As {{long as there are}} taxes, there will also be policy-makers all over the world eager to tackle <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> in the most efficient and efficacious way.

Today, however, we look at a body of literature which has opened up to new and interdisciplinary findings, also thanks to the inclusion of behavioral aspects that do not necessarily follow the paradigms of the homo oeconomicus. To this end, the discipline of Experimental Economics has developed numerous ways to overcome the distance between economic theory and human behavior. The aim of this survey is to take the reader on a tour through some of these methodologies applied to the analysis of tax evasion, arguing that further research should focus on integrating multi-agent simulation models with outcomes from human subject experiments in order to create useful and necessary tools to administer, consolidate and represent the complex theoretical, empirical and experimental panorama of tax evasion research...|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{stressed}} the importance of assessing individual differences in personality as an approach to understanding aggressive and <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> across different contexts. This study investigated the moderation role of irritability, a specific aggression-related disposition, in the process of work stressors that are conducive to counterproductive work behaviour (CWB) within the stressor-emotion model. From a total sample of 1147 Italian workers (53. 5 % women), high- and low-irritability groups were identified. Then, using a multigroup structural equations model, we simultaneously examined all the relations in both high- and low-irritability groups, and investigated whether these relations were different between them. Results showed that job stressors elicited negative emotions that, in turn, lead to CWB. Moreover, some job stressors influenced CWB directly only in the high-irritability group. Overall, irritability moderated the relation among job stressors and CWB but not the relation among job stressors and negative emotions, with the sole exception of role conflict. As well, irritability did not moderate the relation between emotion and CWB. Thus, high-irritability employees may be more prone to react aggressively to job stressors via multiple functioning paths. The principal differences between low- and high-irritability individuals could be how they manage the impact of perceived stressors on emotions and behaviour...|$|E

Assim, é nos colégios, em interação com processos especificamente escolares, que se desenvolvem condutas desviantes em alguns deles. Este texto evoca, primeiramente e de maneira geral, como os jovens percebem as interpelações e diferenças entre o colégio e o bairro, para em seguida voltar a atenção para três dimensões da sociabilidade adolescente que expressam as tensões entre a rua e a escola: as amizades juvenis, a sociabilidade em sala de aula e as relações interétnicas.

With the emergence of the mediaeval Serbian state {{and the development of a}} bureaucratic apparatus, accompanied by specialization in the spheres of judicial practice and finance, a new type of people appeared - judges and other persons dealing with justice, officials of the feudal lords… The more developed and ramified the bureaucratic apparatus (consisting of individuals), the more <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> of people. They did not shrink from different forms of abuse (embezzlement, defamation, excessive charges, and various scams related to the ruler's finances). The growing stratification in terms of social classes led to differentiation between those who were wealthy and the ones who were not. The former were increasingly recruited from the ranks of merchants and craftsmen, equally accustomed to deviant behaviour. What contributed to this was the fact that despite the principal allegiance to the Byzantine civilization, the Serbian state was not immune to western influences, coming mostly via coastal cities, but also from Hungary and other European states. The behaviour of mediaeval people was also influenced by the church, which in the territory of the mediaeval Serbia was a prominent economic, ideological and political force...|$|E
40|$|Positive law is two-{{dimension}}al: it has {{a justice}} (or ideal) dimension (and requisite) and a factual (or real) dimension (and requisite). Both are essential. Hence positive law lapses when {{either of the two}} is absent. In terms of the factual requisite, law remains in place as actual norms of law (unlike mere norm-formulations), provided that a minimum degree of effectiveness is maintained; that is to say, only as long as the subjects of the law consistently and voluntarily act in accordance with such norm/s, and provided further that <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> is remedied by effective coercive measures. "Norm/s" that lose the factual dimension lapse into mere norm-formulations and no longer qualify as positive law. Thus viewed, a realistic grasp of the content of law is co-dependent on actual conduct, regardless of what the norm-formulations purport positive law to entail, because the norm-formulations may have lost track of the actual state of the law. Grasping the actual content of law, including constitutional law, therefore requires not only analysing the norm-formulations of the formally recognised sources of the law, but more specifically social and political observation which may reveal the following: (1) 	actual behaviour that closely corresponds with a legal norm-formulation, in which case the formulations reliably happen to reflect (and by implication to describe) the actual state of law; or (2) 	conduct that regularly deviates from the norm-formulations (usus) by the deviators who deem themselves legally bound to act as they are acting (opinio iuris), in which case new (substituting) law has in fact come into being, without such substituting law being reflected in a new (amended) norm-formulation; or (3) 	large-scale but inconsistent and irregular <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct</b> where the deviators do not consider themselves legally bound to act in the various deviant ways, combined with haphazard enforcement, thus allowing deviators to get away with their transgressions. Unlike the first scenario, the purported norm (law) as reflected in the norm-formulations is in part unsettled but unlike as in the second scenario, no new norm (law) has come into being. A legal lacuna opens up - that is, an area not regulated by existing legal norms. Viewed {{from the perspective of the}} factual dimension, law, including constitutional law, is much more susceptible to the volatility of unpredictable changes and instability than what the doctrine of the rule of law and constitutional supremacy purport it to be. The doctrine holds law (and the constitution) to be formulation driven, and therefore formal-static in nature, in that the law remains essentially static until the norm-formulations (the text) are amended in terms of the prescribed amendment procedures prescribed by the constitution. Consequently, the prevalent doctrine of the rule of law and constitutional supremacy fail to account for the factual dimension which causes it (the doctrine) to obscure the inner workings of the factual dimension of law, and therefore acts as a hindrance to understanding the nature and content of (positive) law, including the constitution. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. The current {{paper is}} based on two {{different}} approaches. One is the relational model of authority (Tyler & Lind, 1992), which addresses the effects of justice perceptions on the legitimacy of authorities and behavioural compliance. The other is Emler and Reicher’s theory (1995, 2005), which explains the involvement of adolescents in delinquency through {{their relationship with the}} institutional authorities of society. Aims. To provide empirical evidence for the linkage of these perspectives, analysing the relationship between justice perceptions about teachers and the involvement of adolescents in deviant behaviour. Our hypotheses are that teachers’ justice is negatively related with deviant behaviour and that this relationship is mediated through the evaluation of institutional authorities, after controlling for school failure. Sample. Three hundred and ninety adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years. Methods. Participants completed the following scales: perceptions of justice about teachers, evaluation of institutional authorities, and deviant behaviour. Data were examined through correlation and bootstrap analyses. Results. Justice judgments about teachers were negatively related with deviant behaviour, and this relationship was partially mediated by the evaluation of institutional authorities, even after controlling for school failure. However, procedural justice revealed a much stronger relationship with deviance, compared to distributive justice. Conclusions. As predicted, these results suggest that when adolescents perceive school authorities as fair, other institutional authorities are likely to be perceived in a similar way and the more those authorities are positively evaluated, the less often adolescents engage in <b>deviant</b> <b>conduct.</b> Results are discussed according to the theories underlying our hypothesis.

40|$|On-line social {{networks}} are complex ensembles of inter-linked communities that interact on different topics. Some communities {{are characterized by}} what are usually referred to as <b>deviant</b> behaviors, <b>conducts</b> that are commonly considered inappropriate {{with respect to the}} society's norms or moral standards. Eating disorders, drug use, and adult content consumption are just a few examples. We refer to such communities as deviant networks.

According to this assumption, research studies have mostly considered them in isolation. In this work we focused on adult content consumption networks, which are present in many on-line social media and in the Web in general. We found that few small and densely connected communities are responsible for most of the content production. Differently from previous work, we studied how such communities interact with the whole social network. We found that the produced content flows {{to the rest of the}} network mostly directly or through bridge-communities, reaching at least 450 times more users. We also show that a large fraction of the users can be inadvertently exposed to such content through indirect content resharing. We also discuss a demographic analysis of the producers and consumers networks. Finally, we show that it is easily possible to identify a few core users to radically uproot the diffusion process. We aim at setting the basis to study deviant communities in context. Comment: ICWSM 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{pilot study}} tested the short- and {{long-term}} efficacy (9 weeks follow-up) of an executive functioning (EF) remediation training with game elements {{for children with}} ADHD in an outpatient clinical setting, using a randomized controlled wait-list design. Furthermore, in a subsample, that is, those treated with methylphenidate, additive effects of the EF training were assessed. Method: A total of 40 children (aged 8 - 12 years) were randomized to the EF training or wait-list. The training consisted of a 25 -session training of inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Treatment outcome was assessed by parent- and teacher-rated EF, ADHD, oppositional <b>deviant</b> disorder, and <b>conduct</b> disorder symptoms. Results: Children in the EF training showed significantly more improvement {{than those in the}} wait-list condition on parent-rated EF and ADHD behavior in the total sample and in the subsample treated with methylphenidate. Effects were maintained at follow-up. Conclusion: This pilot study shows promising evidence for the efficacy of an EF training with game elements...|$|R
40|$|Users {{in online}} social {{networks}} naturally organize themselves into overlapping and interlinked {{communities that are}} formed around common identity or shared topical interests. Some communities gather people around specific <b>deviant</b> behaviors, <b>conducts</b> that are commonly considered inappropriate {{with respect to the}} societyâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s norms or moral standards such as drug use, eating disorders, and pornographic content consumption. From a network analysis perspective, the set of interactions between members of these communities form deviant networks that map how the deviant content is shared and consumed. It is commonly believed that deviant networks are small and isolated from the mainstream social media life; accordingly, most research studies have considered them in isolation. We focus on adult content consumption networks, which is one deviant network with a significant presence in online social media and in the Web in general. We investigate two large online social networks and discuss the following insights. Deviant networks are limited in size, tightly connected and structured in subgroups. Nevertheless, content originated in deviant networks spreads widely across the whole social graph possibly touching a large number of unintentionally exposed users, such that the average local perception is that neighboring users share more deviant content. Finally, we investigate how content production and consumption vary with age and show that the consumption rate is very similar between male and female users up to the age of 25. We conclude that deviant communities are deeply rooted into the relational fabric of a social network, and that a deeper understanding of how their activity impacts on every other user is required...|$|R
