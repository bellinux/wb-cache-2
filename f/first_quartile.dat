Once the threshold is calculated, the algorithm acts similarly to the static threshold algorithm by comparing the current CPU utilization with the calculated threshold. Interquartile Range follows the same principle of MAD but the distance is calculated by computing {{the difference between the}} third and <b>first</b> <b>quartiles</b> in descriptive statistics [130].|$|R

The study population was constructed by pooling the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys between 2010 and 2014. The study population was divided into quartiles based on the sodium to potassium ratio, and the effect was inferred by the difference in hypertension prevalence across quartiles by six pairwise comparisons using a propensity score matching technique. The quartiles with the higher sodium to potassium ratio had higher hypertension prevalence rates based on the following pairwise comparisons: the <b>first</b> vs. third <b>quartile,</b> the <b>first</b> vs. fourth <b>quartile,</b> the second vs. third quartile, and the second vs. fourth quartile. The prevalence differences were 2. 74 % point (p < 0. 05), 3. 44 % point (p < 0. 01), 2. 47 % point (p < 0. 05), and 2. 95 % point (p < 0. 01), respectively. In addition, statistically significant higher systolic (p < 0. 05) and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0. 01) was observed in the second quartiles compared to the <b>first</b> <b>quartiles.</b> Because a strong association was also detected between the sodium to potassium ratio and blood pressure even at a low level of sodium to potassium ratio, a lower sodium to potassium ratio diet than a usual diet is recommended to control high blood pressure in Korea...|$|R

Recently, a large prospective study reported an association with IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 concentration for breast cancer diagnosed after, but not before, the age of 50 years; and in a large cohort of primarily premenopausal women, IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were not associated with breast cancer risk. We did a case-cohort study within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which included {{a random sample of}} 1, 901 women (sub-cohort) and 423 breast cancer cases diagnosed during a mean of 9. 1 years of follow-up. IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 concentrations were measured in plasma collected at baseline.

The hazard ratio (HR) for breast cancer comparing the fourth with the <b>first</b> <b>quartiles</b> was 1. 20 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0. 87 - 1. 65] for IGF-I and 1. 09 (95 % CI, 0. 78 - 1. 53) for IGFBP- 3. Both associations varied with age: for IGF-I, the HRs for breast cancer comparing the fourth with the <b>first</b> <b>quartiles</b> were 0. 60 (95 % CI, 0. 25 - 1. 45) before age 50 and 1. 61 (95 % CI, 1. 04 - 2. 51) after age 60 (test for the log-linear trend of HR according to age, P = 0. 05); for IGFBP- 3, the HRs were 0. 79 (95 % CI, 0. 34 - 1. 83) before age 50 and 1. 62 (95 % CI, 1. 03 - 2. 55) after age 60 (test for log-linear trend, P = 0. 08). IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were positively associated with breast cancer risk in older women but not in younger women.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the pro-apoptotic molecules apoptosis-stimulating fragment (FAS, CD 95 /APO- 1) and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) predict event-free survival of HF patients. Methods and results We assayed soluble (s) FAS and sTRAIL levels in 351 patients with advanced HF. During the median follow-up time of 16 months, 175 patients (50 %) experienced the composite endpoints: rehospitalization and death. The hazard increased with sFAS concentrations, with a hazard ratio of 2. 3 comparing fourth and <b>first</b> <b>quartiles.</b> This association remained significant after adjustment for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and other risk factors in a Cox regression model (P 0. 014). Patients with high sFAS but low BNP had a comparable event-free survival rate with those with elevated BNP only (P 0. 78). Conversely, high sTRAIL concentrations were related to a better prognosis.

40|$|Introduction: Middle ear volume (MEV) is a {{clinically}} relevant parameter across {{middle ear}} diseases. MEV values between these techniques {{have never before}} been tested for agreement in ears with perforated tympanic membranes (TMs). Methods: Middle ears were identified from 36 patients ranging 18 – 89 years of age with TM perforations who underwent tympanometry and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) between 2005 and 2015. MEVs calculated by both tympanometry and three-dimensional volume reconstruction (3 DVR) were analyzed for agreement using Bland Altman plots. The differences between tympanometric and 3 DVR MEV values for each given middle ear were characterized across MEV quartiles (1  = smallest; 4  = largest) and across increasing states of middle ear disease using Kruskal–Wallis and Wilcoxon testing with Bonferroni correction. Results: Bland Altman plots demonstrated significant disagreement between MEV measurement techniques. Differences between tympanometric (T) and 3 DVR MEV values were significantly greater with increasing average (i. e. (T+ 3 DVR) / 2)) MEV per linear regression (p <  0. 0001). Significance was demonstrated between fourth and <b>first</b> average MEV <b>quartiles</b> (p =  0. 0024), fourth and second quartiles (p =  0. 0024), third and <b>first</b> <b>quartiles</b> (p =  0. 0048), and third and second quartiles (p =  0. 048). Absolute MEV difference was not significantly different across varying states of middle ear disease (p =  0. 44). Conclusion: Statistically and clinically significant disagreement was demonstrated between tympanometric and 3 DVR MEV values. Studies that vary in MEV estimation techniques {{may be expected to}} demonstrate significantly different results. These preliminary results suggest that clinicians should endeavor to seek further confirmation when interpreting high tympanometric MEV values...|$|R

40|$|Patients after coarctation repair {{still have}} an {{increased}} risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. This has been explained by the persisting hypertension and alterations in the peripheral vessels. However, involvement of the central vessels such as the retinal arteries is virtually unknown. A total of 34 patients after coarctation repair (22 men and 12 women; 23 to 58 years old, age range 0 to 32 years at surgical repair) and 34 nonhypertensive controls underwent structural and functional retinal vessel analysis. Using structural analysis, the vessel diameters were measured. Using functional analysis, the endothelium-dependent vessel dilation in response to flicker light stimulation was assessed. In the patients after coarctation repair, the retinal arteriolar diameter was significantly reduced compared to that of the controls (median 182 mum, <b>first</b> to third <b>quartile</b> 171 to 197; vs 197 microm, <b>first</b> to third <b>quartile</b> 193 to 206; p > 0. 001). These findings were independent of the peripheral blood pressure and age at intervention. No differences were found for venules. The functional analysis findings were not different between the patients and controls (maximum dilation 3. 5 %, <b>first</b> to third <b>quartile</b> 2. 1 % to 4. 5 % vs 3. 6 %, <b>first</b> to third <b>quartile</b> 2. 2 % to 4. 3 %; p = 0. 81), indicating preserved autoregulative mechanisms. In conclusion, the retinal artery diameter is reduced in patients after coarctation repair, independent of their current blood pressure level and age at intervention. As a structural marker of chronic vessel damage associated with past, current, or future hypertension, retinal arteriolar narrowing has been linked to stroke incidence. These results indicate an involvement of cerebral microcirculation in aortic coarctation, despite timely repair, and might contribute to explain the increased rate of cerebrovascular events in such patients...|$|R
