25|$|The 1850s were an {{important}} {{period in the}} development and expansion of Skidmore's career as a metalworker and craftsman. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, he exhibited church plate, including a silver gilt and enamelled chalice now on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The recognition he received at the Exhibition helped to stimulate his business and he soon expanded, beginning to produce other church furnishings including items in <b>iron,</b> <b>brass</b> and wood.|$|E
25|$|The War of 1812 cut off {{the supply}} of British goods, {{stimulating}} American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of <b>iron,</b> <b>brass,</b> tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following {{the aftermath of the}} Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants and by 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area.|$|E
500|$|Following American {{independence}} in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. [...] The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 {{cut off the}} supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. [...] By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of <b>iron,</b> <b>brass,</b> tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown {{to one of the}} largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. [...] Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it {{was the center of the}} [...] "Arsenal of Democracy", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.|$|E

60|$|By {{authority}} of the king such districts were placed under ban, and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon their dismal solitude. Yet neither {{the mandate of the}} monarch, nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly rapine, of every article, such as <b>iron,</b> <b>brass,</b> or lead-work, which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.|$|E
60|$|The {{favorite}} ornaments of the {{men were}} collars of bears' claws, the proud trophies of hunting exploits; while the women and children wore similar decorations of elks' tusks. An intercourse with the white traders, however, soon effected a change in the toilets of both sexes. They became fond of arraying themselves in any article of civilized dress which they could procure, and often made a most grotesque appearance. They adapted many articles of finery, also, to their own previous tastes. Both sexes were fond of adorning themselves with bracelets of <b>iron,</b> <b>brass,</b> or copper. They were delighted, also, with blue and white beads, particularly the former, and wore broad tight bands of them round the waist and ankles, large rolls of them round the neck, and pendants of them in the ears. The men, especially, who in savage life carry a passion for personal decoration further than the females, did not think their gala equipments complete unless they had a jewel of hiaqua, or wampum, dangling at the nose. Thus arrayed, their hair besmeared with fish oil, and their bodies bedaubed with red clay, they considered themselves irresistible.|$|E

The distinctive sound of the drum characteristic of the Native American Church is created because: [...] "The water inside is in constant motion and produces a special resonance. The player's thumb, pressed against the drum head, holds the tone at a constant pitch which then drops a fifth or more when the pressure is relaxed between songs." ...|$|E

He took steps to increase the foreign trade and set export quotas for Akita copper mines (the copper being the primary coinage metal during that period), despite higher domestic prices. Tanuma's administration granted monopoly patents for numerous products, including <b>iron,</b> <b>brass,</b> sulfur, ginseng and lamp oil. Large investments were into the massive drainage program to increase the agricultural land. The program failed. Several years of crop failures, resulting from drought followed by floods, led to famine.|$|E
50|$|Zinc-Nickel plating {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{corrosion}} resistant finishes available offering over 5 times the protection of conventional zinc plating and up to 1,500 hours of Neutral Salt Spray test performance. This plating is a combination of a High Nickel Zinc-Nickel alloy (10% - 15% nickel) and some variation of chromate. The most common mixed chromates include Hexavalent Iridescent, Trivalent or Black Trivalent Chromate. Used to protect steel, cast <b>iron,</b> <b>brass,</b> copper, and other materials, this acidic plating is an environmentally safe option. Hexavalent Chromate has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA and OSHA.|$|E
