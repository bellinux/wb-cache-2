5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> much as possible and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, {{the main}} heroine of Clannad, {{at the onset}} of the story. Nagisa is a shy, soft-spoken girl who has very low {{self-esteem}} and self-confidence which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of Clannad heroines, is an aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Rouen duck, {{the other}} popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after {{hatching}} weigh up to , {{large enough to}} eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of the}} game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow large enough to <b>eat.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her mother at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey. On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> much as they could. She remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E
5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E
25|$|Spinach {{beet leaves}} are <b>eaten</b> <b>as</b> a pot herb. Young {{leaves of the}} garden beet are {{sometimes}} used similarly. The midribs of Swiss chard are eaten boiled while the whole leaf blades are <b>eaten</b> <b>as</b> spinach beet.|$|R
50|$|Field blewits should {{therefore}} be cooked before <b>eating,</b> <b>as</b> the consumption of raw specimens could lead to indigestion. Blewits can be <b>eaten</b> <b>as</b> a cream sauce or sautéed in butter; {{they can also be}} cooked like tripe or as an omelette filling.|$|R
50|$|Faisselle {{is often}} <b>eaten</b> <b>as</b> a savory dessert served with salt, pepper, and either chives or shallots. It is also <b>eaten</b> <b>as</b> a sweet dessert, served with sugar or honey. It {{is also used}} {{in a number of}} dessert dishes, {{including}} cakes and tarts.|$|R

25|$|Living {{conditions}} {{within the}} compounds were cramped. Each person was allotted {{a very small}} space within a barrack building within which to sleep, keep the few personal possessions they had with them, and also to <b>eat,</b> <b>as</b> there was no communal area within the barracks.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 study {{published}} in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that dieters who kept a daily food diary (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if you record your eating, you wouldn't <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> many calories.|$|E

25|$|Mongolian {{barbecue}} {{restaurants are}} {{popular in the}} Philippines. In 1991 {{it was suggested that}} this may be {{due in part to the}} economic recession that was occurring in the early 1990s, because many Mongolian barbecue restaurants operate as affordable buffets that enable diners to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> much as they desire.|$|E
25|$|The Thy-1 {{knockout}} (KO) mice are {{viable and}} appear grossly normal. They display normal social interactions and normal learning in a maze, but fail {{to learn from}} social cues (e.g. learning from other mice which foods are safe to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> compared to wild-type mice). This failure can be rescued by the transgenic expression of Thy-1 or pharmacologic treatment with a GABA (A) receptor antagonists. This suggests that Thy-1 KO mice have excessive GABAergic inhibition in the dentate gyrus and regional inhibition of long-term potentiation.|$|E
25|$|In China {{during the}} Tang dynasty, {{cannibalism}} was supposedly resorted to by rebel forces {{early in the}} period (who were said to raid neighboring areas for victims to <b>eat),</b> <b>as</b> well as both soldiers and civilians besieged during the rebellion of An Lushan. Eating an enemy's heart and liver was also {{claimed to be a}} feature of both official punishments and private vengeance. References to cannibalizing the enemy have also been seen in poetry written in the Song dynasty (for example, in Man Jiang Hong), although the cannibalizing is perhaps poetic symbolism, expressing hatred towards the enemy.|$|E

25|$|A. ocellaris feed on {{plankton}} and algae, {{thus they}} are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, they have less energy to forage for food. Thus, they usually do not <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> much as the dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, {{but also because of}} the increased danger they face when they leave their anemone since they are smaller. In other words, the larger fish will usually travel farther than the smaller fish. Generally, the A. ocellaris feed on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.|$|E
25|$|Bacon is a {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from cured pork. It is first cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to <b>eat,</b> <b>as</b> is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It can be made from the pork belly or from back cuts, which has less fat than the belly.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} of diarrhea, {{replacing}} lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – oral rehydration therapy – or, in severe cases, intravenously. Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research {{does not support the}} limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea. To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning. CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing {{with other members of}} the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Yom Kippur is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance is expected of every Jewish man or woman above the age of bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the Torah (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is so important to fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do eat on this day are encouraged to <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur {{is considered}} more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.|$|E
25|$|Útgarða-Loki {{says that}} no {{visitors}} {{are allowed to}} stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing {{in the rear of}} the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. Útgarða-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two <b>eat</b> <b>as</b> quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, Þjálfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.|$|E
