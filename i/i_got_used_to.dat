500|$|Tonelli {{returned}} to Alabama after the Olympics and intensified his training regimen, He recalled that [...] "The coach really supplied {{me with the}} environment to improve. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> pressure. You had {{to stand up and}} race in dual meets almost every other weekend, no matter how you felt. In Australia you are lucky if you get two top meets a year." [...] In 1977, he won the 100m backstroke at the US Open Championships at Mission Viejo, becoming one of the few Australians to win a US title.|$|E
500|$|Peart's {{drumming}} {{skill and}} technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences are eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would just turn them around and use the other end. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – {{it gives me a}} solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' to sling around." ...|$|E

We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment for a kid to grow up in. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> dealing with groups of boys and getting on with life in unpleasant circumstances and being smart and funny and subversive at the expense of authority. Perfect training for Python." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Juliet said, [...] "after Tredowen {{it seems}} very small, almost poky, but it isn't, really, and Tredowen {{was not for}} me all my days. It was quite time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{something}} else." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Barbara and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{taking a}} cup of coffee in the evening when we were in England," [...] she said. [...] "Talking of the Old Country {{reminded}} me of it. Will you pour it out, Barbara?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I joined it, I {{hated the}} army; {{that sounds like}} high treason, doesn't it? However, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> things and made art my hobby instead of my vocation. You won't mind if I confess that a view of this kind makes me long to paint?" ...|$|E
60|$|At this Jone nearly took {{my breath}} away by saying {{that he thought that}} the bicycle idea was a capital one, and that for his part he'd like it better than any other way of {{travelling}} through a pretty country. He also said he believed I could work a tricycle just as well as not, and that if <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it I would think it fine.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} have got countrified too. O, I couldn't live in a street for the world! Egdon is a ridiculous old place; but <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, and <b>I</b> couldn't be happy {{anywhere}} else at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|Joe Bronson {{nodded and}} glanced curiously about him before answering: [...] "Yes; I think the bay life will suit {{me for a}} while, and then, when <b>I</b> 've <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, <b>I</b> 'm going to sea in the forecastle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I {{have a big}} {{stake in}} the concern; and <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{spending}} money unnecessarily yet, I've been mighty glad to earn a couple dollars by working from sunup until dark, though I didn't always get it afterward. So have you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At first I was, slightly. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the solitude. And {{you know}} a sort of commonsense will creep even into timidity.

[...] But you must see all over my house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} so distracted {{in my life}} as I was {{the first six months}} he was here," [...] {{acknowledged}} Marilla. [...] "After that I suppose <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> him. He's taken a great notion to farming lately, and wants me to let him try running the farm next year. I may, for Mr. Barry doesn't think he'll want to rent it much longer, and some new arrangement will have to be made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he confessed, [...] "I {{was a bit}} shivery at first; but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it. I used to {{feel sorry}} for that poor girl, though. That made me forget to be afraid. She was such a beauty, in spirit as well as in appearance, and she was only {{slightly}} touched; yet she was doomed to lie there, living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away. Leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{imagine what}} it is! These two years that I have been here I have passed hours--hours! One gets <b>used</b> <b>to</b> things, and {{sometimes}} I think <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> this. But {{there are some things}} that are always beginning over again. For example, my coffee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do so wish I {{were younger}} and better looking," [...] she sighed to the bosom friend. [...] "For myself, I don't mind; <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it. But {{it is so}} hard on Reggie. He feels it, I know he does, though he never openly complains." ...|$|R

60|$|He did {{not mention}} what his malady had been; and I abstained, it is needless to say, from {{questioning}} him further. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> his disfigurement {{in the course of}} my relations with him; and I should no doubt have forgotten my blue man in attending to more absorbing matters of interest, if the effects of Nitrate of Silver as a medicine had not been once more unexpectedly forced on my attention, in another quarter, and under circumstances which surprised me in no ordinary degree.|$|E
60|$|But I {{made it up}} {{by eating}} some salt beef and biscuit, which I {{found to be the}} invariable accompaniment of every meal; the sailors sitting cross-legged on their chests in a circle, and {{breaking}} the hard biscuit, very sociably, over each other's heads, which was very convenient indeed, but gave me the headache, at least for the first four or five days till <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it; and then I did not care much about it, only it kept my hair full of crumbs; and I had forgot to bring a fine comb and brush, so I used to shake my hair out to windward over the bulwarks every evening.|$|E
60|$|The flag {{had been}} struck, {{and the gun}} had been fired, {{at the right moment}} of time, and I felt as snugly cut {{off from the rest of}} Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing {{disturbed}} the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I would--I {{would give}} {{my life to}} do so!' exclaimed Clarence, in warm, eager tones. 'I have tried, but he says I know nothing about it, {{and it is very}} dull at our rooms for him. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, but you can't expect a fellow like Griff to stay at home, with no better company than me, and do nothing but read law.' ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAREST CONSTANCE, After {{three months}} of intense {{excitement}} I snatch a leisure moment {{to tell you how}} much I enjoy my first visit to London. Having been educated abroad, it really seems like coming to a strange city. At first the smoke, dirt and noise were very disagreeable, but <b>I</b> soon <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> these things, and now find all I see perfectly charming.|$|R
6000|$|... "I only {{arrived in}} London yesterday," [...] said the girl, [...] "and <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> your keeping-to-the-left rules. I don't suppose I shall ever {{get back to}} New York alive. Perhaps, as you have saved my life, you wouldn't mind doing me another service. Can you tell me which is the nearest and safest way to a {{restaurant}} called the Regent Grill?" ...|$|R
60|$|Each {{one of us}} had {{a little}} hand-bag hung on our machine, and Mr. Poplington said we needn't take {{anything}} to eat, for there was inns to be found everywhere in England. Hannah started me off nicely by pushing my tricycle until I got it going, and Miss Pondar waved her handkerchief from the cottage door. When Hannah left me I went along rather slow at first, but when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the proper motion I began to do better, and was very sure it wouldn't take me long {{to catch up with}} Jone, who was still worm-fencing his way along the road. When I got entirely away from the houses, and began to smell the hedges and grassy banks so close to my nose, and feel myself gliding along over the smooth white road, my spirits began to soar like a bird, and I almost felt like singing.|$|E
6000|$|My sister wept at the sight, and I too was {{stirred by}} it. [...] "Ah!" [...] I thought to myself, [...] "the Great Spirit must be evil. If {{he is not}} evil such things would not happen." [...] That is how I thought then, my father; now I think differently. I know that we had not found out {{the path of the}} Great Spirit, that is all. I was a chicken in those days, my father; {{afterwards}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> such sights. They did not stir me any more, not one whit. But then in the days of Chaka the rivers ran blood--yes, we had to look at the water {{to see if it was}} clean before we drank. People learned how to die then and not make a noise about it. What does it matter? They would have been dead now anyway. It does not matter; nothing matters, except being born. That is a mistake, my father.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So I {{thought of}} doing, and I had out a young fellow, who I thought might take my place---my partner's son, young Stebbing. They {{wrote that he}} had been {{learning}} Italian, with a view to being useful to me, and so on; but when he came out, what was he but a fine gentleman--- never had put his hand to a pick, nor a blasting-iron; and as to his Italian, he told me it was the Italian of Alfieri and Leopardi. Leopardi's Italian it might be, for it was a very mottled or motley tongue, but {{he might as well have}} talked English or Double-Dutch to our hands, or better, for they had picked up the meaning of some orders from me before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> their lingo. And then he says 'tis office work and superintendence he understands. How can you superintend, I told him, what you don't know yourself? No, no; go home and bring a pair of hands fit for a quarryman, before I make you overlooker.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} know {{anything}} like that?" [...] he cried. [...] "Perfectly willing to thrust me {{out into a}} cold other-world, and leave me to struggle on without her, when <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> her looking after me. Now I'm not so selfish as that. I shouldn't want to have Marion living on through all eternity if I wasn't with her. It would be too lonely for her." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} I took upon myself the toils and cares of our life, and had no partner in them. We lived much as before, in {{reference}} to our scrambling household arrangements; but <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> those, and Dora I {{was pleased to see}} was seldom vexed now. She was bright and cheerful in the old childish way, loved me dearly, and was happy with her old trifles.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mell {{never said}} much to me, {{but he was}} never harsh to me. I suppose we were company to each other, without talking. I forgot to mention that he would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and clench his fist, and grind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner. But he had these peculiarities: and at first they frightened me, though <b>I</b> soon <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|R
