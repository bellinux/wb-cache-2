5|$|The {{objective}} is to fly through the Rætikon environment to find its titular secrets, namely by collecting relics to power an ancient device. The environment is split into themed levels such as swamp, lagoon, mountaintops, and forests. <b>Glowing</b> shards are dispersed throughout each level, which can be collected and redeemed at an altar within each themed level for a <b>glowing</b> relic. These relics can be returned to where the player started the game to power a mysterious, ancient device. The player-character carries the relics past aggressive enemies and treacherous environment, and completes puzzles of reconstructing animal statues from its pieces to access new levels. Each level features different animals and contain environmental objects that player can interact with.|$|E

40|$|Despite a {{widespread}} {{interest in the}} warm <b>glow</b> model [Andreoni (1989, 1990) ], surprisingly most attention focused on the voluntary contribution equilibrium of the model, and only very {{little attention has been}} devoted to the competitive equilibrium. In this paper, we introduce the notion of competitive equilibrium for a warm <b>glow</b> economy [Henceforth, warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium]. Then, we establish (and prove), in the contest of our model, the three fundamental theorems of general equilibrium: (i) warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium exists; (ii) a warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium is Pareto efficient; and (iii) a Pareto efficient allocation can be decentralized as a warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium). The concept of a warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium may prove to be very useful to the normative and positive theory of public goods provision. First, it is a price based mechanism achieving efficient outcomes. Secondly, not only the warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium outcomes could serve as a point of reference to measure free-riding and welfare loss, but also due to warm <b>glow</b> effects, unlike Lindahl allocations, {{they are more likely to}} be achieved.

40|$|The voltage–current {{characteristics}} of <b>glow</b> discharges in gas mixture (N 2 :O 2 = 8 : 2) at a pressure of 10 Torr were obtained with the discharge current up to 150 A. Parallel-plane electrodes with {{a diameter of}} 10. 7 cm and a discharge chamber with co-axial geometry were used to produce <b>glow</b> discharge with high current. The <b>glow</b> discharge voltage was almost constant until the whole surface of the cathode was covered with <b>glow,</b> i. e., until the discharge current became 3. 7 A in our experimental condition (a normal <b>glow</b> discharge mode). The voltage, however, increased with the current when the <b>glow</b> covered over the cathode (an abnormal <b>glow</b> discharge mode). The electron density in positive column of the high-current <b>glow</b> discharge was obtained to be 3 × 1011  cm− 3 from Langmuir probe measurements...|$|R

Furthermore a continuous <b>glow</b> discharge with a large crosssection was produced in a high frequency range of 25 kHz- 100 kHz at sub-atmospheric and atmospheric pressures. The length of transient <b>glow</b> duration is correlative with the ease of production and stability of the continuous <b>glow</b> discharge...|$|R
