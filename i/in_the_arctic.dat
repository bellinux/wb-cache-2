30|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the elevated mercury concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more recently collected eggs were due to atmospheric mercury cycling.

5|$|Svalbard and Jan Mayen {{constitute}} two {{outlying areas}} of Norway. Svalbard is an archipelago <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> about midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. The group of islands ranges from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act established administration by the appointed Governor of Svalbard. Jan Mayen is a volcanic island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Ocean {{located at the}} border of the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. Since 1994, the island has been administrated by the County Governor of Nordland, with some authority delegated to the station commander.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard is an {{archipelago}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Ocean {{under the}} full sovereignty of Norway, but {{is subject to}} the special status granted by the Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E

5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic,</b> and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract High {{hydrocarbon}} resource potential makes <b>the</b> Russian <b>Arctic</b> {{an attractive}} region for major {{oil and gas}} producing companies. Any investment decision is commonly based on an assessment stage which includes various types of technical and economical evaluations. Transportation cost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>Arctic</b> drastically influences overall project economics. Thus accurate method for transportation cost assessment becomes important from early stages of project definition. Infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>Arctic</b> is poorly developed so conventional estimation methods of hydrocarbon transportation tariff are ineffective. This paper describes a cost estimation method for tanker transportation of oil which considers key features of operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>Arctic...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic.</b> Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
