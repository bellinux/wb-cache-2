500|$|The Middlesbrough & Guisborough Railway, {{with two}} {{branches}} into the iron-rich hills, {{was approved by}} Parliament on 17 June 1852; Pease had to <b>guarantee</b> <b>dividends</b> to raise the finance needed.

With electric telegraph installed between stations, passenger trains were not permitted to leave a station until confirmation had been received that the line was clear.|$|R
50|$|The alarm about {{financial}} mismanagement {{did not go}} away. A 3% dividend {{was declared}} {{at the end of}} 1848, while <b>guaranteed</b> <b>dividends</b> to leased companies' shareholders up to 9% were being paid out. It was later asserted plausibly that this was an illegal payment of dividend out of capital. At the shareholders' meeting on 26 February 1849 a large volume of improper shareholdings in other companies was revealed: this was discovered to amount to £492,000 in holdings kept secret from shareholders. By the end of 1849 it was disclosed that the company had expended £1,984,764 on constructing the line, more than £700,000 above the contractors' tenders.|$|R
50|$|The KVR {{was absorbed}} by the North British Railway on 1 August 1885. The {{declared}} cost of constructing the line was £77,308. KVR shareholders were to receive a <b>guaranteed</b> 4% <b>dividend</b> {{for two years and}} thereafter 5% in perpetuity.|$|R
50|$|Actually {{raising the}} capital {{was now the}} task; the Directors offered a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>dividend</b> of 5% during the {{construction}} period, money {{that could only be}} paid out of capital. They also employed a new engineer, H O Baldry, who produced a reduced estimate for the construction of £58,068. However, by January 1885 only £23,365 had been subscribed.|$|E

50|$|By 1864 {{revenue from}} the {{existing}} traffic (i.e. without benefit of the new dock or the new connections to the C&W) supported a 6% annual dividend. C&W £20 shares were now being quoted at £36-£40 but this was partly due to a widespread expectation that the new connections {{would lead to a}} takeover. In the spring of 1864, the Whitehaven Junction Railway, which had repeatedly rebuffed past offers of a lease of the C&W, offered to lease the line, guaranteeing an 8% annual dividend to C&W shareholders. The C&W directors asked instead for either a flat 10% guaranteed or 8% guaranteed but dividends to match any dividend greater than 8% on WJR shares. The WJR were not prepared to offer those terms. However, in October 1864 they were, it being understood that the LNWR and the North Eastern Railway (which had absorbed the Stockton and Darlington) had offered to jointly lease the C&W at an 8% <b>guaranteed</b> <b>dividend.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Liquidation {{preferences}} can be partial (they {{apply to}} less than 100% of investment funds), full (100%), or at a multiple of original investment funds. Further, interest or <b>guaranteed</b> <b>dividends</b> {{may or may not}} be added to the preference amount over time. Occasionally the multiple shifts over time as well. Another distinction is that preferences may be [...] "participating", meaning investors receive their preference first and are then entitled to a share of any remaining funds based on their ownership, or they may be [...] "non-participating", in which case they receive either their preference amount only with no further right to distributions, or else their proportionate share of distributions but without the preference, whichever is greater.|$|R

50|$|In the Spring of 1866 Hodgson {{declared}} a 3% dividend on ordinary shares, but {{the share price}} continued to decline. In the Autumn of 1866 Hodgson was again proposing a dividend of 3% but a new company secretary, John Walker, alerted the finance committee to the true state of the NBR's finances. A new preference share issue had flopped, and it proved impossible to pay debenture interest and preference share <b>guaranteed</b> <b>dividends.</b> Evidently {{it was intended to}} pay the dividend out of new capital; North British ordinary shares fell overnight by 8% after this revelation. Widespread financial impropriety and falsification of accounts were disclosed, all laid at Hodgson's door, and this was reported to a Special General Meeting on 14 November 1866.|$|R
50|$|It {{was early}} {{in the growth of}} railways. The London and Birmingham line {{terminated}} at New Street (then called Navigation Street) and the Grand Junction line from the north west terminated at its southern end at Bushbury. The Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN), fearing competition from the railway companies, decided to go into a form of partnership in an attempt to survive the new transport revolution. From the railway's point of view, the London and North West Railway Company (L&NW) — having just merged with the London and Birmingham Railway Company — wanted control of the line which would join their London to Birmingham line with their Grand Junction line from Coseley to the north west. The BCN were given a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>dividend.</b> The London and Birmingham Railway were given the right to appoint to the Board of the BCN and influence canal policy. The London and Birmingham merged into the London and Western Railway Company a year later (1847) who actually built the line between 1848 and 1850.|$|E

For the BS&WR and the rest, and others that came later, much of {{the remainder of the}} decade saw a struggle to find finance in an uninterested market.Like most legislation of its kind, the act of 1893 imposed a time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers alive, the BS&WR announced a new bill in November 1895, which included an application for an extension of time. The additional time and permission to raise an extra £100,000 of capital was granted when the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1896 received royal assent on 7 August 1896.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade of}} the new dock grew rapidly. In 1864 only 17,000tons of coal passed {{out of the old}} outer basin but in 1871 the new inner dock shipped over 165,000tons. In July 1873 the Great Western Railway took it over from the Llynvi and Ogmore, <b>guaranteeing</b> a <b>dividend</b> of 6%.|$|R
50|$|Castleman was {{encouraged}} now, and Moorsom quickly completed the necessary {{plans of the}} route; the GWR <b>guaranteed</b> a 3½% <b>dividend</b> on S&DR shareholdings, and a Bill was presented to Parliament for the 1845 session.|$|R
50|$|Unlike in {{countries}} where the construction of railways became a field for private enterprise, the state constructed {{the bulk of the}} French railway system, and magnanimously invited private companies to operate the lines under leases (of up to 99 years). France's railways form a somewhat unusual case in that they have never been privately owned. The state <b>guaranteed</b> the <b>dividends</b> of the railway operating companies, and in exchange took two-thirds of any greater profits.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{achieved}} authorisation {{to build}} a long, and expensive main line, the Caledonian did not simply concentrate on completing the construction, but set about {{a complex set of}} negotiations designed to spread the area controlled by the company as far as possible.

This simplified the process of gaining control, but committed the Caledonian to large and continuing periodical payments for the future.|$|R
50|$|The {{capital shares}} of a split share {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket of shares. In effect, the holders of capital shares are borrowing money from the holders of the preferred shares at the dividend rate of the preferred shares, and investing that money in a greater number of shares in the underlying basket of shares. Capital gains (or losses) are amplified in the capital shares because the value of the preferred shares is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket of shares is borne mostly by the capital shares. Holders of the capital shares take on their obligation to <b>guarantee</b> <b>dividend</b> payments to the holders of the preferred shares in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the capital shares can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze {{the effects of the}} {{proposed}} reform of the Finnish capital income tax code on the user cost of capital. The analysis focuses on the proposed switch from a dividend deduction to an imputation system to eliminate the double taxation of dividends. The novelty of the paper is its focus on some details in the tax code. Thus the effects of a »leaking» co/porate tax system is analyzed as well as the effects of the minimum tax proposed to <b>guarantee</b> that <b>dividends</b> are taxed at least once. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{formally}} incorporated in April 1845 under the shorter {{name of the}} North Staffordshire Railway. As a way of eliminating opposition to the Company's Bills in Parliament, and {{to allow it to}} promote a line to Liverpool, the company made an agreement to take over the Trent & Mersey Canal Company. This was achieved by T&M shares being swapped for preference shares in the NSR. These preference shares paid a <b>guaranteed</b> annual <b>dividend</b> of 5% once the entire railway was open. The total purchase cost of the T&M to the NSR £1,170,000.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} decade, the company raised $2.5 billion, {{due in part}} to its “Fund of Funds,” which meant investment in shares of other IOS offerings. The offering was very popular in the bull market times, but then the market dropped and the <b>guaranteed</b> [...] <b>dividends</b> had to be paid straight out of the capital - in effect, making it a pyramid scheme. IOS was forced into an Initial Public Offering to meet its costs. The next bear market made many investors cash their funds as stock value decreased.|$|R
5000|$|In 1852 the Leeds Northern Railway (LNR) built a {{line from}} Northallerton to a {{junction}} with the Stockton to Hartlepool line and {{a section of the}} route ran parallel to the S&DR alongside the Yarm to Stockton Road. The S&DR was originally {{on the east side of}} the road, but the LNR built its line with four tracks on the other side of the road, leasing two to the S&DR for a rental of 1s a year. On 25 January 1853 the LNR and SD&R opened a joint station at [...] with an island platform between the tracks, and one side was used by S&DR trains and the other by the LNR. Rather than allow trains to approach the platform line from either direction, the Board of Trade inspecting officer ruled that trains approaching on a line without a platform must first pass through and then reverse into the platform line.The Middlesbrough & Guisborough Railway, with two branches into the iron-rich hills, was approved by Parliament on 17 June 1852; Pease had to <b>guarantee</b> <b>dividends</b> to raise the finance needed. The 9+1/2 mi single-track railway was worked by the S&DR, and opened to minerals on 11 November 1853 and passengers on 25 February 1854.

50|$|Time went {{by without}} further progress, until on 2 December 1892 the VoGR {{directors}} met the Barry Railway Board again {{to discuss a}} way forward. The Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway had opened to passenger traffic on 1 October 1892, and this company was in the rival Taff Vale Railway camp. The Barry Railway was anxious to secure its western flank against the rival, and keeping the VoGR scheme alive was strategically important. Working arrangements with the Barry Railway were arrived at, by which the Barry Railway <b>guaranteed</b> a <b>dividend</b> of 4% on {{the capital of the}} VoGR. This immediately secured the willingness of investors to take VoGR shares.|$|R
50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the meeting, the Chairman remarked that if the North British Railway would <b>guarantee</b> a small <b>dividend,</b> and work the line at a moderate rate, with a lien to the shareholders, as they did on the St Andrews and other branches of the North British system, he had no doubt that great interest would be given to the scheme.|$|R

I know that the legal genius of Mr. Langmaid, one of my vestry, made possible the organization of the company, and thereby evaded the plain spirit of the law of the state. I know that one branch line was bought for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and capitalized for three millions, and that most of the others were scandalously over-capitalized.

5000|$|After long {{deliberation}} {{about the}} huge area of country in Argyll untouched by railways, {{the decision was}} taken to build what became the West Highland Railway, from Craigendoran to Fort William, through largely unpopulated terrain. The constructing company was to be independent, although supported financially by the NBR. The work was authorised in 1889 and it was opened on 7 August 1894. The cost of the construction had been £1.1 million (...) , a considerable overrun on the estimated cost. The NBR had <b>guaranteed</b> a <b>dividend</b> to the West Highland Railway Company based on a much smaller construction cost, and the commitment was now far beyond what the line was likely to produce in income.|$|R
50|$|Negotiations {{followed}} {{and the proposed}} route of the line was modified to satisfy Hope, and discussion with the North British Railway resulted in their agreeing to work the line for 50% of receipts, <b>guaranteeing</b> a 4.5% <b>dividend</b> on the Company's capital of £66,000.
