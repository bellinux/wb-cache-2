For this he used as a basis the Biblioteca mexicana of Bishop Juan José de Eguiara y Eguren of which only the first volume (as far as [...] "J") appeared in print. Beristáin at first intended to republish Eguiara, completing the alphabet by means of sketches and notes left by the author, but, as he proceeded to carry out the idea, he found that it would be preferable to compose an <b>independent</b> <b>bibliography,</b> incorporating in it the material Eguiara had collected. of Beristain's Biblioteca contains many errors in names and dates. Taking into account the time when he wrote, and the distances from sources and their frequent inaccessibility, it has been considered by many as a monumental work.|$|E
40|$|The name Schur is {{associated}} with many terms and concepts that are widely used {{in a number of}} diverse fields of mathematics and engineering. This survey article focuses on Schur’s work in analysis. Here too, Schur’s name is commonplace: The Schur test and Schur-Hadamard multipliers (in the study of estimates for Hermitian forms), Schur convexity, Schur complements, Schur’s results in summation theory for sequences (in particular, the fundamental Kojima-Schur theorem), the Schur-Cohn test, the Schur algorithm, Schur parameters and the Schur interpolation problem for functions that are holomorphic and bounded by one in the unit disk. In this survey, we shall discuss all of the above mentioned topics and then some, {{as well as some of}} the generalizations that they inspired. There are nine sections of text, each of which is devoted to a separate theme based on Schur’s work. Each of these sections has an <b>independent</b> <b>bibliography.</b> There is very little overlap. A tenth section presents a list of the papers of Schur that focus on topics that are commonly considered to be analysis. We shall begin with a review of Schur’s less familiar papers on the theory of commuting differential operators. Acknowledgement: The authors extend their thanks to Bernd Kirstein for carefully reading the manuscript and spotting a number of misprints. 1.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} academic education, {{which consists}} of both education of students and self-education of academic teachers, there is the instant access to {{the information about the}} latest achievements of information science and the opportunity to present your own record in the scientific international arena. The new requirements, for instance in terms of gaining grants and funds to enable projects of conducted research, are forcing scientists to open up to new forms of publication. The paper presents the results of analysis of the e-resources used in scientific work. The activities of the <b>Independent</b> Section <b>Bibliography,</b> Bibliometrics and Network Information Resources Library of the Lodz University were taken in order to promote electronic information sources and raise awareness of Scientific Workers and students in the range of possibilities offered by electronic databases subscribed by the University of Lodz...|$|R
40|$|Jane and Antoinette is an adapted {{screenplay}} {{from the}} novels Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë and Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys. Rhys’s novel, written nearly {{one hundred years}} {{after the publication of}} Jane Eyre in 1847, functions as a prequel to the original text. I develop the two stories into one, cohesive narrative for the screen. The adaptation process includes close analyses of the texts, both independently and in relation to one another. I viewed all film or television adaptations of the two novels and read critical analyses of these adaptations. I also studied adaptation theory and applied those principles to the discipline of screenwriting. This thesis includes a brief preface, which frames the social contexts of Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea at the times that they were written. The preface also describes characteristics of film adaptations and my decision-making process. As per traditional screenplay formatting, the premise, synopsis, and script then exist together as an <b>independent</b> work. A <b>bibliography</b> is included at the end. The screenplay is a culmination of the research I conducted and my own creative process. I extract key elements from each novel without attempting complete fidelity to either text. This creates space for the collaborative authorship of Brontë, Rhys, and I to share in Jane and Antoinette...|$|R
