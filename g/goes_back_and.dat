5|$|Sharon dates Phyllis' ex, Jack Abbott, {{and they}} {{eventually}} marry. Phyllis discovers Sharon's affair with Brad, and blackmails her. During a cliffside photo shoot Phyllis threatens to tell Jack about the affair, triggering a fight. Sharon {{and her best}} friend Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) fall from the cliff, and Drucilla dies. Sharon is found apparently dead, but she is revived. Nick is later presumed dead after his plane crashes; he returns with amnesia (thinking he is still married to Sharon), regains his memory and returns to Phyllis. Jack, Phyllis, Nick and Sharon develop a magazine, Restless Style; however, clashes among the four drive Jack and Sharon from the company. In October 2008, Sharon and Nick meet in Paris; they kiss on a bridge, and Phyllis sees them. Sharon divorces Jack because his dishonesty; she and Nick make love at the Abbott cabin. Confused, Sharon spirals out of control; she develops kleptomania and has a brief affair with Jack's brother, Billy (Billy Miller). Sharon becomes pregnant; Nick <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth between her and Phyllis, choosing Phyllis when Sharon lies about Jack being the father of the child. After being arrested for larceny a second time, Sharon checks herself into Fairview sanitarium (a psychiatric hospital) when her kleptomania becomes uncontrollable. She gives birth to a baby girl, Faith, who is stolen by Adam Newman (Nick's brother) and given to Jack's sister Ashley (Eileen Davidson) after he caused her miscarriage and hysterical pregnancy. Believing her baby is dead, Sharon grows close to Adam (who bonds with her out of guilt). Sharon and Adam are married, but when the truth about Faith is revealed the marriage ends. Several months later, Sharon shoots Adam when he tries to visit her at the Abbott cabin (mistaking him for a burglar); he survives. Nick and Sharon briefly reunite, but break up again when she cheats on him with Adam (who follows her to New Orleans).|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
25|$|Halfway {{across the}} sea the Roland strikes an unseen object which causes massive {{flooding}} and dooms the ship. The passengers panic as the ship sinks into the Atlantic. Von Kammacher finds Ingigered passed out in her cabin from shock and carries her to a lifeboat. He <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> searches in vain her father but when he can't find him, von Kammacher returns to the lifeboat and holds Ingigereds hand as the lifeboat pulls away. They watch in horror as the Roland sinks into the ocean. The liner sinks so rapidly {{that many of the}} lifeboats are never launched and several passengers are swept into the sea and drowned. By morning, only von Kammachers lifeboat is still floating (the rest having been swamped by swimmers) and 8 still alive. They are spotted by a cargo liner and saved. Ingigerd is devastated when she is told that there are no more survivors and both her father and boyfriend have drowned.|$|E

25|$|Her {{changeable}} {{nature is}} reflected throughout her work, {{which has led}} critics and scholars to have very different conclusions about her and her work. Her style often <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth between classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and monochrome palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often. By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction. Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery. Her interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works. Krasner is often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead {{emphasizes the importance of}} her biography since she claims her art is formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.|$|E
500|$|During Cleveland's {{audition}} for The Bachelorette, an unused scene was created that showed both Peter and Cleveland naked, with Peter {{sitting on top}} of Cleveland and bouncing up and down, as if he and Cleveland were engaging in anal sex, but broadcasting standards prohibited the scene. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comments in the DVD commentary that Walter Murphy, who composes much of the music for Family Guy, <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth from standard Family Guy music to Bachelorette-style music during the episode. During the sequence where Brian and Brooke are talking in the barn, originally, the two horses in the background were intended to begin mating, but the sketch was never used. Nancy Cartwright, voice actor of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons, and Michael Bell, voice actor of Chaz Finster on Rugrats, provided their voices for the Snorks reference. The name of Quagmire's cat was originally [...] "Pussy", but broadcasting standards objected. The episode was originally to feature a sequence showing Chris breaking entry into Goldman's Pharmacy in order to destroy the acne medication wearing a Balaclava, but the scene was never shown. The promo features Quagmire in a limo finding the girl of his dreams, but the scene was also cut.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} responses from critics. R Krishna from Daily News and Analysis gave a positive review for the book. He {{observed that the}} criticism in the second book regarding bad editing and writing has been polished in The Oath of the Vayuputras. He complimented the fact that philosophical discussions {{in the book is}} rightly balanced by action sequences, commending the way in which Sati's fight with the assassins is described. Krishna concluded that the different characters of the book make it a good reading and a fitting ending to the series. Phorum Dalal from Mid Day praised the urban dialect used by Shiva in the book and felt that Tripathi's grip on the whole story is steady and has the reader's undivided attention, ultimately [...] "giving the Trilogy an end it deserves". Sanjeev Sanyal from Business Standard gave a neutral review saying that although the fast-paced and easy style from the earlier books has been retained, it is evident if one <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> rereads the first few pages of The Immortals of Meluha that Tripathi has become much more comfortable and confident of his writing. [...] "Of course, those whose literary tastes have not outgrown Wren and Martin will still find fault with his use of the English language. For the rest of us, it is delightful to see how Tripathi applies simple language to evoke great battle scenes and extraordinary landscapes".|$|E

When asked about the {{background}} behind the song, Keys told Billboard, [...] "I {{wanted to write a}} song for someone who was 10 or 12 years old – like a young Michael Jackson. Even though he was young, he was singing some deep stuff back then. [...] is about {{the ins and outs of}} a relationship.

2500|$|All My Children's {{wardrobe}} director, David R. Zyla, {{collaborated with}} Braun {{in creating the}} wardrobe for the Reese Williams character. The two had worked together before when Braun portrayed Carly Corinthos on General Hospital.

[...] "I like that she goes from really strong pants with a buttoned shirt and tie, which is so on trend but is also just great style, to wearing dresses," [...] Braun said. Reese's wardrobe <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth between the two different types of style which allows Braun and Zyla to play with her fashion. [...] "She's an architect, so to me, I would think she has a real eye for lines," [...] said Braun. [...] "She appreciates form and beauty, and the look we came up with I would describe as 'streamlined with a flair'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} to [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was {{released}} on June 30, 2009. The video was recorded and released within ten hours. The music video begins with clips of fans' tribute to Jackson outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Jackson was pronounced dead at. Shortly after Diddy's part of the song begins to play, the voice of Diddy, who isn't seen throughout the entire video, is heard. Clips shown in the being of the video show a young fan holding a poster that reads [...] "R.I.P. Michael Jackson". From there are seen more images of fans, some mourning Jackson, some celebrating him by doing Jackson's signature dances and dressing like him. The Game begins rapping while lying in a bathtub, fully clothed and drinking as {{the water in the}} tub runs. Brown is shown moments after that, bobbing his head to the music. The video then <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth between recording sessions for the song and tributes from Jackson's fans. The Game is shown in the studio with Brown, then we see Boyz II Men's Wanya Morris recording and singing his part on the record. We then see Game writing his rhyme for the song and, later, getting a new tattoo on his right arm. As the video ends, The Game stands up in the bathtub, takes off his shirt and reveals his new Michael Jackson tattoo. It is a picture of Jackson wearing a fedora and a mask on his face.|$|E

60|$|My dear child, I {{think you}} may set your heart at rest upon that point. As far as the history of England <b>goes</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> {{that is more than}} a {{thousand}} years, there is no account of any earthquake which has done any serious damage, or killed, I believe, a single human being. The little earthquakes which are sometimes felt in England run generally up one line of country, from Devonshire through Wales, and up the Severn valley into Cheshire and Lancashire, and the south-west of Scotland; and they are felt more smartly there, I believe, because the rocks are harder there than here, and more tossed about by earthquakes which happened ages and ages ago, long before man lived on the earth. I will show you the work of these earthquakes some day, in the tilting and twisting of the layers of rock, and in the cracks (faults, as they are called) which run through them in different directions. I showed you some once, if you recollect, in the chalk cliff at Ramsgate--two set of cracks, sloping opposite ways, which I told you were made by two separate sets of earthquakes, long, long ago, perhaps while the chalk was still {{at the bottom of a}} deep sea. But even in the rocky parts of England the earthquake-force seems to have all but died out. Perhaps the crust of the earth has become too thick and solid there to be much shaken by the gases and steam below. In this eastern part of England, meanwhile, there is but little chance that an earthquake will ever do much harm, because the ground here, for thousands of feet down, is not hard and rocky, but soft--sands, clays, chalk, and sands again; clays, soft limestones, and clays again--which all act as buffers to deaden the earthquake shocks, and deaden too the earthquake noise.|$|E
