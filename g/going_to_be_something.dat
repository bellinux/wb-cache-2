Mars addmited to be spending a lot of his time thinking about the processing of the video, saying [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> I’ve never done before, I promise you that". A day before the performance on Victoria's Secret show an official audio video of the song was uploaded to YouTube. The official music video was never released.|$|E

5000|$|The {{collaboration}} with Rundgren proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> difficult, especially for Partridge, and numerous disagreements arose over drum patterns, song selections, and other details. Up to that point, it was typical for Partridge {{to act as}} an [...] "executive producer" [...] for XTC's albums, frequently undermining the authority of the actual credited producer. According to Rundgren: [...] "Essentially, it was kind of preordained by me what the record <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> they never endured before. I think 60 percent of the band trusted me, but Andy never did." [...] Gregory intimated that [...] "Todd and Andy were like chalk and cheese as personalities, they didn't hit it off from the start.

500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{production}} designer was Scott Chambliss, {{a longtime}} collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss {{worked with a}} large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church, creature designer Neville Page, and Star Trek veteran John Eaves. Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated. Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it. [...] "We all have the iPhone that does more than the communicator," [...] said Abrams. [...] "I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality. That must go if it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that you believe is real." [...] Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype. Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder. Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller. The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from [...] "stun" [...] to [...] "kill". An Aptera Typ-1 prototype car was used on location.|$|E
500|$|The casting of American {{actor and}} comedian Robin Williams as the Genie {{inspired}} {{the studio to}} recruit similarly talented voice actors capable of matching his pace. The filmmakers had originally envisioned Jasmine's voice as {{similar to that of}} actress Lauren Bacall. Jasmine's speaking voice is provided by American actress Linda Larkin. The role was only one of several auditions Larkin had scheduled during the same week in which she auditioned for Aladdin, and she originally underestimated the scope of the project, joking, [...] "I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like Duck Tales (sic)". Initially presented with only a few pages of the screenplay, Larkin found that she was particularly drawn to Jasmine's [...] "spirit of activism", in addition {{to the ways in which}} character was both similar to and different from previous Disney heroines. Princesses Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora had been childhood favorites of the actress. Larkin's first audition was held in a Burbank, California recording studio, in which she performed solely for the film's casting director. The side used for Larkin's first audition was the scene in which Jasmine meets Aladdin in the marketplace – their first encounter. Jasmine's line [...] "It's all so magical" [...] helped convince Larkin that she was [...] "meant" [...] to voice the character. Although Larkin's voice was significantly different from what the filmmakers had originally envisioned for the character, her interpretation gradually changed their minds.|$|E

He reunited with Rob Spon, {{who spent the}} {{previous}} season with the Rochester Razorsharks. Spon said, [...] "Anthony and Gabe {{are two of the}} best players I have coached. To have them together on the same team is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> special to see. [...] Both of them are winners and leaders and they will make my job that much easier." [...] Anderson debuted with a double-double, scoring 24 points and adding 10 assists in a victory over the Storm on December 26, 2015. On December 30, Anderson paced Saint John with 33 points, pairing with Doug Herring, Jr. to lead the team to a win over the Miracles. He nearly achieved a triple-double in an overtime loss to the Halifax Hurricanes on January 3, 2016, putting up 19 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds. He made a three-pointer with 25 seconds left in regulation, but Hurricanes' Shane Gibson equalized the score and forced overtime. Anderson would not score 20 or more points for 11 consecutive games, before notching 32 against Moncton on February 6. He recorded career-highs of 51 points and nine three-pointers in a 147–102 win over the Orangeville A's on February 18, breaking the Mill Rats' single-game records in both categories. Two days after his performance, he was named the league's Player of the Week.|$|E

Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Dr. Jeremiah Surd. A childhood {{fan of the}} original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's [...] "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something {{he had tried to}} integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, [...] "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> really special." [...] Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: [...] " [...] {{is one of the few}} roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us." [...] A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for [...] "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an [...] "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".|$|E
