40|$|Uncertainties {{inherent}} in the airport traffic {{may lead to the}} unavailability of gates for accommodating scheduled flights. Incorporating random disruptions is crucial in constructing effective flight-gate assignments. We consider the gate assignment problem under uncertainty in flight arrival and departure times and develop stochastic programming models incorporating robustness measures {{based on the number of}} conflicting <b>flights,</b> <b>idle</b> and buffer times. The proposed models are formulated as large-scale mixed-integer programming problems and tabu search algorithms are implemented to obtain assignments of reasonable quality. We conduct a computational study to analyze the proposed alternate models and show the effectiveness of the solution methods...|$|R
50|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 90, coupled with Air Florida's high {{financial}} leverage and reliance on foreign currency trading for profits, led {{the company to}} declare bankruptcy and cease operations on July 3, 1984, despite an effort by new head Donald Lloyd-Jones (an alumnus of American Airlines) to save the company. When operations ceased, Air Florida had over 18 months of unprocessed credit card ticket purchases and dozens of <b>flight</b> crews <b>idle</b> at home because management had failed to renew leases on all DC-10-30 aircraft. Midway Airlines acquired most of the assets of Air Florida for $53 million while Air Florida was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.|$|R
60|$|He {{was decidedly}} a visionary, but a visionary of an {{uncommon}} and successful kind. The {{manner in which}} his ardent, imaginative, and mercurial nature was controlled by a powerful judgment, and directed by an acute sagacity, is the most extraordinary feature in his character. Thus governed, his imagination, instead of exhausting itself in <b>idle</b> <b>flights,</b> lent aid to his judgment, and enabled him to form conclusions at which common minds could never have arrived, nay, which they could not perceive when pointed out.|$|R
25|$|The {{technical}} log {{for the flight}} indicated that the co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) for the flight. The CVR and ATC recordings also indicate that the co-pilot was PF during the flight. Furthermore, injuries sustained by the co-pilot to his right hand are consistent with his having been handling the aircraft {{at the time of}} impact. As no autopilot or flight director (FD) was fitted, the PF was under a high workload throughout the flight. This was especially so as three approaches were made in poor weather to below minima with two go-arounds. Normally the PF handles both flight and engine controls in a coordinated manner to achieve the required flight path; the PNF carries out other tasks including monitoring the aircraft's flight path, radio communications and keeping the flight log. The CVR indicates that the commander (PNF) took control of the power levers during final approach, this action being acknowledged by the PF. This was significant, as both power levers were subsequently retarded below <b>Flight</b> <b>Idle</b> – an action which would have been unexpected by the PF.|$|E
25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine intake air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall warning horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E
2500|$|... he {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the loss of control in flight {{as a result of}} a malfunction of the left engine propeller control unit which allowed the propeller blade angles to go below the <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> position. Contributing to the accident was the deficient design of the propeller control unit by Hamilton Standard and the approval of the design by the Federal Aviation Administration. The design did not correctly evaluate the failure mode that occurred during this flight, which resulted in an uncommanded and uncorrectable movement of the blades of the airplane’s left propeller below the <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> position.|$|E

It corresponds to the unexplained breakage of an 85 mm long liquid bridge of low viscosity silicone oil, established between unequal discs of 30 and 28 mm, intended to counterbalance the expected deformation by residual acceleration found in previous <b>flights,</b> and left <b>idle</b> because the vibrations and oscillations to be applied afterwards were not started, for fear of premature breakage.

So, I pass to my hotel, enchanted; sup, enchanted; go to bed, enchanted; pushing back this morning (if it really were this morning) into the remoteness of time, blessing the South-Eastern Company for realising the Arabian Nights in these prose days, murmuring, as I wing my <b>idle</b> <b>flight</b> into the land of dreams, 'No hurry, ladies and gentlemen, going to Paris in eleven hours.

40|$|Potentially {{new ways}} to improve civil {{aircraft}} fuel efficiency, based on the aircraft maintenance process optimiza- tion are considered. The data confirming the advisability of their further in-depth study and implementation in civil aviation airlines activity is given. It is shown {{that one of the}} reasons provoking the increase of fuel consumption at the cruising flight stage might be the necessity of the bypass of meteorological areas and of the flight altitude or airspeed change. These events are occasional. At the same time the most advantageous methods aimed at improving fuel efficiency are continuous aircraft climb or descent. One of these research directions is the implementation of continuous descent mode, rational routes of approach to the airfield, climb, choice of optimal flight modes in flights. This program is called “SESAR”. While its realization within the framework of the EC it is planned to reduce fuel consumption by 5 million tons a year due to its economy by 10 % after each flight. The similar program “NextGen” of air traffic optimization is accepted and is realized nowadays in the USA. The purpose of this program is annual improvement of fuel efficiency not less than by 2 % a year. Based on the conducted research the expanded list of recommendations for the realization of aircraft continuous descent system in flight, providing renunciation of horizontal <b>flight</b> areas at <b>idling</b> engines is presented...|$|R

2500|$|During the {{approach}} to a right turn which would place the aircraft on final approach to runway 25, the right landing gear failed to fully extend so the co-pilot began to manually extend it using a hydraulic pump.

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of the accident was [...] "the captain’s inability to control the airplane {{in an attempt to}} recover from an asymmetric power condition at low speed following his intentional use of the beta mode of propeller operation to descend and slow the airplane rapidly on final approach for landing. Factors that contributed to the accident were an unstabilized visual approach, the presence of a departing DC-9 on the runway, the desire to make a short field landing, and the higher-than-normal <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> fuel flow settings of both engines.

40|$|Incidents {{of partial}} or total thrust loss due to engine icing at cruise have been {{recorded}} over past several years. These events increase the demand for better understanding of compres-sor dynamics under such conditions. In the present study, physics based compressor blade row model (BRM) is {{used to evaluate the}} effect of booster ice-shed on axial high pressure compressor (HPC) at <b>flight</b> and approach <b>idling</b> conditions (65 %- 82 % Nc). A representative aviation high-bypass turbofan engine HPC is used in this study. Transient behavior of compressor with vary-ing ice ingestion conditions is compared and inter-stage dynam-ics is analyzed. Stage re-matching occurs due to heat exchange between air and ice which dictates the stall inception stage in the compressor. It is found that although T 3 drop is closely related to compressor stall inception, the transient mechanism of ice-shed also plays an important role. Comparisons are made with steady energy balance equation to determine total water content (TWC) at HPC inlet to emphasize the importance of compressor transients. The ice amount, its ingestion duration and rate affect the onset of stall. HPC might sustain through a slower ice-shed while a faster ice-shed can lead to compressor stall with little or no chances of recovery. Understanding this transient behavior and inter-stage dynamics due to ice-shed will help in designing and implementing passive or active stall control mechanisms.

2500|$|The {{first officer}} {{called for the}} arming of the {{spoilers}} one second after touchdown, and the commander armed them half a second later. Two seconds later the first officer called [...] "no spoilers" [...] as the spoiler indicator light had not switched on. He then verified the hydraulic pressure and that the switch was set correctly. Meanwhile, the commander had switched the thrust levers from <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> to ground idle, and six seconds after touchdown activated the wheel brakes. From 12.8 seconds after touchdown various screeching sounds can be heard from the tires. The braking took place nominally until halfway down the runway. From this point the pilots reported that nominal retardation did not occur. The commander attempted to use the brake pedals to apply full braking, without effect. He then moved the brake lever from green to yellow and subsequently emergency brake, disconnecting the anti-lock. Witnesses observed smoke and spray emitted from the landing gear.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} P2V-5F model, the Neptune {{became one of}} the first {{aircraft}} in operational service to be fitted with both piston and jet engines. The Convair B-36, several Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, Fairchild C-123 Provider, and Avro Shackleton aircraft were also so equipped. To save the weight and complexity of two separate fuel systems, the Westinghouse J34 jet engines on the P2Vs burned the same 115–145 Avgas fuel as the piston engines instead of jet fuel. The jet pods were fitted with intake doors that were kept closed when the J-34s were not running; this prevented windmilling, allowing for economical piston-engine-only long-endurance search and patrol operations. In normal U.S. Navy operations, the jet engines were run at full power (97%) to expedite and assure all takeoffs, then shut down when the aircraft reached a safe altitude. The jets were also started and kept running at <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> during low-altitude ( [...] during the day and [...] at night) anti-submarine and/or anti-shipping operations as a safety measure in case one of the radials developed problems.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the crew}} called out [...] "50 meters", the {{controller}} instructed [...] "level 101", telling the aircraft to terminate descent. At , another controller instructed [...] "Check altitude, level." [...] Simultaneously with this final call, the control column was pulled full aft, commanding max pitch {{up from the}} aircraft, and the throttles were moved within one second from their <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> positions to maximum power. The aircraft, due to the valley terrain, was actually [...] below the runway at this time. The Russian investigation surmised that at this moment the flight crew saw the trees through the fog, and instinctively reacted {{in an attempt to}} escape their grave predicament. The crew did not disengage the autopilot, but the action of commanding maximum pitch up on the control column overpowered it, causing the pitch channel to disengage. The control column briefly moved to neutral at this point, then moved full aft and remained there {{for the duration of the}} flight. According to the Polish report, the command [...] "level" [...] ordering a change to horizontal flight was issued at a time when the aircraft was at an altitude of about [...] above airfield level. Two seconds before the [...] "level" [...] command, the aircraft commander made the decision to go around. According to the Polish committee's findings, the command to level should have been issued 10 seconds sooner, when the aircraft was well below the glide path.|$|E

5000|$|Sound {{analysis}} of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recordings revealed that the drag produced by the propeller exceeded the thrust produced. The investigation later stated: [...] "The drag on an engine at <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> {{is greater than the}} drag on an inoperative engine (OEI), {{and in the case of}} 9N-AHA where the <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> fuel flow was incorrectly set too low, the drag would have been even greater at idle (in excess of 350 lb of drag - reference section 1.16.2). It is therefore possible that at about 6,200 kg with one engine at 100% power and one engine at <b>flight</b> <b>idle,</b> there would have been insufficient thrust to maintain 77 kt, and the additional drag on one side would have affected controllability more than in the OEI case" ...|$|E

50|$|While {{flying at}} 33,000 ft, the aircraft's speed {{gradually}} decreased until it entered an aerodynamic stall.

After a 7,000 feet per minute dive with engines in a <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> or near <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> condition, the plane crashed and burst into flames at 07:01 UTC into a field on a cattle ranch near Machiques, in the western Zulia State, Venezuela (about 30 kilometres from the Colombian border).|$|E

50|$|On 4 April 1994, Flight KL433 to Cardiff, a Saab 340 {{operated}} by KLM Cityhopper, returned to Schiphol after setting {{the number two}} engine to <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> because the crew mistakenly believed that the engine suffered from low oil pressure because of a faulty warning light. On final approach at a height of 90 ft, the captain decided to go-around and gave full throttle on only the number one engine leaving the other in <b>flight</b> <b>idle.</b> The airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank.

On short final (the last stage of flight before landing), at a height of 90 feet, the captain decided to go-around (abort the landing and try again) and gave full throttle. However he only gave full throttle on the number one engine, leaving the other in <b>flight</b> <b>idle.</b> Because of this, the airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank.|$|E
50|$|A {{torque split}} between the powerplants, caused by a {{defective}} Pt2/Tt2 sensor, became significant when the power levers were retarded below <b>Flight</b> <b>Idle</b> and the No. 1 powerplant entered negative torque regime.

50|$|Deeper {{observation}} on the plane's propellers {{revealed that}} the left propeller had a pitch setting of at least 20.4°, {{that is to say}} a pitch superior to that of <b>flight</b> <b>idle.</b> The right propeller had a different pitch setting for each of the blades, settings likely due to less violent secondary impacts on the powerplant at the moment of the accident. Consequently, the values noted were unusable.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} found the propellers oversped because the Captain pulled the power levers through the <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> gate {{and into the}} ground beta range during flight. This was prohibited by the Aircraft Flight Manual. Although a 'beta lockout' mechanism did exist for DHC-8-100,-200, and -300 series aircraft which prevented the propellers from going into reverse even if the power levers were moved into the beta range during flight, this mechanism was only required by regulation to be installed in DHC-8 aircraft operating in the USA. It was not required to be fitted to DHC-8 aircraft in Papua New Guinea, {{and it was not}} fitted to MCJ. If a beta lockout mechanism had been installed on the aircraft, the double propeller overspeed would not have occurred when the power levers were moved below the <b>flight</b> <b>idle</b> range and in the ground beta range during flight. Installation of this mechanism is now mandatory on DHC-8 aircraft worldwide by 19 June 2016. If the pilots had followed the standard emergency procedures detailed in company manuals, they would have given themselves more time to manage the emergency, consider their options, and carry out the approach and forced landing.|$|E
