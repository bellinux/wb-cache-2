50|$|P53's normal {{function}} is to regulate genes that control apoptosis. As survivin is a known inhibitor of apoptosis, it can be implied that p53 repression of survivin is one mechanism by which cells can undergo apoptosis upon induction by apoptotic stimuli or signals. When survivin is over-expressed in the cell lines mentioned in the previous paragraph, apoptotic response from <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agent</b> adriamycin decreased in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that down-regulation of survivin by p53 is important for p53-mediated apoptotic pathway to successfully result in apoptosis. It is known that a defining characteristic of most tumors is the over-expression of survivin and {{the complete loss of}} wild-type p53. The evidence put forth by Mirza et al. shows that there exists a link between survivin and p53 that can possibly explain a critical event that contributes to cancer progression.|$|E
50|$|Wild-type p53 {{has been}} shown to repress survivin {{expression}} at the mRNA level. Using an adenovirus vector for wild-type p53, human ovarian cancer cell line 2774qw1 (which expresses mutant p53) was transfected. mRNA levels of survivin were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and showed time-dependent down regulation of survivin mRNA levels when the cells were infected with wild-type p53. A 3.6 fold decrease of survivin mRNA level was observed 16 hours after infection initiation and decreased 6.7 fold 24 hours after infection. Western blot results do show that there is indeed the p53 from the adenoviral vector was being expressed in the cells using antibody specific for p53. The expression of p53 levels indicative of its role in survivin repression shows that p53 started to be expressed 6 hours into infection and had its highest level at 16-24 hours. To further confirm that endogenous wild-type p53 is really causing the repression of survivin gene expression, the authors induced A549 (human lung cancer cell line with wild-type p53) and T47D (human breast cancer cell line with mutant p53) cells with <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agent</b> adriamycin to trigger the physiological p53 apoptotic response in these cancer cells and compare the survivin levels measured to the same cells without DNA damage induction. The A549 line, which intrinsically has functioning wild-type p53, showed significant reduction in survivin levels compared to non-induced cells. This same effect was not seen in T47D cells that carry mutant inactive p53.|$|E

40|$|Exposure of {{mammalian}} {{cells to}} agents that induce apoptosis {{results in a}} rapid and substantial inhibition of protein synthesis. In MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand inhibit overall translation by a mechanism that requires caspase (but not necessarily caspase- 3) activity. This inhibition {{is associated with the}} increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF 2) alpha, increased association of eIF 4 E with the inhibitory eIF 4 E-binding protein (4 E-BP 1), and specific cleavages of eIF 4 B and eIF 2 alpha. All of these changes require caspase activity. The cleavage of eIF 4 GI, which specifically needs caspase- 3 activity, is dispensable for the inhibition of translation in MCF- 7 cells. Similar experiments with embryonic fibroblasts from control mice and animals defective for expression of the double-stranded RNA-regulated protein kinase (PKR) reveal requirements for both caspase activity and PKR for inhibition of protein synthesis in response to TNFalpha. In contrast, treatment of cells with the <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agent</b> etoposide inhibits protein synthesis equally well {{in the presence of a}} pan-specific caspase inhibitor and in the presence or absence of PKR. Surprisingly, the ability of etoposide to cause increased association of eIF 4 E with 4 E-BP 1 does require PKR activity.

40|$|The {{cisplatin}} analogue 1 R, 2 R-diaminocyclohexane(trans-diacetato) (dichloro) platinumIV (DAP) is a <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agent</b> {{that will}} be entering clinical trials for its potent cytotoxic effects against cisplatin-resistant tumour cells. This cytotoxicity may reside {{in its ability to}} selectively activate G 1 -phase checkpoint response by inhibiting CDKs via the p 53 /p 21 pathway. We have now evaluated the role of another CDK inhibitor p 27 as a contributor to DAP-mediated inhibition of G 1 -phase CDK 2 activity. Our studies in ovarian A 2780 tumour cells demonstrate that p 27 levels induced by DAP are comparable to or greater than those seen for p 21. The induction of p 27 is not through a transcriptional mechanism, but rather is due to a four-fold increase in protein stabilisation through a mechanism dependent on p 21. Moreover, DAP-induced p 21 promoted the selective increase of p 27 in the CDK 2 complex, but not in CDK 4 complex, and this selective increase contributed to inhibition of the CDK 2 kinase activity. The inhibited complex contained either p 27 or p 21, but not both, with the relative levels of cyclin E associated with p 27 and p 21 indicating that about 25 % of the inhibition of CDK 2 activity was due to p 27 and 75 % due to p 21. This study provides the first evidence that p 27 upregulation is directly attributable to activation of the p 53 /p 21 pathway by a <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agent,</b> and promulgates p 53 /p 21 /p 27 axis as a significant component of checkpoint response...|$|E

40|$|Silent mating type {{information}} regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT 1) plays {{a critical}} role in reactive oxygen species-triggered apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Here, we investigated a possible role for the PTEN/Akt/JNK pathway in the SIRT 1 -mediated apoptosis pathway in mES cells. Akt was activated by removal of anti-oxidant 2 -mercaptoethanol in SIRT 1 −/− mES cells. Since PTEN is a negative regulator of Akt and its activity can be modulated by acetylation, we investigated if SIRT 1 deacetylated PTEN to downregulate Akt to trigger apoptosis in anti-oxidant-free culture conditions. PTEN was hyperacetylated and excluded from the nucleus in SIRT 1 −/− mES cells, consistent with enhanced Akt activity. SIRT 1 deficiency enhanced the acetylation/phosphorylation level of FOXO 1 and subsequently inhibited the nuclear localization of FOXO 1. Cellular acetylation levels were enhanced by <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agent,</b> not by removal of anti-oxidant. c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) was activated by removal of anti-oxidant in SIRT 1 -dependent manner. Although p 53 acetylation was stronger in SIRT 1 −/− mES cells, DNA-damaging stress activated phosphorylation and enhanced cellular levels of p 53 irrespective of SIRT 1, whereas removal of anti-oxidant slightly activated p 53 only with SIRT 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is {{a natural}} process by which damaged and {{potentially}} tumorigenic cells are removed. Induction of apoptosis is important in chemotherapy aimed at eliminating cancer cells. We address the mechanisms by which this process can be triggered in cells that are recalcitrant to cell death induced by <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal human fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts with defined genetic changes, were treated with <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents</b> and inhibitors of transcription. Western blotting was used to study the expression {{of some of the}} key factors involved in the response to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis, namely, p 53, p 21 WAFI,Cip 1, Mdm 2, Bax, and CD 95 (Fas/APO 1). Apoptosis was followed by various criteria, including DNA fragmentation, specific proteolysis, cell morphology, viability, and FACS scan for sub-G 1 cells. RESULTS: Normal human fibroblasts were more resistant than lymphoblasts to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents</b> mitomycin C and cisplatin induced rapid apoptosis of fibroblasts with defects in the repair of transcribed DNA, compared with wild-type cells or those with defects in overall genome repair. Short-term treatment with inhibitors of RNA polymerase II transcription, actinomycin D, and alpha-amanitin induced rapid cell death of normal fibroblasts. These results show that there is a link between defective transcription and apoptosis. Treatments and genetic backgrounds that favored apoptosis were associated with efficient and prolonged induction of p 53 and often altered or imbalanced expression of its downstream effectors p 21 WAFI,Cip 1 and Mdm 2, whereas there were no changes in Bax or CD 95 (Fas/APO 1). CONCLUSION: Transcription inhibitors increase p 53 levels and are better inducers of apoptosis than <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents</b> in some cell types.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} protein p 53 {{serves as}} a critical regulator of a G 1 cell cycle checkpoint and of apoptosis following exposure of cells to <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents.</b> The mechanism by which <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents</b> elevate p 53 protein levels to trigger G 1 /S arrest or cell death remains to be elucidated. In fact, whether damage to the DNA template itself participates in transducing the signal leading to p 53 induction {{has not yet been}} demonstrated. We exposed human cell lines containing wild-type p 53 alleles to several different <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents</b> and found that agents which rapidly induce DNA strand breaks, such as ionizing radiation, bleomycin, and DNA topoisomerase-targeted drugs, rapidly triggered p 53 protein elevations. In addition, we determined that camptothecin-stimulated trapping of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes was not sufficient to elevate p 53 protein levels; rather, replication-associated DNA strand breaks were required. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the antimetabolite N(phosphonoacetyl) -L-aspartate (PALA) did not cause rapid p 53 protein increases but resulted in delayed increases in p 53 protein levels temporally correlated with the appearance of DNA strand breaks. Finally, we concluded that DNA strand breaks were sufficient for initiating p 53 -dependent signal transduction after finding that introduction of nucleases into cells by electroporation stimulated rapid p 53 protein elevations. While DNA strand breaks appeared to be capable of triggering p 53 induction, DNA lesions other than strand breaks did not. Exposure of normal cells and excision repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum cells to low doses of UV light, under conditions in which thymine dimers appear but DNA replication-associated strand breaks were prevented, resulted in p 53 induction attributable to DNA strand breaks associated with excision repair. Our data indicate that DNA strand breaks are sufficient and probably necessary for p 53 induction in cells with wild-type p 53 alleles exposed to <b>DNA-damaging</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
