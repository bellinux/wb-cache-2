An adsorption/removal capacity of 65. 12 mg/g was achieved by L. edodes in solutions with a pH ranging from 2. 5 to 6. 0, while little if any adsorption was observed in solutions with a pH under 2. 5. In solutions with pH 6. 0, 84 % of the cadmium adsorption by L. edodes occurred in the first minute. Scanning electronic microscopic examination showed that the cell wall polysaccharides of L. edodes provided a rough sponge-like surface for <b>effective</b> <b>cadmium</b> adsorption.

The total neutron flux of the Ghana Research Reactor- 1 (GHARR- 1) was measured after a beryllium reflector {{was added to}} its shim to compensate for excess reactivity loss. The thermal, epithermal and fast neutron fluxes were determined by the method of foil activation. The experimental samples with and without a cadmium cover of 1 -mm thickness were irradiated in the isotropic neutron field of the irradiation sites of Ghana Research Reactor- 1 facility. The induced activities in the sample were measured by gamma ray spectrometry with a high purity germanium detector. The necessary correction for gamma attenuation, thermal neutrons and resonance neutron self-shielding effects were taken into account during the experimental analysis. By defining <b>cadmium</b> <b>cutoff</b> energy of 0. 55 eV, Al- 0. 1 % Au wires of negligible thickness were irradiated at 3 kW to determine the neutron fluxes of two irradiation channels, outer channel 7 and inner channel 2 whose Neutron Shaping Factor (α) {{were found to be}} (0. 037 ± 0. 001) and (– 0. 961 ± 0. 034).

Recent studies have shown that α, β, and γ CDPs follow the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller models and are capable of reducing heavy metal ion concentrations in water to desirable levels with enhanced sorption capabilities. The removal of cadmium and chromium achieved equilibrium in 4 h.

Furthermore, a small amount of CDPs can remove large quantities of heavy metal ions and can then be regenerated with acid for reuse.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Electrokinetic {{remediation}} of fine-grained soils polluted {{by heavy}} metals {{is affected by}} the equilibria between dissolved and sorbed ions; pH can also influence the surface equilibria. Geochemical models which describe the behaviour of different surface sites and their interactions with heavy metal ions have to be considered for a good mathematical representation of an electrokinetic process. RESULTS: Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + sorption isotherms were performed at different pH values using kaolinite as sorbent. Electrokinetic tests were performed with samples of kaolinite spiked with Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + at 0. 7 and 2 Vcm- 1 : the concentration profiles were obtained experimentally at different treatment times. The pH in the compartments was conditioned by acetate buffer. On the basis of the experimental results, a numerical model was formulated to simulate ion transport under an electric field combining the diffusion-advection equations with a two-sites geochemical model taking into account ion exchange and surface complexation of the metal ions, as well as the protonation-deprotonation reactions of the surface sites. CONCLUSIONS: The process was <b>effective</b> for <b>cadmium</b> removal, while a strong dependence on pH was observed for lead removal.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to provide a}} solution to the problem of toxic metal emissions from high temperature combustion processes. Multi-metal as well as single-metal interactions were investigated to provide an understanding of mechanisms that exist in industrial furnaces, where multiple metals are present. Specifically, multiple toxic metals, lead and cadmium, and a common non-toxic metal, sodium, were investigated. Sodium capture by kaolinite was found to exhibit a negative activation energy (between 1100 and 1300 °C) similar to that shown previously for lead, due to a catastrophic deactivating melt initiated by the metal oxide/kaolinite reaction product. In addition, an overall sodium/kaolinite reaction rate (soluble + insoluble) was determined. It was also discovered that a larger percentage of sodium/kaolinite reaction product was water soluble when formed at lower equivalence ratios than at high equivalence ratios. The majority of the initially formed sodium/kaolinite reaction products were probably insoluble sodium aluminosilicates. However, at high sorbent utilizations (low equivalence ratios), the meta-kaolinite structure probably broke down to form sodium silicates and aluminates, thus enabling at least twice as much sodium capture as the sodium aluminosilicate products. The cadmium/kaolinite reaction rate was highly activated between 1100 °C and 1300 °C, due to a self-enhancing melt, which occurred at the high but not low temperature condition. For the Cd/Pb multi-metal system, cadmium capture was enhanced by a melt initiated by the lead/kaolinite reaction product. Also, cadmium enhanced lead capture by reducing the extent of catastrophic melt caused by the lead/kaolinite product. The formation of an optimum eutectic melt accounts for the enhancement of total bimetal capture by kaolinite at high and low temperatures (1100 °C to 1300 °C). Sodium capture by kaolinite completely dominated over lead capture from a bimetal system. On the other hand, sodium was found to behave similar to lead in terms of enhancing cadmium capture by kaolinite at the low temperature condition. In addition to kaolinite, hydrated lime was found to be <b>effective</b> at capturing <b>cadmium,</b> and CDEM sorbent, composed of calcium carbonate, lime, and kaolinite, was <b>effective</b> at capturing <b>cadmium</b> and a mixture of cadmium and lead...|$|R

To confirm alteration by dietary Cd intake, twenty rats fed AIN- 93 G diet without (n= 10) and with (n= 10) dietary Cd were sacrificed and compared. Other thirty rats were randomly blocked into three groups and fed slightly modified AIN- 93 G diets replacing 0 (n= 10), 5 (n= 10) or 10 % (n= 10) chlorella of total kg diet for 4 weeks. Daily food intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ weight (liver, spleen, and kidney), perirenal fat pad and epididymal fat pad weights were measured. To examine Cd detoxification, urinary Cd excretion and metallothonein (MT) concentrations in kidney and intestine were measured. Food intake, calorie intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ weight and fat pad weights were decreased by dietary Cd intake. Urinary Cd excretion and MT concentrations in kidney and small intestine were increased by dietary Cd. After given Cd containing diet, food intake, calorie intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ weights and fat pad weights were not influenced by dietary chlorella intake. Renal MT synthesis tended to be higher in a dose-dependent manner, but not significantly. And chlorella intake did not significantly facilitate renal and intestinal MT synthesis and urinary Cd excretion. These findings suggest that, after stopping cadmium supply, chlorella supplementation, regardless of its percentage, might not improve cadmium detoxification from the body in growing rats...|$|R

In the visible and infrared spectra both polarizations yielded strong absorption peaks. For perpendicular polarization, the main peak was at 0. 98 eV and was attributed mainly to transitions between bands along the L−H symmetry line. Also in this polarization there was an absorption edge at 0. 29 eV. This {{may be due to}} transitions near the point K in the Brillouin zone. For parallel polarization, the main absorption peak was at 1. 10 eV and was attributed to transitions between bands along Γ−K, Γ−M, and L−H. No low-energy absorption edge was found for parallel polarization. Agreement between the experimental data and the calculations of Kasowski based on a nonlocal-pseudopotential model was fairly good. There was no agreement between the data and calculations based on a local-pseudopotential model. At low temperatures, the long-wavelength absorptivities were approximately constant, in agreement with theory for the anomalous-skin-effect region.

Zeolite A appeared to have the highest binding capacity between pH 5 and 6. 5 and was stable above pH 5. 5. The second objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of zeolite addition on the dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration. Since zeolites increase soil pH and bind Ca, their application might lead to dispersion of organic matter. In a batch experiment, the DOM concentration increased by a factor of 5 when the pH increased from 6 to 8 as a result of zeolite A addition. A strong increase in DOM was also found in the leachate of soil columns, particularly in the beginning of the experiment. This resulted in higher metal leaching caused by metal¿DOM complexes. In contrast, the free ionic concentration of Cd and Zn strongly decreased after the addition of zeolites, which might explain the reduction in metal uptake observed in plant growth experiments.

40|$|International audienceThe primary {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate a chemically modified cellulose for the sorption efficiency and selectivity to remove cadmium from spiked high-hardness groundwater. Heterogeneous esterification of cellulose with succinic anhydride in toluene under basic conditions has proceeded very efficiently to yield the succinylated cellulose (SC) with fairly high DS value, as confirmed by FTIR and solid-state MAS 13 C NMR spectroscopies. Deprotonation of the free carboxylic acid group was achieved by alkaline treatment of SC with saturated NaHCO 3 aqueous solution. Batch experiments were carried out on the resulting sodic material (NaSC) to examine its cadmium-removing capability in both distilled water (DW) and spiked groundwater (GW). The results obtained from the sorption characteristics (kinetics, isotherms and pH effect) have revealed that NaSC material is particularly <b>effective</b> in removing <b>cadmium</b> from both DW and GW solutions, with a maximum uptake of 185. 2 and 178. 6 mg g− 1, respectively. These comparable sorption capacities strongly suggest that NaSC sorbent is highly selective to heavy metal over alkaline earth cations (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) and therefore less susceptible to interference from background ions, naturally present in groundwater. On the other hand, cadmium sorption is shown to decrease with a decrease in pH which is indubitably inherent to the competing proton during the ion-exchange process. Furthermore, the material {{has proven to be}} efficiently regenerable by using a NaCl brine solution. Thus, the use of the sorbent sequentially to the first regeneration led to nearly no attenuation in the material's capacity for cadmium-removal.

40|$|International audienceChemical {{functionalization}} {{of olive}} stone wastes with succinate linkers can potentially improve {{the performance of}} wastewater treatment technologies via enhanced adsorption and high affinity of the covalently attached succinate groups for heavy metals. In this study, a novel reusable adsorbent material based on agricultural waste has been synthesized by esterifying the lignocellulosic matrix of olive stones with succinic anhydride in toluene under basic conditions. Characterization of the as-prepared material by FTIR and solid-state MAS 13 C NMR spectroscopies and TGA confirmed that the heterogeneous esterification has proceeded very efficiently to yield the succinylated-olive stone (S–OS). Subsequent alkaline treatment of S–OS with saturated NaHCO 3 aqueous solution led to the resulting sodic material (NaS–OS), which was subjected to batch experiments in order to evaluate its cadmium-removing efficiency from aqueous solutions at realistic concentrations of cadmium found in industrial effluents. The results obtained from the sorption characteristics have revealed that NaS–OS material is highly <b>effective</b> in removing <b>cadmium</b> from aqueous solutions, with a maximum uptake capacity of 200 mg g− 1 (1. 78 mmol g− 1). The Langmuir isotherm model was found to fit adequately the equilibrium isotherm data. Cadmium adsorption occurs rapidly and the adsorption mechanism is a chemical sorption via ionic exchange between the adsorbate and adsorbent. Thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated from the effect of temperature studies. Regenerability of NaS–OS material was ascertained by quantitative desorption of cadmium with 1 M aqueous NaCl and the reusability of the matrix after five repeated cycles led to nearly no attenuation in its performance (less than 2 % in the sorption capacity), indicating that repeated use of NaS–OS is quite feasible. Compared to other low-cost adsorbents utilized {{for the removal of}} Cd(II) from water/wastewater, NaS–OS shows higher sorption capacity. These results have important implications for the design of low-cost adsorbents based on agricultural wastes...|$|R
40|$|The biosorption {{studies for}} <b>effective</b> removal of <b>cadmium</b> (II) ions from aqueous {{solutions}} using orange rind (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck), cost effective biosorbent, {{was carried out}} in batch system. FTIR analysis of biosorbent confirmed that carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl group which was responsible for biosorption of cadmium (II) ions. The SEM represents porous structure with surface area. The effects of operational factors including solution pH, biosorbent dose, initial cadmium (II) ions concentration, contact time and temperature were studied. The optimum solution pH for cadmium (II) ions biosorption by biosorbent was 7. 0 with the optimal removal 80. 30 %. The biosorbent dose 5 mg/ml was enough for optimal removal of 65. 15 %. The biosorption process was relatively fast and equilibrium was achieved after 90 minutes of contact. The experimental equilibrium biosorption data were analysed by four widely used two-parameters Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Kaganer-Redushkevich (DKR) and Temkin isotherm models. Langmuir isotherm model provided a better fit with the experimental data than Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Kaganer-Redushkevich (DKR) isotherm models by high correlation coefficient value (R 2 = 0. 911). The maximum adsorption capacity determined from Langmuir isotherm was found to be 83. 33 mg/g of biosorbent. Simple kinetic models such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich equation and Weber and Morris intra-particle diffusion rate equation were employed to determine the adsorption mechanism. Results clearly indicates that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R 2 = 0. 998) was found to be correlate the experimental data strongest than other three kinetic models and this suggests that chemical adsorption process was more dominant. Thermodynamic study revealed that the biosorption process was spontaneous, endothermic and increasing randomness of the solid solution interfaces. Orange rind (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) was successfully used for the biosorption studies of cadmium (II) ions from aqueous solutions and can be applied in waste water technology for remediation of heavy metal contamination...|$|R

The adhesion of the coatings was tested in accordance with ASTM D 3359 and the adhesion was found to beAbstract: Zinc-Nickel coatings are effective in providing corrosion protection to ferrous materials. Further, passivation with chromate conversion coating helps to enhance the corrosion resistance. These coatings are being considered as <b>effective</b> replacements for <b>cadmium</b> coating. In the present study an effort {{has been made to}} develop Zn-Ni coating under nearly neutral conditions to minimize the embrittlement effect. The deposition conditions were optimized to obtain Zn-Ni alloy coating with Ni content in the range of 10 - 15 wt. % so as to achieve improved corrosion protection. The coatings were deposited under optimized conditions on a suitably pre-treated stainless steel (SS) substrate so as to obtain a coating of > 4 B. The Zn-Ni coatings were characterized using EDX for the Ni content and FESEM for surface morphology. The nanohardness of the as-deposited coating was observed to be 512 HVN for a load of 25 mN. The roughness of the coating was found to be around 70 nm. The electrochemical corrosion behavior of the coatings was evaluated in 3. 5 % NaCl medium using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The polarization studies showed that the corrosion resistance of baked Zn-Ni coating (icorr 5. 36 µA/cm 2) was better than the as-deposited coating (icorr 23. 8 µA/cm 2). The baked Zn-Ni coating was passivated with chromate (Cr 6 +) conversion coating. The passivated baked Zn-Ni coating showed about five times improved corrosion resistance as compared with unpassivated Zn-Ni coating. Similar observation was also made from electrochemical impedance studies. The long term corrosion behavior of the coatings was evaluated using salt spray test in accordance with ASTM B 117 and the results will be discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Effects of episodic {{exposures}} {{have gained}} attention as the regulatory {{focus of the}} Clean Water Act has shifted away from continuous-flow effluents. Standardized laboratory toxicity tests require that exposure be held constant. However, this approach may not accurately predict organism responses in the field following episodic exposures such as those associated with rain-driven runoff events or accidental pollutant discharge. Using {{a modified version of}} the 7 -day short-term chronic test recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency, Ceriodaphnia dubia were exposed to copper or cadmium for durations ranging from 1 minute to 24 hours. In addition, adult reproductive recovery and effects on second generation individuals was assessed following select copper exposures. Finally, cadmium exposures were compared in reconstituted hard water (RHW) and municipal treated wastewater effluent (TWE). Following exposure, organisms were transferred to clean RHW or TWE and maintained for the remainder of the test. No- and lowest observed effect concentrations (NO- and LOECs) increased logarithmically with respect to logarithmic decreases in duration regardless of metal, endpoint or water type. <b>Effective</b> concentrations of <b>cadmium</b> however, were usually higher than those of copper, especially in TWE. LOECs for C. dubia survival following 24 -hour and 5 -minute exposures to copper were 116 and 417 µg/L, respectively. LOECs for fecundity were 58 and 374 µg/L, respectively. Neonate production of first generation adult C. dubia appeared to recover from pulsed copper exposure upon examination of individual broods. Cumulative mean neonate production however, showed almost no signs of recovery at exposure durations ≥ 3 hours. Pulse exposure to copper also resulted in diminished fecundity of unexposed second generation individuals. Such effects were pronounced following parental exposure for 24 hours but lacking after parental exposures ≤ 3 hours. LOECs for C. dubia survival following 24 -hour and 5 -minute exposures to cadmium in RHW were 44 and 9000 µg/L, respectively. LOECs for fecundity were 16 and 5000 µg/L, respectively. In TWE, LOECs for C. dubia survival were 83 and > 10, 000 µg/L, respectively. LOECs for fecundity in TWE were 48 and 7000 µg/L, respectively. Runoff pollution is site and event specific, however, data presented herein may be useful as a predictive tool under various conditions...|$|R
