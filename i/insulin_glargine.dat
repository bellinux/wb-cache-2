25|$|This is an ultralong-acting insulin {{analogue}} {{developed by}} Novo Nordisk, which markets {{it under the}} brand name Tresiba. It is administered once daily and has a duration of action that lasts up to 40 hours (compared to 18 to 26 hours provided by other marketed long-acting insulins such as <b>insulin</b> <b>glargine</b> and insulin detemir).|$|E
25|$|The {{common side}} effect is low blood sugar. Other side effects may include pain or skin {{changes at the}} sites of injection, low blood potassium, and {{allergic}} reactions. Use during pregnancy is relatively safe for the baby. Insulin {{can be made from}} the pancreas of pigs or cows. Human versions can be made either by modifying pig versions or recombinant technology. It comes in three main types short–acting (such as regular insulin), intermediate–acting (such as NPH insulin), and longer-acting (such as <b>insulin</b> <b>glargine).</b>|$|E
25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous <b>insulin</b> <b>glargine</b> is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} longer-acting <b>insulins,</b> <b>glargine</b> {{must not be}} diluted or mixed with other insulin or {{solution}} in the same syringe. However, this restriction has been questioned.|$|R
50|$|It has an {{intermediate}} duration of action, meaning {{longer than that}} of regular and rapid-acting insulin, and shorter than long acting <b>insulins</b> (ultralente, <b>glargine</b> or detemir).|$|R
50|$|Injections {{of insulin}} may either {{be added to}} oral {{medication}} or used alone. Most people do not initially need insulin. When it is used, a long-acting formulation is typically added at night, with oral medications being continued. Doses are then increased to effect (blood sugar levels being well controlled). When nightly insulin is insufficient, twice daily insulin may achieve better control. The long acting <b>insulins</b> <b>glargine</b> and detemir are equally safe and effective, and do not appear much better than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, but as they are significantly more expensive, they are not cost effective as of 2010. In those who are pregnant insulin is generally the treatment of choice.|$|R
25|$|Several analogs {{of human}} insulin are available. These insulin analogs {{are closely related}} to the human insulin structure, and were {{developed}} for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (<b>insulin</b> <b>glargine).</b> These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.|$|E

40|$|Practical relevance: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a common}} endocrine disorder in feline practice, affecting approximately 1 in 200 cats. The majority of diabetic cats have type 2 diabetes mellitus, which results {{from a combination of}} peripheral insulin resistance and a progressive reduction in insulin production. Clinical challenges: While usually easy to diagnose, management of diabetes mellitus presents a number of challenges for practitioners and clients alike. Practitioners must decide on diet, insulin type and dose, monitoring method and intensity, and concomitant therapy, which will vary based on individual patient and client needs, and geographic location. Practitioners may also encounter patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or other diabetic complications, and patients with multiple concurrent diseases. Clients may be challenged by the substantial time and financial commitment involved in owning a diabetic cat. Audience: Understanding the pathophysiology, optimal treatment protocols and current goals of diabetes management will benefit practitioners managing diabetic cats. This article reviews the most current management plans for feline diabetics. It places particular emphasis on best practice for achieving diabetic remission, which is an attainable goal in the majority of newly diagnosed diabetic cats. Evidence base: The information in this article is drawn from the recent human and veterinary literature, including prospective and retrospective studies.

Modifications of the insulin molecule have resulted in two long-acting <b>insulin</b> analogs (<b>glargine</b> and detemir) and three rapid-acting insulins (aspart, lispro, and glulisine) with improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles. These agents can be used together in basal-bolus therapy to more closely mimic physiologic insulin secretion patterns. Methods: This study reviews effects of the multiple demographic and clinical parameters in the <b>insulin</b> analogs <b>glargine,</b> detemir, lispro, aspart, and glulisine {{in patients with}} T 2 DM. A search was conducted on PubMed for each major topic considered (effects of injection site, age, race/ethnicity, obesity, renal or hepatic dysfunction, pregnancy, exercise, drug interactions) using the topic words and name of each type of insulin analog. Information was also obtained from the prescribing information for each insulin analog. Results: The PK/PD profiles for insulin analogs may be influenced by many variables including age, weight, and hepatic and renal function. However, these variables do not have equivalent effects on all long-acting or rapid-acting insulin analogs. Conclusion: Rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogs represent major advances in treatment for patients with T 2 DM who require insulin therapy. However, there are potentially important PK and PD differences between the two long-acting agents and among the three rapid-acting insulin analogs, which should be considered when designing treatment regimens for special patient groups.

40|$|AIMS: Insulin is {{normally}} added to oral glucose-lowering drugs {{in people with}} type 2 diabetes when glycaemic control becomes suboptimal. We evaluated outcomes in people starting insulin therapy with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), detemir, <b>glargine</b> or premixed <b>insulins.</b> METHODS: Insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes (n = 8009), ≥ 35 years old, HbA(1 c) ≥ 6. 5 % and begun on NPH (n = 1463), detemir (n = 357), glargine (n = 2197) or premix (n = 3992), were identified from a UK database of primary care records (The Health Improvement Network). Unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted analyses were conducted, with persistence of insulin therapy assessed by survival analysis. RESULTS: In the study population (n = 4337), baseline HbA(1 c) was 9. 5 ± 1. 6 %, falling to 8. 4 ± 1. 5 % over 12 months (change - 1. 1 ± 1. 8 %, p < 0. 001). Compared with NPH, people taking detemir, glargine and premix had an adjusted reduction in HbA(1 c) from baseline, of 0. 00 % (p = 0. 99), 0. 19 % (p < 0. 001) and 0. 03 % (p = 0. 51). Body weight increased by 2. 8 kg overall (p < 0. 001), and by 2. 3, 1. 7, 1. 9, and 3. 3 kg on NPH, detemir, glargine and premix (p < 0. 001 for all groups); insulin dose at 12 months was 0. 70 (overall), 0. 64, 0. 61, 0. 56 and 0. 76 U/kg/day. After 36 months, 57 % of people on NPH, 67 % on glargine and 83 % on premix remained on their initially prescribed insulin.
