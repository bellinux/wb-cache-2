The city's telecommunications infrastructure completes more than 70 million Houston telephone connections daily. The Texas Public Utilities Commission has certified more than 400 additional local exchange carriers to provide service statewide or specifically within Houston. More than 1,600 <b>interexchange</b> carriers have registered with the commission to provide long distance service.|$|E

40|$|The {{volatile}} {{constituents of}} rhizomes (main rhizome, lateral parts) of two medicinally used Indonesian plants {{of the family}} Zingiberaceae, Kaempferia rotunda L. and K. angustifolia Roscoe, were investigated by GC and GC-MS (EI) analysis. A total of 75 compounds were identified. The most abundant constituents were benzyl benzoate (69. 7 %, 20. 2 %), n-pentadecane (22. 9 %, 53. 8 %) and camphene (1. 0 %, 6. 2 %) in K. rotunda, and n-pentadecane (17. 8 %, 5. 0 %), camphene (9. 1 %, 12. 4 %), camphor (6. 2 %, 5. 7 %) and bornyl formate (3. 7 %, 16. 3 %) in K. angustifolia. Although both species are known in Java under the same local name (kunci pepet) and probably will be <b>interexchanged,</b> there are some marked phytochemical differences.

40|$|Transformational musical {{theory has}} so far mainly focused {{on the study of}} groups acting on musical chords, {{one of the most famous}} example being the action of the {{dihedral}} group D 24 on the set of major and minor chords. Comparatively less work has been devoted to the study of transformations of time-spans and rhythms. D. Lewin was the first to study group actions on time-spans by using a subgroup of the affine group in one dimension. In our previous work, the work of Lewin has been included in the more general framework of group extensions, and generalizations to time-spans on multiple timelines have been proposed. The goal of this paper is to show that such generalizations have a categorical background in free monoidal categories generated by a group-as-category. In particular, symmetric monoidal categories allow to deal with the possible <b>interexchanges</b> between timelines. We also show that more general time-spans can be considered, in which single time-spans are encapsulated in a "bracket" of time-spans, which allows for the description of complex rhythms.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{semester}} project was to create an Embedded Task Ma-chine. The system would provide a means of executing applications that are too large to fit on the available hardware. Such applications would {{be broken down into}} smaller tasks and a description of how they relate to each other. Synchronous Data Flow is used as the modelling language for the ap-plications. The Embedded Task Machine then executes the tasks one after another on reconfigurable hardware. The system at hand consists of a task repository, a memory management module for the <b>interexchanged</b> data, an execution unit, and a scheduler. This report describes the architecture and the the detailed design of the complete project. Acknowledgment We would like to thank Prof. Lothar Thiele for making it possible for us to work on this interesting project. We also would like to thank our tutor, Matthias Dyer, who supported us on any problems we had and Jan Beutel who helped out when Matthias was not present. We would not have come this far if Roman Plessl would not have taken time for us {{in the last few weeks}} of his Masterâ€™s Thesis. The discussions we had with him about the concepts of his work were very helpful and helped us a lot to start off our project. Last but not least we also would like to thank the rest of the TIK-team for the various small things they did to support us...|$|R

50|$|Each carrier (<b>interexchange</b> {{or local}} exchange) is {{assigned}} a four-digit identification code, the Carrier Identification Code (CIC) {{which was used}} with feature groups. The <b>interexchange</b> carrier to which calls from a subscriber line are routed by default {{is known as the}} Presubscribed <b>Interexchange</b> Carrier (PIC). To give telephone users the possibility of opting for a different carrier on a call-by-call basis, Carrier Access Codes (CAC) were devised. These consist of the digits 101 followed by the four-digit CIC. The CAC is dialed as a prefix immediately before dialing a long-distance phone number.|$|E
50|$|The {{intent was}} that <b>interexchange</b> {{carriers}} could use 700 numbers to implement new services quickly. When a 700 number is dialed, the local exchange carrier processing the call routes {{it to the}} presubscribed <b>interexchange</b> carrier, unless the caller has overridden presubscription by dialing 101XXXX before the number. Thus each <b>interexchange</b> carrier has access to all 7.92 million 700 numbers. 700 numbers are different from all other North American Numbering Plan numbers because the destinations are not unique, and, in fact, depend on the network the caller has selected.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, both <b>interexchange</b> {{carriers}} (IXCs) such as Sprint, AT&T Inc., and Verizon, and Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) such as Verizon and AT&T offer toll-free services. The {{way that}} a toll-free number is handled depends on {{whether it is a}} domestic or an <b>interexchange</b> call. Most countries are divided into regions called exchanges, and within each exchange a local telephone company handles all phone services. Intraexchange calls, which do not leave the individual region, would be managed by the individual local telephone company. Calls that cross U.S. LATA boundaries - or originate in one country and terminate in another - are referred to as <b>interexchange</b> calls.|$|E

50|$|They defined {{switching}} arrangements {{from local}} exchange carriers central offices to <b>interexchange</b> carriers. These arrangements were described {{in an official}} tariff of the National Exchange Carrier Association, filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).|$|E
5000|$|An access {{tandem switch}} connects local {{telephone}} exchanges to long-distance telephone companies (or <b>interexchange</b> carriers, [...] "IXCs"). The {{point at which}} an access tandem connects to the IXC's switch is called the point of presence, or POP.|$|E
50|$|The Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX) was {{an early}} <b>inter{{exchange}}</b> point that allowed the free exchange of TCP/IP traffic, including commercial traffic, between ISPs. It was an important initial effort toward creating the commercial Internet that we know today.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 AT&T {{introduced}} a [...] "follow-me" [...] service under {{the brand name}} of AT&T True Connections using the 500 area code.

50|$|Long {{distance}} carrier-specific: Area code 700 {{is reserved}} for carrier-specific numbers operated by interstate long distance providers, such as AT&T. With the exception of 1-700-555-4141 (which identifies the default <b>interexchange</b> carrier on a line), {{all of these are}} LD carrier-specific. Area code 700 is therefore rarely used.|$|E
50|$|Telecom North America Inc is an <b>interexchange</b> carrier {{licensed}} in {{all states}} of the USA and in all provinces of Canada.

50|$|With Bell System divestiture, {{the network}} in the US was divided into local access and {{transport}} areas (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by Local Exchange Carriers (LECs), while calls between them were carried by <b>interexchange</b> carriers (IXCs). LATAs generally have one or more tandem switches which interconnect end office switches.|$|E
5000|$|The {{services}} {{debuted in}} the late 1990s, originally as 10-321 (and its numerous variants) before the telephone industry expanded carrier access codes to seven digits instead of the original five.

50|$|In the United States, {{wireline}} {{telephone companies}} {{are divided into}} two large categories: long distance (<b>interexchange</b> carrier, or IXCs) and local (local exchange carrier, or LECs).
