Using beamforming along <b>with</b> space-time (<b>ST)</b> <b>coding</b> {{at the source}} and the relay of a cooperative relay network allows achieving both diversity gain and array gain. In this paper we propose novel distributed beamforming techniques for a space-time (<b>ST)</b> <b>coded</b> dual-hop cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) decode-and-forward (DF) relay network to minimize the pair-wise error probability (PEP), while maintaining the SNR at the relay node above a given threshold. Beamforming techniques for the availability of full-instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) as well as statistical CSIT are proposed. The source and the relay compute their own beamforming matrices based only its own CSIT subject to individual power constraints at each node. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed beamforming techniques offer a significant performance enhancement over the performance of a relay network using <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> only.

This paper proposes a new receiver algorithm for differential <b>ST</b> <b>coded</b> transmissions over the finite-impulse-response (FIR) rich multipath fading channels. The symbol detection introduced in this paper is a deterministic subspace-based approach in a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system framework. The receiver (i) operates in a blind fashion without estimating the channel or its inverse and (ii) is {{able to work with}} a small number of signal samples and hence can be applied in the quasistatic channels. The proposed scheme employs multiple antennas at both sides of the transceiver and exploits both the antenna diversity and the multiple constant modulus (MCM) characteristics of the signaling. The receiver is able to blindly mitigate the intersymbol interference (ISI) in a rich multipath propagation environment, and this has been verified through the extensive Monte Carlo simulations.|$|R

This combination takes advantages from multicarrier modulation, spread spectrum and spatial time diversity. Indeed, theuse of OFDM has proved its ability to fight against frequency selective channels but the insertion of guard interval yields spectral efficiency loss and sensitivity to frequency dispersion due {{to the use of}} rectangular pulse shape. Thus, cyclic prefix OFDM is replaced by an advanced ﬁlterbank-based multicarrier system OFDM/OQAM that operates without guard interval. However, OFDM/OQAM provides orthogonality only on the real domain, so transmitted symbols must be real valued. In the other hand, the CDMA component has two advantages: multiple access interference cancellation and providing orthogonality in the complex domain. From the orthogonality property provided, the Alamouti <b>ST</b> <b>code</b> can be combined with MC-CDMA-OQAM system.

40|$|Since the mid 1990 ’s, the {{wireless}} communications industry has witnessed explosive growth. The worldwide cellular and personal communication subscriber base surpassed 600 million users by late 2001, {{and the number}} of individual subscribers surpassed 2 billion at the end of 2006 [1, 2]. In order to attract and accommodate these subscribers, modern communication systems, like the Third Generation (3 G) and Fourth Generation (4 G) cellular networks, will have to provide attractive new features such as increased data throughput rates, greater system capacity, and better speech quality. These modern communication systems promise to have advantages such as wireless access in ways that have never been possible before, providing, amongst others services such as live television (TV) broadcasting to Mobile Stations (MS) s, multi-megabit Internet access, communication using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), unparalleled network capacity, seamless accessibility and many more. With specific, but not exclusive reference to the cellular environment, there are numerous ways to increase the data throughput rate and system capacity. From an economical perspective, it would be more efficient to add equipment to the Base Station (BS) rather than the MSs. To achieve these improvements the motivation to utilise transmit diversity’s capabilities have been identified as a key research issue in this study. Alamouti [3] proposed a transmit diversity technique using two transmit antennas and one receive antenna, providing the same diversity order than using one transmit antenna and two receive antennas. Since Alamouti’s publication in 1998, many papers in the field of Space-Time (<b>ST)</b> <b>coding</b> have been published. Current research in the field of <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> consists of finding methods to extend the number of transmit antennas to more than four, while still achieving full rate, as well as full diversity which is the main motivation for this study. This study proposes a novel idea of breaching the limitations <b>with</b> <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> theory by combining <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> <b>with</b> Spread Spectrum (SS) modulation techniques in order to extend the number of transmit antennas to more than four and still achieve full rate as well as full diversity. An advantage of the proposed scheme, called Direct Sequence Space-Time Spreading (DSSTS) has over current Space-Time Spreading (STS) techniques is that it uses 50 % less spreading codes. A performance evaluation platform for the DSSTS scheme was developed to simulate the performance of the scheme in a realistic mobile communication environment. A mobile communication channel that has the ability to simulate time-varying multipath fading was developed and used to evaluate the performance of the DSSTS scheme. From the simulation results obtained, it is evident that Walsh sequences that exhibit particularly good cross-correlation characteristics, cannot overcome the effect of the antenna self-noise in order to exploit the diversity gain by adding extra antennas, i. e. diversity extension. The research also showed that an optimal trade-off exists between antenna diversity and antenna created self-noise. Performance results of the DSSTS scheme in slow and fast fading channels for a different number of transmit antennas are also presented in this study. With the capacity analysis of the DSSTS scheme, it was shown that the addition of extra transmit antennas to the system indeed increased the system capacity. A further addition to this study is the investigation into the assumption that the channel should be quasi-static over the frame length of the <b>ST</b> <b>code.</b> A Space Sequence Transmit Diversity (SSTD) technique is consequently proposed that allows the transmission of the Alamouti symbols during one time interval instead of two. This relieves the <b>ST</b> <b>code</b> from the assumption that the channel should be quasi-static, allowing it to be used in a more realistic multi-user environment. A performance evaluation platform for the SSTD scheme was developed and used to obtain simulation results in a multipath fading channel. It was also shown that the proposed SSTD scheme is successful in combating the effects of multipath fading for small Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) user loads. However, as a rule of thumb, the square root of the spreading sequence length divided by two depicts the user load at which the SSTD scheme was not capable of overcoming the combined effects of Multi-User Interference (MUI) and multipath fading.

In order to cope with these diverse challenges, advanced technical innovations are required. Recently, space-time (<b>ST)</b> <b>coding</b> has been proposed {{as one of the}} most attractive techniques for high data-rate transmissions in wireless communications. In this thesis, we propose effective <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> solutions for high data-rate wireless communications over space and frequency selective fading channels. At first, a concatenated <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is proposed for flat fading links, followed by the performance analysis, which leads to establishing the design criteria of optimal trellis codes. Based on these design criteria, optimal trellis codes are constructed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed concatenated <b>ST</b> <b>codes</b> outperform <b>ST</b> trellis <b>codes</b> under the same spectral efficiency, trellis complexity, and signal constellation. Performance evaluation of <b>ST</b> <b>coding</b> has mainly been done over flat Rayleigh fading channels. By studying the effects of time delay spread, we derive performance criteria of <b>ST</b> <b>codes</b> over unequalized frequency selective fading channels. It is shown that the diversity order is retained in the presence of multipath, but the coding gain is reduced due to the destructive effects of multipath fading. In order to support high-speed <b>ST</b> <b>coded</b> transmissions, the detrimental influence of frequency selective fading must be mitigated. An efficient space-frequency (SF) coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is proposed as a solution. The design criteria of trellis codes used in such SF OFDM system are derived and discussed. It is shown that the proposed SF codes with low trellis complexity can easily exploit the full diversity order provided by the fading channel. This is in contrast to the traditional SF coded OFDM systems where we have to design complicated <b>ST</b> trellis <b>codes</b> to achieve the same goal.
