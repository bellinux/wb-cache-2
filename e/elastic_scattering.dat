25|$|In the <b>elastic</b> <b>scattering</b> interaction, a {{neutrino}} collides with {{an atomic}} electron and imparts {{some of its}} energy to the electron. All three neutrinos can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral Z boson, and electron neutrinos can also participate with the exchange of a charged W boson. For this reason this interaction is dominated by electron neutrinos, {{and this is the}} channel through which the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of billiards, and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.|$|E
25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by <b>elastic</b> <b>scattering.</b> They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E
25|$|Refractive {{processes}} {{take place}} in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type of scattering is Thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, <b>elastic</b> <b>scattering</b> of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie scattering with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering, wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.|$|E

25|$|When {{the primary}} {{electron}} beam {{interacts with the}} sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by <b>elastic</b> <b>scattering,</b> emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E

500|$|Each X-ray {{diffraction}} image {{represents only}} a slice, a spherical slice of reciprocal space, {{as may be}} seen by the Ewald sphere construction. Both kout and kin have the same length, due to the <b>elastic</b> <b>scattering,</b> since the wavelength has not changed. Therefore, they may be represented as two radial vectors in a sphere in reciprocal space, which shows the values of q that are sampled in a given diffraction image. Since there is a slight spread in the incoming wavelengths of the incoming X-ray beam, the values of|F(q)|can be measured only for q vectors located between the two spheres corresponding to those radii. Therefore, to obtain a full set of Fourier transform data, it is necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than 180°, or sometimes less if sufficient symmetry is present. A full 360° rotation is not needed because of a symmetry intrinsic to the Fourier transforms of real functions (such as the electron density), but [...] "slightly more" [...] than 180° is needed to cover all of reciprocal space within a given resolution because of the curvature of the Ewald sphere. In practice, the crystal is rocked by a small amount (0.25-1°) to incorporate reflections near the boundaries of the spherical Ewald's shells.|$|E

Forty cervical samples from women with abnormal Pap smear test results were collected, and twenty cases were diagnosed as HSIL; the rest were normal or low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). The enlarged and condensed nuclei of HSIL cells as viewed under CLASS microscopy were much brighter and bigger than those of non-HSIL cells.

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to design an active neutron interrogation system to search for conventional explosives. The work began with {{a review of the}} current methods for explosives detection, with a particular focus on active neutron interrogation. The next step was to design a layered shield for an isotopic neutron generator that limited the influence of unattenuated neutrons at undesirable angles. The final shielding design was then adapted for neutron and gamma ray detector collimation in an active neutron interrogation system, and a modular shielding arrangement was proposed. Focus then shifted to improving the flexibility of the active neutron interrogation system via introduction of a method to reliably vary the energy from nearly monoenergetic sealed-tube deuterium-deuterium or deuterium-tritium neutron generators. This was accomplished through single neutron <b>elastic</b> <b>scatter</b> off a target of known composition, resulting in neutrons with predictable energies that can be adjusted through manipulation of the interrogation target location relative to the scatter target and neutron generator. This neutron <b>elastic</b> <b>scatter</b> system was optimized through the adoption of a neutron time-of-flight (TOF) method, where the hydrogen nuclei in the start detector (scatter target) also served as the scattering medium, signaling neutron scatter and allowing for discrimination of neutrons that did not interact in the scatter target. Laboratory measurements and simulations were performed to characterize the new variable energy neutron <b>elastic</b> <b>scatter</b> (VENES) system and evaluate its effectiveness in performing fast neutron resonance radiography. Preliminary investigations on the application of VENES to fast neutron analysis and neutron backscatter were also conducted to direct future work. There was a particular interest in combining all three active neutron interrogation methods with the VENES system and proposed shield designs, allowing for investigations across multiple different neutron energies in the MeV range. The VENES system permits for reliable alteration of neutron energy in active interrogation systems, using relatively cheap, portable, and easily operated components that are either currently, or soon-to-be, commercially available. The improvements on current active neutron interrogation sources should result in its eventual adoption to a variety of applications...|$|R
