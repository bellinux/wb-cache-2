5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

5|$|In Karhide, {{the king}} is {{reluctant}} to accept his diplomatic mission. In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously.

5|$|The final mask to {{be gained}} in the game is the Fierce Deity's Mask.

Upon donning this mask, Link grows to nearly two-and-a-half times his normal height. <b>His</b> <b>clothes</b> turn white and his face appears with a type of war paint on it.

5|$|The woman's {{arms were}} {{swinging}} by her side, untied, while about {{twenty feet away}} swung the boy with <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> partly torn off and his hands tided with a saddle string. The only marks on either body were that made by the ropes upon the necks. Gently swaying in the wind, the ghastly spectacle was discovered this morning by a negro boy taking his cow to water.

5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded <b>his</b> <b>clothes.</b> There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return.

5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in additional casualties. In order to prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the crash site with napalm two days later, reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames. The pilots observed that his body looked to have been disturbed and <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> stolen, but he was still stuck in the aircraft. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war.|$|E

Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. <b>His</b> <b>clothes</b> and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him look}} younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier to}} draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
