The best strategy is to {{ask a lot of questions}} to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{when you}} {{purchase}} {{a book from}} an online bookstore, you exchange money (in the form of credit) for a book.

Transactions <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> data-oriented resources are not permanently updated unless all operations within the transactional unit complete successfully.
