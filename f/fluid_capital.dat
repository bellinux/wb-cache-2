50|$|Once {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} mid-century Taiping Rebellion died down, the economy came to depend on opium to play several roles. Merchants found the {{substance}} useful {{as a substitute for}} cash, as it was readily accepted in the interior provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan while the drug weighed less than the equivalent amount of copper. Since poppies could be grown in almost any soil or weather, cultivation quickly spread. Local officials could then meet their tax quotas by relying on poppy growers even in areas where other crops had not recovered. Although the government continued to require suppression, local officials often merely went through the motions both because of bribery and because they wanted to avoid antagonizing local farmers who depended on this lucrative crop. One official complained that when people heard a government inspector was coming, they would merely pull up a few poppy stalks to spread {{by the side of the}} road to give the appearance of complying. A provincial governor observed that opium, once regarded as a poison, was now treated in the same way as tea or rice. By the 1880s, even governors who had initially suppressed opium smoking and poppy production now depended on opium taxes. The historian Jonathan Spence notes that the harm opium caused has long been clear, but that in a stagnating economy, opium supplied <b>fluid</b> <b>capital</b> and created new sources of taxes. Smugglers, poor farmers, coolies, retail merchants and officials all depended on opium for their livelihood. In the last decade of the dynasty, however, a focused moral outrage overcame these vested interests.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a simple and}} practical framework for characterizing (long-run) economic growth and <b>fluid</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation under shifting technological change. The framework specifies a technological change that depends on exogenous and endogenous factors {{as well as the}} interaction between the two sets of factors, and therefore allows for the evaluation of the (a) output/capital ratio via capital stock (balance sheet) adjustments and intensities, (b) value added stream of income via changes in cash flows (income statements) at some rates of change constrained to be compatible with (c) financial economics of the feasible accumulation of capital investment (sources and uses of funds statement). The model is simple - it is only a single-equation reduced form of a transcendental production function - yet one which can be estimated either as (1) a single equation, (2) three single equations, or (3) a system of three seemingly unrelated equations. economic growth and <b>fluid</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation, economic growth under shifting technological change,growth models...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the term ‘terraqueous territoriality’ to analyse a particular relationship between capitalism {{as a social}} formation, and the sea as a natural force. It focuses on three spaces – exclusive economic zones (EEZs), the system of ‘flags of convenience’ (FOC), and multilateral counter-piracy initiatives – as instances of capitalist states and firms seeking to transcend the geo-physical difference between firm land and <b>fluid</b> sea. <b>Capital</b> accumulation, it is argued here, seeks to territorialise the sea through forms of sovereignty and modes of appropriation drawn from experiences on land, but in doing so encounters particular tensions thereby generating distinctive spatial effects. By exploring the articulation between sovereignty, territory and appropriation in the organisation of spaces where land meets sea, the article seeks to demonstrate {{the value of an}} analytical framework that underlines the terraqueous nature of contemporary capitalism...|$|R
5000|$|Overseas Chinese {{businesses}} in Southeast Asia are usually family owned and managed through a centralized bureaucracy. These firms are typically small and medium sized businesses rather than large conglomerates typically dominant in other East Asian {{countries such as}} Japan and South Korea. Trade and financing is guided by family ties and personal relationships are prioritized over formal relationships. This promotes commercial communication and more <b>fluid</b> transfer of <b>capital</b> {{in a region where}} financial regulation and rule of law remain largely undeveloped in Southeast Asia. [...] These relationships are based on the Confucian paradigm of guanxi, the Chinese term for the cultivation of personal relationships as an ingredient for business success.|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} reasons why labor {{mobility}} matters for productivity and growth. A country with a more mobile labor force uses available resources more effectively and {{is more likely to}} better match its human capital to other factors—both those that are more <b>fluid</b> such as <b>capital,</b> and those that do not move at all such as land. Recent work indicates that labor mobility is critical for social cohesion and the improvement of welfare in lagging regions 15. When people move, they create links between places where economic activity is densely concentrated and those where it is not. These links become channels for resources that flow back to peoples’ places of origin in the form of knowhow and remittances, that sustain the welfare of family members left behind and lead to investments in locally appropriate enterprises. Through these channels, increased labor mobility also contributes to economic convergence within countries, between leading and lagging regions, but also between countries, helping the new member states to achieve the living standards of the older member states. A mobile labor force can better adjust to shocks, and recover more quickly. Given its demographic outlook and the decline in the working-age population, increased labor mobility will be needed in Europe. And {{there is a lot of}} room for it.|$|R
40|$|The {{introductory}} {{parts of}} the paper analyse development of a local variety of capitalism in Slovakia from the institutional and evolutionary perspective. In early transition period privatisation policies were aimed at development of a liberal version of capitalism, based on <b>fluid</b> <b>capital</b> markets. These policies were confronted with institutional legacies of previous regimes. Privatisation, however, had major impact on structure of capital ownership and management. Next chapters compare contemporary Slovak capitalism with varieties found in other OECD economies. Major elements of institutional framework (labour market, business and financial environments) are subject to factor analysis. OECD member countries are compared via index of market coordination. Slovakia {{appears to be a}} market economy with middle levels of strategic market coordination and similar to Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Reliance on bank finance and dual economy are another distinctive features of the contemporary Slovak capitalism. varieties of capitalisms, Slovakia, institutional and evolutionary economics, path-dependence...|$|E
40|$|A brief library search {{will reveal}} some 3000 - 4000 titles on the Norwegian {{petroleum}} economy, not counting journal articles. Arguably, {{there is a}} need and an opportunity to make sense of this material, and arguably the framework pioneered by, among others, Peter Soskice and David Hall could provide a tool. Capitalism, we learn, comes in two flavours: liberal and coordinated market economies. 1 The liberal version is dominant in the Anglo-Saxon world, the coordinated version in e. g. the Scandinavian countries, Germany and Japan. The first relies mostly on markets for the allocation of labour and capital, the second on negotiation, consensus and coordination among participant firms. The first kind is frequently credited with an ability for rapid response, the second for long-termism. Each generates wealth, but the strengths of one cannot easily be combined with the strengths of the other: since each is supported by a set of complementary institutions that serve to reinforce each other. For example, a <b>fluid</b> <b>capital</b> market may not easily coexist with inflexible labour markets. While attempting to keep the framework of Hall and Soskice in mind, I nevertheless feel resigned to rely on a somewhat different and, as for the Norwegian oil economy, better explored approach: portraits of an oil-industrial complex. 2 In this setting, the term was coine...|$|E
40|$|O cooperativismo possui grande relevância para a economia brasileira, na medida em que atua apoiando o desenvolvimento econômico e social, principalmente das pequenas propriedades rurais. As cooperativas agropecuárias atuam no fomento e na comercialização dos produtos agrícolas, {{inclusive}} implantando novos cultivos e agregando valor aos produtos por meio de complexos agroindustriais. O crescimento dessas organizações, sobretudo pela verticalização de suas operações, tem exigido a busca de fontes de capital para financiar as necessidades líquidas de capital de giro dos seus negócios. Decisões sobre financiamento afetam diretamente a saúde financeira das organizações, à medida que produzem um risco financeiro maior. Portanto é relevante uma investigação sobre as fontes de financiamento das necessidades líquidas de capital de giro para as cooperativas agropecuárias, sendo este o objetivo primordial do artigo.

The farming cooperatives work on the processing and commercialization of agricultural products, including implanting new kinds of crops and aggregating value to the products through agroindustrial complexes. The growth of these organizations, mainly through verticalization of its operations, has required the quest for capital founts to finance the needs for fluent capital in their business.

40|$|Context: The {{diagnosis}} of metastatic cancer in <b>fluids</b> is of <b>capital</b> importance as, in most such instances, a rapid fatal {{outcome of the}} disease is anticipated. Aim: To determine the spectrum and cytomorphological features of the common and unusual malignancies presenting with effusions. Methods and Materials : A total of 11, 562 effusion samples received for cytopathological examination over a 10 -year period were analyzed retrospectively. Cytomorphological features of neoplastic effusions were studied. Special stains and immunocytochemistry (ICC) were performed to aid the diagnosis in difficult cases. Observations : The effusion samples comprised of pleural (5018), peritoneal (6340) and pericardial (204) fluids. A definitive {{diagnosis of}} classifiable malignancy could be given in 836 (7. 3 %) of these cases (5. 7 % adenocarcinomas and 1. 6 % uncommon malignancies). Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent cause of malignant pleural (70 %) and peritoneal effusions (86. 9 %). The most common primary site for pleural metastasis was lung (35. 7 %), while for peritoneal metastasis, it was the ovary (54. 3 %). Among the uncommon neoplastic effusions, hematopoeitic malignancies were the most frequent, followed by squamous cell carcinomas. Primary malignant mesotheliomas were the most challenging to diagnose on effusion cytology. ICC was useful {{to arrive at a}} definitive diagnosis in difficult cases. Conclusions: Cytology is a useful tool to detect malignant effusions. However, in uncommon malignancies presenting as effusions, a detailed clinical history and ancillary investigations are often required to make a correct diagnosis...|$|R
30|$|Porter (2000) {{proposition}} that a locations prosperity and productivity does not only {{depend on the}} competition in industries, but more on “how”. This brings to forefront the strategic role of human capital and group dynamics prevalent in such locations. The organizational behavior framework bears positive or {{negative effect on the}} totality of business enterprises in the locations. SMEs face a rather peculiar human capital management, which are usually not well structured in most enterprises. These enterprises attract the type of labor they can afford and the fact that most SMEs business are owned and managed by family members poses grave hindrances to professional management. Hence, SMEs are prone to mistakes in decision-making, <b>fluid</b> participation, human <b>capital</b> management issues. Renaissance capital thematic research report (2013) shows that Lagos is the smallest state in Nigeria (Aliu & Ajala, 2014) and “its population density is equivalent to that of the fifth most densely populated country in the world, and half that of Hong Kong (6800 people per km 2) (capital, 2013)”. Population size has a corresponding correlation with the level of informality, economic productivity and growth. We note that Lagos state population is 18 % higher than that of Zhenjiang but Zhenjiang’s GDP is 58 % that of Lagos state with a much lower population. One major reason for the low productivity of Lagos populations (17.5 million) may be traced to high unemployment rate and huge presence of informal sector participants of 2, 307, 281 persons representing 13 % of the population, national unemployment rate was 21.1 % of labor force in 2010 (National household and informal sector survey, 2010). Harnessing the latent economic capability of the informal sector in Lagos remains a task for policy makers and Lagos State’s current resident registration scheme will help capture the true size of its inhabitants and economic planning. The Government collaborative partnership and recognition of informal trade associations and groups is yielding positive economic benefits with various grassroots capacity training and skill development opportunities aimed at fusing the informal-formal economy continuum (Meagher, 2013; Onokala & Banwo, 2015).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Nanofluid, {{which was}} first {{discovered}} by the Argonne laboratory, is a nanotechnology- based heat transfer fluid. This fluid consists of particles which are suspended inside conventional heat transfer liquid or base fluid. The purpose of this suspension is for enhancing thermal conductivity and convective heat transfer performance of this base fluid. The name nanofluid came about {{as a result of}} the nanometer- sized particles of typical length scales 1 - 100 nm which are stably suspended inside of the base fluids. These nanoparticles are of both physical and chemical classes and are also produced by either the physical process or the chemical process. Nanofluid has been discovered to be the best option towards accomplishing the enhancement of heat transfer through fluids in different unlimited conditions as well as reduction in the thermal resistance by heat transfer liquids. Various manufacturing industries and engineering processes such as transportation, electronics, food, medical, textile, oil and gas, chemical, drinks e. t. c, now aim at the use of this heat transfer enhancement fluid. Advantages such organisations can obtain from this <b>fluid</b> includes, reduced <b>capital</b> cost, reduction in size of heat transfer system and improvement of energy efficiencies. This research has been able to solve numerically, using Maple 12 which uses a fourth- fifth order Runge -kutta- Fehlberg algorithm alongside shooting method, a set of nonlinear coupled differential equations together with their boundary conditions, thereby modelling the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the boundary layer flow of the nanofluids. Important properties of these nanofluids which were considered are viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, specific heat and heat transfer coefficients and microstructures (particle shape, volume concentration, particle size, distribution of particle, component properties and matrixparticle interface). Basic fluid dynamics equations such as the continuity equation, linear momentum equation, energy equation and chemical species concentration equations have also been employed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{developing}} a comprehensive study of what {{is involved in the}} desalination of oil field produced brine and the technical developments and regulatory changes needed to make the concept a commercial reality. It was originally based on ''conventional'' produced water treatment and reviewed (1) the basics of produced water management, (2) the potential for desalination of produced brine {{in order to make the}} resource more useful and available in areas of limited fresh water availability, and (3) the potential beneficial uses of produced water for other than oil production operations. Since we have begun however, a new area of interest has appeared that of brine water treatment at the well site. Details are discussed in this technical progress report. One way to reduce the impact of O&G operations is to treat produced brine by desalination. The main body of the report contains information showing where oil field brine is produced, its composition, and the volume available for treatment and desalination. This collection of information all relates to what the oil and gas industry refers to as ''produced water management''. It is a critical issue for the industry as produced water accounts for more than 80 % of all the byproducts produced in oil and gas exploration and production. The expense of handling unwanted waste <b>fluids</b> draws scarce <b>capital</b> away for the development of new petroleum resources, decreases the economic lifetimes of existing oil and gas reservoirs, and makes environmental compliance more expensive to achieve. More than 200 million barrels of produced water are generated worldwide each day; this adds up to more than 75 billion barrels per year. For the United States, the American Petroleum Institute estimated about 18 billion barrels per year were generated from onshore wells in 1995, and similar volumes are generated today. Offshore wells in the United States generate several hundred million barrels of produced water per year. Internationally, three barrels of water are produced for each barrel of oil. Production in the United States is more mature; the US average is about 7 barrels of water per barrel of oil. Closer to home, in Texas the Permian Basin produces more than 9 barrels of water per barrel of oil and represents more than 400 million gallons of water per day processed and re-injected...|$|R
