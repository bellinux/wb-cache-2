The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by <b>felt</b> <b>carpet</b> and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
6000|$|Usually, {{however, the}} peasants of the South have {{left off the}} costume. Usually it is the {{invisible}} soldiers' grey-green cloth, the Italian khaki. Wherever you go, wherever you be, you see this khaki, this grey-green war-clothing. How many millions of yards of the thick, excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a <b>felt</b> <b>carpet,</b> I should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh democracy! Oh khaki democracy! ...|$|E

It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high-panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plaster-work, and its brickdust <b>felt</b> <b>carpet</b> strewn with silk long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of [...] "Les Cent Nouvelles," [...] bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve, and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantel-shelf, and through the small leaded panels of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London.|$|E

Guangde asked to submit. He sent his Heir Apparent as a hostage {{and promised to}} give <b>felt</b> <b>carpets</b> each year.

However, it depicts several Kyrgyz customs - including the ceremony of placing a baby in a cradle (biseke salu), the funerary ceremony and the engagement ceremony. The ceremonies depict several ethnic Kyrgyz artifacts, like the tekemet rugs of the region, the kigiz <b>felt</b> <b>carpets</b> and the Kyrgyz cradle or besik.|$|R

A floor is covered with felt and there is placed a <b>felt</b> <b>carpet</b> over it. The man's half of the yurt is on the left hand of the entrance. The interior of the yurt has a rich color scheme. The furniture and wooden structures are painted red or orange and ornamented. The entrance of the yurt overlooks south. Proportions of the yurt recreate the model of a sundial. An exact time of day is defined according to a place of solar beam falling in the yurt. The internal yurt layout is divided conditionally into 12 parts according to the cycle of calendar chronology. The parts are named after months of east calendar. The yurt was received as a gift of the Governor of the Kemerovo region A. G. Tuleev in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The {{rebellion}} was {{crippled by}} {{early detection and}} timid leadership. Kublai sent Bayan to keep Nayan and Kaidu apart by occupying Karakorum, while Kublai led another army against the rebels in Manchuria. Kublai's commander Oz Temür's Mongol force attacked Nayan's 60,000 inexperienced soldiers on June 14, while Chinese and Alan guards under Li Ting protected Kublai. The army of Chungnyeol of Goryeo assisted Kublai in battle. After a hard fight, Nayan's troops withdrew behind their carts, and Li Ting began bombardment and attacked Nayan's camp that night. Kublai's force pursued Nayan, who was eventually captured and executed without bloodshed, by being smothered under <b>felt</b> <b>carpets,</b> a traditional way of executing princes. Meanwhile, the rebel prince Shikqtur invaded the Chinese district of Liaoning but was defeated within a month. Kaidu withdrew westward to avoid a battle. However, Kaidu defeated a major Yuan army in the Khangai Mountains and briefly occupied Karakorum in 1289. Kaidu had ridden away before Kublai could mobilize a larger army.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} corpse, the burial {{chambers}} also contained grave goods, whose richness could vary dramatically. Ordinary mounted warriors were buried with a fully equipped horse and weapons, women were buried with a horse, {{a knife and}} a mirror. The burials of higher ranking people were much richer. These could include up to twentyfive richly outfitted horses and an elaborate chariot; the actual burial chamber was built from wooden planks (often larch). The corpse, {{with a woman who}} probably accompanied him in death, lay, clothed, in a long treetrunk coffin. In Noin Ula in Monolia, a woman's braids were interred instead of the woman herself. Outstanding examples of kurgans include the necropoleis of Pazyryk in Altai, Noin Ula in Mongolia, and Arzhan in Tuva, where organic matter was preserved by the permafrost. Thus, <b>felt</b> <b>carpets</b> which decorated the inner walls of the burial chamber, decorated sadels and various kinds of clothing were also found. Although many large kurgans have been robbed of their contents by grave robbers, exceptional examples still remain, including countless gold objects.|$|R

40|$|Felt is {{considered}} mankind 2 ̆ 7 s oldest textile. Created of wool or hair through pressure and shocking, {{and the application}} of heat and cold, felt is a warm, sturdy fabric used for shelter, clothing, carpets, saddles, and bags or container covers. Feltmaking is a world-wide tradition {{in the sense that it}} is practiced in such disparate regions as Mongolia, Central Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. In the souk in Marrakech, Morocco, a two-sided prayer rug is created, one side white and one side grey, using the natural color of the fleece. The process involves the addition of soap which acts as a binding agent during the felting process. Rolling and pressure cause the fibers to bind together forming a flat, finished mat. In Central Asia and the Middle East, the biblical bow and mallet is employed to break up the fiber into a cloud-like mass which is laid on a dampened canvas in a given shape. The feltmakers in this area create inlaid coats and carpets for local consumption. Once a coat has been partially felted, it is folded over, and the softly rolled fleece is applied to the surface in a given design. The laminating process continues in order to felt in the yarn design and to shape the coat. The finished garment has closed sleeves which act like mittens. In Afghanistan, where the carpet designs are very intricate, the dyed fleece is laid in a given pattern on a reed mat and the plain black fleece backing is then laid on top. The entire mass of wool is rolled up in the mat and a canvas and felted through continuous rolling and pressure. In Aqsha, an Afgan town very near the Russian border, a carpet market takes place every week, featuring pile carpets and 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 or <b>felt</b> <b>carpets.</b> This is my carpet which took me 7 hours to buy.

I wonder how many Hopi and Pueblo 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 are being created in Aqsha today?!...|$|R

He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The {{use of these}} materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials {{in such a way}} that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and <b>carpet</b> <b>felt</b> in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.|$|R
5000|$|Dickson {{is known}} for her dark iconic images that examine [...] "the {{constructed}} world, and its psychological freight, the social structuring of desire and its disruption by the uncanny". Deploying unusual materials such as AstroTurf, vinyl, sandpaper, <b>felt</b> and <b>carpet,</b> which resonate with their particular subject, Dickson's paintings express her [...] "fascination {{with the power of}} artificial light, as well as...surreal and sexually transgressive environments". Often depicting the spectacle in her work, her subjects include Times Square (where she lived and/or worked from 1978-2008), demolition derbies, carnivals, suburban homes, and highways, among others. [...] In addition to her large body of paintings, the artist organized “Messages to the Public”, a Public Art Fund series which presented monthly artists’ projects created for Spectacolor’s 1 Times Square Billboard. The project ran from 1982 to 1990 and the artists presented include Keith Haring and Jenny Holzer. In her most recent contribution to Times Square, Dickson designed 67 mosaics of New Year's Eve revelers that were installed within the Port Authority 42nd Street and Times Square subway stations. Commissioned by the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) in 2008, the mosaics are composed of Murano glass, and as art historian Janetta Rebold Benton describes, the figures with their party hats and horns [...] "seem able to elevate the moods of the actual people who hurry along the corridor." ...|$|R
