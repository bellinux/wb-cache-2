40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between financing constraints and investment-cash flow sensitivities by focusing on cash holdings of firms as the basic classification scheme to separate firms into financially constrained and unconstrained categories. The idea is that high cash reserves increase the ability of firms to undertake profitable investment opportunities. Our classification scheme {{is based on an}} optimal cash model, which helps us identify the firms that deviate significantly from their target cash ratio. We conduct the analysis for an emerging market, just before and during a financial crisis to test the hypothesis that the hedging role of cash is more critical in states of the world characterized by high asymmetric information and excessive costs of external finance. The results are in line with our expectations and show that constrained firms exhibit greater investment to cash flow sensitivities than unconstrained firms. Also, there is strong evidence that <b>cash</b> <b>stands</b> as an effective device for firms mainly, during the crisis period.

40|$|Background Many {{governments have}} {{implemented}} {{conditional cash transfer}} (CCT) programmes {{with the goal of}} improving options for poor families through interventions in health, nutrition, and education. Families enrolled in CCT programmes receive cash in exchange for complying with certain conditions: preventive health requirements and nutrition supplementation, education, and monitoring designed to improve health outcomes and promote positive behaviour change. Our aim was to disaggregate the eff ects of cash transfer from those of other programme components. Methods In an intervention that began in 1998 in Mexico, low-income communities (n= 506) were randomly assigned to be enrolled in a CCT programme (Oportunidades, formerly Progresa) immediately or 18 months later. In 2003, children (n= 2449) aged 24 – 68 months who had been enrolled in the programme their entire lives were assessed {{for a wide variety of}} outcomes. We used linear and logistic regression to determine the eff ect size for each outcome that is associated with a <b>doubling</b> of <b>cash</b> transfers while controlling for a wide range of covariates, including measures of household socioeconomic status. Findings A <b>doubling</b> of <b>cash</b> transfers was associated with higher height-for-age Z score (β 0 · 20, 95 % CI 0 · 09 – 0 · 30; p< 0 · 0001), lower prevalence of stunting (– 0 · 10, – 0 · 16 to – 0 · 05; p< 0 · 0001), lower body-mass index for age percentile (– 2 · 85, – 5 · 54 to – 0 · 15; p= 0 · 04), and lower prevalence of being overweight (– 0 · 08, – 0 · 13 to – 0 · 03; p= 0 · 001). A <b>doubling</b> of <b>cash</b> transfers was also associated with children doing better on a scale of motor development, three scales of cognitive development, and with receptive language. Interpretation Our results suggest that the cash transfer component of Oportunidades is associated with better outcomes in child health, growth, and development...|$|R
40|$|Adaptation {{dynamics}} of communities to environmental change, such as rainfall, forest stocks, fish stocks and flooding, have {{a multitude of}} consequences for livelihood choices, poverty and natural resource use. Emerging properties of such household level behaviour are analysed {{in the context of}} energy related policy changes in an agent-based model implemented in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The underlying hypothesis is that complex systems modelling can help decision makers to better understand the responses of a socio-ecological system to macro-policy changes, for example fuel subsidy reductions. The participatory model development process revealed that many decision makers implied linear responses of poverty indicators to policy interventions (“if we <b>double</b> <b>cash</b> payments we can double our impact on poverty”). The agent-based model offered the opportunity to consider feedbacks created by interactions in the socio-ecological system. Model results indicate that poverty responses to changes in fuel subsidies and poverty cash payments are highly non-linear. Three important messages emerge from the model results. Firstly, petrol price reductions have a rather low impact on poverty alleviation. Secondly, diminishing marginal returns have to be expected as poverty levels do not seem to respond linearly to fuel subsidy changes. Thirdly, model results suggest that not just marginal but also absolute returns can decrease due to environmental feedbacks...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to shed light on the {{relationship}} between corporate governance characteristics and cash holding. Cash holding has drawn researchers' attention recently due to the fact that many companies all around the world have <b>doubled</b> their <b>cash</b> reserves. However, increasing cash holdings can bring about agency issues and that is why it is critical to have a strong corporate governance in order to compensate for the agency costs. This will provide managers with more cash reserves which lead to more flexibility to take advantage of the investment opportunities. The sample of this study is taken from Malaysian publicly listed companies for a ten-year period starting from 2003 to 2012. The outcome of this study suggests that corporate governance can significantly affect cash holdings and eventually corporate value. Therefore, companies with stronger corporate governance tend to keep higher cash holdings ratio. cash holdings; corporate governance; board of directors; audit committee; firm size; board independence; expertise; Malaysia; agency costs...|$|R
