50|$|On 2 April 1917 President Woodrow Wilson cited Germany's {{refusal to}} suspend {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean in his {{request for a}} <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war on Germany, and Congress concurred on 2 April 1917. In that April 1,250,000 deadweight tons were sunk, with 122 ocean-going ships sunk {{in the first two}} weeks after that <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war. British <b>losses</b> in that period equaled an average round-trip voyage <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 25%. Allied <b>losses</b> before U.S. entry had already been that heavy that construction in yards outside the U.S. was unable to sustain current losses.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the Company’s {{presentation}} of itself as a small business, the Directors concluded, and the Auditors concurred, {{that there was no}} need to include any details of the funds which the Company transferred to Bangladesh on behalf of its customers. Hence the only indication of the Company’s success (or failure) in implementing its core business was the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a small <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> GB£435 on its foreign exchange activities during 2005-06. No details of the Company’s activities during the following financial year are available at Companies House, since the business had by then collapsed.|$|R
40|$|This article {{questions}} the common assumptions in legal theory regarding Derrida’s well-known <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> Independence. Through a close reading of this text, well-known ground {{such as the}} relation between speech and writing, the notion of representation, speech act theory, the signature, and the proper name is covered. The contribution that this analysis makes in the present context lies in the additional ‘step’ that it takes. The article seeks to give {{an explanation of the}} laws at work in Derrida’s thinking in the above respects and to explain more specifically how they find expression in <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> Independence. The article in this regard also investigates the importance and role of the ‘notions’ <b>of</b> death, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> meaning, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> ownership, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty in Derrida’s thinking. The contention is that if we take account of Derrida’s reading in <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> Independence, it is possible to view constitutions in a very different way, more specifically their ‘origins’, with inevitable implications for constitutional interpretation...|$|R

The <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Sentiments, much like the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Woman was written in the style <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Man, was written in the style <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence of the United States.|$|R
5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> brain function.

In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome <b>of</b> brainstem death. <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|R
