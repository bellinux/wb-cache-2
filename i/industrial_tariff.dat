30|$|The {{cross-subsidization}} in the {{tariff system}} is also {{evidenced by the}} fact that the <b>industrial</b> <b>tariff</b> is greater than the residential tariff in many cases. The residential tariffs should be higher than the industrial tariffs because it costs more. More facilities are needed and greater losses are incurred due to the lower supply voltage. In the situation of EU, the industrial tariffs are lower than the residential tariffs. Consequently, cross-subsidization in the tariff system distorts consumption decisions and make a country’s industry less competitive.|$|E

The scenarios are thus {{in the nature}} of a “thought experiment” rather than a forecast based on the following assumptions. First, all <b>industrial</b> <b>tariffs</b> are removed among the TPP member countries as well as TTIP member countries by 2030, with some exceptions based on the “best guess” scenario propounded by Ciuriak and Jingliang (2014) 6; for the automotive and textiles and clothing sectors, we assume gradual phase-out of tariffs. For agriculture, we exclude traditionally sensitive sectors, including rice into Japan, sugar into the USA, dairy into Canada. Otherwise we eliminate the protection in the GTAP version 8 database.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{minimization}} of tariff {{has been}} receiving considerable attention {{due to the}} rising cost of raw materials and electrical energy. This paper presents a method of optimization to minimize the tariff in industries with the aid of Evolutionary Programming technique. By invoking the Evolutionary Programming the solution with the global minimum is secured while simultaneously improving the convergence speed. A potential advantage of Evolutionary Programming compared to Genetic Algorithm is that the global optimization can be performed more efficiently. The optimization of the objective function is flat rate tariff, which is deduced in terms of two independent variables. The method is applied to a sample medium scale <b>industrial</b> <b>tariff.</b> The optimized results are compared with the results of conventional method...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the effect of}} tariffs for labor productivity faces the challenge of tariff policy endogeneity. Tariff policy is designed to promote economic development and the <b>industrial</b> sector <b>tariff</b> structure may reflect characteristics of the industries protected. We seek to identify the effect of tariffs by taking advantage of multilateral tariff liberalization using reductions in <b>industrial</b> sector <b>tariffs</b> in other world regions as instruments for sectoral tariff reductions in South Africa. The data cover 28 manufacturing sectors over the period 1988 - 2003. We find that tariff reductions have stimulated labor productivity when instrumented by multilateral tariffs. The OLS estimates show downward bias and supports the understanding that the government has given priority to tariff reductions in sectors with slow productivity growth. ...|$|R
