25|$|F1 {{cannot be}} a field because all fields must contain two <b>distinct</b> <b>elements,</b> the {{additive}} identity zero and the multiplicative identity one. Even if this restriction is dropped, a ring with one element {{must be the}} zero ring, which does not behave like a finite field. Instead, most proposed theories of F1 replace abstract algebra entirely. Mathematical objects such as vector spaces and polynomial rings can be carried over into these new theories by mimicking their abstract properties. This allows the development of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry on new foundations. One of the defining features of theories of F1 is that these new foundations allow more objects than classical abstract algebra, one of which behaves like a field of characteristic one.|$|E

In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on.

A field data collection methodology {{was developed to}} provide the inputs to a slope stability investigation that utilises three-dimensional geometric, limit equilibrium and <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> codes. Conceptual slope geometries in addition to three case studies are employed to evaluate the influence of discontinuity set orientation and lateral kinematic confinement on the failure mechanism and slope stability conditions. The influence of varying the discontinuity persistence and block size in a three-dimensional <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> code are also investigated. Systematic studies of these parameters are performed for the planar sliding and block toppling failure mechanisms. This thesis presents the first detailed description and slope stability analysis of the McAuley Creek Landslide and the Chehalis Lake Landslide. New data and analyses of the potentially unstable rock mass at Third Peak on Turtle Mountain are also presented. Two recently developed representations of complex topography in the three-dimensional <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> code are applied to the case studies.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} is {{very useful}} {{for understanding the}} hydraulic fracturing mechanism. In this paper, we simulate the hydraulic fracturing using the <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> approach, to investigate the effect of some critical parameters on hydraulic fracturing characteristics. The breakdown pressure obtained by the <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> approach {{is consistent with the}} analytical solution. This indicates that the <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> approach is feasible on modeling the hydraulic fracturing. We independently examine the influence of in-situ stress ratio, injection rate and fluid viscosity on hydraulic fracturing. We further emphasize the relationship between these three factors and their contributions to the hydraulic fracturing. With the increase of stress ratio, the fracture aperture increases almost linearly; with the increase of injection rate and fluid viscosity, the fracture aperture and breakdown pressure increase obviously. A low value of product of injection rate and fluid viscosity (i. e., Qμ) will lead to narrow fracture aperture, low breakdown pressure, and complex or dispersional hydraulic fractures. A high value of Qμ would lead wide fracture aperture, high breakdown pressure, and simple hydraulic fractures (e. g., straight or wing shape). With low viscosity fluid, the hydraulic fracture geometry is not sensitive to stress ratio, and thus becomes a complex fracture network...|$|R

Using the internal programming FISH, the cohesive fracture model is programmed into a hybrid <b>distinct</b> <b>element</b> algorithm as encoded in Universal <b>Distinct</b> <b>Element</b> Code (UDEC).
