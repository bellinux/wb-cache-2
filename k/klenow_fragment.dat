40|$|Radiotherapy is the {{clinical}} {{application of the}} ionizing radiation to treat cancer. Ionizing radiation causes multiple modes of damage to the DNA damage such as SSBs, DSBs and modified bases such as thymine glycol. These lesions can exist as clusters {{in one or two}} helical turns of DNA. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely toxic to cells because they can lead to genomic rearrangements and even cell death. If base lesions accompany these DSBs, there will be a substantial hindrance for repair. NHEJ is the primary DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells. HRR repairs single strand breaks (SSBs) or Double strand breaks (DSBs), during late S phase and G 2 phase of the cell cycle, by using an undamaged copy of the DNA sequence, and is therefore largely error-free. The NHEJ pathway repairs DSBs without the requirement for sequence homology and can be error-free or error-prone, and is most active during G 1 phase. Thymine glycol (Tg) is the most common oxidation product of thymine. It is produced endogenously as a consequence of aerobic metabolism or via exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation (IR); {{it is one of the}} predominant types of base modifications produced by ionizing radiation. Due to clustering of radiation-induced damages, many DSBs are accompanied by damaged bases such as Tg at or near the DSB ends that may interfere with subsequent gap filling and ligation. The base excision repair pathway plays a major role in removal of thymine glycol from the damaged DNA strand. During NHEJ, after synapsis by Ku and DNAPKcs and processing of the DNA ends, XRCC 4 /Ligase IV complex ligates the DNA. This ligase activity is promoted by the interaction of XLF/XRCC 4 filament with Ligase IV. Linearized plasmids with Tg at the 5 th -Tg 5 positions from the broken end were subjected to a repair assay using XRCC 4 -like factor (XLF) -deficient cell extracts, with or without the addition of XLF and Endonuclease III and/or ddTTP and <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragments.</b> End joining of Tg 5 was compared to plasmid with Tg at third position-Tg 3 in extracts. In addition, the ability of purified NHEJ proteins Ku, DNAPKcs and XRCC 4 /Ligase IV, to repair the Tg 1 (Tg at the end), Tg 2 (Tg at the second position), Tg 3 and Tg 5 in the presence and absence of XLF was assessed. The data indicated that the cell extract could ligate the Tg 5 plasmids only in the presence of XLF. End joining of the Tg 5 was less in comparison to Tg 3 with base excision repair being more active in Tg 5 competing with the joining. Plasmids with Tg were treated with Endonuclease III and ddTTP to test whether the end joining occurred before or after Tg removal. Endonuclease III and ddTTP treatment showed reduced intensity of the joined fragment suggesting that end joining occurred without removal of Tg in some cases. The extracts were not able to fill in the processed end by the BER though it has a 3 ′-OH which was filled in by the treatment with Klenow enzymes derived from E. coli DNA Polymerase I, following removal of extract proteins by proteolysis. When purified proteins were used to treat the plasmids, it is observed that there was increased efficiency of repair with increased distance of the Tg from the end may be due to less distortion of the ends as Tg is away from the end. While Tg 1 and Tg 2 required XLF presence for the repair, Tg 3 and Tg 5 could show a small amount of repair in its absence. XLF enhanced the repair of Tg 3 and Tg 5. While the repair by extract showed no repair in the same substrates without XLF, there was repair by purified proteins without XLF, suggesting there is some competition with the XRCC 4 /Ligase for the DSB by other proteins and XLF is required to overcome this. In conclusion, cell extract was able to ligate the plasmid with Tg located at fifth position from the DSB but with lower efficiency compared to Tg 3 plasmids. The base excision repair pathway is more functional if the modified base is far from the DSB. End joining by the purified proteins was proportional to the thymine glycol position from the DSB end. XLF was mandatory for repair of Tg 1 and Tg 2 by the purified proteins, and not for Tg 3 and Tg 5...|$|R

Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the reaction tubes are moved between them by means of an automated process.

50|$|Mismatch repair {{contributes}} to the overall fidelity of DNA replication and is essential for combating the adverse effects of damage to the genome. It involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that have been missed by the proofreading element (<b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment)</b> of the DNA polymerase complex. The post-replicative Mismatch Repair System (MMRS) of Escherichia coli involves MutS (Mutator S), MutL and MutH proteins, and acts to correct point mutations or small insertion/deletion loops produced during DNA replication. MutS and MutL are involved in preventing recombination between partially homologous DNA sequences. The assembly of MMRS is initiated by MutS, which recognizes and binds to mispaired nucleotides and allows further action of MutL and MutH to eliminate a portion of newly synthesized DNA strand containing the mispaired base. MutS can also collaborate with methyltransferases in the repair of O(6)-methylguanine damage, which would otherwise pair with thymine during replication to create an O(6)mG:T mismatch. MutS exists as a dimer, where the two monomers have different conformations and form a heterodimer at the structural level. Only one monomer recognises the mismatch specifically and has ADP bound. Non-specific major groove DNA-binding domains from both monomers embrace the DNA in a clamp-like structure. Mismatch binding induces ATP uptake and a conformational change in the MutS protein, resulting in a clamp that translocates on DNA.|$|E
5000|$|The {{polymerase}} is a monomeric protein {{with two}} distinct functional domains. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments support {{the proposition that}} this protein displays a structural and functional similarity to the <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> of the Escherichia coli Polymerase I enzyme; it comprises a C-terminal polymerase domain and a spatially separated N-terminal domain with a 3'-5' exonuclease activity.The isolated enzyme has no intrinsic helicase activity, but may carry out an equivalent function by way of its strong binding to single stranded DNA, particularly in preference to double stranded nucleic acid. This is the property of this enzyme that makes is favorably applicable to Multiple Displacement Amplification. The enzyme facilitates the [...] "debranching" [...] of double stranded DNA. Deoxyribonucleoside triphoshate cleavage that occurs {{as part of the}} polymerisation process probably supplies the energy required for this unwinding mechanism. The continuous nature of strand synthesis (compared to the asymmetric synthesis seen in other organisms) probably contributes to this enhanced processivity.Proofreading activity conferred by the exonuclease domain was demonstrated by showing the preferential excision of a mismatched nucleotide from the 3' terminus of the newly synthesised strand. [...] The exonuclease activity of the enzyme is, like its polymerisation activity, highly processive and can degrade single stranded oligonucleotides without dissociation. Co-operation or a 'delicate competition' between these two functional domains is essential, so as to ensure accurate elongation at an optimal rate. The exonuclease activity of the enzyme does impede its polymerisation capacity; inactivation of the exonuclease activity by site-directed mutagenesis meant that a 350 fold lower dNTP concentration was required to achieve the same rates of primer elongation seen in the wild type enzyme.|$|E

The bases consisted of a benzimidazole ring with one or two exocyclic substituent(s) that are either electron-donating (methyl and methoxy) or electronwithdrawing (trifluoromethyl and dinitro). Both pol a and <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> exhibit a remarkable inability to discriminate against these analogues as compared to their ability to discriminate against incorrect natural dNTPs. Neither polymerase shows any distinct electronic or steric preferences for analogue incorporation.

Whereas pol a and <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> exhibited minimal discrimination against the 5 - and 6 -regioisomers, they discriminated much more effectively against the 4 - and 7 -regioisomers. Since all four of these analogues will have similar hydrophobicity and stacking ability, these data indicate that hydrophobicity and stacking ability alone cannot account for the inability of pol a and <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> to discriminate against unnatural bases.

This method might be applicable to a broad spectrum of thermolabile DNA polymerases in cycled PCR and other methods of DNA amplification. <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli (Klenow polymerase) (1), as well as other thermolabile DNA polymerases (2), were used for PCR {{in the early days of}} this method by fresh addition to each cycle. Introduction of thermostable enzymes added much convenience to PCR, and Klenow polymer...|$|E
40|$|The 3 ' [...] 5 ' {{exonuclease}} {{activities of}} T 4 DNA polymerase and the <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> of Polymerase I towards the phosphoryl and thiophosphoryl 3 ', 5 ' linkage were examined under comparable conditions of idling-turnover, duplex hydrolysis and turnover during polymerization. With the T 4 enzyme {{there is a}} negligible effect of thiosubstitution on these activities; with the <b>Klenow</b> <b>fragment</b> {{there is a greater}} than one hundred-fold reduction in rate with the thiolinkage for the exonuclease but not polymerization activities. This inability to hydrolyze rapidly the thiophosphoryl linkage extends to the hydrolytic activity of Exonuclease III. The quantitation of the exonuclease activities of these three proteins under various conditions should aid in the successful employment of thiophosphoryl nucleoside triphosphates for their incorporation into DNA...|$|E
