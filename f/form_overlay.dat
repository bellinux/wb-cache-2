Rlinks provide a clean way to build and share related-file information without creating additional files and directories. Rlinks <b>form</b> <b>overlay</b> graphs between files of a file system, thus providing useful alternate views of the file system.

40|$|Recently, {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) {{traffic is}} increasing rapidly in volume day by day. One {{of the main}} causes {{is that most of}} P 2 P applications including file sharing and streaming applications often <b>form</b> <b>overlay</b> net-works for exchanging data that are oblivious to the underlay network topology. As a result, they generate a large amount of inter-domain traffic causing higher cost for internet service providers (ISPs). This raises a problem of traffic localization. To optimize the cross-ISP/AS traffic, existing approaches focus on solv-ing the problem on the application layer where each P 2 P application must be equipped with an additional protocol to obtain underlay network information from an “oracle ” server or an additional locality-aware procedure to estimate location by itself. Therefore some modifications of application software are re-quired for these approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for addressing the problem, called PLS, forcing packet loss to each P 2 P packet based on geographical location of each destination at the network layer. Since PLS is implemented at a network router, no software modification is required. This proposal can be applied to all types of P 2 P applications in order to localize the traffic. The experiments evaluated on popular P 2 P streaming applications show that our proposed method significantly reduces the cross-domain traffic by suppressing the connections with faraway peers...|$|E
40|$|Peer-to-peer overlay {{networks}} are distributed systems, without any hierarchical organization or centralized control. Peers <b>form</b> <b>overlay</b> networks {{that are on}} top of the Internet. Both parts of this thesis deal with peer-to-peer overlay networks. The first part builds an unstructured one to construct a large scale Networked Virtual Environment. We present a complete study of a Delaunay-based overlay for massively shared virtual worlds. We design an overlay network matching the Delaunay triangulation of the participating peers. Especially, we describe the self-organizing algorithms for peer insertion and deletion. To reduce the delay penalty of overlay routing, we propose to augment each node with a limited number of carefully selected shortcut links creating a small-world. We show that a small number of shortcuts is sufficient to significantly decrease the delay of routing. The second part of this thesis gives insights on how the users of a real life structured peer-to-peer network behave. We give a detailed background on KAD, a Distributed Hash Table based on Kademlia, a file sharing system with several million simultaneous users. We describe the organization of the peers, and the search and the publish operations. We have been crawling KAD continuously for more than a year. We obtained information about geographical distribution of peers, session times, peer availability, and peer lifetime. As we have been studying KAD we have been both, fascinated and frightened by the possibilities KAD offers. Mounting a Sybil attack is very easy and allows to compromise the privacy of users, to compromise the correct operation of the key lookup and to mount a DDOS attack.

The last purpose is identifying the interaction between Lebak Regency withthe other regions in Banten Province. It is using the gravity method. Based on LQ analysis, we know that Lebak regency has 6 basic sectors, such as agriculture, mining and excavating, building and constructing, trading, hotel and restaurant, finance and leasing. Besides, there are 3 non basic sectors, electricity, gas, and clean water. From Shift Share, MRP, and Overlay analysis, there are 9 sectors that have excellent competitiveness and others have only special characteristic.

50|$|The main {{concentration}} of ball clay in Dorset {{is to the}} north of the Purbeck Hills centred on Norden. Ball clays are sedimentary in origin. Approximately 45 million years ago (in the Lutetian stage of the Eocene epoch) the climate was tropical and an ancient River Solent washed kaolinite (formed from decomposed granite) from its parent rock on Dartmoor. As the streams flowed from upland areas they mixed with other clay minerals, sands, gravels, and vegetation before settling in low-lying basins to <b>form</b> <b>overlaying</b> seams of ball clay. Ball clays usually contain three dominant minerals: from 20-80% kaolinite, 10-25% mica, and 6-65% quartz.

To build an end-to-end data collecting system, how to efficiently integrate WSNs with the Internet should be investigated.

The selection of this virtualization method crucially determines the emerging network model. The network model consists of virtual networks, virtual routers, and virtual links that <b>form</b> <b>overlays</b> on top of the physical network.

Additionally, a proof of concept implementation using currently available technol-ogy and infrastructure is presented.

Data is still exchanged directly over the underlying TCP/IP network, but at the application layer peers are able {{to communicate with each other}} directly, via the logical overlay links (each of which corresponds to a path through the underlying physical network). Overlays are used for indexing and peer discovery, and make the P2P system independent from the physical network topology. Based on how the nodes are linked to each other within the overlay network, and how resources are indexed and located, we can classify networks as unstructured or structured (or as a hybrid between the two).|$|R
