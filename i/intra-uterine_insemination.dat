40|$|Reproductive {{performance}} {{is a major}} concern for pork producers because the financial stability of a pork enterprise that produces piglets is substantially influenced by fecundity index (FI) for number of piglets born alive (FI = farrowing rate x litter size born alive). It is well known that farrowing rate and litter size are affected by numerous factors. A new reproductive technique that pork producers are hearing and reading about is <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination.</b> <b>Intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> is the process of placing spermatozoa directly into the uterine body instead of the cervix as traditionally done. The uterine body is located between the cervix and uterine horns. The uterine body is about 1. 5 to 2. 0 inches long.

The motives and principles of deep insemination are well described, but the equipment used may differ. In this trial, the efficiency of two different insemination pipettes for deep <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> in the mare was compared with insemination into the uterine body using commercially available frozen-thawed semen of two stallions of proven fertility. These inseminations were performed using two different doses. The semi-flexible Minitube pipette was compared with a newly designed insemination device with a more flexible telescopic insemination catheter (Ghent device). The semi-flexible Minitube pipette performed better than the newly designed insemination device with respect to pregnancy outcome (p= 0. 008). The superiority of deep horn insemination over uterine body insemination was reflected by the better pregnancy rates obtained after deep insemination using the same low doses (30. 6 % better pregnancy rates) (p= 0. 0123) ...|$|E

The epidemiological data on the prevalence and predictors of infertility-specific stress in cultural specific scenario are scarce. The objective {{of the present study}} was to estimate the prevalence of infertility-specific stress and identify predictors of infertility-specific stress in women diagnosed with primary infertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 infertile married women, diagnosed with primary infertility. The tools used for the assessment were “semi-structured questionnaire ” compiled by the authors, “ICD- 10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders (Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines), ” and “Psychological Evaluation Test for infertility. ” STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 15). Chi-square test was used for univariate analysis followed by multiple logistic regressions between stress and the predictor variables. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The prevalence of stress among women was 80 %. Univariate analysis revealed that predictors of stress were years of marital life, duration of infertility, infertility type, history of gynecological surgery, cycles of ovulation induction with timed intercourse and <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>inseminations,</b> present and past psychiatric morbidity, coping difficulties, gynecological diagnosis, and severity of premenstrual dysphoria.

Data were collected mainly from already existing national registers. From 23 countries, 579 clinics reported 289 690 cycles with: IVF 120 946, ICSI 114 378, frozen embryo transfer (FER) 47 195 and egg donation (ED) 7171. Overall this represents a 4 % increase since the year 2000. For the first time, results on European data on <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> (IUIs) were reported from 15 countries. A total of 67 124 cycles [IUI husband'sperm (IUI-H) 52 949 and IUI donor sperm (IUI-D) 14 185] were included. In 12 countries where all clinics reported to the register, a total of 108 910 cycles were performed in a population of 131. 4 million, corresponding to 829 cycles per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rate per aspiration and per transfer was 25. 1 and 29. 0 %, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 26. 2 and 28. 3 %. These figures {{are similar to the}} results from 2000. After IUI-H, the clinical pregnancy rate was 12. 8 % in women or = 40 years of age. After IVF and ICSI, the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and > or = 4 embryos was 12. 0, 51. 7, 30. 8 and 5. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: In {{fertility}} care, high-quality care is {{most often}} {{described in terms of}} effectiveness. The Institute of Medicine drew the attention to the importance of patient-centredness to quality of care. However {{in order to be able}} to evaluate the patient-centredness of fertility care, the concept ‘patient-centred fertility care’ needs to be clearly defined first of all. Patient-centred care takes into account what in care is important to patients. Because an in-depth insight into the patients’ perspective on fertility care is not provided by the literature, this called for an explorative qualitative study. The aim of this study was to define a framework for ‘patient-centred fertility care’ including rich descriptions of the patients’ perspective. Material and Methods: A total of 103 patients across 20 fertility clinics in The Netherlands and Belgium were included in 14 focus group discussions. The sample included men and women who experienced at least one of the following fertility treatments: IVF, ICSI, timed coitus or <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> (with or without ovulation induction). Participants were asked to discuss their positive and negative experiences with fertility care in order to discover what ‘patient-centred fertility care’ is. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A basic conceptual model of the dimensions of ‘patient-centred fertility care’ was developed, based on the general model of patient-centredness (Picker Institute) and on a literature review focused on the patients’ perspective on fertility care. This model was the starting point for data analysis. Phenomenology was used to deepen our understanding of the experience of fertility patients and to create rich descriptions of their perspective. The phenomenological coding process was conducted by and discussed among two researchers independently to increase the reliability of the coding. The insights were used to adapt the model of ‘patient-centred fertility care’. Furthermore, patients were asked to draw a list with the 5 aspects of care, most important to them. Aspects were allocated to a dimension of ‘patient-centred fertility care’ through qualitative analysis. The first aspect on patients’ list resulted in 5 points for the relevant dimension; the second 4, and so on. The scores per dimension were added up and this resulted in a ranking of the dimensions of ‘patient-centred fertility care’. Results: The conceptual model of ‘patient-centred fertility care’ requires adaptation based on our qualitative research into the patients’ perspective on care. ‘Patient-centred fertility care’ is a multidimensional concept, with 10 main care dimensions: ‘accessibility’, ‘coordination and integration’, ‘physical comfort and facilities’, ‘continuity and transition’, ‘competence’, ‘emotional support’, ‘information and education’, ‘communication’, ‘patient involvement and privacy’ and ‘attitude of clinic staff’. For each dimension, patients have a detailed opinion on what they want. Based on patients’ priority listings, patients put most importance to (in order of importance) : ‘information and education’, ‘attitude of clinic staff’ and ‘competence’. Patients want timely, detailed, consistent and practical information and have concrete information needs. Patients want to be cared for by clinical staff with a friendly, empathic, understanding and devoted attitude who are trustworthy, competent, conscientious, thorough and punctual and they want monitoring of the clinic's quality. Conclusion: High-quality fertility care is also patient-centred. This study provides health care professionals with a model for the, until now rather vague, concept of ‘patient-centred fertility care’. This detailed model includes a rich description of the patients’ perspective. Further research is needed to develop a quantitative instrument to evaluate the patient-centredness of care according to this concept in European fertility clinics. status: publishe...|$|R

Twenty-two ejaculates of 5 adult males of the Piau breed trough the gloved-hand method. In order to verify the sperm viability of the raw semen and post-thawing, the following traits were evaluated: sperm motility and vigor, hypoosmotic test, supra-vital color test and percentage of normal acrosomes. To freezing, the ejaculates were fractioned and submitted in: method 1, method of freezing recommended by Fürst et al. (2005), modified according to media extender; method 2, recommended by Fürst et al. (2005), modified according to the cooling curve; and method 3, recommended by Ohata et al. (2001). To test the in vivo fertility of the frozen/thawed semen, 23 <b>intra-uterine</b> (post-cervical) <b>inseminations</b> were performed in 14 females of the Piau breed, with semen from method 3. The mean values obtained with the use of methods 1 and 2 and post-thawing were inferior to those obtained with method 3. Four adult sows got pregnant (28. 6 % fertility rate). The freezing method recommended by Ohata et al. (2001), with balance period of 90 minutes at 22 - 26 ºC, enables higher results of in vitro sperm viability in comparison with the two other methods. The absence of balance period of method 1 and the cooling curve utilized in protocol 2 affect negatively the parameters of sperm viability evaluated in the present study.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, the {{percentage}} of multiple pregnancies in the Netherlands has increased. Nowadays, {{the percentage}} of triplets is decreasing {{but there is still}} an increase in {{the percentage of}} twin pregnancies. A major cause is that Dutch women tend to delay starting a family until an advanced age. This increases their chances of a spontaneous multiple pregnancy. Moreover, they are prone to subfertility and consequently have a greater chance of undergoing treatments involving assisted-reproduction techniques such as <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI) and in-vitro fertilisation. In the Netherlands, the majority of higher order multiple pregnancies result from mild ovarian hyperstimulation in combination with IUI.

40|$|<b>Intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> {{produces}} better fertility than intra-vaginal insemin-ation when breeding quail by {{artificial insemination}} (Wentworth & Mellen, 1963; Ogasawara & Huang, 1963). Insemination is best accomplished when an egg {{is present in}} the uterus. Wentworth & Mellen (1963) passed a needle through the postero-dorsal wall of the cloaca, the uterus wall and the egg, and injected semen into the anterior region of the uterus. Antibiotics were added to the food and to a semen diluent to prevent serious infection of the females by E. coli. Ogasawara & Huang (1963) expelled the egg from the uterus before depositing the semen therein. Good fertility was obtained without the use of antibiotics and infection ofhens was not reported. The present communication reports a simple yet successful method of arti-ficial insemination of quail without expelling the egg from the uterus. It was developed in an attempt to produce chicken-quail hybrids with the semen ofBrown Leghorns. Japanese quail aged between 2 and 7 months were maintained in individual cages and fed a turkey starter ration. Automatically controlled lights provided a 14 -hr day. Brown Leghorn males of the Breeding line (Blyth & Sang, 1960) were kept under similar conditions but were fed a normal chicken breeders' mash. Brown Leghorn semen, uncontaminated with transparent fluid and urine, was collected by the method described by Lake (1957). Quail semen was collected by the method of Ogasawara & Huang (1963), except that massage was also applied {{to the back of the}} bird. Urine and semen of the quail could be distinguished when the erected copulatory organ was squeezed, because urine was invariably chalky-white and sometimes granular compared with the creamy-white, homogeneous nature of semen which appeared in the centre of the spade-like organ. <b>Intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> of quail hens was carried out by a modification of the method of Ogasawara & Huang (1963).

40|$|Infertility {{treatments}} are sought after by {{about one in}} every ten women in the United States. In vitro fertilization (IVF) and <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI) are both relatively expensive and time consuming fertility options for patients and yet still cannot guarantee pregnancy will be achieved. Incorporating acupuncture into an IVF cycle creates a sympathoinhibitory effects, decreases pulsatillity index, and promotes increased uterine artery blood flow and therefore increased endometrial thickness and increased likelihood of embryo implantation. Additionally, acupuncture normalizes hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction. Incorporating Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) into an IVF cycle promotes estrogenic effects including uterine support through the luteal phase. Incorporating CHM into an IUI regimen helps to alleviate the anti-estrogenic effects of the follicle stimulating pharmaceuticals prescribed. In randomized trials, acupuncture and CHM significantly increased endometrial thickness measurements and CHM significantly increased pregnancy and live birth rates when used alongside IVF. Most patients have negative perceptions regarding traditional Chinese medicine and are therefore not receptive to using it or incorporating it into their fertility treatment plan.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many male cancer {{survivors}} experience fertility problems due to antineoplastic treatment. We report the fertility outcome in 67 couples referred to assisted reproduction treatment (ART) because of male factor infertility due to cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective study assessing the following parameters: diagnosis, cancer treatment, type of fertility treatment {{and type of}} sperm used, number of pregnancies and pregnancy out-come. RESULTS: Testicular cancer and lymphomas were the most prevalent diagnoses. Adjuvant treatment with chemo- and/or radiation therapy {{had been given to}} 90 % of the men. Semen was cryopreserved in 82 % of the men prior to treatment. Following antineoplastic treatment, 43 % of the men had motile spermatozoa in the ejaculate, but 57 % were azoospermic. A total of 151 ART cycles were performed [55 <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI), 82 ICSI and 14 ICSI–frozen embryo replacement (FER) ]. The clinical pregnancy rate per cycle was 14. 8 % after IUI, 38. 6 % after ICSI and 25 % after ICSI–FER. The corresponding delivery rates were 11. 1, 30. 5 and 21 %.

RESULTS: Of all subfertility related continuing pregnancies, 46 % were conceived spontaneously, 16 % were induced by clomiphene citrate (CC), 2. 4 % by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and 14 % by <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> combined with controlled hyperstimulation (IUI/(COH)). In vitro fertilization (IVF) and its related techniques resulted in about a fifth of all continuing pregnancies (n = 212), but were responsible for more than half (n = 36) of the multiple pregnancies. Furthermore, 18 % of the multiple pregnancies were induced by IUI/(COH), 3 % by FSH, 11 % by CC, whereas about 11 % were conceived spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS: IVF and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were responsible {{for the majority of the}} multiple pregnancies in a subfertile population. Therefore, twin prevention should be focused on further promoting elective single embryo transfer (eSET). Fertility treatment and particular IVF should not be started as long as the spontaneous pregnancy prognosis is good...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: A large {{proportion}} of men with normal sperm results as analyzed using conventional techniques have fragmented DNA in their spermatozoa. We performed a prospective study to examine the incidence of DNA fragmentation in sperm in cases of couples with previously unexplained infertility and treated with <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination.</b> We evaluated whether there was any predictive value of DNA fragmentation for pregnancy outcome in such couples. Methods: The percentage of DNA fragmentation and all classical variables to evaluate sperm before and after sperm treatment were determined. We studied the probable association between these results and pregnancy outcome in terms of clinical and ongoing pregnancy rate per started first cycle. We also assessed the optimal threshold level to diagnose DNA fragmentation in our center. Results: When using threshold levels of 20 %, 25 %, and 30 %, the occurrence of DNA fragmentation was 42. 9 %, 33. 3 %, and 28. 6 %, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of all cases revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 80 % to predict the clinical pregnancy rate per cycle from testing the sperm motility (a+b) before treatment. We failed to generate an ROC curve to estimate pregnancy outcome from the amount of DNA fragmentation before treatment. However, when selecting only those men with a pre-treatment DNA fragmentation of at least 20 %, the pre-treatment result was statistically different between couples who achieved a clinical pregnancy {{and those who did}} not. Conclusion: DNA fragmentation is often diagnosed in couples with unexplained infertility. Each center should evaluate the type of test it uses to detect DNA fragmentation in sperm and determine its own threshold values...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} 10 % of female mice enter oestrus and allow mating {{in the middle}} of the day is an old {{observation}} that has been more or less forgotten. We here show that this old knowledge can be used to improve the efficacy of both embryo transfer and insemination protocols. The present technical paper shows that rapid re-arrangements of mating cages, to achieve pseudo-pregnant recipients {{in the middle of}} the day, can be of great advantage in emergency situations. Such emergency situations occur repeatedly, i. e. when a scientist has forgotten to re-arrange her/his mating cages, and the last important male suddenly has become ill and may die within a few hours. A rapid technique for uterine artificial insemination in mice in such situations is extremely valuable. An artificial <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> requires only a minimum of planning, a minimum of instrumentation and a minimum of surgical training. The artificial insemination must be performed shortly after mating due to rapid constriction of the utero-tubual junction (UTJ). This means that the timing of the insemination is very important. We here show that the success rate for embryo transfers, when using recipients plugged {{in the middle of the}} day, was the same as for ordinary overnight mating protocols. In addition, it: should be noted that the success rate (frequency of pregnancies) for uterine inseminations was 55 % if using F 1 recipients of C 57 BL/ 6 J (considerable lower if using recipients of inbred C 57 BL/ 6 J), which is amazingly high, since inseminations in mice is known to be tricky to perform in a reproducible manner...|$|E
40|$|Four trials {{involving}} the <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> {{of a total}} of 840 Coopworth ewes were conducted to assess the fertilization capacity of ram semen stored at WC. Semen from Polled Dorset rams was collected by artificial vagina, diluted with either a standard milk diluent or a synthetic diluent (RSD- 1) to a concentration of 200 x 106 sperm/ml, cooled to 15 “C, placed in 0. 25 ml straws and held at WC for various periods [Day 0 (4 h), Day 1 (28 h), Day 2 (52 h), Day 3 (76 h) and Day 4 (100 h) ] before insemination. Ewes were synchronised, with CIDR devices inserted for 14 days and 400 i. u. PMSG was given at time of device removal. Laparoscopic assisted inn-a-uterine inseminations were performed between 52 h and 56 h after device withdrawal. A total of six inseminators were used throughout the trial series with between 3 to 5 inseminators per trial.

40|$|Aim: Comparison {{between the}} results of the oocyte {{retrieval}} technique and the conversion to the <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI) technique in cases with poor ovarian response to the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) procedure. Patients and methods: It is a retrospective observational study in women with poor ovarian response to COH which is defined as estradiol (E 2) peak level < 1000  pg/mL or with ⩽ 4 follicles which are ⩾ 14  mm in diameter. Four hundred and sixteen cases were reported as poor responders in 2 IVF centers since December 2007 to July 2010. One hundred and fifty two cases of them proceeded to the oocyte retrieval procedure. These cases were assigned as group (A). Sixty eight cases converted to IUI and were assigned as group (B). One hundred and ninety six cases canceled their cycles. These cases {{were not included in the}} current study. Our data were collected from the databases of two In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) centers and analyzed retrospectively to compare {{the results of}} the different applied techniques in the studied groups. The main measured outcome parameters were the clinical pregnancy rate and the live birth rate. Results: The group of cases proceeded to the oocyte retrieval procedure had a higher basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level, needed a longer duration of stimulation with higher Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG) doses and had higher E 2 peak levels. The clinical pregnancy rates and the live birth rates were higher in the group proceeded to the oocyte retrieval than the group converted to IUI but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: As the pregnancy rates difference between both groups was not statistically significant the conversion to IUI could be considered a useful substitute to the oocyte retrieval procedure in the poor responder cases. However, to adopt this conclusion, further confirmation in other prospective studies with larger sample size is a must...|$|E
40|$|The candidate’s work is {{centred on}} the {{evidence}} based investigation and treatment of reproductive disorders in women and includes subthemes of evidenced based medicine, infertility and the long term management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The candidate’s published work encompasses {{a broad spectrum of}} the hierarchal levels of research evidence including observational studies (case series, retrospective and prospective cohort studies), clinical trials (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), narrative reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs and Evidence Based Clinical Guidelines. The candidate is totally committed to the principles and practices of Evidence Based Medicine to improve clinical practice and outcomes. Evidence based medical practice is based on the best research evidence available. The candidate’s published work on female reproductive disorders focusses on the management of Infertility and PCOS. The published work on infertility includes both the investigation and treatment of this important reproductive disorder. These publications on the investigation of infertility involve the surgical techniques of Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) and Outpatient Hysteroscopy which are two important investigations evaluating female infertility whilst the publications on the treatment of infertility comprise a range of infertility treatments including surgical treatment of endometriosis, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with various insemination techniques (timed intercourse, intra-cervical insemination [ICI] and <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> [IUI]) for unexplained or ovulatory (which includes unexplained, male, cervical, endometriosis, and tubal infertility) infertility, ovulation induction for anovulatory infertility (PCOS) and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) with or without Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). The published work on PCOS consists of treating both the infertility and long term effects of PCOS. Particular emphasis has been placed on comparing both the efficacy and adverse effects profile of the new treatment agent metformin, in order to help determine the role of metformin (both alone and combined with other treatment modalities) in the management of PCOS in terms of both infertility and long-term treatment. However, the candidate’s work has more recently evolved to also evaluate the role of all infertility treatments in PCOS in an evidenced based manner including lifestyle, pharmacological, surgical and IVF treatments...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple pregnancies {{are high}} risk pregnancies with higher chances of {{maternal}} and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In the past decades {{the number of}} multiple pregnancies has increased. This trend {{is partly due to}} the fact that women start family planning at an increased age, but also due to the increased use of ART. Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility generally receive intrauterine insemination IUI with controlled hormonal stimulation (IUI COH). The cumulative pregnancy rate is 40 %, with a 10 % multiple pregnancy rate. This study aims to reveal whether alternative treatments such as IVF elective Single Embryo Transfer (IVF e SET) or Modified Natural Cycle IVF (MNC IVF) can reduce the number of multiple pregnancy rates, but uphold similar pregnancy rates as IUI COH in couples with mild male or unexplained subfertility. Secondly, the aim is to perform a cost effective analyses and assess treatment preference of these couples. METHODS/DESIGN: We plan a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or six cycles of Modified Natural Cycle (MNC) IVF or three cycles with IVF-elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) plus cryo-cycles within a time frame of 12 months. Couples with unexplained subfertility or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for treatment independent pregnancy will be included. Women with anovulatory cycles, severe endometriosis, double sided tubal pathology or serious endocrine illness will be excluded. Our primary outcome is the birth of a healthy singleton. Secondary outcomes are multiple pregnancy, treatment costs, and patient experiences in each treatment arm. The analysis will be performed according tot the intention to treat principle. We will test for non-inferiority of the three arms with respect to live birth. As we accept a 12. 5 % loss in pregnancy rate in one of the two IVF arms to prevent multiple pregnancies, we need 200 couples per arm (600 couples in total). DISCUSSION: Determining the safest and most cost-effective treatment will ensure optimal chances of pregnancy for subfertile couples with substantially diminished perinatal and maternal complications. Should patients find the most cost-effective treatment acceptable or even preferable, this could imply the need for a world wide shift in the primary treatment.

40|$|Clomiphene citrate (CC) {{is first}} line {{treatment}} in women with World Health Organization (WHO) type II anovulation and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Whereas 60 % to 85 % of these women will ovulate on CC, only about one half will have conceived after six cycles. If women do not conceive, treatment can be continued with gonadotropins or <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI). At present, it is unclear for how many cycles ovulation induction with CC should be repeated, and when to switch to ovulation induction with gonadotropins and/or IUI. We started a multicenter randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of CC plus intercourse or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus intercourse or six cycles of CC plus IUI or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus IUI. Women with WHO type II anovulation who ovulate but did not conceive after six ovulatory cycles of CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days will be included. Our primary outcome is birth of a healthy child resulting from a pregnancy that {{was established in the}} first eight months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and treatment costs. The analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. Two comparisons will be made, one in which CC is compared to gonadotrophins and one in which the addition of IUI is compared to ovulation induction only. Assuming a live birth rate of 40 % after CC, 55 % after addition of IUI and 55 % after ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, with an alpha of 5 % and a power of 80 %, we need to recruit 200 women per arm (800 women in total). An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has criticized the data of the first 150 women and concluded that a sample size re-estimation should be performed after including 320 patients (i. e. 80 per arm). The trial will provide evidence on the most effective, safest and most cost effective treatment in women with WHO type II anovulation who do not conceive after six ovulatory cycles with CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days. This evidence could imply the need for changing our guidelines, which may cause a shift in large practice variation to evidence based primary treatment for these women.

40|$|Introduction: Sub-fertile {{couples have}} the option of enrolling in a {{treatment}} cycle to increase their chance of becoming pregnant. Patients find the treatment to be an aggravating experience, physically aswell as mentally. The way patients cope with this stressful experience and the need for psychosocial help differs from person to person however. Research goal: Developing an easy method to get an adequate impression of the patients’ emotional wellbeing, with the underlying goal to offer patients tailor-made psychosocial help. The method will be developed to verify the patients request for help, be physician-independent, non-intrusive and should be quick to fill-out, not requiring a lot of time from the staff of the sub-department reproductive medicine. Method: An emotional survey was developed, consisting of multiple questions about the patients’ characteristics. Furthermore, the survey contained an emotional thermometer, theses on the patients’ wellbeing and a question concerning psychosocial help. The survey was distributed amongst patients (men and women) who were undergoing either <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI), or in vitro fertilization (IVF) /intra cytoplasmic semen injection (ICSI) treatment. For the survey a template was used, on which the thermometer could be scored in a rang from 0 - 10 and the theses in a range from 12 - 48 points. Results: 91 surveys were returned during the research (1 / 3 belonged to an IUI patient, 2 / 3 to an IVF/ISCI patient). Nearly 80 % was filled out by a woman. The mean age was 33, 1 ± 4, 2 years old and two-third of these patients was in stage 1 - 3 of the treatment. Patients scores consisted of a median of 7 (2 - 9) on the thermometer and a median of 23 points (13 - 36) on the theses. Almost 70 % of these patients indicated to be willing to fill out the survey again and 8, 8 % of respondents wanted to talk with an employee within the UMCG about their emotional wellbeing. With these scores, no relation was found between the desire to speak to an employee within the UMCG and the scores on the thermometer and theses. Conclusions and recommendations: It is not possible to identify patients with the need to speak to a social-worker, based on the way people scored on the survey. The emotional survey could however be used as a way for patients to reflect on their emotional wellbeing. Furthermore additional research could be conducted on the subject of patients’ emotional wellbeing and psychosocial aid during the entire treatment cycle. ...|$|E
