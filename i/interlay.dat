For the biostratigraphical {{characterization}} of the metamorphic formations, beside the structure and tectonic particularities, the only biostratigraphical guide – marks are represented by the acritarchs and chitinozoans assemblages. For Upper Formation (Tg. 4) of Tulghes Group from Eastern Carpathians is an example difficult to study and biostratigraphical correlation due to its boundary position between Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician. Previous studies on chitinozoan and acritarch assemblages allowed some interesting palynological and biostratigraphical conclusions. The position of our country’s territory in Perigondwanaland, {{at the intersection of}} warm and cold microfloristic element, from Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician, as well as the total lack of trilobite and graptolite fossil rests, for zonation and analogy, tectonization and the powerful metamorphism of the analyzed samples induced great difficulties in the biostratigraphical {{characterization of}} these formations. We consider that any biostratigraphical boundary between different geological formations represents a palaeobiological transitory zone, with an exchange and a gradual replacement of faunistic and floristic elements, with the turning up of palaeobiological assemblages with biostratigraphical provincialism characters.

Horizons of poikilitic olivine gabbros in the core represent magma chamber replenishment in which the replenishing magma ponded {{at the base of the}} chamber and fractionated. Variations in plagioclase trace element compositions (e. g. La/Nd and Ba/K) in part reflect compositional variation in their parental melts derived from the mantle. Calculated equilibrium melt compositions are highly LREE depleted (Lan/Ndn as low as 0. 25).;Brown-pyroxene gabbros are olivine - plagioclase - clinopyroxene cumulates which have more evolved mineral compositions than poikilitic olivine gabbros. A series of major and trace element characteristics of the rocks, and textural phenomena, indicate that post-cumulus processes were important in their formation. In particular, extreme variations in incompatible element abundances, and fractionation of Zr and Y (and REE's), from the core to rim of clinopyroxene crystals occurs. It is proposed that the fractionation of the interstitial melt was caused by reaction between migration interstitial melt and the crystal assemblage (magmatic metasomatism). This led to the interstitial melt becoming highly evolved in terms of incompatible elements whilst the major elements were efficiently buffered by the crystals. ...|$|R
40|$|A pilot seismic microzonation of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) {{is used to}} {{establish}} the conditions and limitations of geophysical methods for site response investigations in city conditions. Maps of fundamental soil resonant frequencies, amplifications at these frequencies and interpolated average shear wave velocity of top 30 m of soil profile (VS- 30) used in soil classification were compared to the maps of drift thickness and surficial geology for the GTA. The non-applicability of the interpolated VS- 30 map for site classification between measured test points is indicated. It is also shown that the soil response cannot be estimated properly using VS- 30 values only. In order to enhance the capability of the horizontal-to-vertical-spectral-ratio (HVSR) method to resolve the fundamental soil resonances, a procedure and a computer program were developed for separation of ambient vibrations from nearby traffic as well as distant sources using the recorded waveforms before calculating the HVSR. A portable seismic station was developed for field HVSR waveforms recordings. It was also used for identification of building vibration modes. The influence of building vibrations on the HVSR result was investigated considering a benchmark building before construction started and after its completion. This influence is expressed as suppression or split-up of HVSR resonance if the building and soil resonances are close. This effect spreads out to distances comparable to the maximum dimension of the building. The experimentally obtained building resonant frequency at first vibration mode {{was found to be}} significantly higher than that calculated using empirical equations proposed by building codes, while the damping factor was less than the prescribed value. Additionally, the concept of using the HVSR inside a building to identify its resonances was examined using recorded waveforms, but the results did not confirm applicability of the HVSR for this purpose. The limitations and initial conditions that are necessary for successful implementation of refracted shear wave seismic profiling (SH-profiling) and multi-channel-analysis-ofsurface- waves (MASW) methods for application in urban areas are discussed.

It is especially focused on Czech food sellers trying to compete against transnational companies entering and operating on Czech market. One of possibilities how to face geographically and financially strong subjects is vertical cooperation and creation trade alliances. It means joining individual small and medium sized wholesalers and retailers into one association representing all members. Main advantages of these cooperative structures are lower purchase costs due to common negotiation with suppliers and co-financing of some activities (for example promotion). It {{is very important to}} sustain the diversity of retail market because of ensuring and forming competitive environment and offering the miscellaneous forms of retail to final consumers. That is why the main goal {{of this paper is to}} find out last changes and contemporary position and structure of the food independent trade alliances with prediction of future development. It is necessary to mention the fact that data is quite difficult to gain for this purpose. There are yearbooks of Czech and Slovak trade where some important information are published namely sales of food trade alliances are used like main indicator to describe and predict their development. A suitable statistic method has to be selected to fulfil the stated goal. Time series and <b>interlay</b> with trend curve seem like the most suitable instrument. In case of individual trade alliances the linear or logarithmic function will be used according to course of sales...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThermal {{damage to}} {{peripheral}} nerves is a known complication of endovenous thermal ablation (EVA) {{of the small}} saphenous vein (SSV). Therefore, the main objective of this anatomic study was to define a safe zone in the lower leg where EVA of the SSV can be performed safely. MethodsThe anatomy of the SSV and adjacent nerves was studied in 20 embalmed human specimens. The absolute distances between the SSV and the sural nerve (SN) (closest/nearest branch) were measured over the complete length of the leg (> 120 data points per leg), {{and the presence of}} the <b>interlaying</b> deep fascia was mapped. The distance between the SSV and the tibial nerve (TN) and the common peroneal nerve was assessed. A new analysis method, computer-assisted surgical anatomy mapping, was used to visualize the gathered data. ResultsThe distance between the SSV and the SN was highly variable. In the proximal one-third of the lower leg, the distance between the vein and the nerve was < 5 mm in 70 % of the legs. In 95 %, the deep fascia was present between the SSV and the SN. In the distal two-thirds of the lower leg, the distance between the vein and the nerve was < 5 mm in 90 % of the legs. The deep fascia was present between both structures in 15 %. In 19 legs, the SN partially ran beneath the deep fascia. In the saphenopopliteal region, the average shortest distance between the SSV and the TN was 4. 4 mm. In 20 %, the distance was < 1 mm. The average, shortest distance between the SSV and the common peroneal nerve was 14. 2 mm. The distance was < 1 mm in one leg. ConclusionsAt the saphenopopliteal region, the TN is at risk during EVA. In the distal two-thirds of the lower leg, the SN is at risk for (thermal) damage due to the small distance to the SSV and the absence of the deep fascia between both structures. The proximal one-third of the lower leg is the optimal region for EVA of the SSV to avoid nerve damage; the fascia between the SSV and the SN is a natural barrier in this region that could preclude (thermal) damage to the nerve. Clinical RelevanceIatrogenic damage to peripheral nerves is a known, incapacitating complication of endovenous thermal ablation (EVA) of the small saphenous vein (SSV). Although EVA is quickly replacing conventional surgery as the treatment of choice for saphenous ablation, no consensus has been reached regarding the surgical landmarks for a safe EVA of the SSV. This study describes and visualizes the anatomic limits in relation to the sural nerve and deep crural fascia, the tibial nerve, and the common peroneal nerve using a new anatomy mapping tool, computer-assisted surgical anatomy mapping. The results offer the surgeon {{a better understanding of the}} complex anatomy of the SSV and thereby provide surgical guidelines to reduce complications of EVA of the SSV...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe CBM {{experiment}} {{will investigate}} strongly interacting matter at extreme densities {{at the future}} accelerator facility FAIR in Darmstadt, in search for the first-order phase transition from confined to deconfined matter. Key observables of CBM are strange and charmed hadrons. We discuss {{the performance of the}} planned experimental setup with respect to the measurement of strange and multi-strange hadrons, open charm and charmonium, based on detailed detector simulations which include a realistic detector response. Prospects for strangeness and charm measurements with the CBM experiment 2 1. The CBM experiment The interest in the high-density part of the QCD phase diagram and its features, namely the possible first-order phase transition from confined to deconfined matter, the critical endpoint separating the first-order transition region from that of a cross-over at lower densities, and the properties of hadrons in a dense environment, reflect in several experimental activities in accelerator laboratories around the world: the RHIC energy scan programme, the NA 61 activities at CERN-SPS, the NICA project at JINR Dubna, and the CBM project at the future facility FAIR in Darmstadt [1]. Amongst them, the fixed-target experiment CBM provides the unique opportunity to study extremely rare probes like charmed hadrons, which are close to their production thresholds at FAIR beam energies (10 - 45 A GeV). This opportunity is due to the high beam intensities to be delivered by the SIS- 300 synchrotron of FAIR (up to 10 9 ions/s), giving rise to interaction rates of up to 10 MHz with a typical 1 % interaction target. CBM is being designed to measure hadronic, leptonic and photonic observables in a large acceptance, covering the full p t range and rapidities from centre-of-mass rapidity close to beam rapidity. The planned experimental setup is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core tracker (STS), consisting of eight stations of Silicon microstrip detectors, is located between the yokes of a super-conducting dipole magnet. Close to the target, the Micro-Vertex Detector (MVD) provides excellent resolution of displaced vertices from open charm decays. Downstream of the STS, a RICH and several layers of Transition Radiation Detectors (TRD) provide electron identification in a large momentum range. The TRD also serves for global tracking, connecting the tracks reconstructed in the STS with the time-of-flight wall located approximately 10 m downstream of the target. An electromagentic calorimeter after the TOF detector enables the measurement of neutral particles. The setup is completed with a downstream calorimeter (PSD) for event characterisation in terms of centrality and reaction plane angle. For muon measurements, the RICH will be replaced by an absorber system <b>interlayed</b> with several tracking detector planes, allowing to follow the tracks reconstructed in the main tracker through the setup (right panel of Fig. 1). In the following, we present results of physics performance studies in this detector system. They are based on the simulation of signals embedded into typical background events generated by UrQMD [2]. If not mentioned otherwise, all results refer to the collision system Au+Au at 25 A GeV beam momentum. The results were obtained with full detector response simulation and event reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Airplanes are the man-­‐made {{birds of}} the sky. Their {{efficiency}} for travelling, humanitarian aid, war  and  transport  are  self-­‐evident.   They  have  demonstrated  to  be  safe  and  fast,  with  a  constant  {{increase in the}} number of users and passengers throughout the years. Intense research is carried out in this field, and the aerodynamics, electronics and materials of the aircrafts have been continuously evolving. The aerospace and automotive industries have been replacing heavy materials, such as steel or aluminium, by lighter and tougher alternatives such as composite materials, which play nowadays a dramatic role in aircraft’s composition. For example, aluminium is being replaced by GLARE (“Glass Laminate Aluminium Reinforced Epoxy"), a structure that <b>interlays</b> aluminium films with glass fibre prepreg  laminates,  with  better  damage  tolerance,  corrosion  and  fire  resistance,  and  lower  specific  weight than conventional aluminium. Boeing 787 is made by a 50 % of composite materials, including them in its fuselage, wings, tail, doors and interior. Airbus 380, the world’s largest passenger airliner, is made by a 25 % of composite materials. Composites used in the aerospace engineering are made of a resin, generally a polymer, and a reinforcement, such as carbon or glass fibres. In particular, according to F. Fischer et al. : “The use  of  carbon-­‐fibre  reinforced  plastics  (CFRP)   is  increasing  in  all  areas  where  weight  reduction  enables an improvement, either in an economic or ecological way or as regards performance”. Polymers  can  be,  essentially,  of  three  kinds:  thermoplastics,  thermosets  and  elastomers.   Polymers  count with the benefits of excellent bulk and surface properties, low cost and good mechanical applications  nowadays.   Thermoplastics  present  high  ductility,  fracture  toughness  and  impact  resistance; moreover, thermoplastic composites (TPCs) can be cost-­‐effectively joined and manufactured.   Thermosets,  on  the  other  hand,  do  not  count  with  these  properties,  but  they  have  good compression, fatigue resistance and creep resistance. Regarding their characteristics, for some applications, thermoplastics may be used, and for others, thermosets are the answer: Thermoplastics are preferably used in small to medium-­‐sized parts, and thermosets are more economical to be used in  large  parts.   Their  combination,  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  both  materials  for  each application, is a fact in current aircraft structures. Here is where the main challenge of using these new materials arises: the joining of thermoplastics and thermosets. Mechanical fastening is the conventional  method  to  join  these  materials.   For  example,  in  the  fuselage  of  A 350,  the  structural  frame is joined to the thermoset composite skin through thermoplastic clips and cleats. Apart from the extra weight and stress concentrations they imply – lightweight potential of the composite material  is  lost  due  to  the  need  of  reinforcement  in  the  areas  where  the  rivets  and  screws  are  inserted – when insufficient economical investment is devoted to their insertion, in order to assure the correct performance of the joining procedure, several problems may occur, such as delamination, water intrusion, galvanic corrosion and intensive labour they induce, among others. Then, in order to avoid the damage of the composite materials, and to save weight and economical resources, other joining alternatives are being taken into account [...] .
