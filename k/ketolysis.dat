50|$|There {{are some}} health {{benefits}} to ketone bodies and ketogenesis as well.

5000|$|OXCT1 is {{a member}} of the CoA {{transferase}} family I, which is known to catalyze the transfer of CoA between carboxylic acid groups. In particular, OXCT1 catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step in <b>ketolysis</b> by transferring the CoA from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetyl CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA can then be converted by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase into acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle to generate energy for the cell. As a result, OXCT1 allows cells to utilize energy stored in ketone bodies synthesized by the liver during conditions of energy deficiency, such as low glucose levels. In addition, OXCT1 activity leads to the formation of acetoacetate, which serves as a precursor for short-chain acyl-CoAs and lipids in the cytosol.|$|E
5000|$|... β-Hydroxybutyrate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} ketone bodies, followed by acetoacetate and finally acetone. β-Hydroxybutyrate and Acetoacetate can pass through membranes easily, {{and are therefore a}} source of energy for the brain, which cannot directly metabolize fatty acids. The brain receives 60-70% of its required energy from ketone bodies when blood glucose levels are low. These bodies are transported into the brain by monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 2 [...] Therefore, ketone bodies are a way to move energy from the liver to other cells. The liver does not have the critical enzyme, succinyl CoA transferase, to process ketone bodies, and therefore cannot undergo <b>ketolysis.</b> The result is that the liver only produces ketone bodies, but does not use a significant amount of them.|$|E

40|$|Ketone body {{utilisation}} is {{of special}} importance {{in times of}} fasting/starvation or increased energy demand.

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to the textbooks, the ketotic {{glycogen}} {{storage disease}} (GSD) types 0, III, VI, IX, and XI {{are associated with}} fasting ketotic hypoglycemia and considered milder as gluconeogenesis is intact. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of biochemical profiles from supervised clinical fasting studies is performed in ketotic GSD patients in our metabolic center. For data analysis, hypoglycemia was defined as plasma glucose concentration < 2. 6 mmol/L. Total KB {{was defined as the}} sum of blood acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. If the product of glucose and KB concentrations was greater than 10, a <b>ketolysis</b> defect was suspected. RESULTS: Data could be collected from 13 fasting studies in 12 patients with GSD III (n[*]=[*] 4), GSD VI (n[*]=[*] 3), and GSD IX (n[*]=[*] 5). Six patients remained normoglycemic with median glucose concentration of 3. 9 mmol/L (range, 2. 8 - 4. 6 mmol/L) and median total KB concentration of 1. 9 mmol/L (range, 0. 6 - 5. 1 mmol/L). The normoglycemic patients included type VI (3 out of 3) and type IX (3 out of 5) patients. All type III patients developed ketotic hypoglycemia. Interestingly, in five patients (one GSD III, one GSD VI, and three GSD IX), the biochemical profile suggested a <b>ketolysis</b> defect. CONCLUSION: Normoglycemic ketonemia is a common biochemical presentation in patients with GSD types VI and IX, and ketonemia can precede hypoglycemia in all studied GSD types. Therefore, GSD VI and GSD IX should be added to the differential diagnosis of ketotic normoglycemia, and KB concentrations should be routinely measured in ketotic GSD patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{associated}} with cardiac hypertrophy that leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To date, use of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockade has been the main treatment modality. However, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockade by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) can only partially reverse the cardiac hypertrophy without having {{a significant impact on}} all-cause mortality as evidenced by meta-analyses from clinical trials. It is imperative to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of CKD-related cardiomyopathy for potential targets in further treatment. Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent subtotal nephrectomy (SNX) rats were established as the CKD model. A hemodynamic study was used to evaluate the left ventricle (LV) structural and functional alterations. We used proteomic techniques to profile the LV protein changes among sham-operated rats, SNX rats, and SNX rats with 6 months of ACEi enalapril interventions. The differentially expressed proteins were further annotated by functional and network analyses. Results: As compared to the sham-operated rats, the SNX rats had 25 upregulated and 46 decreased protein expression. The top canonical pathways identified by ingenuity pathway analysis for the CKD cardiomyopathy were mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid β oxidation, protein ubiquitination, and <b>ketolysis.</b> The most relevant functions extracted from these networks contained 27 and 23 focused proteins, respectively. They were related to cellular assembly and organization, RNA posttranscriptional modification, and protein synthesis. After ACEi intervention for 6 weeks, the residual canonical pathways identified by ingenuity pathway analysis that mediated the CKD-related cardiomyopathy were mitochondrial dysfunction, <b>ketolysis,</b> phenylalanine degradation IV, and putrescine degradation III. There were decreased Sirt 3 and SNRNP, and increased monoamine oxidase and SAHH expression in the LV of SNX rats that could not be reversed by the ACEi. Conclusion: Our studies provide a repertoire of potential biomarkers related to cardiac hypertrophy in CKD. There are still residual disturbed molecules/pathways despite ACEi intervention. Further studies are warranted to investigate these potential novel targets to alleviate CKD-related cardiomyopathy...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, control CMRGlu* was {{comparable}} to the data reported by Kreissl et al. in mice exposed to a similar fasting duration [25]. However, this value was almost halved after 48 -h STS. In agreement with the evident decrease in PFK [26] activity, this response confirms previous studies showing a profound deceleration in brain glycolytic rate after prolonged food deprivation and weight loss both in humans [5, 6] and rodents [27]. A similar consideration applies to the almost fivefold increase of BHBDH activity in starved brains. This observation agrees with the acknowledged brain metabolic response to STS in which the preferential utilization of ketone bodies [28] accelerates cell respiration as confirmed by the enhancement in mitochondrial Complex I function. Similarly, the relatively low OXPHOS efficiency [24] of <b>ketolysis,</b> and the consequent rise in reactive oxygen species, nicely explains the increase in glutathione reductase activity [29] as a basic cell response to oxidative stress.|$|E
40|$|Succinyl CoA: 3 -oxoacid CoA {{transferase}} (SCOT; E. C. 2. 8. 3. 5) mediates the {{rate-determining step}} of <b>ketolysis</b> in extrahepatic tissues, the esterification of acetoacetate to CoA {{for use in}} energy production. Hereditary SCOT deficiency in humans causes episodes of severe ketoacidosis. We obtained human-heart SCOT cDNA clones spanning the entire 1, 560 -nt coding sequence. Sequence alignment of the human SCOT peptides with other known CoA transferases revealed several conserved regions of potential functional importance. A single approximately 3. 2 -kb SCOT mRNA is present in human tissues (heart > leukocytes >> fibroblasts), but no signal is detectable in the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2. We mapped the human SCOT locus (OXCT) to the cytogenetic band 5 p 13 by in situ hybridization. From fibroblasts of a patient with hereditary SCOT deficiency, we amplified and cloned cDNA fragments containing the entire SCOT coding sequence. We found a homozygous C-to-G transversion at nt 848, which changes the Ser 283 codon to a stop codon. This mutation (S 283 X) is incompatible with normal enzyme function and represents the first documentation of a pathogenic mutation in SCOT deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Acetoacetate (AcAc) and 3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB), the {{two main}} ketone bodies of humans, are {{important}} vectors of energy transport from the liver to extrahepatic tissues, especially during fasting, when glucose supply is low. Blood total ketone body (TKB) levels should be evaluated {{in the context of}} clinical history, such as fasting time and ketogenic stresses. Blood TKB should also be evaluated in parallel with blood glucose and free fatty acids (FFA). The FFA/TKB ratio is especially useful for evaluation of ketone body metabolism. Defects in ketogenesis include mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (mHS) deficiency and HMG-CoA lyase (HL) deficiency. mHS deficiency should be considered in non-ketotic hypoglycemia if a fatty acid beta-oxidation defect is suspected, but cannot be confirmed. Patients with HL deficiency can develop hypoglycemic crises and neurological symptoms even in adolescents and adults. Succinyl-CoA- 3 -oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency and beta-ketothiolase (T 2) deficiency are two defects in <b>ketolysis.</b> Permanent ketosis is pathognomonic for SCOT deficiency. However, patients with "mild" SCOT mutations may have nonketotic periods. T 2 -deficient patients with "mild" mutations may have normal blood acylcarnitine profiles even in ketoacidotic crises.

40|$|High energy {{demands of}} neurons make them {{vulnerable}} to {{adverse effects of}} energy impairment. Recently, astrocytes were shown to regulate the flux of energy substrates to neurons. In pathological situations, astrocytes are activated but the consequences on brain energy metabolism are still poorly characterized. We found that local lentiviral-mediated gene transfer of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a cytokine known to activate astrocytes, induced a stable decrease in the glycolytic flux in the rat striatum in vivo as measured by 2 -[18 F]- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose autoradiography and micro-positron emission tomography imaging. The activity of the mitochondrial complex IV enzyme cytochrome oxidase was not modified, suggesting maintenance of downstream oxidative steps of energy production. CNTF significantly increased the phosphorylation level of the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), supporting a specific reorganization of brain energy pathways. Indeed, we found that different key enzymes/transporters of fatty acids beta-oxidation and <b>ketolysis</b> were overexpressed by CNTF-activated astrocytes within the striatum. In primary striatal neuron/astrocyte mixed cultures exposed to CNTF, the AMPK pathway was also activated, {{and the rate of}} oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies was significantly enhanced. This metabolic plasticity conferred partial glial and neuronal protection against prolonged palmitate exposure and glycolysis inhibition. We conclude that CNTF-activated astrocytes may have a strong protective potential to face severe metabolic insults...|$|E
40|$|In humans, the six {{identified}} thiolases {{participate in}} many biochemical pathways. Depending on subcellular location, thiolases either degrade CoA activated fatty acids or catalyse the initial steps of various biosynthetic pathways. Three of the characterized thiolases {{are confined to}} mitochondria. The mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, also known as T 2, is a short chain specific thiolase and is, therefore, classified as a biosynthetic thiolase (EC 2. 3. 1. 9) [1]. T 2 controls the pool of acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA are mainly produced through β-oxidation, the pathway that uses fatty acids to provide molecules for energy production (Fig. 1 A). When there is great excess of acetyl-CoA, T 2 synthesizes acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA is then fed into the HMG-CoA pathway, which ultimately leads to ketone body, acetoacetate, formation (Fig. 1 A). Ketone bodies are fat derived energy for extrahepatic tissues. In the extrahepatic cells, T 2 produces acetyl-CoA from acetoacetyl-CoA in a pathway known as <b>ketolysis</b> (Fig. 1 B) [3, 4]. Thereafter, acetyl-CoA is fed into citric acid cycle from which the electrons are carried through the respiratory chain to produce ATP. The third important function of T 2 is to degrade 2 -methylacetoacetyl-CoA in the isoleucine catabolism pathway (Fig. 1 C) [2]. Figure 1 : T 2 participates in various biochemical pathways.

40|$|Anabolism and catabolism. The {{study of}} metabolism, as pursued {{up to the}} present, {{is the study of}} catabolism. The {{contrast}} between the detailed chemistry of catabolism on the one hand, and the vague gen-eralisations with regard to anabolic processes on the other, stands out keenly, and in no group of substances is this so clearly seen as with the proteins. With the exception of the mode of action of pepsin, and to sume extent, the mechanism of deamination, it may be said that the study of protein catabolism has met with considerable success at all points; the hydrolysis to the amino-acids; the identification of these; the studies on proteolytic enzymes; <b>ketolysis</b> and ketogenesis; urea synthesis:-all these processes are more or less understood, and it is possible to trace in some detail, in normal conditions, a high percentage of protein nitrogen from one end of its course in the body to the other. What is known of the corresponding anabolic processes? Nitrogen, ingested in the form of protein, is laid down as protein in the tissues. The amino-acids are generally assumed to be the highest common factor in this change, and the anabolic process is regarded as the synthesis of body protein from the amino-acids traversing the walls of the intestinal canal. The only observations calculated to throw any light on this synthesis are those of Blackwood (1932) following the earlier work of Cary (1920, 1926); namely, that in the blood stream afferent to a site of protein synthesis, the amino-acids are in higher concentration than in the efferent. Catabolic processes are readily stimulated, initiated and controlled. Control of the anabolic processes is only through hormones of unknown action; protein synthesis can be stimulated by the administration of the anterior pituitary growth hormone, but this has, thus far, thrown n...|$|E
40|$|Glycerol kinase {{deficiency}} (GKD) is an X-linked recessive disorder. There are two types. {{an isolated}} form and a complex form. We review the clinical, biochemical and molecular genetic features of GKD. The clinical and biochemical phenotype of isolated GKD may vary from a life-threatening childhood metabolic crisis to asymptomatic adult 'pseudohypertriglyceridaemia', resulting from hyperglycerolaemia. To date 38 patients from 24 families with isolated GKD have been reported. At least 7 {{of these patients}} had a metabolic crisis during a catabolic condition. The complex GKD is an Xp 21 contiguous gene syndrome involving the glycerol kinase locus together with the adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) loci or both. Clinical features of a patient with complex GKD depend on the loci that are involved. Approximately 100 patients from 78 families with a complex GKD have been reported. Seventeen patients with complex GKD (AHC-GKD-DMD or AHC-GKD) died in the neonatal period or early childhood because of unrecognized or inappropriate management of adrenal dysfunction. Since {{the outcome of the}} crisis in GKD is highly dependent on the physicians' knowledge of the disease, we devised an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis. From molecular genetic investigations of isolated GKD, 7 missense mutations, 2 splice site mutations, I nonsense mutation, 1 Alu Sx insertion and 2 small deletions were reported for isolated GKD in 13 unrelated families. In 4 families consisting of more than one patient with the same biochemical and genetic defect, the phenotypic variability of the isolated GKD was remarkable. The clinical variability in isolated GKD cannot be explained by biochemical or by molecular heterogeneity. Isolated GKD patients showed a tendency towards hypoglycaemia with hyperketonaemia; whether the clinical symptoms of GKD are caused by dysfunction of gluconeogenesis and/or <b>ketolysis</b> needs to be investigated furthe...|$|E
40|$|The E 2 F pathway plays a {{critical}} role in cardiac growth and development, yet its role in cardiac metabolism remains to be defined. Metabolic changes play important roles in human heart failure and studies imply the ketogenic enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase I (BDH 1) is a potential biomarker. To define the role of the E 2 F pathway in cardiac metabolism and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a focus on BDH 1. We previously developed transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the transcriptional repressor, E 2 F 6, to interfere with the E 2 F/Rb pathway in post-natal myocardium. These Tg mice present with an E 2 F 6 dose dependent DCM and deregulated connexin- 43 (CX- 43) levels in myocardium. Using the Seahorse platform, a 22 % decrease in glycolysis was noted in neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from E 2 F 6 -Tg hearts. This was associated with a 39 % reduction in the glucose transporter GLUT 4 and 50 % less activation of the regulator of glucose metabolism AKT 2. The specific reduction of cyclin B 1 (70 %) in Tg myocardium implicates its importance in supporting glycolysis in the postnatal heart. No changes in cyclin D expression (known to regulate mitochondrial activity) were noted and lipid metabolism remained unchanged in neonatal cardiomyocytes from Tg hearts. However, E 2 F 6 induced a 40 -fold increase of the Bdh 1 transcript and 890 % increase in its protein levels in hearts from Tg pups implying a potential impact on <b>ketolysis.</b> By contrast, BDH 1 expression is not activated until adulthood in normal myocardium. Neonatal cardiomyocytes from Wt hearts incubated with the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) showed a 100 % increase in CX- 43 protein levels, implying a role for ketone signaling in gap junction biology. Neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures from Tg hearts exhibited enhanced levels of BDH 1 and CX- 43 and were not responsive to β-OHB. The data reveal a novel role for the E 2 F pathway in regulating glycolysis in the developing myocardium through a mechanism involving cyclin B 1. We reveal BDH 1 expression as an early biomarker of heart failure and its potential impact, through ketone signaling, on CX- 43 levels in E 2 F 6 -induced DCM...|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic ketotic {{hypoglycemia}} {{is characterized}} by hypoglycemia and elevated levels of ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) during fasting. The affected children are otherwise healthy and they usually present with the condition before 5 years of age. Hypoglycemia usually develops in the morning {{after a period of}} reduced energy intake. The presenting symptoms are the classical signs of hypoglycemia: paleness, tachycardia, sweatiness, tremor, headache, vomiting, etc. The underlying mechanisms have not yet been clarified. The aim of this thesis was to investigate ketone body turnover and fasting tolerance in children and adults with previous symptoms of hypoglycemia and in patients with suspected defects in <b>ketolysis.</b> In Paper I, a pair of homozygotic twin boys were studied, one of whom had severe ketotic hypoglycemia while the other one was apparently healthy. A 24 -hour fasting tolerance test confirmed the diagnosis in the affected twin. The rates of glucose and glycerol production were measured and were similar in both boys. During infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 5 10 times more in the twin with idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia, indicating disturbed clearance or metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate. No mutations were found in the genes involved in ketone body metabolism or transport. In Paper II we studied whether an altered ketone body turnover might be the cause of idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia. Twenty-two children with previous symptoms of hypoglycemia underwent investigations {{similar to those of the}} boys in Paper I. The results of the rate of glucose production were compared with those of 9 healthy age-matched controls. Nine children developed idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia and their ketone body turnover differed from that of the normoglycemic children. The rate of glucose production was within the low normal range, and no mutations were found. The enzyme succinyl CoA- 3 :ketoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT) is involved in the metabolism of ketone bodies. In Paper III we investigated a child and an adult with suspected deficiencies in this enzyme and showing symptoms resembling those of idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia. In total, 5 novel mutations were identified in the SCOT gene. Despite this, the analysis of the enzyme showed only a 30 35 % decrease in activity, probably due to a nonspecific assay. A fasting tolerance test was terminated prematurely in both cases due to acidosis. During the test and also during the beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion, both patients showed high levels of ketone bodies. None of them developed hypoglycemia, and the glucose production rate was normal. Finally, in Paper IV, a group of adults who had had symptoms of hypoglycemia during fasting were investigated. None of them developed hypoglycemia, and, compared to a control group, no differences were found in the ketone body level or hormonal response. Conclusion The results suggest that neither a low rate of glucose production nor a reduced metabolism of ketone bodies alone can explain idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia. Instead, the combination of a disturbed ketone body metabolism and a glucose production rate within the low normal range seems to cause idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia. The cause of the disturbed ketone body metabolism is unknown. No adults with idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia were identified...|$|E
