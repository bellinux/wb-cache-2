The most income of the 25 farm households justly consists of self net agricultural income. That is gained by deducting the production cost and payable <b>farm</b> <b>rents</b> from gross agricultural income.

When the charity was first established the selection of the tenant widows was the responsibility of Bishop Ward, on his death the task fell alternately to the bishop and the dean and chapter. Over the intervening centuries the charity has benefited from the wills of various individuals, for example, William Benson Earle who left 2000 guineas in 1796, Thomas Henry Allen Poynder from Hartham Park in Corsham gave 1,000 guineas in 1865, Helen Nevill, who bequeathed £1,000 in 1929 and Mary Fletcher, who bequeathed £1,500 in 1953.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{the concepts of}} land rent {{from the standpoint of}} modern economics and accounts for the contributing factors {{in the formation of the}} agricultural land price during the pre-war and the post-war periods. It can be said the agricultural land price in the later Taisho period was conditioned by <b>farm</b> <b>rent</b> and as far as the pure farming region is concerned, the agricultural land price in the post-war period is also explained considerably by net returns per 10 ares of land, which is capitalized by an 8 percent interest rate. Furthermore, the increase in agricultural land price, based on the premises of constant return to scale and the supported price of farm products, has demonstrated that the rise in the agricultural land price is sufficiently explained by technological progress in rice production. Though various factors are considered important in the contribution to the formation of the agricultural land price in this paper the main emphasis is based upon the fact that the interior factors of agriculture considerably elucidate its formation throughout the pre-war and the post-war period. This is especially applicable to the agricultural land price in pure farming regions...|$|E

In a model with land as fixed factor and credit market imperfections, when an area payment is given, land rents go up by more than the subsidy. On aggregate farms may lose from the subsidy. The results depend {{on the extent to which}} subsidies have direct and indirect effects on the credit constraints, on whether <b>farms</b> <b>rent</b> or own land, and on farm heterogeneity...|$|R
