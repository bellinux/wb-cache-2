Plant growth conditions, growth media composition and <b>harvest</b> <b>methods</b> can {{have an effect on the}} microbial population of the plant, and therefore should be considered along with the optimization of plant growth and harvest yields to ensure a safe and palatable food crop. This work examines the effect of plant cultivar, growth media, and <b>harvest</b> <b>method</b> on plant microbial populations. Twelve varieties of leafy greens and herbs were grown on a mixture of Fafard # 2 and Arcillite in the pillow root containment system currently being considered for the VEGGIE plant growth unit developed by Orbitec. In addition,,Sierra and Outredgeous lettuce varieties were grown in three different mixtures (Fafard # 2, Ardllite, and Perlite/Vermiculite). The plants were analyzed for microbial density. Two <b>harvest</b> <b>methods,</b> "cut and come again" (CACA) and terminal harvest were also compared. In one set ofexpe'riments red leaf lettuce and mizuna were grown in pots in a Biomass Production System for education. Plants were harvested every two weeks by either method. Another set of experiments was performed using the rooting pillows to grow 5 varieties of leafy greens and cut harvesting at different intervals. Radishes were harvested and replanted at two-week intervals. Results indicate up to a 3 IOglO difference in microbial counts between some varieties of plants.

50|$|Difficulties in {{harvesting}} are {{the major}} barriers of orchard production and development the plants potential as a cash-crop. Harvesting the fruit is problematic because the fruit does not easily release from the stem. Different mechanical harvester have been developed, such as shaking, vacuum and quick freezing, but most have disadvantages of fruit and bark damage and low efficient. Except when frozen on the shrub, fresh fruit mechanical harvesting {{is still in the}} development stage. This is mainly due to the difficulty in separating the stem(pedicel) from the berry (pericarp). The mechanical <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> usually eliminates the necessity for maintenance pruning, leaving a hedge that has been uniformly cut back.

5000|$|In 1878, naturalist John Muir {{described}} the Indian method of harvesting pinyon seeds in Nevada. In September and October, the harvesters knocked the cones off the pinyon trees with poles, stacked the cones into a pile, put brushwood on top, lit it, and lightly scorched the pinyon cones with fire. The scorching burned off the sticky resin coating the cones and loosened the seeds. The cones were then dried {{in the sun}} until the seeds could be easily extracted. Muir said the Indians closely watched the pinyon trees year-round and could predict the scarcity or abundance of the crop months before harvest time. [...] In 1891, B. H. Dutcher observed the harvesting of pinyon seeds by the Panamint Indians (Timbisha people) in the Panamint Range overlooking Death Valley, California. The <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> {{was similar to the}} foregoing except that the pinyon seeds were extracted immediately after the cones had been scorched in the brushwood fire.|$|E
50|$|Cranberries are {{a kind of}} tart red berry {{produced}} by various plant species, but it is the large-fruited, or “American cranberry” (Vaccinium macrocarpon), that is farmed for commercial production. Currently, the main cranberry farming Canadian provinces are British Columbia, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. However, the lower temperatures present in the Eastern provinces require the use of irrigation and flooding to prevent frost damage and moisture loss. Wet harvesting is the common <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> used for cranberries that are to become cranberry juice. A paddled machine called a water reel harvester is used to separate the ripe cranberries from the vines, then collected through a large suction pipe and transported by truck to a processing plant. At the processing plant, the cranberries go through a sequence of fruit crushing, mash maceration, mash heating, juice pressing, and pasteurization to produce a cranberry concentrate that is separated from pulp. To prepare a cranberry juice/cocktail product, cranberry juice concentrate is reconstituted with varying amounts of water, specified by the solicitation, contract, or purchase order.|$|E
50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the conveyor roller itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated conveyor roller condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within conveyor rollers when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict conveyor roller failure. This ultimately makes conveyor roller condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the conveyor roller, using a dynamo style energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make conveyor rollers can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their conveyor roller products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|E

50|$|Standing Stem Harvesting, a {{selective}} <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> within Heli-Logging, {{was invented by}} Philip Jarman of Port Alberni, British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple {{which was to be}} operated by a K-Max Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted, jettisonable sled carrying a hydraulic power pack, to operate the grapple.Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a grapple designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively.|$|E
