5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory {{withdrawal from the}} market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Five {{different}} amphetamine-based pharmaceuticals {{are currently}} used in ADHD treatment: racemic amphetamine, <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> lisdexamfetamine, and two mixed enantiomer products (Adderall and Dyanavel XR). Lisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> (i.e., lisdexamfetamine itself doesn't {{do anything in}} the body, but it metabolizes into <b>dextroamphetamine).</b> Adderall is a proprietary mixture of (75%) <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and (25%) levoamphetamine salts, which results in very mild differences between their effects. Dyanavel XR contains a similar mixture. Adderall begins to work before <b>dextroamphetamine</b> because of levoamphetamine. Levoamphetamine also provides Adderall with a longer clinical effect than <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> Some children with ADHD and comorbid disorders respond well to levoamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|Stimulants such as cocaine, {{amphetamine}} (Adderall), <b>dextroamphetamine</b> (Dexedrine), methamphetamine (Desoxyn), methcathinone, and methylphenidate (Ritalin).|$|E
25|$|In drug {{discrimination}} studies, methcathinone hydrochloride evokes responses {{similar to}} those induced by both <b>dextroamphetamine</b> sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. When examined in particular pharmacological assays for psychomotor stimulant-like activity, both the dextrorotary and levorotary enantiomeric forms of methcathinone hydrochloride {{have been found to}} be pharmacologically active. In these assays, the l-form of methcathinone is more active than either d-methcathinone or <b>dextroamphetamine</b> (this is notable as the dextrorotary isomer is the more active isomer of both amphetamine and methamphetamine).|$|E
25|$|Some street {{dealers are}} selling methcathinone as <b>dextroamphetamine</b> or methamphetamine but {{the drug is}} more {{dangerous}} to people who inject it than the more common amphetamine.|$|E
25|$|The body metabolizes meth{{amphetamine}} into amphetamine (in {{addition to}} less active metabolites). A quarter of methamphetamine will ultimately become amphetamine. After comparing only {{the common ground}} between <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and dextromethamphetamine, the latter {{is said to be}} the stronger stimulant.|$|E
25|$|The main {{treatment}} of {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} in narcolepsy is central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> modafinil, and armodafinil. In late 2007 an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to modafinil was issued by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine – ADHD is {{associated}} with increased caffeine consumption, and caffeine's stimulant effects on cognition may have some benefits for ADHD. Limited evidence suggests a small therapeutic effect that is markedly inferior to standard treatments like methylphenidate and <b>dextroamphetamine</b> while still producing similar or greater side effects.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{stimulant}} and non-stimulant medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), <b>dextroamphetamine</b> (Dexedrine), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv), and clonidine (Kapvay). Other medicines which may be prescribed off-label include bupropion (Wellbutrin), tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, or MAOIs. The presence of comorbid (co-occurring) disorders can make finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more complicated, costly, and time-consuming. So it is recommended to assess and simultaneously treat any comorbid disorders.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), <b>dextroamphetamine</b> (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
500|$|<b>Dextroamphetamine</b> is a {{more potent}} agonist of [...] than levoamphetamine. Consequently, <b>dextroamphetamine</b> {{produces}} greater [...] stimulation than levoamphetamine, roughly {{three to four times}} more, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects.|$|E
500|$|The two {{amphetamine}} enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and <b>dextroamphetamine)</b> {{alleviate the}} symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing {{the activity of the}} neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which results in part from their interactions with trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. [...] <b>Dextroamphetamine</b> is a more potent [...] stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life (i.e., it remains in the body longer) than <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the treatment response in some individuals relative to <b>dextroamphetamine</b> alone. Adderall's active ingredient, amphetamine, shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human trace amines, particularly phenethylamine and , the latter of which is a positional isomer of amphetamine.|$|E
500|$|Amphetamine, {{the active}} {{ingredient}} of Adderall, works primarily by increasing {{the activity of the}} neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. [...] It also triggers the release of several other hormones (e.g., epinephrine) and neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin and histamine) as well as the synthesis of certain neuropeptides (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptides). Both active ingredients of Adderall, <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and levoamphetamine, bind to the same biological targets, but their binding affinities (that is, potency) differ somewhat. <b>Dextroamphetamine</b> and levoamphetamine are both potent full agonists (activating compounds) of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and interact with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), with <b>dextroamphetamine</b> being the more potent agonist of TAAR1. Consequently, <b>dextroamphetamine</b> produces more [...] stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects. It has been reported that certain children have a better clinical response to levoamphetamine.|$|E
500|$|Chemically, Adderall is {{a mixture}} of four {{amphetamine}} salts; specifically, it is composed of equal parts (by mass) of amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, <b>dextroamphetamine</b> sulfate, and <b>dextroamphetamine</b> saccharate. This drug mixture has slightly stronger [...] effects than racemic amphetamine due to the higher proportion of <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> Adderall is produced as both an immediate release (IR) and extended release (XR) formulation. , ten different companies produced generic Adderall IR, while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Actavis, and Barr Pharmaceuticals manufactured generic Adderall XR. , Shire plc, the company that held the original patent for Adderall and Adderall XR, still manufactured brand name Adderall XR, but not Adderall IR.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} chiral resolutions have been {{developed}} to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine. For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with [...] to form a diastereoisomeric salt which is fractionally crystallized to yield <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale. In addition, several enantioselective syntheses of amphetamine {{have been developed}}. In one example, optically pure [...] is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral Schiff base. [...] In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group. [...] Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure <b>dextroamphetamine.</b>|$|E
500|$|Amphetamine (contracted from [...] ) is {{a potent}} central nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} that {{is used in the}} treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use.|$|E
500|$|The first {{amphetamine}} pharmaceutical was Benzedrine, a brand {{which was}} used to treat a variety of conditions. [...] Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine, through activation of a trace amine receptor, increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmitter activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine.|$|E
500|$|For the assays, a study {{noted that}} an enzyme multiplied {{immunoassay}} technique (EMIT) assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine may produce more false positives than liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the derivatizing agent [...] chloride {{allows for the}} detection of methamphetamine in urine. [...] GC–MS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the chiral derivatizing agent Mosher'sacid chloride allows {{for the detection of}} both <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and dextromethamphetamine in urine. [...] Hence, the latter method may be used on samples that test positive using other methods to help distinguish between the various sources of the drug.|$|E
500|$|A severe {{amphetamine}} overdose {{can result}} in a stimulant psychosis that may involve a variety of symptoms, such as delusions and paranoia. [...] A Cochrane Collaboration review on treatment for amphetamine, <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> and methamphetamine psychosis states that about [...] of users fail to recover completely.About 5–15% of the users who develop an amphetamine psychosis fail to recover completely (Hofmann 1983)...Findings from one trial indicate use of antipsychotic medications effectively resolves symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.}} According to the same review, {{there is at least one}} trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.|$|E
500|$|Children with ADHD who use {{stimulant}} medications {{generally have}} better relationships with peers and family members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. The Cochrane Collaboration's reviews {{on the treatment}} of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that while these drugs improve short-term symptoms, they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects. A Cochrane Collaboration review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse, but high doses of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> could exacerbate tics in some individuals.|$|E

2500|$|Amphetamine is a chiral {{compound}} {{which is}} composed of two isomers: levoamphetamine and <b>dextroamphetamine.</b> [...] Levoamphetamine and <b>dextroamphetamine</b> have the same chemical formula but are mirror images of each other, {{the same way that}} a person's hands are the same but are mirror images of each other. This mirror difference is enough to produce a small difference in their pharmacological properties; levoamphetamine has a slightly longer half-life than <b>dextroamphetamine,</b> but <b>dextroamphetamine</b> is a more potent central nervous system stimulant. Although it is effective in reducing primary ADHD symptoms such as hyperactivity and inattention, multiple adverse side effects presented.

50|$|Lisdexamfetamine was {{developed}} {{with the goal}} of providing a long duration of effect that is consistent throughout the day, with reduced potential for abuse. The attachment of the amino acid lysine slows down the relative amount of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> available to the blood stream. Because no free <b>dextroamphetamine</b> is present in lisdexamfetamine capsules, <b>dextroamphetamine</b> does not become available through mechanical manipulation, such as crushing or simple extraction. A relatively sophisticated biochemical process is needed to produce <b>dextroamphetamine</b> from lisdexamfetamine. As opposed to Adderall, which contains roughly equal parts of racemic amphetamine and <b>dextroamphetamine</b> salts, lisdexamfetamine is a single-enantiomer <b>dextroamphetamine</b> formula. Studies conducted show that lisdexamfetamine dimesylate may have less abuse potential than <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and an abuse profile similar to diethylpropion at dosages that are FDA-approved for treatment of ADHD, but still has a high abuse potential when this dosage is exceeded by over 100%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dextroamphetamine</b> is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of the prodrug lisdexamfetamine (L-lysine-dextroamphetamine), {{available by the}} brand name Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate). <b>Dextroamphetamine</b> is liberated from lisdexamfetamine enzymatically following contact with red blood cells. The conversion is rate-limited by the enzyme, which prevents high blood concentrations of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> and reduces lisdexamfetamine's drug liking and abuse potential at clinical doses. Vyvanse is marketed as once-a-day dosing as it provides a slow release of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> into the body. Vyvanse is available as capsules, and in six strengths; 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, and 70 mg.

50|$|<b>Dextroamphetamine</b> is {{also used}} recreationally as a {{euphoriant}} and aphrodisiac, and like other amphetamines {{is used as a}} club drug for its energetic and euphoric high. <b>Dextroamphetamine</b> is considered to have a high potential for misuse in a recreational manner since individuals typically report feeling euphoric, more alert, and more energetic after taking the drug. Large recreational doses of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> may produce symptoms of <b>dextroamphetamine</b> overdose. Recreational users sometimes open dexedrine capsules and crush the contents in order to snort it or subsequently dissolve it in water and inject it.
