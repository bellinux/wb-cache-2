40|$|Violence {{against women}} and girl is a {{widespread}} problem {{of human rights and}} we need to revisit the current prevention programs to ensure proper resolution. Even though, we live in an advance society, violence continues to be an on-goinginternational problem. In this paper, we analyse violence {{against women and}} girls in today’s society and its effects. We show that violence varies from physical altercation to mental abuse. In addition, we analyse established definitions for violence against women and their international recognition. To supplement this discussion, we would present various political movements by the international community to prevent violence against women. However, as a thesis, we believe that additional political actions are necessary to further prevent and/or reduce these violent acts from occurring in the first place. We think that minimizing or reducing violence against women is a complex process that requires shared undertakings by various parties such as governments, private NGOs, and the individual participation.

For this purpose, the temperatures of the cookers’ phase change material (PCM) were continuously measured during the day, both during sun and after sunset, by filling with the phase change material around the solar cooker manufactured. From the measurements, while {{the temperature of}} the PCM in the big cooker filled the large amount of PCM is 92, 8 °C, {{the temperature of the}} PCM in the other cooker is 80, 4 °C.

40|$|We report optical {{observations}} of the Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) HR Carinae which show that the star has reached a visual minimum phase in 2009. More importantly, we detected absorptions due to Si IV 4088 - 4116 Angstroms. To match their observed line profiles from 2009 May, a high rotational velocity of vrot= 150 +- 20 km/s is needed (assuming an inclination angle of 30 degrees), implying that HR Car rotates at ~ 0. 88 +- 0. 2 of its critical velocity for break-up (vcrit). Our results suggest that fast rotation is typical in all strong-variable, bona-fide galactic LBVs, which present S Dor-type variability. Strong-variable LBVs are located in a well-defined region of the HR diagram during visual minimum (the "LBV minimum instability strip"). We suggest this region corresponds to where vcrit <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> left of this strip, a forbidden zone with vrot/vcrit> 1 is present, explaining why no LBVs are detected in this zone. Since dormant/ex LBVs like P Cygni and HD 168625 have low vrot, we propose that LBVs can be separated in two groups: fast-rotating, strong-variable stars showing S-Dor cycles (such as AG Car and HR Car) and slow-rotating stars with much less variability (such as P Cygni and HD 168625). We speculate that SN progenitors which had S-Dor cycles before exploding (such as in SN 2001 ig, SN 2003 bg, and SN 2005 gj) could have been fast rotators. We suggest that the potential difficulty of fast-rotating Galactic LBVs to lose angular momentum is an additional evidence that such stars could explode during the LBV phase.

It is needless to say that, in this highly-networked information society, customer satisfaction influences the future and development of enterprises. Corporate profits in the distribution industry, such as supermarkets, are simply defined as the number of customers multiplied by the average sale amount to per customer. In order to achieve the ultimate customer satisfaction, high impression, happiness and surprise beyond customers’ expectations are needed. To understand what customers really want and {{to meet the needs of}} them, it would be vital for companies to gather the voices of the customers through a suggestion box in the offices or stores which are directly submitted to store managers. After gathering the voices of customers in a community, it is important to put these suggestions into practice. Since the distribution industry is a labor-intensive industry and close to customers, it is necessary to accept and respect customers’ opinions sincerely. Recently, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is emphasized more than before. The only true property of enterprises must be customer satisfaction and high employee morale. An enterprise needs to coexist with the community, become “a good corporate citizen”, and earn the confidence from the society.

40|$|Clean {{gas turbine}} {{combustion}} research has gained popularity {{in power generation}} and propulsion industry in recent days. Present days, advanced efficient emission (NOx, CO and UHC) reduction combustion technologies are acknowledged for using the lean premixed combustion system. To support continuous development of eco-friendly combustion system, a 4 th generation dry low NOx prototype downscaled burner (designed and manufactured by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB) has been researched experimentally and numerically. The research burner has multiple stages, which includes a central Pilot (named as RPL/Rich-Premixed Lean) stages, Pilot stage and Main stage. The RPL combustion chamber holds the primary flame, which produces the temperature and high concentration of radicals. The radicals and hot product <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forward stagnation point of the Main flame anchoring point. Swirled reactant mixture is delivered to the Main combustion zone and a strong recirculation zone is developed. The recirculated product is moved to the Main flame root and ignites the fresh mixture. The Main flame was visualized by applying Chemiluminescence and 2 D OH-PLIF imaging techniques. Emission measurement was performed to quantify the burner operability and emission competency. Burner stage fuel splits are varied and their effects on flame stability was monitored thoroughly. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was performed to understand the flow field and compare the experimental results with numerical analysis. CFD simulation can help to identify the approximate NOx formation region and flame locations inside the burner. RPL flow and Pilot fuel split shows significant contribution towards flame stabilization as experienced from experiment and CFD. A high temperature B-type thermocouple was positioned at the liner exit to measure the exhaust gas temperature. Numerical calculation prediction and measured temperatures showed good qualitative agreement. From the present experimental and numerical research, {{it is evident that}} the downscaled prototype gas turbine burner demonstrates a wide flame stability for various operating condition.

Humans use colours to {{give meaning to}} objects and to express their feelings, either visually either verbally. While colours and their associations may differ in different societies, their objectives in use are similar (like religious associations, status symbols, and to add aesthetic values, etc.). Whatever are the pleasures, styles or fashions of the time, the importance of colour’s role in desirability of an object remains constant. Especially, in the post-Industrial Revolution era with the progression the field of communication, the cultural differences between societies decreased.
