The most fruitful years of his life were dedicated to the advancement of a constantly expanding Farmville community. Success has crowned his efforts.

50|$|The {{design of}} a trucker cap {{is similar to that}} of a {{baseball}} cap, with a slightly curved bill in front, a cap constructed from six almost triangular gores, and a button on top. Instead of being made of cotton fabric like a typical baseball cap, the front section of a trucker hat above the bill is foam, and the rest is plastic mesh for breathability. The foam front of the <b>hat</b> <b>stands</b> up straight and stiff, which makes the trucker hat taller than most baseball caps. There is an adjustable plastic snap or hook-and-loop closure in the back to ensure that one size fits most. This design was intended to make the cap much cooler in the sun or hot weather for the comfort of the wearer.|$|E
