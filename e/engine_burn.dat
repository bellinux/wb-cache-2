5|$|On July 29, 2015, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter {{was placed}} {{into a new}} orbit to provide {{communications}} support during the anticipated arrival of the InSight Mars lander mission on September 28, 2016. The maneuver's <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> lasted for 75 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The HTV {{flight control}} team sent {{commands}} for three engine burns at 14:55, at 16:25, and at 20:53, November 1 (UTC) {{to prepare the}} vehicle's destruction in Earth's atmosphere.

The second de-orbit <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> lasted for approximately 9 minutes and was completed at 16:34. Following the second de-orbit maneuver, the HTV-1 was inserted into an elliptic orbit with an altitude of 143km perigee and 335km apogee.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the trouble}} during the descent <b>engine</b> <b>burn,</b> NASA deemed the mission {{a success in}} demonstrating the LM systems, and a second {{unmanned}} flight test using LM-2 was canceled. LM-3 was cleared for the first manned LM flight, which occurred on Apollo 9.|$|E

25|$|One of the Topol-M's {{most notable}} {{features}} is its short <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> time following take-off, intended to minimize satellite detection of launches and thereby complicate both early warning and interception by missile defense systems during boost phase. The missile {{also has a}} relatively flat ballistic trajectory, complicating defense acquisition and interception.|$|E
25|$|On January 22, 1968, Apollo 5 {{lifted off}} just before sunset. The Saturn IB worked perfectly, {{inserting}} {{the second stage}} and LM into a 163 x 222km orbit. The nose cone was jettisoned and after a coast of 43 minutes 52 seconds, the LM separated from its adapter, with a 167 x 222km orbit. After two orbits, the first planned 39 second descent <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> was started, but aborted by the Apollo Guidance Computer after only 4 seconds. Shortly before launch there was a suspected fuel leak and {{a decision was made}} to delay arming the engine until the time of ignition.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, Deep Impact was re-targeted towards {{asteroid}} (163249) 2002 GT {{which it}} would reach in January 2020. At the time of re-targeting, {{whether or not a}} related science mission would be carried out in 2020 was yet to be determined, based on NASA's budget and the health of the probe. A 71-second <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> on October 4, 2012, changed the probe's velocity by [...] to keep the mission on track.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 October 1974, the Space and Missile Systems Organization {{successfully}} {{conducted an}} Air Mobile Feasibility Test where a C-5A Galaxy aircraft air dropped an 86,000lb Minuteman ICBM from 20,000ft over the Pacific Ocean. The missile descended to 8,000ft before its rocket engine fired. The 10-second <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> carried the missile to 20,000ft again before it {{dropped into the}} ocean. The test proved the feasibility of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile from the air. Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, though the capability {{was used as a}} negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Aircraft 69-0014, [...] "Zero-One-Four" [...] used in the test was retired to the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base.|$|E

50|$|Following orbital insertion, Soyuz TMA-08M {{immediately}} began rendezvous operations. On the first orbit, the spacecraft executed {{its first two}} programmed <b>engine</b> <b>burns.</b> On the second orbit, actual orbital parameters were transmitted from a Russian ground site.

5000|$|Flight Day 36 through Day 41 Cygnus was {{detached}} from the station and maneuvered a safe distance away. Engineering tests were conducted for 2 days before a series of <b>engine</b> <b>burns</b> were conducted to slow the spacecraft for reentry over the South Pacific Ocean, where it and the cargo inside were destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|To get to {{much higher}} altitudes, Reed {{planned to use}} an unusual <b>engine</b> that <b>burned</b> hydrazine. A normal {{internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> <b>burns</b> gasoline with air to generate power, but at 21 kilometers the air is too thin to keep it running. Instead of gasoline, Reed planned to use hydrazine, or (NH2)2, which breaks down spontaneously when run across a catalyst, generating heat to produce steam to drive the engine. Hydrazine is corrosive, toxic, unstable stuff, but its ability to [...] "burn" [...] without oxygen makes it useful for spacecraft thrusters and for such high-altitude engine applications.|$|R
50|$|Cooling is {{also needed}} because high {{temperatures}} damage engine materials and lubricants. Cooling {{becomes more important}} when the climate becomes very hot. Internal-combustion <b>engines</b> <b>burn</b> fuel hotter than the melting temperature of engine materials, and hot enough to set fire to lubricants. Engine cooling removes energy fast enough to keep temperatures low so the engine can survive.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the trouble}} during the descent <b>engine</b> <b>burn,</b> NASA deemed the mission {{a success in}} demonstrating the LM systems, and a second {{unmanned}} flight test using LM-2 was canceled. LM-3 was cleared for the first manned LM flight, which occurred on Apollo 9.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{requested}} {{another attempt}} at an <b>engine</b> <b>burn,</b> but were denied {{and told to}} sleep. A recovery attempt could not be made for another day. Rukavishnikov couldn't sleep, however, {{and thought about the}} novel Marooned, which featured an American space crew stranded in orbit.|$|E
50|$|The Soviets {{conceived}} {{of a wide}} array of responses during the SDI era. In 1997 Russia deployed the Topol-M ICBM which utilized a higher-thrust <b>engine</b> <b>burn</b> following take-off, and flew a relatively flat ballistic trajectory, both characteristics intended to complicate space-based sensor acquisition and interception.|$|E

Both <b>engines</b> <b>burn</b> UDMH and AK27I in the gas generator cycle. It was designed by OKB-2, the famous Isaev Design Bureau, for the original Soyuz programme.|$|R
50|$|It spent {{a little}} over two days in free-flight, during which time it {{conducted}} two main <b>engine</b> <b>burns</b> and a firing of its manoeuvring thrusters to raise its orbit before docking with the Pirs module of the International Space Station on 28 January at around 00:09 UTC; the docking port having been vacated by Progress M-13M on 23 January.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{attitude}} and articulation controller {{designs for the}} CRAF/Cassini spacecraft have prompted a consideration of potential interactions with structural dynamics and propellant motion. The two algorithms significantly affected are attitude control during main <b>engine</b> <b>burns,</b> and articulation control of the high-precision scan platform (HPSP). For main <b>engine</b> <b>burns,</b> the primary concerns are the sloshing of the bipropellant, which constitutes 70 percent of initial spacecraft mass, and the vibration of the three large appendages, especially the HPSP, on which the gyros are mounted. For the HPSP pointing algorithm, the main concern is the fairly large offset of the HPSP center-of-mass from the gimbals, which is motivated by other system and subsystem considerations. This offset results in significant coupling between HPSP articulation and HPSP boom structural dynamics. This paper surveys the operational scenarios of these algorithms, and the impacts of nonrigid dynamics on controller design and performance...|$|R
