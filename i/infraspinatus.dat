25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} {{comprises}} four pennate muscles, the supraspinatus, <b>infraspinatus,</b> subscapularis and teres minor, and their accompanying tendons. These muscles form a cuff around the glenohumeral joint and function to stabilize and manipulate the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} is an {{anatomical}} term {{given to the}} group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the supraspinatus, <b>infraspinatus,</b> teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches {{to the head of the}} humerus. Together, these keep the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the humeral head caused by the pull of the deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The <b>infraspinatus</b> and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{study on}} human cadaveric {{shoulders}} suggests tendon tears {{may affect the}} pennation angle of the rotator cuff muscles. Researchers compared pennation angle between a control group and tear groups comprising either partial or complete-thickness tendon tears. Via dissection of ten injured and ten non-injured cadeveric shoulders, the study discovered a correlation between tendon tear size {{and an increase in}} pennation angle among two of the rotator cuff muscles. Pennation angle remained unaffected across all rotator cuff muscles in the partial tendon tear group, suggesting a threshold tear size must be exceeded to produce any changes in pennation angle. Full-thickness tendon tears did not affect the pennation angle of the subscapularis or teres minor muscles. However, a correlation between full-thickness rotator cuff tear size and the pennation angle of the supraspnatus and <b>infraspinatus</b> muscles was evident. The length of the full-thickness tendon tear strongly correlated with an increase in the pennation angle of the supraspinatus muscle. In addition, a moderately strong association between the area of the full-thickness tear and the resulting increase in pennation angle of the <b>infraspinatus</b> was visible.|$|E
25|$|There is a ridge on {{the outer}} part {{of the back of}} the scapula. This runs from the lower part of the glenoid cavity, {{downward}} and backward to the vertebral border, about 2.5cm above the inferior angle. Attached to the ridge is a fibrous septum, which separates the <b>infraspinatus</b> muscle from the Teres major and Teres minor muscles. The upper two-thirds of the surface between the ridge and the axillary border is narrow, and is crossed near its center by a groove for the scapular circumflex vessels; the Teres minor attaches here.|$|E
25|$|The tendons of the rotator cuff, not the muscles, {{are most}} {{commonly}} involved, {{and of the}} four, the supraspinatus is most frequently affected, as it passes below the acromion. The role of the supraspinatus is to resist downward motion. The supraspinatus resists downward motion while the shoulder is relaxed as well as when carrying weight. Such a tear usually occurs at its point of insertion onto the humeral head at the greater tubercle. Even though the supraspinatus is the most commonly injured muscle of the four muscles in the rotator cuff, the other three muscles that comprise the rotator cuff, the <b>infraspinatus,</b> teres minor, and subscapularis, may also be injured.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuffâ€”the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and <b>infraspinatus.</b> These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E

2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the <b>infraspinatus,</b> or combined tears of the supraspinatus and <b>infraspinatus.</b> Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
2500|$|The four tendons {{of these}} muscles {{converge}} {{to form the}} rotator cuff tendon. [...] This tendon, along with the articular capsule, the coracohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral ligament complex, blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities. [...] The <b>infraspinatus</b> and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions, while the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon {{at the entrance of}} the bicipital groove.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} glenohumeral joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. [...] It is a {{ball and socket joint}} that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. [...] The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the {{shoulder joint}} and contribute to the shoulder's stability. The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus, subscapularis, <b>infraspinatus,</b> and teres minor. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head.|$|E
