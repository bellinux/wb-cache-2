5|$|Mathematics were {{essential}} in drafting the astronomical calendar, a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year.

5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E

5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into two parts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> timing of the births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E

Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 June as a result of faulty riveting and excessive strain on the hull when she had been docked. Repairs took only two <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June.|$|E

5|$|In each {{of their}} {{following}} two matches, at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire, Somerset batted first and then enforced the follow-on after bowling their opponents out cheaply. In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat, and both matches resulted in draws. During the Worcestershire match, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman's total of 28,067 first-class runs to become the highest-scoring Australian batsman. Successive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title. No play was possible on {{the third and fourth}} <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> match resulted in another draw, leaving Somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, meant that Durham clinched the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth draw in a row in the competition), and finished third in the first division.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, {{as well as}} phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E
