5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and <b>expensive</b> and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very <b>expensive.</b> Nike-X thus relied on a few very <b>expensive</b> sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E

5|$|Gross and Kotok {{built the}} digital audio program <b>Expensive</b> Tape Recorder.|$|E
5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is <b>expensive</b> because dairy fats and meat are more <b>expensive</b> than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet {{has been proposed}} as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more <b>expensive</b> food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|In the 2017 {{worldwide}} cost {{of living}} survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most <b>expensive</b> city in the world, and the second most <b>expensive</b> in Europe, after Zurich.|$|E
5|$|Spectre {{was filmed}} from December 2014 to July 2015, with {{locations}} in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while still employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies. Spectre {{was estimated to}} have cost around $245 million, making it the most <b>expensive</b> Bond film {{and one of the}} most <b>expensive</b> films ever made.|$|E
5|$|The Rules of the Game was {{the most}} <b>expensive</b> film ever {{produced}} in France when it was released. Its original budget had been 2.5 million francs (which already made it the most <b>expensive</b> French film of that year) and was increased by another 2 million francs, costing over 5 million francs total.|$|E
5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more <b>expensive</b> than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power. As photovoltaics became less <b>expensive,</b> some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} cost approximately $82 million, {{making it}} the most <b>expensive</b> election in Massachusetts' history and of any Congressional race in history {{as well as the}} second-most <b>expensive</b> election in the 2012 election cycle, behind only the 2012 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|The rugged high-altitude terrain {{makes it}} <b>expensive</b> to provide {{telecommunications}} services.|$|E

5|$|A key {{innovation}} in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding {{the need for an}} additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American M85 flex fuel vehicles too <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|A more <b>expensive</b> black {{model was}} offered until the {{introduction}} of the unibody aluminum MacBook. The polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook (until the new 2015 model) to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} tests are available to determine the degree of cirrhosis present. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is the test of choice, but it is <b>expensive.</b> Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index may be used when cost is an issue.|$|E
5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only automatic train control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} too <b>expensive</b> to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
5|$|Air {{transport}} particularly favors light, <b>expensive</b> {{and small}} products: electronic media rather than books, for example, and refined drugs rather than bulk food.|$|E
5|$|Although xenon is {{rare and}} {{relatively}} <b>expensive</b> to extract from the Earth's atmosphere, {{it has a}} number of applications.|$|E
5|$|An astronomical {{interferometer}} achieves high-resolution observations {{using the}} technique of aperture synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very <b>expensive</b> monolithic telescope.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as the {{inert gas}} within Schlenk lines and gloveboxes. Argon is {{preferred}} to less <b>expensive</b> nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its {{role is to}} regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of <b>expensive</b> palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while {{at a much higher}} cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too <b>expensive</b> for industrial usage, some {{progress has been made in}} the development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.|$|E
5|$|Besides repúblicas, studio apartments {{are very}} common around the university. While more <b>expensive</b> than the shared houses, they afford more privacy {{and have more}} {{flexible}} contracts, are well as being furnished.|$|E
5|$|Bond Street is also {{a square}} on the British Monopoly board, and is the most <b>expensive</b> of the green-coloured set that also {{includes}} Regent and Oxford Streets. The three streets are grouped together because of their shared retail history.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff fans would be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most <b>expensive</b> tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least <b>expensive</b> tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as happened during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an <b>expensive</b> and {{painstaking}} process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and <b>expensive</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s {{maintenance}} {{was becoming}} increasingly <b>expensive,</b> and the building's design ill-suited to modern fire appliances. Plans to replace the fire station were put on hold pending the formation of the Greater Manchester Fire Service.|$|E
5|$|Central Independent Television had {{confidence}} in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less <b>expensive</b> videotape, and on location, making it very <b>expensive</b> compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} <b>expensive</b> naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the <b>expensive</b> new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Costing over 105million euros, the Skyway Monte Bianco is {{regarded}} as the world's most <b>expensive</b> cable car installation.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{can be kept}} as a pet, though {{providing}} suitable care is <b>expensive</b> {{and requires}} extremely large enclosures. In many countries, permits or licenses are necessary and most veterinarians have little experience of these exotic animals.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the rooms}} has its own balcony and is {{designed}} in the Beverly Hills Hotel colors of peachy pinks and greens, apricots and yellows. Several of the more <b>expensive</b> rooms have private patios, Jacuzzis and their own kitchens.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine {{is largely}} {{restricted}} to <b>expensive</b> restaurants, {{although there are}} some inexpensive French bistros.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least <b>expensive</b> of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and <b>expensive</b> topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both <b>expensive,</b> it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather <b>expensive</b> imports in the north.|$|E
5|$|However, in May 2015 {{a member}} of The Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group {{confirmed}} that Azerbaijan had cheated {{and that it was}} organized and very <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
