5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of {{south-west}} England, the Blackdown Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately 10°C (50°F) and shows a seasonal and a <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation,</b> but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom (UK). January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E

25|$|Geomagnetic {{storms that}} ignite auroras may occur more often {{during the months}} around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but {{geomagnetic}} storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation,</b> changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.|$|E
40|$|<b>Diurnal</b> (or sub-daily) <b>variations</b> {{are large}} in many surface and {{atmospheric}} {{fields such as}} solar radiation, surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, surface temperature and winds, atmospheric convection, and precipitation. These <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> are especially important in air-land and air-sea interactions, which are highly non-linear and thus can not be resolved using daily mean values. Current regional and global climate models still have difficulties in simulating the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> correctly.

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> in middle {{atmospheric}} water vapor {{as measured by}} two ground-based microwave radiometers in the Alpine region near Bern, Switzerland. The observational data set is also compared to data from the chemistry-climate model WACCM. Due to the small <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> of usually less than 1 %, averages over extended time periods are required. Therefore, two time periods of five months each, December to April and June to October, were taken for the comparison. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> from the observational data agree well {{with each other in}} amplitude and phase. The linear correlation coefficients range from 0. 8 in the upper stratosphere to 0. 5 in the upper mesosphere. The observed diurnal variability is significant at all pressure levels within the sensitivity of the instruments. Comparing our observations with WACCM, we find that the agreement of the phase of the diurnal cycle between observations and model is better from December to April than from June to October. The amplitudes of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> for both time periods increase with altitude in WACCM, but remain approximately constant at 0. 05 parts per million in the observations. The WACCM data is used to separate the processes that lead to <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> in middle atmospheric water vapor above Bern. The dominating processes were found to be meridional advection below 0. 1 hPa, vertical advection between 0. 1 and 0. 02 hPa and (photo-) chemistry above 0. 02 hPa.

After two years, he moved to a boys-only school in Glascote, Tamworth. This council school in a mining town had basic science facilities (uncommon at that time), and it was there that his interest in science was first kindled. At ten, Titterton won a scholarship to attend Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Tamworth, where he performed consistently well. He also excelled at sports, playing cricket and hockey for the school's [...] first teams, and learned to play the piano and the organ. He received his School Certificate with seven credits when he was fourteen, and entered sixth form, which was at that time reserved for gifted students expected to continue to study at a tertiary level. He studied mathematics, chemistry, and physics. His physics teacher, William Summerhayes, cultivated Titterton's interest in science. Summerhayes believed that his pupils should learn how to conduct research, and had Titterton and another boy measure the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of Earth's magnetic field. Their results were published in the school magazine.|$|E

60|$|It {{is in this}} manner, for example, that loaded dice may be discovered. Of course no dice are so clumsily loaded {{that they}} must always throw certain numbers; {{otherwise}} the fraud would be instantly detected. The loading, a constant cause, mingles with the changeable causes which determine what cast will be thrown in each individual instance. If the dice were not loaded, and the throw were left to depend entirely on the changeable causes, these in {{a sufficient number of}} instances would balance one another, {{and there would be no}} preponderant number of throws of any one kind. If, therefore, after such a number of trials that no further increase of their number has any material effect upon the average, we find a preponderance in favor of a particular throw; we may conclude with assurance that there is some constant cause acting in favor of that throw, or, in other words, that the dice are not fair; and the exact amount of the unfairness. In a similar manner, what is called the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of the barometer, which is very small compared with the variations arising from the irregular changes in the state of the atmosphere, was discovered by comparing the average height of the barometer at different hours of the day. When this comparison was made, it was found that there was a small difference, which on the average was constant, however the absolute quantities might vary, and which difference, therefore, must be the effect of a constant cause. This cause was afterward ascertained, deductively, to be the rarefaction of the air, occasioned by the increase of temperature as the day advances.|$|E
