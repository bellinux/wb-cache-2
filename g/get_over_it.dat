Oz is bitten by a werewolf, and just as Willow begins to confront him about why he does not spend time with her, he transforms and attacks her. She must shoot him with a tranquilizer gun several times while he is wild, but her assertiveness in doing so makes her more confident in their relationship. Oz's trials in dealing with a power he cannot control is, according to authors J. Michael Richardson and J.

When Willow and Oz decide to commit to each other, Willow is enthusiastic {{that she has a}} boyfriend, and, as a guitarist in a band, one so cool. Her relationship with Oz endures the high school storylines of exploring her attraction to Xander, which briefly separates them. She worries that she is not as close to Oz as she could be.

500|$|The {{following}} year, Dunst {{starred in}} the comedy film <b>Get</b> <b>Over</b> <b>It</b> (2001).

Also in 2001, she {{starred in the}} historical drama The Cat's Meow, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, as the American actress Marion Davies. Derek Elley of Variety described the film as [...] "playful and sporty", saying that this was Dunst's best performance to date: [...] "Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy." ...|$|E

But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. <b>Get</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were very upset about her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E

500|$|Lionel Luthor {{is portrayed}} in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the [...] "clear canvas" [...] {{he had to work}} with when {{developing}} his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character's struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend's battle with cancer; he said his friend was a [...] "cheerleader to people", who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad.

He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say {{with all due respect to}} a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears."

500|$|On {{the night}} of December 12–13, 1994, McGovern's {{daughter}} Teresa fell into a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, while heavily intoxicated and died of hypothermia. Heavy press attention followed, and McGovern revealed his daughter had battled her alcoholism for years and had {{been in and out}} of many treatment programs while having had one extended period of sobriety. He authored an account of her life, Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism; published in 1996, it presented a harrowing, unsparing view of the depths to which she had descended, the torment that he and the rest of his family had experienced in trying unsuccessfully to help her, and his ongoing thoughts and guilt about whether the demands of his political career and the time he had spent away from the family had made things worse for her. The book was a modest best-seller, and with the proceeds, he founded the Teresa McGovern Center in Madison to help others suffering from the combination of alcoholism and mental health problems. He would later say that Terry's death was by far the most painful event in his life: [...] "You never <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>it,</b> I'm sure of that.

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles.

Okay, so I was having a bad six months? <b>Get</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
500|$|Zinta {{has been}} the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the Bharat Shah case, she testified against the Indian mafia. Bharat Shah, the financer of one of her films, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, was arrested in 2000 for having {{connections}} with Chhota Shakeel, a Mumbai underworld boss. Unlike several of her colleagues, Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received extortion threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given witness protection and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become hostile to the prosecution; the nation responded positively to her actions. Consequently, she was the first recipient of Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the [...] "courageous act" [...] of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, [...] "To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and you <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>it,</b> then you can be called brave. I am human. It is not that I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far." [...] Since 2006, Zinta {{has been the}} brand ambassador for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery awards.|$|E
