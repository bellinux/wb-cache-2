5|$|Bart {{wakes up}} from the {{nightmare}} to find his family beside his bed. Marge assures him {{he has nothing to}} be afraid of, but a green fog seeps in through the window and the Simpsons are turned inside out. They, along with Willie, perform a musical number over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away and <b>eviscerated</b> by Santa's Little Helper.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, <b>eviscerated</b> larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been <b>eviscerated,</b> then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Holothuria arenicola is {{described}} as a sea cucumber suitable for keeping in aquaria as it does not <b>eviscerate,</b> whereas the [...] "Australian" [...] sea apple (Paracucumaria tricolor) frequently <b>eviscerates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hooking Blade wields a chained sickle. One-Arm defeats him {{by hanging}} {{him by his}} own weapon from a tree, {{allowing}} One-Arm to <b>eviscerate</b> him.|$|R
50|$|When slaughtered, none of {{the animal}} need be wasted - so, all of the <b>eviscerate</b> can be used. This {{includes}} heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, stomach and intestines.|$|R
5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was <b>eviscerated</b> and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} base, the agents {{discover}} the <b>eviscerated</b> and partially devoured corpses of security personnel and scientists. After splitting up to restore {{power to the}} facility, Gail goes missing. Whilst searching for him, Regina is confronted by a Velociraptor. Re-uniting with Rick, the two determine it was the dinosaurs that caused the bloodbath at the base. Although their mission to recover Dr. Kirk still stands, it is now more important to signal for a rescue. Regina sets out to activate the main antenna to contact their airlift. On her way, she is attacked by another Velociraptor and is rescued by Gail, who then leaves to continue searching for Dr. Kirk. After restoring communications, Regina heads back to the control room and they receive a signal on their communicators. Believing it might be Cooper or Tom in trouble, Rick wants to investigate. Gail shoots down the idea, wanting {{to follow up on}} a closed-circuit television sighting that might have been Kirk. The player must choose which course of action to follow.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, {{however, the}} Rules on Containers were {{subsequently}} <b>eviscerated</b> by the Federal Trade Commission, {{which found that}} the Rules were an impermissible restraint on trade.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 Romney began {{criticizing the}} McCain-Feingold Law, saying [...] "We step into {{dangerous}} territory when politicians start <b>eviscerating</b> our fundamental freedoms {{in the name}} of amorphous principles, like campaign finance reform." ...|$|R
50|$|Sabretooth {{reveals that}} he's faking the ordeal however, and fully healed, escapes by deceiving Tabitha into {{destroying}} his bonds. In his escape, he <b>eviscerates</b> the X-Man Psylocke, who barely survives her wounds.|$|R
5000|$|Both Falzon and Krovatin praised Erik Rutan's production, with Falzon {{saying that}} it [...] "takes Conceived in Sewage {{to a higher level}} of <b>eviscerating</b> brutality", and Krovatin calling the sound [...] "solid" [...] and [...] "lush".|$|R
25|$|In the DRC the genocidal rape {{was focused}} on the {{destruction}} of family and communities. An interview with a survivor gave an account of gang rape, forced cannibalism of a fetus taken from an <b>eviscerated</b> woman and child murder.|$|E
25|$|However, {{as police}} {{obtained}} confessions from suspects, bodies {{continued to be}} discovered, proving that the suspects who had confessed could not be the killer the police were seeking. On 30 October 1983 the <b>eviscerated</b> body of a 19-year-old prostitute, named Vera Shevkun, was found in Shakhty. Shevkun had been killed on 27 October. Although the mutilations inflicted upon Shevkun's body were otherwise characteristic of those found upon other victims linked to the unknown murderer, the victim's eyes had not been enucleated or otherwise wounded. Two months later, on 27 December, a 14-year-old Gukovo schoolboy, named Sergey Markov, was lured off a train and murdered at a rural station near Novocherkassk. Markov was emasculated and suffered over 70 knife wounds to his neck and upper torso before being <b>eviscerated.</b>|$|E
25|$|France {{has several}} regions where people consume rat. A recipe for grilled rats, Bordeaux-style, {{calls for the}} use of {{alcoholic}} rats who live in wine cellars. These rats are skinned and <b>eviscerated,</b> brushed with a thick sauce of olive oil and crushed shallots, and grilled over a fire of broken wine barrels.|$|E
50|$|The inner {{or second}} of the three toes is fitted with a long, straight, murderous nail which can sever an arm or <b>eviscerate</b> an abdomen with ease. There are many records of natives being killed by this bird.|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} McCutcheon v. FEC, arguing that Justice Roberts’s opinion, coupled with Citizens United v. FEC, <b>eviscerates</b> campaign finance laws. The plurality’s position drastically contravenes public policy, overlooks its own precedent, and erroneously ignores McCutcheon’s inevitable effects...|$|R
5000|$|Borah {{was well}} known for his biting wit and frank judgments. He “wielded a scathing and even <b>eviscerating</b> verbal style that might unnerve {{all but the most}} {{confident}} graduate student or thick-skinned colleague” but he also had a “fundamental , if often concealed, kindness.” ...|$|R
25|$|The {{disaffiliation}} {{of several}} major unions in 2005 led the AFL-CIO {{to reconsider the}} use of DALUs. Many of the disaffiliated unions provided the majority of members, staff and funds to AFL-CIO state federations and central labour councils. The loss of these resources would not only have effectively dismantled the AFL-CIO presence in these areas but <b>eviscerated</b> the labor movement as well.|$|E
25|$|Germany emerged {{champions of}} the 2014 World Cup, {{defeating}} Argentina 1–0 thanks to a memorable goal by 22-year-old Mario Götze. In {{the run-up to the}} finals, Germany <b>eviscerated</b> Brazil 7–1 in their semifinal match, breaking several World Cup records. Miroslav Klose also scored his 16th World Cup goal in this match to become the highest scoring player in World Cup history.|$|E
25|$|In 1746, the Jacobite officer Francis Towneley, {{along with}} other members of the Manchester Regiment, who had been {{captured}} during the failed Jacobite rising of 1745, were convicted of high treason and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered on the common on 30 July. However, by then executioners possessed some discretion as to how much the condemned should suffer before death. Townley was killed before his body was <b>eviscerated.</b> His head was placed on a pike on Temple Bar.|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} {{clinical}} presentation of vaginal evisceration consists of vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, discharge, or/and a protruding mass [1]. The distal ileum {{is the most}} common organ to <b>eviscerate,</b> but prolapse of omentum (only two cases), colon, appendix, and fallopian tubes have been reported [1].|$|R
50|$|Gregory S. Paul {{stated that}} tyrannosaurids {{attacked}} hadrosaurs by targeting the caudofemoralis muscle and thigh muscle to disable their preys locomotor system, the abdomen to <b>eviscerate</b> their prey and the neck {{which would have}} caused the most rapid death by damaging the trachea and major blood vessels.|$|R
5000|$|Matt's passion for filmmaking {{started at}} a young age, making {{mountain}} biking videos.

25|$|On 14 January 1990 Chikatilo {{encountered}} 11-year-old Andrei Kravchenko {{standing outside}} a Shakhty theater. Kravchenko was lured from the theater on {{the pretext of}} being shown imported Western films Chikatilo claimed to have at his residence; his extensively stabbed, emasculated {{body was found in}} a secluded section of woodland the following month. Seven weeks after Kravchenko's murder, on 7 March, Chikatilo lured a 10-year-old boy, named Yaroslav Makarov, from a Rostov train station to Rostov's Botanical Gardens. The <b>eviscerated</b> body was found the following day.|$|E
25|$|Two ancient legends tell of mythical origins for the city. In {{the first}} legend, Trapani {{stemmed from the}} sickle which fell {{from the hands of}} the goddess Demeter while she was seeking for her {{daughter}} Persephone, who had been kidnapped by Hades. The second myth features Kronos, who <b>eviscerated</b> his father Ouranos, god of the sky, with a sickle which, falling into the sea, created the city. In ancient times, Saturn was the god-protector of Trapani. Today, Saturn's statue stands in a piazza in the centre of the city.|$|E
25|$|Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, <b>eviscerated</b> {{and rinsed}} {{thoroughly}} with water. Air is pumped {{under the skin}} through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat. The duck is then soaked in boiling water {{for a short while}} before it is hung up to dry. While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water. Having been left to stand for 24 hours, the duck is roasted in an oven until it turns shiny brown.|$|E
5000|$|Gods of Violence {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release. Writing for All About the Rock, Fraser Wilson said: [...] "With this record, Kreator {{have created a}} slab of truly <b>eviscerating</b> aural perfection.

5000|$|Gardiner then quotes Grossberg, [...] "The {{collapse}} of all political space, {{civil society and}} everyday life and the transformation of everyday life in disciplined mobilization not only depoliticizes {{large segments of the}} population, it also <b>eviscerates</b> the recognition of popular culture as a terrain and weapon of struggle." ...|$|R
50|$|The McGovern Commission, {{which had}} set out to reform the Presidential {{nomination}} process {{in order to avoid}} a repeat of the 1968 Convention, eventually issued its recommendations, including the requirement that all delegates be directly elected by the people, <b>eviscerating</b> the power of political bosses to control the nomination process.|$|R
25|$|When Suharto {{was still}} in power, a film {{supporting}} the New Order's version of events, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI (Betrayal of Indonesia Communist Party) was broadcast annually on the government television station TVRI every 30 September. This version {{was the only one}} allowed in open discourse in the country. After Suharto's removal from power, many people, including those involved, told other versions of the events in various books and films. One, the documentary film The Act of Killing, included interviews with individuals who had participated in the mass killings, and its companion piece The Look of Silence follows one grieving family trying to understand why it happened and exposes how those behind the Indonesian massacres still revel in their crimes 50 years on, including boasting on camera how they dismembered, <b>eviscerated,</b> castrated and beheaded alleged communists.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of United States Army Air Forces heavy bombers caused {{a problem for}} the German fighter force. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in particular could absorb heavy punishment. The armament of the Bf 109 and then current Fw 190 were not adequate for bomber destroyer operations, with the B-17's eventual deployment in the combat box formations providing their defensive armament with formidable massed firepower from as many as one hundred 0.50 in (12.7 mm) Browning AN/M2 machine guns or more between all the bombers in such a formation, from almost any conceivable direction. In addition, the Luftwaffes original solution of Zerstörer twin-engine Messerschmitt Bf 110G bomber destroyers, while effective against unescorted Allied bomber formations, lacked manoeuvrability and were <b>eviscerated</b> by the USAAF's fighter escorts in late 1943 and early 1944.|$|E
25|$|The Bear's 2008 {{campaign}} was marked with diminished expectations, {{as all of}} California's offensive stars at their skill positions (DeSean Jackson, Lavelle Hawkins, Robert Jordan, Justin Forsett and Craig Stevens) graduated or declared for the NFL Draft. Thus the Bears started the season unranked {{for the first time}} since 2003. Their 2008 season would confirm this ranking, as they would finish the season undefeated at home but would only win one game on the road. The Bears won their opening game at home against Michigan State 38–31 and <b>eviscerated</b> Washington State in Pullman 66–3, but fell to Maryland 35–27 in College Park. The Bears won two straight home games against Colorado State and Arizona State but fell in the desert to Arizona. Although the Bears still controlled their destiny in the Pac-10 after two more home wins against UCLA and Oregon, two close losses to Pac-10 champion contenders USC and Oregon State on the road put an end to those hopes. Cal reclaimed the Axe by beating Stanford 37–16 in the 111th Big Game and kept Washington's season winless with a 48–7 victory. Cal finished the regular season 8–4 as Tedford claimed his seventh consecutive winning season for the Golden Bears and third unbeaten home record in five years. The Bears accepted an invitation to take on the Miami Hurricanes at the 2008 Emerald Bowl, which they won 24–17.|$|E
6000|$|The old Malay {{was right}} {{as to the}} cause, but wrong as to distance.
