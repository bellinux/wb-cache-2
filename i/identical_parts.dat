25|$|Émile Durkheim {{wrote in}} The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, {{the body of}} civil law {{concerned}} primarily with restitution and compensation grows {{at the expense of}} criminal laws and penal sanctions. Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies {{in which there is a}} high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities. For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among <b>identical</b> <b>parts,</b> or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.|$|E
500|$|In February 1977 after {{attending}} a Ramones concert in Los Angeles, music producer Phil Spector offered {{to assist in}} making Rocket to Russia. The band declined his offer, feeling as though the album {{would not be the}} same without Tommy Ramone and Tony Bongiovi producing the album. While the band refused his initial offer, they later asked Spector to help with the album because of their lack of popularity and sales. End of the Century would be the first album released without former drummer and producer Tommy. Spector had become famous through his work with The Ronettes, The Righteous Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, The Beatles and John Lennon, among others. With these releases, Spector defined what would become known as the [...] "Wall of Sound", which is a dense, layered, and reverberant sound that came across well on AM radio and jukeboxes. These standards are created through instruments performing <b>identical</b> <b>parts</b> in unison, using high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers to aid in the production value. The producer was convinced that the Ramones had talent with lyrics and musical structure, so he intended to promote the band through more advanced methods of sound output.|$|E

50|$|A {{coordinate}} {{measuring machine}} (CMM) is also a device used in manufacturing and assembly processes to test a part or assembly against the design intent.

These points are collected by using a probe that is positioned manually by an operator or automatically via Direct Computer Control (DCC). DCC CMMs can be programmed to repeatedly measure <b>identical</b> <b>parts,</b> thus a CMM is a specialized form of industrial robot.|$|E

50|$|As {{in other}} members of the Pandanales, the flower {{morphology}} in the Stemonaceae is distinctively developed and rather atypical for other monocots. In the majority of the species, flowers are tetramerous (composed of four <b>identical</b> <b>parts)</b> or sometimes dimerous. Stamens are distinguishable and four in number. In most of the members, tepals are four. They are smooth or sometimes papilate which is probably because they function as odour-producing components (osmophores). However, in Pentastemona, the flowers are pentamerous and the number of stamens is five. Microsporogenesis is successive. Reproductive structures are colored in shades of purple, maroon, green, or yellow. They imitate carrion and sometimes release such smell - flies visiting the flowers function as pollinators.|$|E

Moreover, following features must be highlighted: hull structure modeling: an algorithm to represent corrugated parts more accurately, commands for checking the edge preparation of plates and profiles, options for {{the definition of}} face bars and an algorithm to represent more accurately curved shell and deck plates. Regarding profiles and plates nesting, the NEST module allows the nesting of <b>identical</b> <b>parts</b> assigned to different interim products and keeps information to recognize each individual part.|$|E
50|$|As {{proposed}} by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled flat-four unit. One of Miles Thomas' few {{restrictions on the}} Mosquito project was {{that it had to}} have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British horsepower tax, which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine which could easily be produced in two versions - a narrow-bore 800 cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100 cc version for export. Both versions would use <b>identical</b> <b>parts,</b> except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling.|$|E
50|$|In reality, models do {{not always}} conform to their nominal scale; there are 1/25 scale {{automobile}} models which are larger than some 1/24 scale models, for instance. For example, the engine in the recent reissue of the AMT Ala Kart show truck is significantly smaller than the engine in the original issue. AMT employees from the 1960s note that, at that time, all AMT kits were packaged into boxes of a standardized size, to simplify shipping; and the overriding requirement of designing any kit was {{that it had to}} fit into that precise size of box, no matter how large or small the original vehicle. This practice was common for other genres and manufacturers of models as well. In modern times this practice has become known as fit-the-box scale. In practice, this means that kits of the same subject in nominally identical scales may produce finished models which actually differ in size, and that hypothetically <b>identical</b> <b>parts</b> in such kits may not be easily swapped between them, even when the kits are both by the same manufacturer.|$|E
