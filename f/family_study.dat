50|$|The <b>Family</b> <b>Study</b> is a {{longitudinal}} study designed to follow spouses of Service members from all branches of the military, including the National Guard and Reserve, for 21 years. Spouses of Service members participating in the Millennium Cohort Study were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire between 2011 and 2013 and will be re-surveyed every three years. Because families and family relationships change over time, spouses are asked to complete follow-up surveys every three years, even if their spouse {{is no longer in}} the service or their marital status changes. The questionnaire asks participants about their mental and physical health, the quality of their marital and family relationships, their deployment and reunion experiences, their perception of how their spouse is coping, and the effects of military life and deployment on their children. Participation in the <b>Family</b> <b>Study</b> is completely voluntary.|$|E
