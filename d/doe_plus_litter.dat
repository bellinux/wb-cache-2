40|$|Separating kits {{and mother}} to {{determine}} milk yield at 4 th wk of lactation (MY 4)  could have negative consequences on {{the training and}} development of young rabbits. In this work, a total of 313 lactation curves (28 d long), taken from 2 different trials, were used to fit regression models to estimate MY 4. In both trials, females were subjected to a semi-intensive reproductive rhythm [insemination at 11 d post-partum (dpp) and weaning at 28 dpp], but diets, genetic types, parity order and day of controls were slightly different. The models included variables which, according to the bibliography, are related to milk yield and are often recorded in joint management (without separation of litters  rom mothers), such as litter size at weaning (LSW; both linear and quadratic), joint energy intake of <b>doe</b> <b>plus</b> <b>litter</b> at 4 th wk of lactation (JEI; both linear and quadratic), perirenal fat thickness change (ΔPFTd) and milk yield at 3 rd wk (MY 3). The overlapping degree (OL) between current lactation and next pregnancy was included as a dummy variable, {{as well as their}} interactions with quantitative traits. To fit these models, 3  procedures were proposed to obtain accurate equations with biological meaning: Eq 1, multiple linear regression (MLR) of data; Eq 2, MLR with previous smoothing of sample distribution; and Eq 3, MLR with previous smoothing and avoiding redundant samples and collinearities among variables. MY 3 had a positive and relevant linear effect on MY 4 for the 3 equations obtained (responsible for 39 to 50 % of MY 4 prediction). JEI had also a relevant role in MY 4 prediction (28 to 61 %), its positive effect being linear on Eq 1, quadratic on Eq 2 and both linear and quadratic on Eq 3. ΔPFTd and LSW related traits were only included in Eq 3, with a low relative weight, and OL inclusion did not improve prediction in any equation. Predicting MY 4 was possible with the variables used, although certain precautions must be taken. Traditional MLR seems to predict central values properly, but extreme values poorly, whereas pre-treatment of data to smooth the dependent variable distribution appears to improve prediction of extreme values. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Ray Semlitsch, Fisheries & WildlifeThroughout the world, {{amphibian}} {{populations have}} shown an overall declining trend. Frogs are {{a vital part}} of the ecosystem, and their absence could have many negative consequences. However, if we are to help conserve frogs, we must better understand their habitat requirements in all stages of life. Our experiments simulated forest and field habitats using soils, grasses, and leaves and allowed Southern Leopard Frog (Rana sphenocephala) metamorphs (very young frogs) to choose between the two. During each trial, frogs were put into individual aquariums divided into two halves. The following three experiments were conducted simultaneously: 1) forest soil <b>plus</b> intact <b>litter</b> vs. field soil plus intact litter; 2) forest soil <b>plus</b> crushed <b>litter</b> vs. field soil plus crushed litter; and 3) wet forest soil <b>plus</b> intact <b>litter</b> vs. dry forest soil <b>plus</b> intact <b>litter.</b> Frogs were left undisturbed overnight, and the next morning we recorded which side they were on. Thirty out of 33 frogs (91 %) chose the forested side in Experiment 1. A lower number, 21 out of 33 frogs (64 %), chose the forested side in Experiment 2. Twenty-one of 22 frogs (96 %) chose the wet side of Experiment 3. Because frogs are dependent on moisture to survive, the results of Experiment 3 indicate that being in an artificial setting did not affect the frog's abilities to make a choice. Therefore, the high number of forest choices can be interpreted as a preference for forested habitats. Furthermore, the stronger selection for forest in Experiment 1 rather than in Experiment 2 may mean that the frogs are choosing habitats based on structure. For instance, dead leaves might provide much better cover from predators than matted grass. Overall, these results show that conservation and management practices concerning the Southern Leopard Frog should include the forested areas around their breeding sites.

An unselected control (maintenance control; MC) was also maintained in all replicates. Selection ceased for 26 generations; heat-loss measurement and selection resumed at generation 42. Lactation performance, dam weight, dam feed intake, {{and efficiency of}} production of pup weight were recorded or calculated for MH and ML dams in all 3 replicates at generation 46 or 47 {{with the objective of}} determining whether selection for heat loss has created correlated responses in maternal performance. One-half of the dams reared their own litters, and one-half reared cross-fostered (across lines) litters. Between 10 and 12 litters were used from each replicate-line-rearing class. Litter size was recorded, and litters were standardized to 8 pups within 24 h of birth. For cross fostering, MH litters were matched to ML litters born within 24 h of each other, and MH-ML litter pairs were cross-fostered at 3 d of age. A weigh-suckle-weigh protocol was used to obtain milk production estimates over a 2 -h suckling period at 6, 9, 12, and 15 d. Dam (<b>plus</b> <b>litter)</b> feed intake was also recorded at these times and was calculated as the disappearance of feed over 3 -d intervals. Dams of the MH selection tended (P 3 ̆c 0. 11) to have greater litter size than those of the ML selection; litter size of MC dams was intermediate. Line of dam affected milk production (P = 0. 04) and dam feed intake (P 3 ̆c 0. 03) as MH dams produced more milk and consumed more feed than ML dams. Average milk production for the 2 -h measurement period was 1. 70 ± 0. 07 and 1. 41 ± 0. 07 g, and average 3 -d feed consumption was 50. 8 ± 1. 2 and 45. 2 ± 1. 2 g for MH and ML dams, respectively.

Alternative laying-hen housing systems are being adopted by some egg producers in the U. S.

40|$|Climatic warming {{leads to}} the {{expansion}} of deciduous shrubs and trees in the Arctic. This leads to higher leaf litter inputs, which together with warming may alter the rate of carbon and nutrient cycling in the arctic ecosystems. We assessed effects of factorial warming and additional litter on the soil ecosystem of a subarctic heath in a 7 -year-long field experiment. Fine root biomass, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total C concentration increased in response to warming, which probably was a result of the increased vegetation cover. Litter addition increased the concentration of inorganic P in the uppermost 5 cm soil, while decreasing the pool of total P per unit area of the organic profile and having no significant effects on N concentrations or pools. Microbial biomass C and N were unaffected by the treatments, while the microbial biomass P increased significantly with litter addition. Soil ergosterol concentration was also slightly increased by the added litter in the uppermost soil, although not statistically significantly. According to a principal component analysis of the phospholipid fatty acid profiles, litter addition differed from the other treatments by increasing the relative proportion of biomarkers for Gram-positive bacteria. The combined warming <b>plus</b> <b>litter</b> addition treatment decreased the soil water content in the uppermost 5 cm soil, which was a likely reason for many interactions between the effects of warming and litter addition. The soil organic matter quality of the combined treatment was also clearly different from the control based on a near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopic analysis, implying that the treatment altered the composition of soil organic matter. However, it appears that the biological processes and the microbial community composition responded more to the soil and litter moisture conditions than to the change in the quality of the organic matter...|$|R

Cynara cardunculus (L.) is an invasive perennial thistle that establishes high-density popula-tions in coastal California grasslands. We examined the natural distribution of C. cardunculus seedlings in an established population and found that nearly 100 % of seedlings grew within 2 m of adults despite an expected distribution peak at 3 m from source plants based on measured dispersal distances. We then investigated the role of mature plants in seedling survival and establish-ment with regard to live vegetation, litter, and seedling distance by planting seedlings at increasing distances around adults and applying removal treatments to the focal adult rosettes. We applied control (no removal), adult rosette removal (live leaves), litter removal (dead leaves), and adult rosette <b>plus</b> <b>litter</b> removal (all aboveground plant material) treatments. Seedlings experienced a higher rate of survival, measured by senescence date, and establishment, measured by return rate the following year, with all adult rosette removal treatments. Inhibition by adult rosettes was reduced with distance to 60 – 80 cm from the rosette, and there was little effect of adult plants between 80 and 200 cm. These results suggest that adult rosettes may inhibit conspecific seedlings at very close distances but provide a favorable environment for seedlings within nearby interspaces. This pattern may contribute to the creation and maintenance of high-density populations in C. car-dunculus. Land managers seeking to control this species may improve long-term effectiveness by expanding management efforts to include a 2 m radius around adult plants and treating within 5 months of seedling emer-gence to prevent recruitment rather than treating adults alone...|$|R
40|$|Arctic soil carbon (C) {{stocks are}} {{threatened}} by the rapidly advancing global warming. In addition to temperature, increasing amounts of leaf litter fall following from the expansion of deciduous shrubs and trees in northern ecosystems may alter biogeochemical cycling of C and nutrients. Our aim was to assess how factorial warming and litter addition in a long-term field experiment on a subarctic heath affect resource limitation of soil microbial communities (measured by thymidine and leucine incorporation techniques), net growing-season mineralization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and carbon turnover (measured as changes in the pools during a growing-season-long field incubation of soil cores in situ). The mainly N limited bacterial communities had shifted slightly towards limitation by C and P in response to seven growing seasons of warming. This and the significantly increased bacterial growth rate under warming may partly explain the observed higher C loss from the warmed soil. This is furthermore consistent with the less {{dramatic increase in the}} contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic N (DON) in the warmed soil than in the soil from ambient temperature during the field incubation. The added litter did not affect the carbon content, but it was a source of nutrients to the soil, and it also tended to increase bacterial growth rate and net mineralization of P. The inorganic N pool decreased during the field incubation of soil cores, especially in the separate warming and litter addition treatments, while gross mineralized N was immobilized in the biomass of microbes and plants transplanted into the incubates soil cores, but without any significant effect of the treatments. The effects of warming <b>plus</b> <b>litter</b> addition on bacterial growth rates and of warming on C and N transformations during field incubation suggest that microbial activity is an important control on the carbon balance of arctic soils under climate change...|$|R

Understanding the impact of these land-use changes on soil carbon cycling and stocks depends on accurate predictions from well parameterised models. Key considerations are cultivation disturbance and the effect of autotrophic root input stimulation on soil carbon decomposition under novel biomass crops. This paper presents partitioned parameters from the conversion of semi-improved grassland to Miscanthus bioenergy production and compares the contribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration to overall ecosystem respiration of CO 2 in the first and second years of establishment. Repeated measures of respiration from within and without root exclusion collars were used to produce time series model integrations separating live root inputs from decomposition of grass residues ploughed in with cultivation of the new crop. These parameters were then compared to total ecosystem respiration derived from eddy covariance sensors. Average soil surface respiration was 13. 4 % higher in the second growing season, increasing from 2. 9 to 3. 29 g CO 2 -C m- 2 day- 1. Total ecosystem respiration followed a similar trend, increasing from 4. 07 to 5. 4 g CO 2 -C m- 2 day- 1. Heterotrophic respiration from the root exclusion collars was 32. 2 % lower in the second growing season at 1. 20 g CO 2 -C m- 2 day- 1 compared to the previous year at 1. 77 g CO 2 -C m- 2 day- 1.

Patients with spine and head injuries and other severe neurological injuries are the most vulnerable to repeated shock and vibration exposure caused by the vehicle. It is crucial to minimize {{the effects of these}} forces on patients during air and ground medical transport. The development of new medical evacuation platforms creates a need to better understand the effects of human exposure to shock and vibration. The use of human subjects to measure whole body vibration for the evaluation of patient transport systems generates a challenge for designers of and evaluators of enroute care systems. Therefore two different supine manikins were created for this project, manikin 1 and manikin 2. Manikin 2 was a modification of manikin 1 so that it would have a closer biodynamic response to that of humans when subjected to repeated shock and vibration. The main objective of this project was to test the two manikins under various conditions and compare the results. The manikins’ design was based on the standards of a 95 th percentile male. Another objective was to analyze the utilization of a litter air bladder to lower the consequences of human exposure to repeated shock and vibration due to aero medical transport. The vibration signals used to perform the test were derived from research performed at the United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory at Fort Rucker Alabama. The vibration signals were captured from field tests conducted on a medevac litter mounted in a HH- 60 M Black Hawk helicopter in different modes of flight. After processing the recorded data, laboratory vibration tests were conducted on the manikins placed in the supine position to obtain the acceleration and transmissibility magnitudes at different locations on the manikins and the stirrup of the litter. The square root of the sum of the squares (RSS) acceleration in the real time was calculated to examine various strap restraint and stirrup clearance configurations and the effects of the use of the air bladder.

Based on limited frequency distributions of metal surface assays, estimates are made in this chapter of the incremental quantities of ferrous metals associated with specific surface radioactivity levels. Approximately 78 percent of the 511, 000 tons of ferrous metals from D&D of the diffusion plants would have an activity of less than 4, 400 Bq/kg (120 pCi/g). Copper and aluminum are also characterized from more limited data. Radioactivity levels in 59, 000 tons of aluminum were estimated to range from 14, 600 to 63, 600 Bq/kg (394 to 1, 718 pCi/g) for a mixture of radionuclides, including Tc- 99, U- 238, Pu- 239, and Np- 237. Slightly lower radioactivity levels were estimated for copper. Data were insufficient to characterize concrete radioactivity levels in the diffusion plants. Information in the publishe...|$|R

Excreta derived from such diets can be of high quality if nutrient losses are minimized. Steers were fed a basal diet of Napier grass supplemented with either commercial dairy meal at 0. 5 % of liveweight (low concentrate - LC) or dairy meal (0. 5 % liveweight) <b>plus</b> poultry <b>litter</b> (0. 5 % liveweight) (high concentrate - HC). The amount of faeces and urine collected, and the dry matter, N and K contents of the resulting manure composted with wheat straw were significantly higher with the HC than with the LC diet, {{and this was the}} case also for P and Ca content when urine was added. Significant linear relationships were observed between the daily N intake and the daily N collected in faeces and urine. Dry matter, N, K and Ca were also higher when urine was added to the faeces and straw during accumulation than when urine was excluded, and this was the case also for P with high concentrate diets. Appropriate manure management could significantly improve nutrient conservation on smallholder farms in the Central Kenya Highlands and contribute to the sustainability of intensive cropping...|$|R

These two documents are supplemented by compilations of selected publications, thesis abstracts, and the curriculum vitae of the eleven Ph. D. physicists who are carrying out this {{research program}}. This Progress Report contains {{a review of the}} research which has been done over the first half (1992 and 1993 to date) of the current three-year <b>DOE</b> grant, <b>plus</b> some earlier research to establish a broader perspective of the research interests. High energy physics research at Duke has three components. The first, Task A, is based upon experiments carried out at Fermilab`s Tevatron Collider. The group is finishing the analysis of data from their first collider experiment (E 735), a study of inclusive particle production from {bar p} p collisions at {radical}{bar s} = 1. 8 TeV. The second component of the research, Task B, deals primarily with heavy flavor physics. The third part of the research program, Task D, deals with preparation for research at the SSC. The authors have been active in the development of tracking detectors for the SSC since 1989, and are now concentrating on the design and construction of straw tube drift chambers for the solenoid detector...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows and}} {{analyzes}} the energy efficiency solutions adopted {{to renew the}} terminal T 3 of Rome International Airport at Fiumicino 'Leonardo da Vinci'. Such solutions put together the top-of-the-market energy technologies with the most innovative architectures and materials to renovate an old terminal transforming it into a Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB). For the new forepart of the terminal and for the new boarding area 'F', now under construction, a dynamic energy simulation has been performed using a software provided by the US Department of Energy (<b>DOE)</b> named Energy <b>Plus,</b> and its interface Design Builder. The tool makes possible to calculate the energy consumption of the two buildings and to assess the design {{in order to maximize}} energy efficiency and sustainability. The main results of the energy analysis are reported after detailing the case study...|$|R
40|$|Incident {{rainfall}} is a {{major source}} of nutrient input to a forest ecosystem and the consequent throughfall and stemflow contribute to nutrient cycling. These rain-based fluxes were measured over 12 mo in two forest types in Korup National Park, Cameroon, one with low (LEM) and one with high (HEM) ectomycorrhizal abundances of trees. Throughfall was 96. 6 and 92. 4 % of the incident annual rainfall (5370 mm) in LEM and HEM forests respectively; stemflow was correspondingly 1. 5 and 2. 2 %. Architectural analysis showed that ln(funneling ratio) declined linearly with increasing ln(basal area) of trees. Mean annual inputs of N, P, K, Mg and Ca in incident rainfall were 1. 50, 1. 07, 7. 77, 5. 25 and 9. 27 kg ha(- 1), and total rain-based inputs to the forest floor were 5. 0, 3. 2, 123. 4, 14. 4 and 37. 7 kg ha- 1 respectively. The value for K is high for tropical forests and that for N is low. Nitrogen showed a significantly lower loading of throughfall and stemflow in HEM than in LEM forest, this being associated in the HEM forest with a greater abundance of epiphytic bryophytes which may absorb more N. Incident rainfall provided c. 35 % of the gross input of P to the forest floor (i. e., rain-based <b>plus</b> small <b>litter</b> inputs), a surprisingly high contribution given the sandy P-poor soils. At the start of the wet season leaching of K from the canopy was particularly high. Calcium in the rain was also highest at this time, most likely due to washing off of dry-deposited Harmattan dusts. It is proposed that throughfall has an important `priming' function in the rapid decomposition of litter and mineralization of P {{at the start of the}} wet season. The contribution of P inputted from the atmosphere appears to be significant when compared to the rates of P mineralization from leaf litter...|$|R
40|$|Swedish boreal streams were {{modified}} to transport timber by pushing boulders to stream sides, creating levees that disconnected streams from riparian areas. Many streams {{have since been}} restored and {{our goal was to}} understand how this affects riparian nitrogen (N) cycling. We compared the natural abundance of delta N- 15 isotopes in foliage and roots of Filipendula ulmaria <b>plus</b> soils and <b>litter</b> along streams restored 2 - 25 years ago. We measured sources of N, potential immobilization of N, namely plant diversity and biomass, and the amount and sources of carbon (C) to determine if these were important for describing riparian N cycling. The delta N- 15 of F. ulmaria foliage changed dramatically just after restoration compared to the channelized, disconnected state and then converged over the next 25 years with the steady-state reference. The disturbance and reconnection of the stream with the riparian zone during restoration created a short-term pulse of N availability and gaseous losses of N as a result of enhanced microbial processing of N. With increasing time since restoration, N availability appears to have decreased, and N sources changed to those derived from mycorrhizae, amino acids, or the humus layer, or there was enhanced N-use efficiency by older, more diverse plant communities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Forest biomass {{is helpful}} to assess its {{productivity}} and carbon (C) sequestration capacity. Several disturbance activities in tropical forests have reduced the biomass and net primary production (NPP) leading to climate change. Therefore, an accurate estimation of forest biomass and C cycling in context of disturbances is required for implementing REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) policy. Methods: Biomass and NPP of trees and shrubs were estimated by using allometric equations while herbaceous biomass was estimated by harvest method. Fine root biomass was determined from soil monolith. The C stock in vegetation was calculated by multiplying C concentration to dry weight. Results: Total stand biomass (Mg∙ha– 1) in undisturbed forest stand (US) was 960. 4 while in disturbed forest stand (DS) it was 449. 1. The biomass (Mg∙ha– 1) of trees, shrubs and herbs in US was 948. 0, 4. 4 and 1. 4, respectively, while in DS they were 438. 4, 6. 1 and 1. 2, respectively. Total NPP (Mg∙ha– 1 ∙yr– 1) was 26. 58 (equivalent to 12. 26 Mg C∙ha– 1 ∙yr– 1) in US and 14. 91 (6. 88 Mg C∙ha– 1 ∙yr– 1) in DS. Total C input into soil through <b>litter</b> <b>plus</b> root turnover was 6. 78 and 3. 35 Mg∙ha– 1 ∙yr– 1 in US and DS, respectively. Conclusions: Several disturbance activities resulted in the significant loss in stand biomass (53...|$|R
5000|$|Combat Zone Wrestling {{has used}} WarGames stipulations the {{some of their}} Cage of Death events, the most recent being in Cage Of Death XV (2013). For Cage of Death 5, in {{that there were two}} rings; one of them was {{surrounded}} by the cage, and the other was filled with [...] "one million" [...] thumbtacks (the actual amount has never been verified). Above the two rings was scaffolding walkway on which the wrestlers could walk on at any time. The match started with two members of each team, and every 90 seconds a wrestler, from either team, entered the match according to the number they drew before the match started. These eliminations which will occurred in that would happen when a wrestler would hit the arena floor; however, Cage of Death 5 also had rules that the wrestlers who were not tossed out of or off the cage, that they could travel a scaffold hanging above another ring filled with thumbtacks to safety, scoring points for the team. For Cage of Death 6 there were eliminations that would happen when a wrestler would hit the arena floor much like Cage of Death 5 the year before, the difference being that the tag team titles were hanging on a scaffold stretched across the length of the top of the cage overlooking the two rings, <b>plus</b> all weapons <b>littered</b> around double caged ring.|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} rates of pigs subjected to different farrowing management protocols were compared. 60 litters of YorkxLandrace piglets were either unattended at farrowing or were dried, had {{the umbilical cord}} tied, had oral and nasal cavities suctioned to clear mucus, received oxygen and received bovine colostrum, all within 2 min of delivery. Mortality rates and their causes, weight gains, and haematocrit levels were recorded for the first 3 weeks of life. Total preweaning mortality was 18. 2 and 10. 1 % for the control and attended groups, respectively. The main impact of the treatment was {{the reduction of the}} animals that otherwise would have been classified as stillbirths. The stillbirth rate decreased from 6. 8 to 1. 6 % while the mortality rate during the first day decreased from 5. 2 % in the unattended litters to 2. 2 % in the attended litters, respectively. At weaning the weights of the attended piglets were higher than those of the unattended animals and overall weight gains were higher in the attended litters when compared with those of the control litters (3. 99 +or- 0. 08 and 3. 68 +or- 0. 06 kg, respectively). It is suggested that the reduction in mortality of 44 % (equivalent to about one piglet per <b>litter),</b> <b>plus</b> the benefit of enhanced performance in the attended group, could justify the implementation of a farrowing protocol which involves adding the extra labour at farrowing time, especially if several sows are attended by the same attendant. ...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen (N) isotope {{fractionation}} and symbiotic N fixation were investigated in the shrub legume tagasaste, {{growing in the}} glasshouse and field. In a pot study of effectively nodulated plants supplied with 0, 1, 5 and 10 mM nitrate [stable isotope 15 N (δ 15 N) of 3. 45 ‰], the δ 15 N of dry matter N of fully symbiotic cultures indicated a greater {{isotope fractionation}} during distribution of N between nodules, stems, leaves and roots than for N 2 fixation itself, with whole-plant δ 15 N being near zero (– 0. 46 to 0. 42 ‰). Regardless of whether plants were field-grown, pot-cultured, fixing N 2 or utilising mineral N, woody stems were depleted in 15 N relative to all other plant parts. The similar orders of ranking of δ 15 N for plant components of the nitrate-treated and fully symbiotic plants, and a general increase in δ 15 N as plants were exposed to increasing concentrations of nitrate, indicated that N isotope fractionation can be accounted for, and thus not undermine 15 N natural abundance as means of measuring N 2 fixation inputs in tagasaste trees. In pot culture the percentage of plant N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) by symbiotic N 2 fixation fell from 85 to 37 % when the nitrate supply was increased from 1 to 10 mM, with evidence of nitrate N being preferentially allocated to roots. δ 15 N natural abundance assessments of N 2 fixation of 4 -year-old trees of field-grown tagasaste in alley (550 trees ha- 1) or plantation (2330 trees ha- 1) spacing were undertaken at a study site at Moora, Western Australia, over a 2 -year period of shoot regrowth (coppicing). Cumulative N yields and %Ndfa were similar for trees of alley and plantation spacing, with much less coppice N accumulation in the first compared to the second year after cutting. Scaling values from a tree to plot area basis, and using a mean %Ndfa value of 83 % for all trees at the site, inputs of fixed N into current biomass <b>plus</b> fallen <b>litter</b> over the 2 years of coppicing were calculated to be 83 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 for the alley and 390 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 for the plantation spacing. Although the plantation tagasaste fixed 587 kg N ha- 1 in the second year, close to the maximum value {{reported in the literature}} for any N 2 -fixing system, this should not be seen as typical where the trees are used for animal production, since grazing and cutting management will substantially reduce productivity and N 2 fixation input...|$|R
