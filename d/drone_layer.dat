5000|$|The queen {{emerges from}} her cell after 15 days of {{development}} and she remains in the hive for 3-7 days before venturing out on a mating flight. Mating flight is otherwise known as [...] "nuptial flight". Her first orientation flight may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark {{the position of the}} hive. Subsequent mating flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough sperm from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mate—possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hive—she remains infertile and becomes a <b>drone</b> <b>layer,</b> incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.|$|E
5000|$|... 2001 saw {{the release}} of Penetration a record that would move the Regis sound on yet again. A {{combination}} of tonal <b>drones</b> <b>layered</b> with heavy percussion was inspirational {{to a new generation}} of techno producers. This influence was underlined when Regis and Surgeon started the British Murder Boys (BMB) project in 2002. More a group project, BMB drew on their non-techno influences to create an original concept for the dancefloor. Their recorded output included the tracks [...] "Dont Give Way To Fear", and [...] "Learn Your Lesson", but the group also played live, with gigs often ending in total chaos and digital feedback. Since 2001 Regis has been less prolific, but continues to work in techno.|$|R
5000|$|The rhythmic electroacoustic experimentalism was {{not only}} used in the studio set up, but {{continued}} in their live performances during the Drum's Not Dead tour. Microphones taped on Gross drum kit and the percussion set of Hemphill picked up the live played rhythms and were modulated heavily by digital [...] processing spring reverbs and pitch shifters forming multi <b>layered</b> <b>drones.</b> The creation of this set-up is outlined in the CD booklet for Drum's Not Dead.|$|R
50|$|A {{subject that}} can be found {{throughout}} his work is what he calls static music, which explores the microcosms of sound beyond semantic, narrative or dramatic gesture. It consists of elements like long tones and <b>drones,</b> repetition and <b>layers</b> of sustained pitches. The result is an aural sculpture, an intense physical experience with the whole body, a physics and physical approach to the phenomenon of Sounds that are continuous and three-dimensional. The same elements can be found in noise and metal music, styles Krieger includes in his newer experimental projects.|$|R
50|$|Psychedelic Desert is a noise ambient {{group from}} Osaka, Japan. Psychedelic Desert's music ranges from ambient <b>drone</b> soundscapes to <b>layers</b> of {{fluctuating}} sounds which stimulate the brainwaves of the listener. The band toured in Australia in 2008 and performed on two European tours and on various festivals in 2008 - 2010 (France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, Netherlands) and released several albums, EPs and appeared on Pharmafabrik compilation albums Fabriksampler with artists Lull, Final, Nordvargr, KK Null and remixed a track for PureH {{on the album}} Signia. The band also host special music installation events called Liquid Beat Hotel in Otoya, Kobe and Osaka.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from being}} used against ground targets, SRC Inc. has written {{software}} {{to combine the}} Switchblade with sensors {{to be able to}} intercept hostile UAVs. The Switchblade is used alongside an existing counter-artillery radar and IED jamming system, all of which can be towed by Humvees. Interception of an enemy <b>drone</b> occurs in <b>layers</b> of defenses: if a drone gets through covering jet fighters or is too small to be targeted by them, it is picked up by the fire-finding radar; once detected, the jammer performs electronic warfare to break its data-link; if the drone resists EW, the Switchblade is launched to physically impact and destroy it.|$|R
