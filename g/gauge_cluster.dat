5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
25|$|Closing out the 2004 {{model year}} was the W40 package {{featuring}} an exclusive paint color called Pulse Red, red GTO embroidery on the seats, and a grey colored <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster.</b> The last 794 of the 2004 model year GTOs were built with the W40 package.|$|E
25|$|In the interior, the rear-seat and {{headliner}} are redesigned to {{add more}} rear legroom and headroom, improving comfort, additional sound insulation is added and the cupholders are larger. A rear camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system now comes with the Navi system. Furthermore, the <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> is refreshed.|$|E
40|$|The fractal {{dimension}} D_f of sites resisting Landau or maximal Abelian(MA) gauge fixing in lattice SU(3) gluodynamics is defined and computed. In Landau gauge such sites clump into D_f ~ 1 clusters in the confining phase. In the finite temperature phase their dimensionality drops to D_f < 1, that is, clustering seems to dissipate. In contrast, MA gauge resistant sites fail to exhibit a notable tendency to cluster at any temperature. One may {{wonder if the}} one dimensional Landau <b>gauge</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are related to the}} famous MA gauge magnetic monopole currents. By evaluating a spacetime correlator between the D_f ~ 1 Landau <b>gauge</b> <b>clusters</b> and the monopole currents in MA gauge we show they are distinct...|$|R
50|$|For the 2010 model year, {{the models}} {{received}} a facelift in late 2009, adopting Kia's new Tiger nose grille. In addition, {{the steering wheel}} receives the same design as the Kia Soul and Kia Forte, featuring optional Bluetooth hands-free phone operation, and the <b>gauges</b> <b>cluster</b> receives a new red backlit design. The headlights were modified slightly, with a darker appearance and parking lights and side-marker lights sharing the turn-signal housing. Side mouldings on the car became narrower and body-colored. For the UK version, the Rio looks {{exactly the same as}} the US version, except that only the hatchback variant is sold there. It has Kia's new bowtie grille (for the 2010 model) and is powered by a 1.4 litre DOHC four-cylinder 16-valve petrol engine, or a 1.5 litre DOHC four-cylinder 16-valve diesel. They both have a five speed manual gearbox.|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 series Knight Rider the co-protagonist—a Ford Shelby GT500KR named KITT {{which is}} capable of driving itself, talking, and firing all sorts of {{offensive}} and defensive weapons—has a small EMP device on board. The car is most often seen deploying this weapon to disable vehicles that it pursues. When the EMP is discharged, it is visualized by a distorted blue wave that expands outward from KITT in a circle. The effect is a total electrical shutdown of the target vehicle, which is depicted by the car radio shutting off if in use, the <b>gauge</b> <b>clusters</b> all falling to zero, and the vehicle occupants cellphones also becomes inoperable. The target vehicle then (usually) coasts to a stop. In one episode, a continuity error {{shows up in the}} fact that after their vehicle has been EMP bombed by KITT, a two-way walkie-talkie held by one of the goons still appears to work. KITT is not affected in any way by his own EMP weapon.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was revised {{with a new}} center console, lower dash panels (to meet U.S. regulations) and a single monopod <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> (with electronic gauges). For the North American market a model dubbed the Graduate was added in tribute to the car's famous appearance in the 1967 film, The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman.|$|E
25|$|Changes to US {{models of}} Hyundai Azera include lower {{starting}} price of $31,000 ($1,250 reduction from 2013), refined steering feel and precision, standard 6-inch color LCD audio display with rearview camera, standard driver blind-spot mirror, new electroluminescent <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> with color LCD trip computer, new 8-inch navigation system standard on Limited, power-folding side mirrors standard on Limited, Hyundai Assurance Connected Care telematics services standard for three years.|$|E
25|$|The IS F Sport models include {{enhanced}} {{handling and}} performance, Adaptive Variable Suspension and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (IS 350). Not {{only does the}} F Sport handle differently, but its more aggressive styling certainly sets it apart from the basic production model. F-Sport styling includes an edition specific F-Sport pattern front grill, F-Sport logo badges, and five spoke split graphite wheels. Inside the cabin, you'll find bright, carbon fiber-like trim, extra bolstered performance seats, an all-black headliner, and an impressive moving vessel <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> that displays navigation and audio information. The F-Sport models have an edition specific Ultra White exterior and vibrant, Rioja Red interior. The 2014 model year also served as the first year to offer all-wheel drive in the IS F Sport line up.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{purchased}} {{the site in}} 1936, and spent nearly $800,000 refurbishing, updating, and equipping the plant. [...] The plant opened in 1941, and employed up to 279 people making ammeters, <b>gauges,</b> and instrument <b>clusters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1988, {{four new}} colors were introduced: Bright Blue Metallic, Forest Green Metallic, Light Mesa Brown Metallic, and Dark Mesa Brown Metallic. More new {{features}} for 1988 included a fixed mast antenna {{in place of}} the old windshield antenna, a trip odometer as part of the <b>gauge</b> package <b>cluster,</b> and an improved pulse windshield wiper control. Also, helping to reduce air leaks in the doors was a new door handle seal.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. The interior received a redesigned steering wheel, revised instrument <b>cluster</b> <b>gauges,</b> and different trim pieces.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, {{was designed to}} be user friendly. Like the previous generation, it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near {{the left side of the}} dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} drivetrain {{consisted of}} the four-barrel [...] V8 rated at [...] and the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission. Also standard were power steering and power brakes.

50|$|The Supercharged {{version of}} the S-281 was first {{introduced}} as an option for the New Edge Mustang in 1999 with a horsepower rating of 350 (261 kW). Designated as Saleen 281 CID SuperCharged, this designation was widely recognized as a separate model in 2000 with more options becoming available by Saleen. Notable internal differences of an S-281SC introduced a dual <b>gauge</b> instrument <b>cluster</b> above the dashboard, while the only external difference was a Saleen Heat Extractor hood. With {{the introduction of the}} Fifth-generation Ford Mustang, the supercharger was now installed in an upside-down configuration to provide better performance and a higher horsepower rating of 465 (347 kW).|$|R
5000|$|... 1995This {{would be}} the last year of the {{traditional}} 3 seater body that Sea-Doo was using for the GTX. Design was similar to 1994 with same colors, but with different font for the GTX decal, and more aerodynamically designed side-view mirrors. Engine was 657x with dual carburetors producing 80HP. <b>Cluster</b> <b>gauges</b> included speedometer and digital fuel gauge with individual warning lights for fuel, battery, oil, and temperature.Color Scheme:Green and White, purple rear handlebar ...|$|R
2500|$|Engines {{were carried}} over from 1973, {{including}} the [...] V8 (standard on the Model J) and [...] (standard on the Model SJ, optional on the Model J). A Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, and power brakes were standard equipment on both models. In {{addition to the}} 455 V8, the Model SJ also added a Rally <b>Gauge</b> <b>Cluster,</b> [...] "SJ" [...] identification, and a radial-tuned suspension similar to Pontiac's Grand Am. Radial tires were also a new option on the Model J this year.|$|E
2500|$|The Tempest line, {{including}} the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding [...] {{to the overall}} length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac's characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight increased about [...] The brake lining area increased nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front antisway bar. The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> ($86.08) added a more legible tachometer and oil pressure gauge. An additional option was a breakerless transistor ignition.|$|E
2500|$|The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, {{moving the}} turn signal {{indicators}} {{to the front}} bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster</b> with a tachometer appeared. Interestingly, the front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. [...] The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. [...] Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was [...] "1970-something" [...] meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|The eggcrate grille {{featured}} on the 1955 cars was widened {{into a series of}} rectangles for 1956, but this subtle exterior change was nothing compared to Ford's adoption of a 12-volt electrical system across the line.

40|$|Real time {{rainfall}} for {{flood forecasting}} is predominately measured by rain gauges and weather radars. Analysis of rainfall data measured simultaneously by a dense {{rain gauge network}} and weather radar over the Brue catchment, {{during a period of}} six years, was undertaken using Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis. Wind, temperature, relative humidity for the major storms events over the Brue were modelled by the numerical weather model MM 5. PCA provided information regarding the state of the existing rain gauge network in terms of redundancy and adequacy of the rain <b>gauge</b> network. <b>Cluster</b> analysis was used to identify the best rain gauge locations.

40|$|Bipartite field {{theories}} (BFTs) are a {{new class}} of 4 d N = 1 quantum field theories defined by bipartite graphs on bordered Riemann surfaces. In this paper we derive, purely in terms of the <b>gauge</b> theory, the <b>cluster</b> transformations of face weights under square moves in the graph. In this context, we obtain them by connecting regular parametrizations of the master space of the associated BFTs. For BFTs on a disk, these transformations follow from the properties of coordinates in the Grassmannian.

2500|$|Car Life {{tested a}} 1965 GTO with Tri-Power {{and what they}} {{considered}} the most desirable options (close-ratio four-speed manual transmission, power steering, metallic brakes, rally wheels, 4.11 limited-slip differential, and [...] "Rally" [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster),</b> with a total sticker price of US$3,643.79. With two testers and equipment aboard, they recorded 0–60miles per hour (0–97km/h) in 5.8seconds, the standing quarter mile in 14.5seconds with a trap speed of 100miles per hour (160km/h), and an observed top speed of 114miles per hour (182.4km/h) at the engine's 6,000rpm redline. A four-barrel Motor Trend test car, a heavier convertible handicapped by the two-speed automatic transmission {{and the lack of}} a limited slip differential, ran 0–60mph in 7seconds and through the quarter mile in 16.1 seconds at 89miles per hour (142.4km/h).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{structural}} improvement was a stronger {{design for the}} side door guard beams. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) for coupes and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels (which was also optional with the Monte Carlo), as was the instrument <b>gauge</b> <b>cluster.</b> A power moonroof was an option 1973-75.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that environmental change can influence human migration. In particular, the environment {{plays a role}} in migration processes in drylands, in which environmental change—including increasing variability of rainfall, increasing frequency of droughts, chronic water shortage, and land degradation—can heavily influence migration. However, systematic large-scale studies of the relationship between environmental factors and human migration are rare, and a global, consistent picture of environmental drivers of migration is lacking. In this study, we sought to fill this gap by analysing spatial patterns of environmental drivers of migration in drylands by performing a cluster analysis on spatially explicit global data. In this analysis, we focused explicitly on precipitation, aridity, drought, land degradation, soil constraints, and availability of cropland and pastures as potential environmental drivers of migration in drylands. In addition, we linked the identified clusters to two observed hotspots of out-migration—Burkina Faso and Northeast Brazil—to <b>gauge</b> the <b>cluster</b> results. Our results show that environmental drivers can be grouped into eight distinct clusters, and we identified the most severe environmental constraints for each cluster. These results suggest that out-migration—both in absolute and relative terms—occurs most frequently in a cluster that is constrained primarily by land degradation rather than water availability...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen rain {{measurement}} {{instruments were}} deployed on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ship Ronald H. Brown during the 1997 Pan American Climate Studies (PACS) Tropical Eastern Pacific Process Study (TEPPS). To examine differences in rainfall catchment related to instrument design, {{three types of}} dis-drometers, an optical rain gauge, a ship rain gauge, and a siphon <b>gauge</b> were <b>clustered</b> in one location to ensure similar exposure. To address exposure effects, eight siphon rain gauges were deployed on different sides {{of the ship and}} on several different levels. Cross-ship differences in hourly rainfall accumulation were negligible when relative wind speeds were less than 3 m s 21 and became significant at greater than 5 m s 21, especially when the relative wind direction was 208 or greater from the bow. Instruments with both horizontal and vertical catchment surfaces yielded a measurable collection advantage over instruments with only horizontal catchment surfaces. Analysis of data collected during TEPPS using a multiple-instrument, multiple-location approach yields the following recommendations for reducing uncertainty in rain measurement at sea.

40|$|Protein {{receptor}} conformations, {{obtained from}} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, {{have become a}} promising treatment of its explicit flexibility in molecular docking experiments applied to drug discovery and development. However, incorporating the entire ensemble of MD conformations in docking experiments to screen large candidate compound libraries is currently an unfeasible task.

Nevertheless, the RMSD only {{may not be the most}} appropriate <b>gauge</b> to <b>cluster</b> conformations when the target receptor has a plastic active site, since they are influenced by changes that occur on other parts of the structure. Hence, we have applied two partitioning methods (k-means and k-medoids) and four agglomerative hierarchical methods (Complete linkage, Ward's, Unweighted Pair Group Method and Weighted Pair Group Method) to analyze and compare the quality of partitions between a data set composed of properties from an enzyme receptor substrate-binding cavity and two data sets created using different RMSD approaches. Ensembles of representative MD conformations were generated by selecting a medoid of each group from all partitions analyzed. We investigated the performance of our new method for evaluating binding conformation of drug candidates to the InhA enzyme, which were performed by cross-docking experiments between a 20 ns MD trajectory and 20 different ligands. Statistical analyses showed that the novel ensemble, which is represented by only 0. 48 % of the MD conformations, was able to reproduce 75 % of all dynamic behaviors within the binding cavity for the docking experiments performed. Moreover, this new approach not only outperforms the other two RMSD-clustering solutions, but it also shows to be a promising strategy to distill biologically relevant information from MD trajectories, especially for docking purposes...|$|R
