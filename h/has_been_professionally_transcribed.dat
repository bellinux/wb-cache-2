40|$|Utah State University’s Music Therapy Program has a close {{association}} with the Community Abuse Prevention Services Agency (CAPSA) located in Logan, UT. CAPSA provides a variety of services to {{victims of domestic violence}} and sexual assault including a fourteen-week women’s support group designed to help victims work through the therapeutic process of naming, accepting, and moving forward from the abuse. Fourteen modules <b>have</b> currently <b>been</b> written and compiled into a manual for these sessions. Once finished, the manual will be published and distributed to other abuse prevention agencies throughout the nation for use in leading women support groups similar to the present program. Songs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> composed that are musically and lyrically appropriate for this target population and specifically relate to the four large themes in this fourteen-module manual. The research results include literature on how music <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used in treating victims of domestic violence and the process of how five original songs scores and lyrics were created to specifically address the module issues and themes. The songs contain messages, structures, and feelings taken from first hand observations of women who were victims of domestic violence. The original songs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>professionally</b> recorded, <b>transcribed,</b> and will be sent with the published group sessions manual across the nation to other abuse shelters like CAPSA...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} priority {{setting and}} decision-making {{in primary care}} organisations and to determine how resources are managed {{in order to meet}} the oral health needs of local populations. Method: This is a qualitative study. The purposive sample comprised twelve dental public health consultants and six senior finance representatives from contrasting care systems across the United Kingdom. Participants completed a written information sheet followed by a recorded semi-structured telephone interview. Conversations <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> verbatim and analysed independently by two investigators using the constant comparative method. Results: The emergent themes focused upon: the role of participants in decision-making; professional relationships; managing change; information needs; and identifying and managing priorities. There was wide interpretation with respect to participants' roles and perceived information needs for decision-making and commissioning. A unifying factor was the importance placed by participants upon trust and the influence of individuals on the success of relationships forged between primary care organisations and general dental practitioners. Conclusion: To facilitate decision-making in primary care organisations, commissioners and managers could engage further with practitioners and incorporate them into commissioning and resource allocation processes. Greater clarity is required regarding the role of dental public health consultants within primary care organisations and commissioning decisions...|$|R
