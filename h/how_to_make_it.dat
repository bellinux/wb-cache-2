However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} by Emilio Segrè's {{group in}} April and May 1944 of {{high levels of}} plutonium-240 in reactor-produced plutonium [...] meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, but studies indicated {{that this would be}} extremely difficult to achieve. [...] By August 1944, the calculations had been made of how an ideal spherical implosion would work; the problem was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work in the real world where jets and spalling were a problem. Christy worked in Rudolf Peierls's T-1 Group, which studied the theory of implosion. He suggested the possibility of using a solid plutonium core that would form a critical mass when compressed. This was an ultra-conservative design that solved the problem of jets by brute force. [...] It became known as the [...] "Christy pit" [...] or [...] "Christy gadget", [...] "gadget" [...] being the laboratory euphemism for a bomb. However the solid pit was intrinsically less efficient than a hollow pit, and it required a modulated neutron initiator to start the chain reaction. [...] Christy worked with Klaus Fuchs, Paul Stein and Hans Bethe to develop a suitable initiator design, which became known as an [...] "urchin". The Gadget used in the Trinity nuclear test and the Fat Man used in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki used Christy pits.|$|E

Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because [...] "We just couldn't figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work and not {{take away from the}} central story of Belle." [...] Upon learning that [...] "Human Again" [...] was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return [...] "to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple," [...] the ultimate result of which was the love song [...] "Something There," [...] which has been described as [...] "shorter and more direct" [...] than [...] "Human Again". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence {{near the end of the}} film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and [...] "as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work".|$|E

[...] In many reviews, Miller's self-deprecation was outweighed by critical praise for his talents in vocal phrasing, inventiveness, and musical ambition.

2500|$|Although several makeup effects {{companies}} were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Stan Winston was not {{directly involved in}} the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on [...] creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, [...] "The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> affordable. We knew {{there was going to be}} a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given." [...] Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, [...] "We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters." [...] During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible. Hurd explained, [...] "We wanted the aliens to be more like a different ethnic race than like lizard people, ..." [...] She added, [...] "We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not so different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters–not creatures." [...] A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that [...] "the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster's comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead." [...] Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had [...] "heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters." [...] Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.|$|E
