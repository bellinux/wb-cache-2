When Alpha arrived on Hispaniola it brought between 4inches (101mm) and 7.9in (201mm) of rain which triggered floods and landslides.

In {{an effort}} to reduce {{suspended}} solids and organic carbon loading and to increase long-term groundwater recharge rates at Orange County Water District’s spreading basins, a pilot project was conducted to evaluate riverbed filtration as a technology to treat river water prior to groundwater recharge. A shallow under-channel lateral <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> was constructed within a channel adjacent to the Santa Ana River to induce and capture infiltration. Water pumped from the <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> was analyzed for a variety of water quality parameters and then recharged into test spreading basins to evaluate recharge rates compared to Santa Ana River water without treatment. Riverbed filtered water and untreated water was also tested in percolation columns. At the pilot project <b>drain</b> <b>system,</b> phreatic surface and temperature were continuously monitored at thirteen points. River water inflow and outflow and <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> pumping rates were also monitored. The pilot test was divided into two periods: Period 1 had shallow overflow (1 - to 3 -inches) within the river channel; Period 2 achieved deeper surface water depths (3 - to 12 -inches). Lateral <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> pumping during both test periods were incrementally increased to establish the maximum pumping capacity of the <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> for each test period. Monitoring data indicate that riverbed filtration effectively removed essentially all suspended solids and reduced organic carbon contents with the bulk of water captured by the under-channel <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> from induced infiltration. The phreatic surface and subsurface water movement within the <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> area was shown to be very sensitive to changes in surface water flow rates and depth, and <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> pumping rates. In addition, surface clogging was observed. The pilot project results indicate that riverbed filtration is a viable technology for treating surface water prior to recharge operations, however, additional testing and optimization is needed...|$|R

50|$|For their renowned <b>draining</b> <b>system,</b> Lothal {{engineers}} provided corbelled roofs, and {{an apron}} of kiln-fired bricks over the brick {{face of the}} platform where the sewerage entered the cesspool. Wooden screens inserted in grooves in the side drain walls held back solid waste. The well is built of radial bricks, 2.4 m in diameter and 6.7 m deep. It had an immaculate network of underground drains, silting chambers and cesspools, and inspection chambers for solid waste. The extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets, organisation of housing and baths. On average, the main sewer is 20 - 46 cm in depth, with outer dimensions of 86 × 68 × 33 cm (34 × 27 × 13 in). Lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks, designed with care in regards to thickness of structures. They were used as headers and stretchers in same and alternate layers. Archaeologists estimate that in most cases, the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides, in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of Lothal scale of 25 mm.|$|E
