5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has an <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of 200m (219yd) and {{a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when fired from the P90, and an <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of 50m (55yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} classification is a discipline {{in its own}} right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their <b>effective</b> <b>range,</b> their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses {{the means by which}} they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.|$|E
5|$|The 5-inch/38 {{functioned as}} a dual purpose gun. However, this {{did not mean that}} it possessed {{inferior}} anti-air abilities; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board North Carolina, the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft flying at , which was twice as far as the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of the earlier single purpose 5-inch/25 anti-air gun.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a dynamic load balancing method of domain decomposition for 3 -dimensional Molecular Dynamics on parallel computers. In {{order to reduce}} interprocessor communication overhead, we are introducing a concept of permanent cells to the dynamic load balancing method. Molecular Dynamics simulations on a parallel computer T 3 E prove that the proposed method using load balancing much improves the execution time. Furthermore, we analyze theoretical <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> of the dynamic load balancing method, and compare them with experimental <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> obtained by parallel Molecular Dynamics simulations. As the result, the theoretical upper bounds predict experimental <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> and are also valid on commercial parallel computers...|$|R

50|$|Maximum <b>effective</b> {{indirect}} <b>range</b> of the OG-15V HE-Frag round against formation targets is 4400 m. Its <b>effective</b> {{direct fire}} <b>range</b> against small point targets is around 1000 m.|$|R
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of the guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its thick frontal armour, {{flanking}} manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements. Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of Allied tank guns.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{takes place}} entirely in outer space. The playing area is vast when {{compared}} to the small starfighters piloted by the player and the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> they have. This space is populated with interstellar bodies such as stars, planets, asteroids, etc. The implementation of nebulae as an interactive environment {{is one of the most}} distinctive and crowning aspects of FreeSpace 2. Flying through a nebula involves impaired vision, and occasional disruptions to flight electronics. Nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} have played OMG the most {{significant}} {{difference is that the}} ground scale and time scales have been halved due to the shorter <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> of direct fire weapons, although the only noticeable difference is the range of artillery.|$|R
50|$|Because of its low toxicity, it {{is useful}} as a buffer for {{biological}} systems with <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> between pH 2.5-3.8 and 7.5-8.9, however, it is only moderately stable for storage once dissolved. It {{is used in the}} synthesis of more complex peptides.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified approach on {{determination of the}} <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> based on equivalent law of strain energy and fatigue damage model, so as to provide an efficient approach for accurately assessing effective fatigue stress of existing bridge under traffic loading. A new theoretical framework to relate variable- and constant-amplitude fatigue is proposed in this paper. Different formulation for calculating <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> can be derived by the proposed theory, which include the <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> by the root mean square, by Miner's law and a new <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> based on the nonlinear fatigue damage model. Comparison of the theoretical results of fatigue damage under the <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> of the variable-amplitude stress spectrum and experimental data of fatigue damage under realistic traffic loading has confirmed {{the validity of the}} proposed theory. As a way to relate variable-amplitude fatigue data with constant-amplitude data, the <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> provides the most convenient way for evaluating fatigue damage under variable-amplitude loading. The proposed theory is then applied to provide an efficient approach for accurately assessing fatigue damage of existing bridges under traffic loading, in which online strain history data measured from bridge structural health monitoring system is available. The proposed approach is applied to evaluate the <b>effective</b> stress <b>range</b> for the purpose of the fatigue analysis of a deck section of a long-span steel bridge-the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong.

5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her <b>effective</b> <b>range.</b> Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E
50|$|The Chauchat was not {{comparable}} to the submachine guns of World War I, which used pistol, rather than rifle, ammunition and were thus less powerful. Compared to the Chauchat, the early submachine guns were used in relatively small numbers (thousands, rather than hundreds of thousands) and had much shorter <b>effective</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
30|$|The single-salt NaCl {{solutions}} {{showed a}} similar trend to the KCl solutions. However, {{it appeared to}} be not as <b>effective</b> <b>ranging</b> from 60 to 22 % from DF 7 to DF 10. DF 6 was the exception as it generated only a 20 % loss and does not fit into the general trend.|$|R
5000|$|The Satevari ( [...] სატევარი {{translated}} as [...] "Dagger" [...] ) MSWP is a bicaliber modular sniper rifle paltform developed by STC DELTA primarily for military but also limited civilian use. It {{was designed as}} convertible precision sniper rifle able to maintain high accuracy over long <b>ranges</b> and maximum <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> accordingly to cartridge and corresponding conversion.|$|R
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|By 17:35, Sydney {{was heading}} south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from {{multiple}} fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing {{and could not}} be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of <b>effective</b> <b>range.</b> The cruiser continued to be hit by shells from Kormorans aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported that around 17:45, all four torpedoes from Sydneys starboard launcher were fired, but as Kormoran was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from Sydneys port launcher were ever fired, which must have happened some time earlier. The raider's engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on Sydney at a high rate despite being immobilised, although many of the shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. Kormoran ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The Southwest Pacific {{was not a}} {{promising}} theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day {{did not have the}} range to reach Japan from Australia, and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries. This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.|$|E
50|$|The Type 91 torpedo was 450 mm (17¾ in) diameter. There {{were five}} models put into service, with high {{explosive}} warheads weighing 213.5 kg to 526.0 kg (or 470.7 lb to 1160 lb) and having <b>effective</b> <b>ranges</b> of 1,500 m to 2,000 m (or 1,640 yd to 2,187 yd) at 42 knots (77.8 km/h or 48.34 mph).|$|R

5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed {{in more recent}} years. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II-era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much, and can be transported by helicopter—as opposed to the M198, which requires a C-5 or C-17 to airlift. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> to —a longer range {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will be capable of firing 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give Zumwalt-class destroyers the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M-198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are far less expensive than a cruise missile, and are therefore a better alternative to many combat situations.|$|E
