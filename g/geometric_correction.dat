40|$|<b>Geometric</b> <b>correction</b> of SAR {{satellite}} imagery {{is the process}} to adjust the model parameters that define the relationship between ground and image coordinates. To achieve sub-pixel geolocation accuracy, {{the adoption of the}} appropriate <b>geometric</b> <b>correction</b> model and parameters is important. Until now, various <b>geometric</b> <b>correction</b> models have been developed and applied. However, it is still difficult for general users to adopt a suitable <b>geometric</b> <b>correction</b> models having sufficient precision. In this regard, this paper evaluated the orbit-based and time-offset-based models with an error simulation. To evaluate the <b>geometric</b> <b>correction</b> models, Radarsat- 1 images that have large errors in satellite orbit information and TerraSAR-X images that have a reportedly high accuracy in satellite orbit and sensor information were utilized. For Radarsat- 1 imagery, the <b>geometric</b> <b>correction</b> model based on the satellite position parameters has a better performance than the model based on time-offset parameters. In the case of the TerraSAR-X imagery, two <b>geometric</b> <b>correction</b> models had similar performance and could ensure sub-pixel geolocation accuracy...|$|E
