40|$|AbstractDysregulated {{expression}} of MYC family genes is {{a hallmark of}} many malignancies. Unfortunately, these proteins are not amenable to blockade by small molecules or protein-based therapeutic agents. Therefore, we must find alternative approaches to target MYC-driven cancers. Amplification of MYCN, a MYC family member, predicts high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) disease. We have shown that R 9 -caPep blocks the interaction of PCNA with its binding partners and selectively kills human NB cells, especially those with MYCN amplification, and we now show the mechanism. We found elevated levels of DNA replication stress in MYCN-amplified NB cells. R 9 -caPep exacerbated DNA replication stress in MYCN-amplified NB cells and NB cells with an augmented level of MYC by interfering with DNA replication <b>fork</b> <b>extension,</b> leading to Chk 1 dependence and susceptibility to Chk 1 inhibition.

40|$|Regulator of {{telomere}} length 1 (RTEL 1) is {{an essential}} DNA helicase that disassembles telomere loops (T loops) and suppresses telomere fragility to maintain the integrity of chromosome ends. We established that RTEL 1 also associates with the replisome through binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Mouse cells disrupted for the RTEL 1 -PCNA interaction (PIP mutant) exhibited accelerated senescence, replication fork instability, reduced replication <b>fork</b> <b>extension</b> rates, and increased origin usage. Although T-loop disassembly at telomeres was unaffected in the mutant cells, telomere replication was compromised, leading to fragile sites at telomeres. RTEL 1 -PIP mutant mice were viable, but loss of the RTEL 1 -PCNA interaction accelerated the onset of tumorigenesis in p 53 -deficient mice. We propose that RTEL 1 plays {{a critical role in}} both telomere and genome-wide replication, which is crucial for genetic stability and tumor avoidance. The stability of the genome is critically de-pendent on the coordinate action of DNArepair pathways during the cell cycle (1).

Here, we have employed DNA fiber labeling to quantify, for the first time, {{the extent to which}} Chk 1 maintains global replication fork rates during normal vertebrate S phase. We report that replication fork rates in Chk 1 −/− chicken DT 40 cells are on average half of those observed with wild-type cells. Similar results were observed if Chk 1 was inhibited or depleted in wild-type DT 40 cells or HeLa cells by incubation with Chk 1 inhibitor or small interfering RNA. In addition, reduced rates of <b>fork</b> <b>extension</b> were observed with permeabilized Chk 1 −/− cells in vitro. The requirement for Chk 1 for high fork rates during normal S phase was not to suppress promiscuous homologous recombination at replication forks, because inhibition of Chk 1 similarly slowed fork progression in XRCC 3 −/− DT 40 cells. Rather, we observed an increased number of replication fibers in Chk 1 −/− cells in which the nascent strand is single-stranded, supporting the idea that slow global fork rates in unperturbed Chk 1 −/− cells are associated with the accumulation of aberrant replication fork structures...|$|E
40|$|Topoisomerase I {{cleavage}} complexes can {{be induced}} {{by a variety}} of DNA damages and by the anticancer drug camptothecin. We have developed a ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) assay to analyze replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks induced by topoisomerase I cleavage complexes in human colon carcinoma HT 29 cells at the nucleotide level. We found that conversion of topoisomerase I cleavage complexes into replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks was only detectable on the leading strand for DNA synthesis, which suggests an asymmetry in the way that topoisomerase I cleavage complexes are metabolized on the two arms of a replication <b>fork.</b> <b>Extension</b> by Taq DNA polymerase was not required for ligation to the LM-PCR primer, indicating that the 3 ′ DNA ends are extended by DNA polymerase in vivo closely to the 5 ′ ends of the topoisomerase I cleavage complexes. These findings suggest that the replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks generated at topoisomerase I cleavage sites are produced by replication runoff. We also found that the 5 ′ ends of these DNA double-strand breaks are phosphorylated in vivo, which suggests that a DNA 5 ′ kinase activity acts on the double-strand ends generated by replication runoff. The replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks were rapidly reversible after cessation of the topoisomerase I cleavage complexes, suggesting the existence of efficient repair pathways for removal of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent adducts in ribosomal DNA...|$|E

40|$|Context: Despite the {{abundance}} of techniques for the repair of Hypospadias, its problems still persist and a satisfactory design to correct the penile curvature {{with the formation of}} neourethra from the native urethral tissue or genital or extragenital tissues, with minimal postoperative complications has yet to evolve. Aim: Persisting with such an endeavor, a new technique for the repair of distal and midpenile hypospadias is described. Materials and Methods: The study has been done in 70 cases over the past 11 years. The "Forked-Flap" repair is a single stage method for the repair of such Hypospadias with chordee. It takes advantage of the rich vascular communication at the corona and capitalizes on the established reliability of the meatal based flip-flap. The repair achieves straightening of the curvature of the penis by complete excision of chordee tissue from the ventral surface of the penis beneath the urethral plate. The urethra is reconstructed using the native plate with <b>forked</b> flap <b>extensions</b> and genital tissue relying on the concept of meatal based flaps. Water proofing by dartos tissue and reinforcement by Nesbit′s prepucial tissue transfer completes the one stage procedure. Statistical Analysis: An analysis of 70 cases of this single stage technique of repair of penile hypospadias with chordee, operated at 3 to 5 years of age over the past 11 years is presented. Results and Conclusion: The Forked Flap gives comparable and replicable results; except for a urethrocutaneous fistula rate of 4 % no other complications were observed...|$|R
40|$|Helicases play central {{roles in}} {{initiation}} and elongation of DNA replication. We previously reported that helicase and ATPase {{activities of the}} mammalian Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 complex are activated specifically by thymine-rich single-stranded DNA. Here, we examined its substrate preference and helicase actions using various synthetic DNAs. On a bubble substrate, Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the 5 ′-proximal 25 nt single-stranded segments adjacent to the branch points, presumably generating double hexamers. Loss of thymine residues from one single-strand results in significant decrease of unwinding efficacy, suggesting that concurrent bidirectional unwinding by a single double hexameric Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 {{may play a role}} in efficient unwinding of the bubble. Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 binds and unwinds various <b>fork</b> and <b>extension</b> structures carrying a single-stranded 3 ′-tail DNA. The extent of helicase activation depends on the sequence context of the 3 ′-tail, and the maximum level is achieved by DNA with 50 % or more thymine content. Strand displacement by Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 is inhibited, as the GC content of the duplex region increases. Replacement of cytosine–guanine pairs with cytosine–inosine pairs in the duplex restored unwinding, suggesting that mammalian Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 helicase has difficulties in unwinding stably base-paired duplex. Taken together, these findings reveal important features on activation and substrate preference of the eukaryotic replicative helicase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Alloy is an {{increasingly}} popular lightweight specification lan-guage based on relational logic. Alloy models can be automatically ver-ified within a bounded scope using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. Since false assertions {{can usually be}} disproved using small counter-examples, this approach suffices for most applications. Unfortunately, it can sometimes lead to {{a false sense of}} security, and in critical applications a more tradi-tional unbounded proof may be required. The automatic theorem prover Prover 9 {{has been shown to be}} particularly effective for proving theorems of relation algebras [7], a quantifier-free (or point-free) axiomatization of a fragment of relational logic. In this paper we propose a transla-tion from Alloy specifications to <b>fork</b> algebras (an <b>extension</b> of relation algebras with the same expressive power as relational logic) which en-ables their unbounded verification in Prover 9. This translation covers not only logic assertions, but also the structural aspects (namely type declarations), and was successfully implemented and applied to several examples. ...|$|R
