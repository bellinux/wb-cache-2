His wife remained in Beijing; and, due to her work as the Party secretary of Beijing Normal University, was only able to visit infrequently. Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to complain to Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng {{spent most of his}} free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged: <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed {{to the members of the}} Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of. In 1960 Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.|$|E

He {{graduated from high}} school at age fifteen, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have graduated several years earlier. His graduation was postponed due to taking additional courses at another high school and also partly because of his mother's death. He entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1923. While in college he joined the Zeta Psi fraternity. He raised the needed membership fees partly by playing billiards. He was initiated as a member of Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society. He chose engineering because {{he did not want to}} be an academic like his father. He also felt that engineering had good job prospects.|$|E
25|$|Originally an {{employee}} with the Cadbury confectionery firm in Birmingham, {{he was first}} engaged by Warwickshire as a professional in 1904 but played only irregularly for over half a decade owing {{to the presence of}} Lilley behind the stumps. When, after losing his Test place Lilley decided to concentrate on batting, Tiger Smith took his opportunity remarkably well, and developed a remarkable understanding with Frank Foster in his first full season in 1910. The following year Warwickshire achieved an astonishing triumph in the County Championship even though the abnormally dry and hot weather made it an utter fluke based around the pace bowling of Foster and Frank Field. Smith kept wicket superbly – standing up to Foster <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get great pace off the extremely fast pitches – and made a remarkable advance in batting. He had not scored one half century before 1911 but advanced to over 800 runs with a century against Surrey at Edgbaston.|$|E

500|$|During the Vietnam War Gorski {{volunteered to}} serve in the {{military}} [...] "because he thought {{it was the right thing}} to do" [...] <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have sought a graduate school deferment. Joining the United States Marine Corps, he attended Marine Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1967. After this he was deployed to Vietnam, beginning his tour of duty in December 1967. Initially he served as a platoon commander in a motor transport battalion stationed at Gia Le near Da Nang, under the command of Colonel Robert Reilly. While deployed, Gorksi took part in the Battle of Huế during the Tet Offensive, at which time his unit was employed largely in an infantry role. [...] In April 1968, Gorski was the officer responsible for the night watch of battalion headquarters in Gia Le, when a North Vietnamese assault breached the perimeter wire fence. During the skirmish that followed, Gorksi directed artillery and mortar fire. About a dozen North Vietnamese were killed in the engagement, along with three Marines. In January 1969 Gorski returned to the United States, having risen to the rank of captain. He earned no medals for bravery, however, nor was he wounded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last three}} Tests were drawn, {{but not without}} incident; Wisden wrote [...] "as the tour progressed he took more knocks than most from the bowlers. Nobody relished the short-pitched bowling, but Barrington showed his dislike more than most {{and as a result}} became a special target. Nevertheless, he fought bravely". Barrington proved {{vulnerable}} as his expressive face encouraged the fast bowlers and he ducked late, making him look ungainly. His roommate Ray Illingworth said he cried at night because of his injuries and Hall marked him out for his most hostile bowling. Barrington made 16 and 4 in the Third Test and was barely declared fit for the Fourth Test after suffering from bronchial asthma and being hit on the elbow by Hall. He retired hurt for a few minutes, but declined to go to hospital and resumed his innings <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not play any strokes, making 5 runs in a stand of 39 with Dave Allen and making a duck in the second innings. A century against Berbice helped him return to form and even though he was forced to retire hurt when hit on the knuckles by Hall he returned to hook and cut his way to 69 in the last Test. England won the series 1–0, the first time they had won a Test series in the Caribbean and Barrington's 420 runs (46.66) were an important part of this victory.|$|E

Since 1975 he was also a true philatelist who mounted his collection artistically and with informative explanations on sheets of his own design. Other indoor interests that served as a background to his major pursuit were classical music, with a strong penchant towards the Vienna school, smoking a pipe or a cigar and enjoying a glass of good wine or Scotch whisky. His dislikes included sports, entertainment programmes on TV and popular music. At 60, Sjögren decided to retire from Saab, but still devoted some of his time to Saab matters - such as writing the book [...] "The Saab Way" [...] - so <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> now <b>could</b> devote all the time he wanted to his other hobbies, he still seemed to have gasoline in his blood.|$|R

There was a charm, too, even for a tired man, in the eerie stillness of the lone twilight land through which he was passing, a grey shadow-hung land which seemed to have been emptied of all things that belonged to the daytime, and filled with a lurking, moving life of which one knew nothing beyond the sense that it was there. There, and very near. If there had been wood-gods and wicked-eyed fauns in the sunlit groves and hill sides of old Hellas, surely there were watchful, living things of kindred mould in this dusk-hidden wilderness of field and hedge and coppice.|$|E

40|$|The stable {{marriage}} problem, as {{addressed by}} Gale and Shapely [1] consists {{of providing a}} bipartite matching between n " boys " and n " girls "-each of whom have a totally ordered preference list over the other set-such that there exists no " boy " and no " girl " that would prefer each other over their partner in the matching. In this paper, we analyze the cases of strategic play by the " boys " in the game directly inspired by this problem. We provide an O(n^ 3) algorithm for determining a matching which is not necessarily stable in the Gale-Shapely sense, but it is coalition-stable, in that no player has a selfish interest to leave the resulting grand coalition to join any potential alternative one which might feasibly form, and is also man-optimal. Thus, under a realistic assumption set, no player has an interest to " destabilize " the matching, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> theoretically <b>could.</b> The resulting matching is often better than the naïve Gale-Shapely one for some (not all) of the " boys ", being no worse for the rest. This matching is more realistic (stable) than the one produced by top-trading-cycles method, thus offering a qualitative improvement over the latter. Furthermore, we analyze the situation when players are allowed to make strategic threats (i. e. be willing to sacrifice their own outcome to hurt others), offer a relevant example to illustrate the benefits of this form of play, and ultimately provide an exponential time algorithm which tries to determine a good threat-making strategy. We then briefly examine a few other non-conventional possibilities a player has to affect his outcome. Most common variations to the game model are also described and analyzed with regard to applicability of the methods in this paper. Finally, {{a few examples of}} real-life problems which can be modeled and solved with the methods in this paper are presented. Comment: 89 pages, 8 sections. Main result in Section 3.

On his own showing he was a most revengeful person and one who declined to agree to a quite suitable alliance, apparently desired by both parties, merely because it offended his family pride. No, on reflection he might be unjust to Oro in this particular, since he never told that story; it was only shown in some pictures which very likely were just made up to astonish us. Meanwhile, it was his business to preach to this old sinner down in that hole, and he confessed honestly that he did not like the job.
