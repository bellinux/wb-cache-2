40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to examine the influence of negative framing and adverse selection to manager’s <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> continuing a failing project (escalation of commitment) and influence of job rotation to manager’s <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> discontinuing a failing project. Prospect and agency theory are used for explaining this study. This experiment was using factorial design 2 x 2 with instrument like cases given for 160 respondents. Hypotheses {{in this study were}} analyzed by using two ways ANOVA to find out the main effect and joint effect between two variables. The results show that negative framing has significance influence to manager’s <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> continuing a failing project. On the other hand, interactive effect between negative framing and adverse selection to manager’s <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> continuing a failing project has no significance influence. This study also shows that there is significance influence between job rotation to manager’s <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> discontinuing a failing project. However interactive effect between job rotation and adverse selection to manager’s <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> discontinuing a failing project has no significance influence...|$|R

5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> its first century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights {{two reasons for}} this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v.

Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral <b>decisions.</b> <b>For</b> example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Dead Money: The first add-on pack was {{released}} for the Xbox 360 on December 21, 2010 and for PlayStation 3 and PC (via Steam) on February 22, 2011. In Dead Money, the Courier is captured by an insane ex-Brotherhood of Steel leader known as Father Elijah and must work alongside three other captives {{to find the}} fabled treasure of the Sierra Madre Casino, concealed from the world by a deadly toxic cloud. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, new weapons, perks, terrain, enemies and <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> the player, as well as raising the level cap by five.

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim {{was to create a}} more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind.

5|$|In January 2009, Ubisoft {{announced}} that it had signed a licensing agreement with ABC Studios to develop a video game based on Grey's Anatomy. Designed for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC, Grey's Anatomy: The Video Game was released on March 10, 2009. The game lets the player {{assume the role of}} one of the main characters, making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> the character's personal and professional life, and competing in a number of minigames. It has been criticized by reviewers because of the simplicity of the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6.0/10 overall rating. The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper writers {{initially}} performed {{this function}} {{in the early days}} of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> their players in games played at home stadiums, and a home team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related to perceived bias or errors in scoring have led to questions about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many major newspapers decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.|$|E

5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E
5|$|The Bank of the United States was {{established}} by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale, and sought to open a branch in Boston. Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts, and Gore {{decided to make the}} move. He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank, and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank. He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank, a relatively large investment. Gore was influential in making hiring <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> the branch, and sought to merge state-chartered banks into the organization, arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service. Gore resigned from the board in 1794, citing the demands of his law practice.|$|E

5|$|The World was {{developed}} by a German programmer named Harald Hoerwick; its backstory {{is based on the}} Epitaph of Twilight, an epic poem by Emma Wielant. Her death inspired Hoerwick to create the game. Elements of the poem are coded into the game's programming. The hidden purpose of Hoerwick's game is to develop the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable of making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> itself. To this end, Hoerwick inserted functions into the system which monitor and extract behavioral data from millions of the game's players to aid in the AI's learning process. After Hoerwick's death, these pieces of code became black boxes to the current developers, who cannot fathom their purpose, yet are critical to the proper functioning of the game.|$|E
