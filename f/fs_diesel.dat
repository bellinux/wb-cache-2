Originally, it used <b>FS</b> <b>diesel</b> multiple-unit (DMU) {{trainsets}} of [...] In 1969, these were replaced by German (DB) diesel multiple units, of class VT 11.5. In 1972, the train returned to using Italian FS cars, but now electric locomotive-hauled instead of multiple-unit trainsets, with different locomotives over different portions of the route. In summer 1977, the train was once again using DB coaches, remaining locomotive-hauled, but in autumn 1979 it returned to using FS coaches. When the TEE Mediolanum was using Italian cars, its restaurant car was operated by Wagons-Lits, {{and when it was}} using German cars, the restaurant was operated by the German Sleeper and Dining Car Company (DSG).|$|E

40|$|Premixed {{combustion}} concepts like PCCI and RCCI {{have attracted}} much attention, since these concepts offer possibilities to reduce engine out emissions {{to a low}} level, while still achieving good efficiency. Most RCCI studies {{use a combination of}} a high-cetane fuel like diesel, and gasoline as low-cetane fuel. Limited results have been published using natural gas as low-cetane fuel; especially full scale engine results. This study presents results from an experimental study of diesel-CNG RCCI operation on a 6 cylinder, 8 l heavy duty engine with cooled EGR. This standard Tier 4 <b>f</b> <b>diesel</b> engine was equipped with a gas injection system, which used single point injection and mixed the gaseous fuel with air upstream of the intake manifold. For this engine configuration, RCCI operating limits have been explored. In the 1200 - 1800 rpm range, RCCI operation with Euro-VI engine out NOx and soot emissions was achieved between 2 and 9 bar BMEP without EGR. Corresponding hydrocarbon levels were high, but exhaust temperature levels hold promise for a suitable reduction through catalytic aftertreatment. Thermal efficiency was comparable to or better than diesel operation. In the load ranges tested, gas Methane Number (MN) variations between 70 and 100 have only a small effect on RCCI performance...|$|R

50|$|British and European {{locomotives}} of {{this type}} tend to be {{much smaller than the}} common size in the United States. Current British shunters are 0-6-0 diesel-electrics, Class 08 and Class 09, of 350-400 horsepower. These were developed from similar locomotives supplied by the English Electric Company to the Big Four British railway companies in the 1930s and 1940s, e.g. those pioneered by the LMS. Similar locomotives were exported to the Netherlands (e.g. NS Class 600) and Australia (e.g. Victorian Railways <b>F</b> class (<b>diesel)).</b> The use of shunting locomotives saw a sharp decline in Britain {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, largely due to the contraction of the network, increased competition from road traffic and widespread adoption of train-load freight, with fixed rakes of wagons moving mainly bulk products between rapid-loading facilities, as opposed to thousands of sidings and goods depots feeding trains of assorted wagons into the marshalling yards.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{high pressure and temperature}} combustion chamber {{was designed to}} compare the ignition properties of different fuels, including conventional <b>F</b> 76 <b>diesel</b> and hydrotreated renewable diesel (HRD), derived from algae. Conditions were selected to capture the operating conditions within a large number of Navy systems, testing at a range of temperatures from 8001340 F and pressures as high as 20 atm. Three Navy-relevant injectors were procured for the testing as well as a commercial injector made by Sturman Industries. The Sturman diesel injector was characterized up to a fuel tip pressure of 9600 psi and produced Sauter Mean Diameters of approximately 90 microns, generally showing improved atomization for F- 76 when compared to HRD at similar conditions. The combustion chamber utilized dynamic air injection with increased turbulence and the ability to alter the amounts of combustion products including CO, CO 2 and H 2 O that typically exist in real engines from the previous combustion event. Qualification testing of the combustion chamber evaluated final pressures of up to 15 atmospheres and temperatures of 472 F, but revealed heat losses during the dynamic air injection events, resulting in temperatures below expected values and auto-ignition conditions for fuels under consideration. A fluidized bed heat exchanger will be implemented to supplement the existing design and reach the desired temperatures. Ensign, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis develops a computer simulation for modeling the logistical support of multiple naval battle {{groups in a}} peacetime or wartime setting. The simulation model, written in Microsoft Visual Basic Version 5. 0, allows the user to create any number of naval battle groups containing multiple combatants that are located by latitude and longitude. Each battle group operates {{with one or two}} assigned station supply ships, i. e., a fast combat support (AOE) ship, or a fleet oiler (AO) ship and ammunition (AE) ship, respectively. Additionally, the user can create any number of Forward Logistics Base (FLB) ports and Continental United States (CONUS) ports, each having any number and type of shuttle supply ships assigned to them. Every ship and port has four major supply categories: F 44 (aviation fuel), <b>F</b> 76 (<b>diesel</b> fuel marine), ammunitions, and stores. The combatant's supplies are consumed over the specified time frame based on a randomly selected F 76 rate, a fixed user inputted stores rate and, if desired, multiple user inputted F 44 and ammunition rates. The multiple user inputted F 44 and ammunition consumption rates capability enables the user to model a naval battle based on any previously developed Tactical Warfare (TACWAR) or similar scenario involving aircraft carrier and/or amphibious battle groups[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The properties, use and {{construction}} of quartz Piezo electric transducers are briefly described. The dynamic calibration of quartz pressure transducers have been investigated using a Balanced-Disc pressure pick-up as a standard. The temperature effect on the static and dynamic output of these transducers has also been examined. Various types of engine indicators and their limitations are discussed. Piezo-electric pressure transducers and strain gauges were used for constructing an inertia-free pressure-volume indicator to produce a P-V diagram on an oscilloscope screen from which the trace was recorded. This included a simple and accurate method for obtaining top-dead-centre on pressure-time records. Some aspects of diesel combustion were considered using P-T diagrams from a variable compression Lister <b>F.</b> R. I <b>diesel</b> engine running at different loads and compression ratios. The effect of the shape of transducer passage on the accuracy of P-T diagrams is observed. Volumetric efficiency was measured using a crystal pressure transducer.

Electrified railway system is a better solution for that. The prime objective of this electrification economic study is to determine Whether electrical operation of the Sri Lanka suburban railway is economically viable and more advantageous {{than that of the}} existing diesel operation system with further improvement. According to present railway passenger flow, geographical data of railway tracks and other railway statistics and population of Sri Lanka, the network of suburban railway stations Kalutara North- Colombo-;· Polgahawela, Colombo - Homagama and Ragama Negombo (Colombo International Airport) was selected as high passenger density area. In the selected suburban area, railway and road passenger flow was studied by us in g train formation, railway time table, tickets issued at railway stations (daily and season tickets) and survey details of major railway stations and bus stand s.
