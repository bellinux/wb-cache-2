5|$|Issued loans {{accounted}} <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> 21% of {{the finance}} of Confederate war expenditure. In fact, initially the South was more successful in selling debt than the North, partially because New Orleans was a major financial center, whose financiers bought up two-fifths of a 15 million dollar loan in early 1861.|$|E

The symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotelian {{model was}} {{accepted}} in the Western world <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its axis and if the sun were placed {{at the center of}} the Universe.|$|E
5|$|All five {{songs on}} the {{extended}} play (EP) were written and produced by Chana and Chan. The pair worked on Manos Arriba <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio in the garage of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. They initially created the material {{as a way to}} secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed her to have more creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided {{over the issue}} of Biblical Sabbath {{observance}} <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{accounted}} <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> 90 {{percent of}} the Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|Enron's auditor firm, Arthur Andersen, {{was accused}} of {{applying}} reckless standards in its audits because of {{a conflict of interest}} over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E

5000|$|A {{feature of}} 20th-century laying {{was the use}} of one- or two-man laying. The US was notable for using two-man laying, {{horizontal}} {{on one side of the}} gun, elevation on the other. Most other nations mostly used one-man laying. The laying drill, dealing with all three axes, typically adopted this sequence: [...] "roughly <b>for</b> line, <b>roughly</b> <b>for</b> elevation, cross-level, accurately for line, accurately for elevation".|$|R

Just inside of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> a half-mile southward along the western bank of the Hudson River before {{separating}} at a trumpet interchange south of Highland. One mile east of US9W, US44 and NY55 cross the Hudson on the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E

In 1991, it was estimated that each show of the tour grossed US$1 million, <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> $86 million over the course of the tour (or approximately $ today, adjusted for inflation).|$|E
5|$|In 1584 Báthory allowed Zamoyski {{to execute}} Samuel Zborowski, whose death {{sentence}} for treason and murder had been pending <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> a decade. This political conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family, framed as {{the clash between}} the monarch and the nobility, {{would be a major}} recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years. In external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed to the lack of support from the Sejm, which refused to pass requested tax raises.|$|E

40|$|Three {{hydrophilic}} model {{drugs with}} different characteristics and molecular weights, namely protamine sulphate, diclofenac sodium and N 6 -Cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), were nano-encapsulated in poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) using a novel “in-oil nanoprecipitation” method recently {{developed for the}} purpose. Although the same settings were used for all three model drugs, the drug loading efficiency was greatly dependent on their chemical–physical characteristics, being considerably higher <b>for</b> protamine (<b>roughly</b> 93 %), intermediate <b>for</b> diclofenac (<b>roughly</b> 50 %), and very low <b>for</b> CPA (<b>roughly</b> 7 %). The resulting particle size and drug release rates were also strictly model-drug dependent. In the attempt to improve {{the characteristics of the}} CPA-loaded nanoparticles, the respective effects of adding an excipient (lauric acid) and substituting PLGA with poly(d,l-lactide) polymer (PLA) were investigated by measuring in vitro drug release and drug degradation kinetics in human whole blood. The results indicate that the proposed method seems promising for the nanoencapsulation of hydrophilic drugs in hydrophobic polymers, and easily modifiable to suit molecules that are difficult to incorporate into a polymeric matrix...|$|R

Type-0 HD, together with , provoked a rise in sales for the PS4 while other console sales remained consistent, but it ultimately performed poorly, selling through only 59.59% of its shipment. It had sold over 128,000 units in Japan by August 2015, being the 26th best-selling video game during that period.|$|E
5|$|In June 1583 Zamoyski {{took his}} third wife, Gryzelda Bathory, a {{relative}} of king Bathory himself. In May 1584 Zamoyski's men captured Samuel Zborowski, a noble whose death sentence for treason and murder had been pending <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> a decade, shortly afterwards with Bathory's consent Zborowski was executed. This political conflict between Báthory, Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, framed as the clash between the monarch and the nobility, {{would be a major}} recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years, beginning with a major dispute at the Sejm of 1585.|$|E
5|$|Liubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' {{youngest}} son. In {{the early}} 1320s {{he married a}} daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received Galicia, while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> sixty years. He had three sons.|$|E

Grand Master Hompesch was pressured to capitulate, as the Maltese nobility and the Magistrate of the Castellania, together with influential and high ranking figures {{made it clear to}} the Fiscal of the Castellania that, unless he surrenders, those resisting the French would have to simultaneously face an internal revolution.

5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation <b>for</b> <b>roughly</b> 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved {{too small for the}} football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily built-up area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street of the same name remains.|$|E
