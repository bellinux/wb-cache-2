5|$|No Line on the <b>Horizon</b> <b>is</b> {{the twelfth}} studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was {{produced}} by Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, and Steve Lillywhite, and was released on 27February 2009. It was the band's first record since How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), marking the longest gap between studio albums of their career to that point. The band originally intended to release the songs as two EPs, but later combined the material into a single record. Photographer Anton Corbijn shot a companion film, Linear, which was released alongside the album and included with several special editions.|$|E
5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's <b>horizon,</b> <b>is</b> not a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of isolated horizons over event <b>horizons</b> <b>is</b> that while one needs the entire spacetime history to locate an event <b>horizon,</b> isolated <b>horizons</b> <b>are</b> defined using local spacetime structures only. The laws of black hole mechanics, initially proved for event <b>horizons,</b> <b>are</b> generalized to isolated horizons.|$|R
50|$|Dokuchaev was {{the first}} to label soil horizons with A, B and C designations.

25|$|In ontological hermeneutics, a <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> used to {{identify}} an individual's past experiences, personal beliefs and opinions, cultural background, intentionality, and overall life direction. In simpler terms, to refer to an individual's <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> to refer to an individual's future goals, as informed by their past experiences and personal belief system. Since goals, beliefs, and experiences are plural, there can be horizons within a larger horizon, similar to how there can be multiple thoughts within a core belief in CBT, or how there can be multiple experiences of high school within the overall experience of high school. However, there is never one masterful, overarching horizon that governs all the others.|$|E

25|$|The prime {{vertical}} (the great circle {{taking in the}} zenith and east point on the <b>horizon)</b> <b>is</b> divided into twelve, and these divisions are projected on to the ecliptic along great circles that take {{in the north and}} south points on the horizon.

25|$|A {{much more}} likely source of {{explanation}} is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern <b>horizon,</b> <b>is</b> quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in refractive index, as in an inversion layer.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of soil formation, the bare rock out crops is gradually colonized by pioneer species (lichens and mosses).

40|$|Present study evaluates diversity, {{abundance}} and biomass of soil macrofauna in organic and semi-organic horizons in Parrotia persica-Carpinus betulus forest in Shast kola area. Totally 70 sample points {{were randomly selected}} from organic and semi-organic <b>horizons</b> then sampling <b>was</b> done by a rectangle 100 cm 2 area. Soil macrofauna were separated from soil samples by hand sorting and using Berlese funnel then dried at 60 °C for 72 h and weighted in 0. 001 gr. With using taxonomic classification key, thirteen macrofauna orders were identified. Most of abundance of soil macrofauna in both soil <b>horizons</b> <b>were</b> allocated to Millipedes order. Changes in diversity, {{abundance and}} biomass of macrofauna in both soil <b>horizons</b> <b>were</b> calculated.

25|$|The {{chronology}} violating set is the set {{of points}} through which CTCs pass. The boundary of this set is the Cauchy horizon. The Cauchy <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> generated by closed null geodesics. Associated with each closed null geodesic is a redshift factor describing the rescaling of {{the rate of change}} of the affine parameter around a loop. Because of this redshift factor, the affine parameter terminates at a finite value after infinitely many revolutions because the geometric series converges.|$|E
25|$|A {{selected}} mining cut on {{the most}} economic <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> often undertaken. The B Reef is a highly channelized ore-body located 140m stratigraphically above the Basal Reef. Within the channels, grades are excellent, but this falls away to nothing, outside of the channels. The A Reef is also a highly channelized reef, located some 40m above the B Reef. It consists of multiple conglomerate bands of up to 4m thick and a selected mining cut is usually required to optimise the ore-body.|$|E

25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens {{the edges of the}} trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and {{factories}} in the background—the blue of the sky at the <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asnières subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hawking {{had shown}} earlier {{that the total}} horizon area of a {{collection}} of black holes always increases with time. The <b>horizon</b> <b>is</b> a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase, but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.|$|E
