25|$|The company {{spun off}} its Travelers Property and Casualty <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> {{business}} in 2002. The spin off {{was prompted by}} the insurance unit's drag on Citigroup stock price because Traveler's earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters, particularly the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in downtown New York City. It was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker.|$|E

25|$|Also {{prior to}} the passage of the Act, there were many relaxations to the Glass–Steagall Act. For example, a few years earlier, {{commercial}} Banks were allowed to pursue investment banking, and before that banks were also allowed to begin stock and insurance brokerage. <b>Insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> was the only main operation they weren't allowed to do, something rarely done by banks even after the passage of the Act. The Act further enacted three provisions that allow for bank holding companies to engage in physical commodity activities. Prior to the enactment of the Act those activities were limited to those that were so closely related to banking to be considered incidental to it. Under GLBA depending on the provision the institution falls into, bank holding companies can engage in physical commodity trading, energy tolling, energy management services, and merchant banking activities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remaining}} {{provisions of}} the Glass–Steagall Act—enacted following the Great Depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters, and meant Citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets. However, Weill stated {{at the time of}} the merger that they believed [...] "that over that time the legislation will change...we have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem". Indeed, the passing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999 vindicated Reed and Weill's views, opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking, investment banking, <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> and brokerage.|$|E

2500|$|Though Aguillard {{remained}} president-emeritus and {{a faculty}} member {{after he left the}} LC presidency, he was terminated from both positions in the spring of 2016 following an evaluation. In September 2016, Aguillard filed suit in the 9th Judicial District Court in Alexandria to seek damages for [...] "civil conspiracy" [...] involving breach of contract, assault and battery, and emotional distress. The defendants include Louisiana College, Aguillard's permanent presidential successor Rick Brewer, private investigator Don Benton Connor, Sr., and the <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> firm RSUI Indemnity Company.An out-of-court settlement was believed to have been pending in December 2016.|$|E
2500|$|An {{insurance}} underwriter's job is {{to evaluate}} a given risk as to {{the likelihood that a}} loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent. Thus, [...] "discrimination" [...] against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting.</b> For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment {{goes to the heart of}} the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.|$|E

50|$|The GLBA’s {{amendment}} to the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks to affiliate with <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> companies was a new power. Under a 1982 {{amendment to}} the Bank Holding Company Act bank affiliates had been prohibited from underwriting most forms of insurance. Because the GLBA permitted banks to affiliate with insurance underwriters, Citigroup was able to retain ownership of the Travelers <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> business. Overall, however, commentators viewed the GLBA “as ratifying and extending changes {{that had already been}} made, rather than as revolutionary.” At least one commentator found the entire GLBA “unnecessary” for banks and suggested the OCC had the authority to grant national banks all the <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> powers permitted to affiliates through the GLBA.|$|E
