2500|$|Current {{military}} explorations into swarming {{address the}} spectrum of military operations, from strategic through tactical. An expert group evaluated swarming's role in the [...] "revolution in military affairs" [...] or <b>force</b> <b>transformation.</b> They observed that military swarming is primarily tactical, sometimes operational and rarely strategic, and is a complement to other efforts rather than a replacement for them. Swarming is a logical extension of network-centric warfare, but the networks needed to make swarming routine will be available around 2010-2011. At present, the networking for swarming is only available in specific contexts.|$|E

The efficiency of the risk management process for the Force Development Programs depends on different factors, but the most significant role belongs to the structure of the process and the methods used in the risk management model.
