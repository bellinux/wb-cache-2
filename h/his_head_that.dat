5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he {{had fallen in love with}} Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E

However, Jones's son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him. An autopsy of Jones's body also showed levels of the barbiturate Pentobarbital, {{which may have been}} lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Learning to sing is an {{activity}} that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds {{he or she is}} producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.|$|E
25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E

500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>That</b> same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, [...] "I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} episode, [...] "The Long Game", the Doctor, Rose, and Adam arrive on {{a space station}} in the year 200,000, and Adam is overwhelmed by culture shock. Tempted by the wealth of information and technology available to him, he has an advanced computer interface port, activated by a click of the fingers, installed in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> allows him to access the future's computer system. He attempts to transmit information back to 21st century Earth using Rose's modified mobile phone, but this backfires when the villains running the station attempt to extract information on the Doctor directly from Adam's brain. As punishment of Adam's breach of trust, the Doctor returns him home, despite his pleading, and destroys his answering machine. When Adam's mother (Judy Holt) returns home, she reacts with shock and horror after inadvertently activating the implant installed in his forehead.|$|E
500|$|Speed {{enters the}} Grand Prix against great odds: Royalton has placed a bounty on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> the other drivers {{are eager to}} collect, and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack [...] "Cannonball" [...] Taylor. Speed overcomes a slow start {{to catch up with}} Taylor, who uses a {{cheating}} device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches it is revealed in a flashback montage that he really is Rex, who has faked his death and undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance as part of his plan to save his family and the sport of racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, and Royalton is sent to jail.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 16 of {{the book}} Skáldskaparmál, a kenning given for Loki is [...] "relative of Sleipnir." [...] In chapter 17, a story is {{provided}} in which Odin rides Sleipnir into the land of Jötunheimr and arrives at the residence of the jötunn Hrungnir. Hrungnir asks [...] "what sort of person this was" [...] wearing a golden helmet, [...] "riding sky and sea," [...] and says that the stranger [...] "has a marvellously good horse." [...] Odin wagers <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> no horse as good {{could be found in}} all of Jötunheimr. Hrungnir admitted that it was a fine horse, yet states that he owns a much longer-paced horse; Gullfaxi. Incensed, Hrungnir leaps atop Gullfaxi, intending to attack Odin for Odin's boasting. Odin gallops hard ahead of Hrungnir, and, in his, fury, Hrungnir finds himself having rushed into the gates of Asgard. In chapter 58, Sleipnir is mentioned among a list of horses in Þorgrímsþula: [...] "Hrafn and Sleipnir, splendid horses [...] ". In addition, Sleipnir occurs twice in kennings for [...] "ship" [...] (once appearing in chapter 25 in a work by the skald Refr, and [...] "sea-Sleipnir" [...] appearing in chapter 49 in Húsdrápa, a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason).|$|E

500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, and all it did was get me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting. [...] "Kill You" [...] is about Davis' ex-stepmother. Davis explained: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Davros {{was designed by}} Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a [...] "spokesperson" [...] for the Daleks as {{he felt it was}} [...] "boring" [...] listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with no body but a [...] "green, dome-like head" [...] which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. [...] The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the [...] "disorienting" [...] situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes {{in the top of the}} bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E

2500|$|From {{its origins}} as totems or the stylized {{depiction}} of natural creatures, the Chinese dragon evolved {{to become a}} mythical animal. The Han dynasty scholar Wang Fu recorded Chinese myths that long dragons had nine anatomical resemblances.The people paint the dragon's shape with a horse's head and a snake's tail. Further, there are expressions as 'three joints' and 'nine resemblances' (of the dragon), to wit: from head to shoulder, from shoulder to breast, from breast to tail. These are the joints; as to the nine resemblances, they are the following: his antlers resemble those of a stag, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> of a camel, his eyes those of a demon, his neck that of a snake, his belly that of a clam (shen, 蜃), his scales those of a carp, his claws those of an eagle, his soles those of a tiger, his ears those of a cow. Upon his head he has a thing like a broad eminence (a big lump), called [...] (尺木). If a dragon has no , he cannot ascend to the sky.|$|E
2500|$|Players did {{not wear}} {{protective}} helmets in the 1950s {{and he had}} to be helped off the field with a large bump on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> was visible from the stands. He was taken to hospital for x-rays, but returned to loud applause only to be bowled by Lindwall for 9. The Australians needed 223 to win, but were afraid that Tyson would send down a barrage of fast, short-pitched bowling, but he was intelligent enough to bowl full length deliveries that caught them unprepared. While Brian Statham bowled [...] "up the cellar steps" [...] and into the wind Tyson tore down the slope from the Randwick End with [...] "half a gale" [...] behind him and bowled [...] "as fast as man has ever bowled". [...] He took 6/85 in the innings and 10/130 in the match to give England a 38 run victory. The Australian captain Arthur Morris told the newspapers [...] "Such fine bowling deserved to win". Peter Loader told Tyson [...] "you bowled like a 'Dingbat'" [...] and the nickname 'Dingers' stuck".|$|E

[...] The downside is that everyone staying in the place gets their every wish, so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem), takes Beverly and Howard {{to be on the}} Iprah Show with the topic [...] "Why Women Give It to Men Who Don't Get It", guest starring Dr. Phlip. [...] Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse. [...] Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. [...] Deuteronomy is a creature half id and half superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. [...] Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). [...] Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. [...] Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be [...] "God". A few years later he was reunited with his parents and brother at a baseball game in Dakvorlde.|$|E
