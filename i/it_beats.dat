5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. <b>It</b> <b>beats</b> its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E
25|$|Limacina helicina {{possesses}} {{a pair of}} flexible, wing-like appendages called parapodia which <b>it</b> <b>beats</b> in a complex 3D stroke pattern which resembles the wing kinematics of flying insects. By doing so, the animal effectively flies through the water. The sea butterfly uses a high angle of attack of approximately 45-50 degrees to generate lift, and <b>it</b> <b>beats</b> its wings 4 to 10 times per second. It propels itself using {{a version of the}} clap and fling mechanism described by Torkel Weis-Fogh in small insects such as thrips. Another aspect of locomotion by Limacina helicina is the extreme, forward-back pitching (called hyper-pitching) which it experiences during each half-stroke of its wings. The animal rocks forward and backward by up to 60 degrees during each half-stroke. No other species is known to experience such extreme hyper-pitching during normal locomotion.|$|E
25|$|When {{feeding on}} flowers, this {{butterfly}} is unhurried, often spending {{a long time}} sitting on the same flower. When sitting it either spreads its wings or closes them over its back the hindwings covering the forewings to a large extent. Sometimes the butterfly will not sit, but rest gently on the flower while feeding, while doing this, to maintain balance, <b>it</b> <b>beats</b> only its forewings while keeping the hindwings completely steady.|$|E
