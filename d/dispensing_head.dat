40|$|Abstract. The {{continuous}} quantitative dispensing system {{gets the}} trajectory coordinates by CCD image recognition, then the <b>dispensing</b> <b>head</b> is automatically positioned by motion control platform. Pressure controller is selected to automatically control {{the pressure of}} compressed air {{in order to ensure}} gas pressure is steady. Peristaltic pump is used to guarantee the precision of the automatic program-controlled colloid transmitting. Colloid volume, <b>dispensing</b> <b>head</b> position and dispensing accuracy can be effectively guaranteed. The experimental results show that the whole system fully meets the double fluid dispensing design requirements, and program interface is friendly and easy to operate. It can apply for product promotion and widely application...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} denoted a swab device {{has been}} developed as a convenient means of acquiring samples of contaminants from surfaces and suspending the samples in liquids. (Thereafter, the liquids can be dispensed, in controlled volumes, into scientific instruments for analysis of the contaminants.) The swab device is designed {{so as not to}} introduce additional contamination and to facilitate, simplify, and systematize the dispensing of controlled volumes of liquid into analytical instruments. The swab device is a single apparatus into which are combined all the equipment and materials needed for sampling surface contamination. The swab device contains disposable components stacked together on a nondisposable <b>dispensing</b> <b>head.</b> One of the disposable components is a supply cartridge holding a sufficient volume of liquid for one complete set of samples. (The liquid could be clean water or another suitable solvent, depending on the application.) This supply of liquid is sealed by Luer valves. At the beginning of a sampling process, the user tears open a sealed bag containing the supply cartridge. A tip on the nondisposable <b>dispensing</b> <b>head</b> is engaged with a Luer valve {{on one end of the}} supply cartridge and rotated, locking the supply cartridge on the <b>dispensing</b> <b>head</b> and opening the valve. The swab tip includes a fabric swab that is wiped across the surface of interest to acquire a sample. A sealed bag containing a disposable dispensing tip is then opened, and the swab tip is pushed into the dispensing tip until seated. The <b>dispensing</b> <b>head</b> contains a piston that passes through a spring-loaded lip seal. The air volume displaced by this piston forces the liquid out of the supply cartridge, over the swab, and into the dispensing tip. The piston is manually cycled to enforce oscillation of the air volume and thereby to cause water to flow to wash contaminants from the swab and cause the resulting liquid suspension of contaminants to flow into the dispensing tip. After several cycles to ensure adequate mixing, liquid containing the suspended contaminant sample is dispensed. The disposable components are then removed from the <b>dispensing</b> <b>head,</b> which may then be reused with a fresh set of disposable components...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} {{research has}} focused on the feasibility of manufacturing adequate scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue engineering through the technique of 3 D plotting micro-extruded filaments of biodegradable thermoplastics. Two aspects were addressed, the foremost of which encompasses the production and evaluation of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for the replacement of arteries and heart valve cusps. Scaffolds with different geometries were created and their relevant mechanical properties were compared to those of the equivalent natural tissue. To improve their cell-interactive properties, a method was developed for coating the PCL parts with collagen. In a second aspect, the expansion of this production technique to the micro-extrusion for 3 D plotting of thermally sensitive polymers like poly-(lactic acid) (PLA) was considered. A finite element model of the conventional <b>dispense</b> <b>head</b> for thermoplastics revealed that its thermoregulation was unsuitable for the processing of PLA-based polymers, which were found to degrade significantly during their residence time inside the <b>dispense</b> <b>head.</b> Hence, a new <b>dispense</b> <b>head</b> named COMET (COntinuous Modular Extrusion of Thermoplastics) was developed to reduce thermal loading of the polymer during processing. COMET was found to be a functional device with a much improved thermoregulation, which will allow for the reliable extrusion of thermally sensitive polymers...|$|R

40|$|Dispensing liquid materials, {{specifically}} adhesives, onto substrates {{and printed}} circuit boards (PCB’s) with repeatable dot-to-dot quality and minimal assist time is a complex process. The key is to choose the <b>dispensing</b> <b>heads</b> that lends itself most closely {{to the requirements of}} a specific production process. Understanding how the <b>dispensing</b> <b>heads</b> work and what jetting technology’s strongest and weakest attributes are is essential. This paper will outline the benefits and limitations of jetting materials. Specific attention is paid to underboard support and contact impact issues. This paper also outlines the parameters and the control required in production applications of jet technology. After reviewing the parameters and profile of this method of dispensing, the areas where this technology lends itself to production are explored. Specifically, yield, throughput and setup time advantages from using this leading edge technology is explained. Also covered are the limitations and future development map for jetting. Adhesive Dispensing in the Surface Mount Assembly Process Although Surface Mount Technology (SMT) has become a mature process and has been implemented worldwide, the demands for smaller, faster, more complex and lower cost assemblies keep the industry {{in a constant state of}} evolution.

40|$|We {{present a}} miniaturized, disposable, normally-closed {{electromagnetic}} dispensing valve for the microliter range to process 96 -well plates. The novel injection-molded valve {{is designed to}} fit into a 9 mm grid to realize an eight channel <b>dispensing</b> <b>head,</b> enabling the serial processing of well plates row-by-row. The presented dispensing valve design originates from a miniaturization study of a previously developed functional model. The outer diameter of the valve, including all actuating components, was reduced by 8 mm to an overall diameter of 8. 5 mm without compromising the performance. Additionally, the actuation current of the valve could be reduced to 5 A. The valve is characterized for a volume range between 840 nL and 5. 3 μL. The performance of the injection molded valve is competitive to commercially available dispensing valves, featuring the advantages of low fabrication costs, disposability, low mounting size, easy handling, and super silent actuation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new developed, inline applicable dispensing platform that {{is equipped with}} an advanced version of previously introduced parallel <b>dispensing</b> print <b>heads.</b> At process speeds of up to 700 mm·s- 1 and a substantially improved process stability, recent cell results on industrial 90 ohm/sq. emitters showed an efficiency increase of up to + 0. 4 %abs. in comparison to standard single screen printing technology.

40|$|Over {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} trend towards smaller and more sensitive components and products in the fields of information, communications, medical and precision technology. Subsequent to increasing component miniaturization and integration densities, especially the rapid developments in the cross-sectional field of micro electronics have led more and more to demands for conductive dots with diameters of < 200 #mu#m punctiform micro-dispensing volumes in the picoliter range. Due to the results obtained from the peristaltic micro pump project, decisive advances could be made in the production of micro dispensing geometries in dot form using electrically-conductive adhesives implemented in a new micro dispensing technique. The new peristaltic dispensing process treats the media gently and enables isotropic conductive dots with tiny diameters of 130 #mu#m to be reproduced by implementing for the first time an unpressurized adhesive cartouche. The micro dispensing system utilized possesses a <b>dispensing</b> <b>head</b> (disposable/re-usable types available) with an adapted 3 -chamber geometry and a buna N membrane, integrated micro magnetic valves, pneumatic connections and a quick-action lock. The micro dispensing system developed forms a sound basis for the flexible manufacture of microelectronic products in the future with three-dimensional substrates, multi-stage fitting processes, various bonding materials and a wide range of micro dispensing geometries and sequences. The developments achieved during the project support the industrial implementation of micro products and therefore represent and important contribution towards advancing micro system technology in Germany.

In particular, I will look at word order variation in Old High German and show that the factors that determine this variation are either prosodic or information-structural in nature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} a new developed, inline applicable dispensing platform that {{is equipped with}} an advanced version of previously introduced parallel <b>dispensing</b> print <b>heads</b> and works as drop-in-replacement in existing manufacturing lines. At process speeds of up to 700 mm•s- 1 and a substantially improved process stability, {{the impact of the}} resulting contact geometries on optical and ohmic losses was analysed in detail. A reduced finger width as well as an effective width of just 48 % after encapsulation of the finger width leads to nearly 50 % reduction of shading losses compared to screen printed samples. A substantially improved finger homogeneity leads to similar grid resistances at 20 % less silver consumption. Consequently, recent cell results on industrial emitters (Rsh = 90 Ω/sq.) showed an efficiency increase of up to + 0. 4 %abs. in comparison to standard single screen printing reaching top values of η = 20. 5 % on PERC structures. A key improvement of the technology is the new ability to process certain metal pastes originally designed for screen printing applications and thus keep in track with fast emerging paste development. Successfully evaluated screen printing pastes then can be rheologically adapted in order to reach ultrafine contact fingers at high aspect ratios and extract the whole advantage of this non-contacting printing technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, a new <b>dispensing</b> print <b>head</b> is {{introduced}} covering an operational width of 16 cm and therefore allowing for solar cell processing at industrial throughput rates. Like in previous ten nozzle versions, the interior paste flow {{was designed by}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using rheological parameters of applied Ag-pastes (commercially available pastes), including yield stress, shear thinning and wall slip behaviour. The novel print head features a homogeneous distribution of Ag-paste from an inlet supply with a diameter of Din = 2 mm to an outlet slot with a width of ws = 160 mm. A first printing test followed by geometrical characterization of the dispensed contacts revealed a distribution of the contact finger width of wf = 35 ± 1 μm across the whole wafer (156 x 156 mm 2) which demonstrates highest precision of the approach. The print head is directly integrated in an inline feasible dispensing platform, developed by ASYS GmbH. Respective nozzle plates can be customized to any desired front side grid regarding nozzle diameter, nozzle pitch and {{the total number of}} nozzles. In the actual version, the print head uses two strokes to print 100 contact fingers. Each of the 50 nozzles prints two adjacent contact fingers while moving up and down at a speed of up to vy = 700 mm/s. In a first solar cell test sequence with the new 6 ” print head, a maximum cell efficiency of η = 21. 2 % on industrially preprocessed Cz-PERC samples was reached which demonstrates a successful launching of the print head...|$|R
25|$|McKesson's Robot RX {{is another}} {{healthcare}} robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily {{with little or}} no errors. The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or <b>dispensed</b> location. The <b>head</b> moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who knows? Perhaps he {{will have}} <b>dispensed</b> with his <b>head</b> also by that time,' said a {{corporal}} in front, and they all laughed together in a manner which in England would have meant a court-martial. This {{seemed to me to}} be one of the survivals of the Revolution, that officer and private were left, upon a very familiar footing, which was increased, no doubt, by the freedom with which the Emperor would chat with his old soldiers, and the liberties which he would allow them to take with him. It was no uncommon thing for a shower of chaff to come from the ranks directed at their own commanding officers, and I am sorry to say, also, that it was no very unusual thing for a shower of bullets to come also. Unpopular officers were continually assassinated by their own men; at the battle of Montebello it is well known that every officer, with the exception of one lieutenant belonging to the 24th demi-brigade, was shot down from behind. But this was a relic of the bad times, and, as the Emperor gained more complete control, a better feeling was established. The history of our army at that time proved, at any rate, that the highest efficiency could be maintained without the flogging which was still used in the Prussian and the English service, and it was shown, for the first time, that great bodies of men could be induced to act from a sense of duty and a love of country, without hope of reward or fear of punishment. When a French general could suffer his division to straggle as they would over the face of the country, with the certainty that they would concentrate upon the day of battle, he proved that he had soldiers who were worthy of his trust.|$|R
