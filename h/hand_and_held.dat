25|$|In 1990, {{he set the}} PBA {{all-time record}} for the most three-point field goals made in a single season (160 triples) and led Presto Tivoli to a {{championship}} title. He was named the 1990 PBA Most Valuable Player and was selected {{to play for the}} first all-pro national team coached by Robert Jaworski, bound for the Asian Games. In one of his Asian Games appearances, he led the national team's second half comeback win, 86-78, against Japan with 34 points despite playing with a broken <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> scoreless in the first half. The Philippines {{went on to win the}} silver medal after losing to China in the finals with Caidic and Samboy Lim named in the mythical 5 selection.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{dispensed}} with the experiment of having Hutton bat down {{the order and}} the old Roses opening partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook went to the crease. Hutton was full of confidence, 19 runs came off the first three overs and Keith Miller asked for a new ball in the fourth. Umpire Elphinstone examined the ball and changed it for a new one, which he ground into the dust to take the shine off. Hutton insisted on a look and bounced on the grass a few times {{so that it would}} lose its shape. It made no difference as another 8 runs came of the next two overs and Miller was taken off, only to take a diving catch off Ian Johnson (3/94) to dismiss Washbrook. Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; [...] "He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot. I ran across before he played it, flung out my <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> the ball. I was just as astonished as Cyril". Hutton (62) and Simpson (49) took the score to 128/1 when Miller was brought back on to bowl one of his most famous overs. He bowled a [...] "super ball" [...] to dismiss Hutton lbw and bowled Denis Compton for a duck when the ball clipped the edge of the bat and ricocheted into the stumps. Gilbert Parkhouse survived until tea, but Reg Simpson guided another ball from Miller to Sam Loxton at short-fine-leg and England were 137/4. The popular Freddie Brown strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit Bill Johnston to the fence, lofted Lindwall into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto Umpire Barlow's foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the Welshman pulled Ian Johnson to Arthur Morris at mid-on at 187/5. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who held up one end while Brown scattered the in-field and clouted the Australian bowling round the ground. When he was finally out the next day, playing over a yorker from Ray Lindwall for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for England so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. England was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall bouncer at 263/6 and was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Godfrey Evans struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but Alec Bedser was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and John Warr by Miller (4/37). Bailey returned at 281/8 and tried to bat one-handed before he was caught by Don Tallon of Ian Johnson. Doug Wright joined Evans, but was run out for a duck by his Kent team-mate, tripping over his bat and pulling a muscle as he rushed home and England were all out for 290.|$|E
60|$|Reluctantly, {{the referee}} caught his gloved <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it aloft.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tetterby, in a {{whirlwind}} of laughing and crying, caught his face within her <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it there.|$|R
60|$|He {{clasped her}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> on to them, until {{he felt her}} rather nervously trying to {{withdraw}} them.|$|R
60|$|Seemingly he made {{an attempt}} to turn incontinently on his heel, for the woman put out her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> on to his cloak.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it. She had never looked more beautiful.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked a}} little wistfully at him as she took his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it.|$|E
60|$|I {{took her}} <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> {{it a few}} moments without a word. Then she gently withdrew it.|$|E
60|$|When, {{the first}} shock, {{and then the}} pause were over, he lifted the {{portrait}} in his two <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it averted from him.|$|R
6000|$|St. Leonard grasped {{his head}} between his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it firmly. [...] "If I consent," [...] he said, [...] "I must insist on being honest" ...|$|R
60|$|Oh! it was horrible! What could I say? How was I to stop him? How much dare I tell? I caught {{hold of his}} <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them tightly.|$|R
60|$|He {{poured out}} {{a glass of}} wine with a firm <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it to her lips. She drank it obediently.|$|E
60|$|Bob got to it {{with one}} <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it. His impetus carried him on almost to where Burgess was standing.|$|E
60|$|The Caliph {{gave him}} a piece of money, and was passing on, but the blind man seized his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> him fast.|$|E
60|$|Deronda's anguish was intolerable. He {{could not}} help himself. He seized her outstretched <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them together, <b>and</b> kneeled at her feet. She {{was the victim of}} his happiness.|$|R
60|$|She took {{both his}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> {{them for a}} moment. Then {{she walked to the}} door, made sure that it was {{securely}} fastened, and stood there listening for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|Silently the Professor drew front {{his pocket}} a square gold watch, with {{six or eight}} <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it out for my inspection. [...] "This," [...] he began, [...] "is an Outlandish Watch--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then--then take that!" [...] But {{the blow}} never touched Trent. He thrust out his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> his assailant away at arm's length.|$|E
60|$|Istra {{shut the}} door resolutely. The hall was dark. It was gratefully quiet. She {{snatched}} up Mr. Wrenn's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it to her breast.|$|E
60|$|Lane {{caught her}} <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it, {{following}} {{her to the}} end of the hall, where she opened a door and peeped into the sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|She {{broke off}} in a sudden fit of sobbing. He took her face gently in his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it up to him. It was he, now, who was to play the part of consoler.|$|R
60|$|A {{man took}} the hair in his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it fast. Then Swart hewed with his axe, but the Dane twitched {{his head back}} so strongly, that he who was holding his hair fell forward; the axe cut off both his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> stuck fast in the earth.|$|R
60|$|Cole {{took the}} box in his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it. For a time his tired mind failed to focus. What did he have? He {{concentrated}} on it. The box was the children's toy. The inter-system vidsender, they had called it.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he lifted}} his {{withered}} <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it towards Benita, saying: [...] "I tell you that yonder she sits for whom the generations have waited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} Balzac's 'Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme'," [...] he said, as he fanned her with one <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> her coffee cup in the other.|$|E
60|$|The Indian clasped Shefford's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it in a {{response}} {{that was more}} beautiful for its silence. So they {{stood for a moment}} in the starlight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh God!" [...] cried Lawson furiously. [...] "I {{knew it was}} that. He wants morality." [...] He {{joined his}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them towards heaven in supplication. [...] "Oh, Christopher Columbus, Christopher Columbus, {{what did you do}} when you {{discovered}} America?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I arrived--to where I am now--pretty dizzy," [...] he responded, with a {{smile that}} was both radiant and sorrowful. He took her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them close. [...] "Lenore!... if I come home from the war--still with my arms and legs--whole--will you marry me?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them tightly, but he {{answered}} {{only in a}} whisper. He wore a sombre black cloak and a broad-brimmed black hat. A muffler concealed {{the lower part of}} his face. She put her finger upon the electric light, but he stopped her.|$|R
60|$|Saton {{took her}} <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it between his. It {{was dry and}} withered, but the nails were exquisitely manicured, and the fingers were aflame with jewels.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took it in}} his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it up, {{but made}} no {{immediate}} overture to return it. [...] "And Mr. Harding has seen this?" [...] said he.|$|E
60|$|I {{took her}} <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> it. The thought flashed {{into my mind}} that when I {{released}} that hand the last tie between Sylvia and myself would be broken.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} into {{his face with a}} smile which had turned the heads of {{hardened}} stagers in New York. No wonder that Tavernake felt his heart beat against his ribs! He took her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them for a moment. Then he turned abruptly away.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught her}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>held</b> them tightly, drawing {{her a little}} closer to him, forgetting that she was Tom St. Clair's wife, remembering only that she was the woman to whom he had given all his love and life's devotion, to the entire beggaring of his heart.|$|R
60|$|Smiling, she {{stretched}} out her <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>held</b> {{it for a}} moment.|$|R
