But I suppose the heavens to mean that part of creation which holds equal companionship with our globe; I understand the [...] "rolling of these heavens together as a scroll," [...] to be an equal and relative destruction with the melting of the elements in fervent heat; and I understand {{the making of the}} firmament to signify that, so far as man is concerned, most magnificent ordinance of the clouds;--the ordinance that, as the great plain of waters was formed {{on the face of the}} earth, so also a plain of waters should be stretched along the height of air, and the face of the cloud answer the face of the ocean; and that this upper and heavenly plain should be of waters, as it were, glorified in their nature, no longer quenching the fire, but now bearing fire in their own bosoms; no longer murmuring only when the winds raise them or rocks divide, but answering each other with their own voices, from pole to pole; no longer restrained by established shores, and guided through unchanging channels, but going forth at their pleasure like the armies of the angels, and choosing their encampments upon the heights of the hills; no longer hurried downwards for ever, moving but to fall, nor lost in the lightless accumulation of the abyss, but covering the east and west with the waving of their wings, and robing the gloom of the farther infinite with a vesture of diverse colours, of which the threads are purple and scarlet, and the embroideries flame.|$|E

60|$|And now let {{it not be}} {{overlooked}} that in the observing at what time during the next year this extreme limit of the shadow was again reached, and in the inference that the sun had then arrived at the same turning point in his annual course, {{we have one of}} the simplest instances of that combined use of equal magnitudes and <b>equal</b> <b>relations,</b> by which all exact science, all quantitative prevision, is reached. For the relation observed was between the length of the sun's shadow and his position in the heavens; and the inference drawn was that when, next year, the extremity of his shadow came to the same point, he occupied the same place. That is, the ideas involved were, the equality of the shadows, and the equality of the relations between shadow and sun in successive years. As in the case of the scales, the equality of relations here recognised is of the simplest order. It is not as those habitually dealt with in the higher kinds of scientific reasoning, which answer to the general type--the relation between two and three <b>equals</b> the <b>relation</b> between six and nine; but it follows the type--the relation between two and three, <b>equals</b> the <b>relation</b> between two and three; it is a case of not simply <b>equal</b> <b>relations,</b> but coinciding relations. And here, indeed, we may see beautifully illustrated how the idea of <b>equal</b> <b>relations</b> takes its rise after the same manner that that of equal magnitude does. As already shown, the idea of equal magnitudes arose from the observed coincidence of two lengths placed together; and in this case we have not only two coincident lengths of shadows, but two coincident relations between sun and shadows.|$|R

The analysis further suggests that if one of the good has zero income elasticity, it will always be a substitute to the other good which will always be an elastic good.

In order to achieve {{the goals of the}} study, two examinations are used. The First one is the examination of the thinking and learning method that is based on both hemispheres of the brain. The second one is the examination of the multiple intelligences. Some referees are consulted for assuring the suitability of the examinations for the measured sample and the calculation of the exam. The sample consists of 300 students who study the course of psychology. The sample is chosen randomly. The results indicates that more repeated method of learning and thinking is based on the left hemisphere of the brain; as it comes out with the highest total of 136 and within a percentage of (45. 3 %). In addition, the results that are related to the dominance of the multiple intelligences indicate that personal intelligence, and physical intelligence are the highest respectively; a mean value of (49. 80 %). Whereas, intrapersonal intelligence comes third with a mean value of (48, 40 %). Finally, musical intelligence scores the lowest mean value. Regarding connection relation; it is as a statistical function on the level of the (?= 0. 05) between the natural intelligence and the left hemisphere of the brain on one hand; and the intrapersonal and the integrated intelligence on the other on the other hand.

However, there is little {{understanding of how to}} create and maintain successful school-community collaboration. The purpose of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive framework for transformative school-community collaboration based on a critical paradigm and its corresponding theories. Using school survey data, an exploratory factor analysis identified the four dimensions of transformative school community collaboration, including (1) critical member capacity, (2) <b>equal</b> <b>relations,</b> (3) democratic network governance, and (4) empowering coordination. The results of multiple regression analyses showed that the identified dimensions were positively associated with the quality outcomes of Out-of-School Time programs although their significant effects varied across different quality outcomes: high-quality activities, student engagement, and linkages with family/community. Another key finding was that structural dimensions—democratic network governance and empowering coordination—appeared to be stronger factors. However, this research suggested that critical member capacity and <b>equal</b> <b>relations</b> may be associated indirectly with the quality outcomes.

Additionally to determine the adequate extend of surgery for benign parotid gland tumors, enucleation and superficial parotidectomy were compared in terms of permanent facial nerve dysfunction, paresthesia, Frey-syndrome and recurrence. Methods Including criteria: patient of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, initial manifestation of a benign parotid gland tumor, observation period: 1996 - 2005. Results We found 225 (48 %) zystadenolymphoma and 213 (45 %) pleomorphic adenomas. The relation was equal in each year. 97 % of the patients with zystadenolymphoma and 59 % of the patients with pleomorphic adenoma smoked. Only paresthesia (p= 0, 004) and Frey-syndrome occurred significantly more often after superficial parotidectomy than after enucleation.

40|$|The {{destruction}} of nature {{is caused by}} the wrong humanâ€™s point of view towards neighbourhoods. Ecofeminism assumes the caused factor of nature destruction comes from patriarchy culture which more on dualistic logic, hierarchy and the fight for domination. The thought of patriarchy causes {{destruction of}} nature and oppression of woman. Ecofeminism thought is interesting to be researched because it offers alternative vision which more sociable and gender balanced. The aim of this research is to explicit, critically evaluate, formulate concept of ecofemisthics ethics thought comprehensively and to reveal new vision relating to keep forest preservation. The chosen literature is analyzed using philosophy method: description, interpretation, and holistic. The result of this research shows that nature preservation is lasting and oppression towards woman is stopped if society abandoned patriarchy thought. Ecofeminism develops the concept of care ethics holistically, interactively, non-reduction, and participatively. Principe of ethics which need to be concerned are responsibility towards the whole biosphere, cosmic solidarity, keeping balance with nature, <b>equal</b> <b>relation,</b> careens and simplicity. The excess of ecofeminism succed in realizing the danger of patriarchy thought towards woman and nature. The weakness of it is that it generalizes and universalizes feministhics values uniformity towards all women instead of a priory negative towards the quality of masculinity values. Ecofeminism develops human moral responsibility based on women special experiences...|$|E
