5|$|Traditional meals have ancient origins, such as {{bread and}} cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled {{vegetables}} and broths, and freshwater and saltwater fish.

5|$|English cookery has {{developed}} over many centuries {{since at least}} the time of The <b>Forme</b> of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E

Calvin recognised {{the power of}} music and he intended that it be used to support scripture readings. The original Strasbourg psalter contained twelve psalms by Clément Marot and Calvin added several more hymns of his own composition in the Geneva version. At the end of 1542, Marot became a refugee in Geneva and contributed nineteen more psalms. Louis Bourgeois, also a refugee, lived and taught music in Geneva for sixteen years and Calvin {{took the opportunity to}} add his hymns, the most famous being the Old Hundredth.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} fraught relationship between England and French-speaking Continental Europe {{in the late}} fourteenth century by uncovering a contemporary cross-regional discourse that theorized this relationship. The dissertation examines the so-called <b>formes</b> fixes, an important lyric genre widely used across Francophone Europe in the late Middle Ages. It argues for this genre 2 ̆ 7 s emergence as a privileged medium for Francophone poets to explore the difficulty of retaining trans-European cultural affinity during the rise of protonationalist and regionalist faction in the Hundred Years War. This was a long-term conflict ostensibly between England and France, lasting from 1337 until 1453, that involved multiple other European regions within its theater. The dissertation organizes itself around a large, but little studied, late medieval manuscript anthology of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, MS Codex 902 (formerly French 15). Never fully edited, the Pennsylvania manuscript is the largest, oldest, and most formally and geographically diverse <b>formes</b> fixes collection extant today. Chapter One argues that, unlike other, later, <b>formes</b> fixes anthologies, the Pennsylvania manuscript is not structured by author or sub-genre, but rather by form, chronology, geographic diversity, and dialectal difference. It thus reveals not only its compiler 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of the diffusion of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric, but a desire to memorialize this genre 2 ̆ 7 s transmission across regional divides. Chapter Two explores the political effects of the diffusion of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric by mapping literary borrowings between a corpus of anti-war texts in this anthology and other lyric corpora written in France, England, and the Low Countries. Chapter Three focuses on Francophone responses, both positive and negative, to the transmission of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric into England, centering on the implications of Eustache Deschamps 2 ̆ 7 praise of his English Francophone contemporary, Geoffrey Chaucer, as a 2 ̆ 2 great translator 2 ̆ 2 of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric. Chapter Four examines the adoption of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric {{in the work of}} Chaucer and his English Francophone contemporary, John Gower. It demonstrates that, like their Continental counterparts, Chaucer and Gower also view the appropriation of <b>formes</b> fixes lyric as a means of carving a geopolitically specific identity out of Francophone cultural belonging. ...|$|R

He had {{transferred}} {{power of}} attorney in his residence and property in Wiesbaden to his wife, and when trying {{to buy a house}} in Chicago he found she had taken everything. His voice becoming worn, and needing employment, he essayed a career as stage actor: after some study he played Schiller's William Tell and Lessing's Nathan the Wise, in Würzburg and Mainz with success, and Shylock (The Merchant of Venice) with artistic (but not financial) success in England. Santley saw him as Shylock, and observed that (although <b>Formes</b> always preserved a strong German accent in conversation) his English declamation and rhythm were exemplary, better than the English actors: [...] His second wife, from Wiesbaden, also failed to safeguard his money. However <b>Formes</b> returned to singing, and to America. Anschütz established German Opera at New York in 1862, and in October 1864 <b>Formes</b> was with Leonard Grover's German Opera Company in Boston, with Johannsen and Marie Frederici (mezzo), Johanna Rotter, Theodore Habelman (tenor), Josef Hermanns (basso) and Sig. Tamaro. These singers cohered in subsequent years. Anschütz retired from the German Opera in 1864, and in spring 1865 his pupil and chorus-master Adolf Neuendorff delivered William Tell at the New York Academy with Frederici, Habelman, Hermanns, Carl <b>Formes</b> and Wilhelm <b>Formes</b> (his brother), as Grover's Company. The Grover company gave Martha (April 29) with <b>Formes,</b> Franz Himmer, Rotter and Sophie Dziuba (Nancy).|$|R

50|$|Around 1840, {{he decided}} to attempt a musical career, {{encouraged}} by Franz Liszt who heard him sing. An actor Ferdinand Gumbert tutored him in bass roles from Die Zauberflöte (Sarastro), Norma (Oroveso) and Boieldieu's La dame blanche (Gaston). He made his debut as Sarastro at Cologne Stadt-Theater in January 1842, with such success that the Director, Spielberger, immediately engaged him on a salary, {{and he was able}} to understudy other roles. Liszt declared his prophecy fulfilled, and <b>Formes</b> devoted himself fully to the stage. At Cologne the bass Josef Staudigl (of the Vienna Hofoper) made guest appearances which <b>Formes</b> studied closely, especially his Bertram in Robert le diable and his Marcel in Les Huguenots. Staudigl, returning from London in 1843, heard <b>Formes</b> perform Bertram with his own modifications, and paid him a broad compliment. They sang together once in I puritani, as Riccardo (Staudigl) and Giorgio (<b>Formes).</b> After two years (including a season at Düsseldorf), <b>Formes</b> broke his contract with Spielberger and escaped to Mannheim, where he joined the Grand-Ducal Opera and befriended Vinzenz Lachner. In February 1845 he was singing Marcel there.|$|R

25|$|In October 1905, Satie {{enrolled}} in Vincent d'Indy's Schola Cantorum de Paris to study classical counterpoint while still continuing his cabaret work. Most {{of his friends}} were as dumbfounded as the professors at the Schola when they heard about his new plan {{to return to the}} classrooms, especially as d'Indy was an admiring pupil of Saint-Saëns, not particularly favoured by Satie. Satie would follow these courses at the Schola, as a respected pupil, for more than five years, receiving a first (intermediate) diploma in 1908. Some of his classroom counterpoint-exercises, such as the , were published after his death.

25|$|Léonce Rosenberg, in 1929, {{commissioned}} Gleizes (replacing Gino Severini) {{to paint}} decorative panels for his Parisian residence, {{which would be}} installed in 1931.

By this time, his work reflected the strengthening of his religious convictions and his 1932 book, Vers une conscience plastique, La <b>Forme</b> et l’histoire examines Celtic, Romanesque, and Oriental art. On tour in Poland and Germany, he gave lectures titled Art et Religion, Art et Production and Art et Science and wrote a book on Robert Delaunay but it was never published.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Reformation, {{directly}} {{influenced by}} Calvinism, was generally opposed to church music, {{leading to the}} removal of organs and a growing emphasis on metrical psalms, including a setting by David Peebles commissioned by James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. The most important work in Scottish reformed music was probably A <b>forme</b> of Prayers published in Edinburgh in 1564. The return from France of James V's daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots in 1561, renewed the Scottish court as a centre of musical patronage and performance. The Queen played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She was brought many influences from the French court {{where she had been}} educated, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. Mary's position as a Catholic gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal in her reign, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. The outstanding Scottish composer of the era was Robert Carver (c.1485–c.1570) whose works included the nineteen-part motet 'O Bone Jesu'. James VI, king of Scotland from 1567, was a major patron of the arts in general. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he came south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. The Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, as when Charles I returned in 1633 to be crowned, bringing many musicians from the English Chapel Royal for the service, and it began to fall into disrepair. From now on the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage.|$|E
