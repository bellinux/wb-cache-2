25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{established}} in a permanent structure with equipment {{that is not}} intended for portable operation {{is referred to as}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>station.</b> This is {{the most common form of}} amateur radio station, and can be found in homes, schools, and some public buildings. A typical <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> is equipped with a transceiver and one or more antennas. For voice communications, the station will be equipped with a microphone; for communications using the Morse code, a telegraph key is common; and for communications over digital modes such as RTTY and PSK31, a station will be equipped with a specialized interface to connect the transceiver to a computer sound card. While not a requirement for radiocommunications, most fixed amateur radio stations are equipped with one or more computers, which serve tasks ranging from logging of contacts with other stations to various levels of station hardware control. Fixed stations might also be equipped with amplifiers, antenna rotators, SWR meters, and other station accessories.|$|E
25|$|Before it {{was turned}} off on May 2, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50m (164ft) {{horizontally}} and about 100m (328ft) vertically. Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called Differential GPS or DGPS. DGPS also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so {{it continues to be}} widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order of President Clinton in 2000.|$|E
25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{installed}} in a vehicle {{is referred to as}} a mobile station. A typical mobile station is equipped with a transceiver, one or more antennas, and a microphone. The transceiver may be specially designed for installation in vehicles. It may be much smaller than transceivers designed for <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> use, to facilitate installation under a seat or in a trunk, and it may feature a detachable control head that can be mounted in a separate location {{from the rest of the}} radio. Antennas designed for mobile stations must accommodate the unique physical constraints of the vehicle and travel lanes which it occupies, allowing for clearance under overpasses and bridges, and safe passage by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Most antennas used in mobile stations are omnidirectional. Few mobile stations are equipped to communicate with Morse code or digital modes. Most mobile stations are designed to be operated by the vehicle operator while driving.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>stations</b> are {{generally}} powered from the AC {{mains electrical supply}} available in the building.

The 1 -s sound pressure levels and 1 -s black carbon concentrations were measured. In addition, 5 continuous monitoring <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> connected to building facades were used. Different processing methods are compared, based on different temporal and spatial weighting aggregations.

50|$|A captive rover is a rover station whose contest {{operation}} is intended specifically or {{primarily for the}} benefit of another <b>fixed</b> <b>station.</b> A captive rover might travel to locations in several different grid locators and make two-way contacts only with one specific multi-operator station in the contest. That station benefits from the activity of the rover station, whereas its competition in the contest cannot receive the same potential benefit. A <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> that is helped by multiple captive rovers can generate a very large score making two-way contacts with only a small set of rovers.|$|E
40|$|Information systems {{consist of}} {{multiple}} mobile <b>stations</b> and <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> communicating with each other. Mission critical applications {{are required to}} be executed fault-tolerantly in these systems. However, mobile stations support neither enough volume of storage and processing power nor enough capacity of battery to do reliable communication for a long period. Moreover, wireless communication channels are less reliable. Hence, the communication channels with the mobile stations are often disconnected. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} multiple mobile stations to take checkpoints synchronously since the communication channels with the mobile stations may be disconnected even during taking the checkpoints. We have proposed hybrid checkpointing where checkpoints are taken asynchronously by the mobile stations and synchronously by the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations.</b> In addition, the mobile stations record messages for getting local states consistent with the checkpoints taken by the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations.</b> In this [...] ...|$|R

40|$|At city level, {{personal}} monitoring is {{the best}} way to assess people's exposure. However, it is usually estimated from a few monitoring stations. Our aim was to determine the exposure to black carbon (BC) and BC dose for 45 schoolchildren with portable microaethalometers and to evaluate the relationship between personal monitoring and <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> at schools (indoor and outdoor) and in an urban background (UB) site. Personal BC concentra-tions were 20 % higher than in <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> at schools. Linear mixed-effect models showed low R(2) between personal measurements and <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> at schools (R(2) ≤ 0. 28), increasing to R(2) ≥ 0. 70 if considering only periods when children were at schools. For the UB station, the respective R(2) were 0. 18 and 0. 45, indicating the importance of the distance to the monitoring station when assessing exposure. During the warm season, the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> agreed better with personal measurements than during the cold one. Children spent 6 % of their time on commuting but received 20 % of their daily BC dose, due to co-occurrence with road traffic rush hours and the close proximity to the source. Children received 37 % of their daily-integrated BC dose at school. Indoor environments (classroom and home) were responsible for the 56 % BC dose. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (ERC-Advanced Grant) under grant agreement number 268479 – the BREATHE project.
