50|$|The above-described {{process with}} {{the capture of}} two {{electrons}} and emission of two neutrinos (two-neutrino double electron capture) is allowed by the Standard Model of particle physics: no conservation laws (including lepton number conservation) are violated. However, if the lepton number is not conserved, or the neutrino is its own antiparticle, another kind of the process can occur: the so-called neutrinoless double electron capture. In this case, two electrons are captured by nucleus, but neutrinos are not emitted. The energy released in this process is carried away by an internal bremsstrahlung <b>gamma</b> <b>quantum.</b> This mode of decay has never been observed experimentally, and would contradict the Standard Model if it were observed.|$|E

The shifts of volt-ampere characteristics into the higher voltage range have been observed in conditions of increasing neutron fluence and radiation dose. The observed increase in the resistance of ohmic contacts is caused by the rising resistance of adjacent area, which in its turn results from the changing mobility of charge carriers. The latter varies with the growth of introduced defects under irradiation. Two different areas of current generation have been identified. A mechanism of current generation depends on injected charge carriers in the range of mid-level electron injection. Moreover, the range of high electron injection is distinguished by changing resistance of light emitting diode cores alongside with current generation conditioned by charge carrier injection...|$|E

40|$|Over 10 {{years ago}} we {{proposed}} an experiment on measuring the characteristics of radiative neutron decay in papers [1, 2]. At {{the same time we}} had published the theoretical spectrum of radiative <b>gamma</b> <b>quanta,</b> calculated {{within the framework of the}} electroweak interactions, on the basis of which we proposed the methodology for the future experiment [3, 4]. However, because we were denied beam time on the intensive cold neutron beam at ILL (Grenoble, France) for a number of years, we could only conduct the experiment in 2005 on the newly opened FRMII reactor of Technical University of Muenchen. The main result of this experiment was the discovery of radiative neutron decay and the measurement of its relative intensity B. R. = (3. 2 +- 1. 6) 10 - 3 with C. L. = 99. 7 % for radiative <b>gamma</b> <b>quanta</b> with energy over 35 kev [5, 6]. Over a year after our first announcement about the results of the conducted experiment, "Nature" [7] published a letter asserting that its authors have also measured the branching ratio of radiative neutron decay B.

40|$|The {{present report}} is {{dedicated}} to consideration of spectrum and angular distribution of radiative gamma quanta for radiative neutron decay, {{which has not been}} discovered experimentally. The angular distribution of gamma quanta obtained will allow one to conduct new correlation experiments with the take-off of the fourth particle Å the <b>gamma</b> <b>quantum.</b> Besides, as will be shown in the report, this distribution plays a signiˇcant role in suppressing the correlated background of bremsstrahlung gamma quanta, which simulates the effect completely. This background is impossible to remove even using the triple gamma quanta, electron and recoil proton coincidences. However, it is namely this unhomogeneous distribution by the angle of the outgoing radiative gamma quanta that allows one to use the space resolution and eliminate this dangerous background, thus making the conduction of an experiment on radiative neutron decay perfectly feasible. ´  ¨§¨·Ê¥É¸Ö ¸¶¥±É · ¨ Ê£µ¢µ ¥ ·  ¸¶·¥¤¥¥´¨ ¥ £   -± ¢  ´Éµ ¢ ¶· ¨ ·  ¤ ¨  Í¨µ´´µ ¡¥É- ·  ¸ ¶  ¤¥ ´¥°É·µ ´ , ±µÉµ·Ò ° ¶µ ±  Ô±¸¶¥·¨¥´É Ó´µ ´ ¥ µ¡ ´  ·Ê¦¥´. ˆ§¥·¥´¨ ¥ Ê£µ¢ÒÌ ·  ¸¶·¥¤¥¥´¨...|$|E
