25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to {{ring for}} tea when you came. Sit down, Mr Haffigan.|$|E
60|$|Rectus {{had gone}} on board, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to follow him, when our old Minorcan stepped up to me.|$|E
6000|$|Lize began, abruptly: [...] "I'm down, but not out; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{coming up}} to see you this afternoon. Lee and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> pulling out for good." ...|$|R

6000|$|Lawford slowly {{shook his}} head. 'You know {{in your heart}} it isn't, Sheila; you {{understand}} me quite well, although you persistently pretend not to. I can't argue now. I can't speak up for myself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> as far down as I can go. It's only Alice.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> {{to shake}} hands with them all, {{previous}} to my final departure from their presence, when the Boots came into the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> {{to give up}} {{the hunt}} for my ball in despair, when I heard Celia's voice calling to me {{from the edge of the}} undergrowth. There was a sharp note in it which startled me.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{door closed}} softly below, and a step came {{creeping}} towards the back-stairs. Sure now of my prey, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to scream 'Jack!' when something went splash {{into the tub}} {{at the foot of}} the back-stairs.|$|E
5000|$|William's {{father was}} able to make a generous {{provision}} for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1845 Thomson graduated as Second Wrangler. He also won the First Smith's Prize,which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> fit to mend his pens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Red Cloud, dear Red Cloud," [...] she said, [...] "your {{reasoning}} <b>is</b> all wrong. <b>I</b> think I {{love you}} best. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> making up my mind, and it's for you. And now, just {{to help me}} to be sure, {{tell me what you}} told me a little while ago--you know--' I love the woman, the one woman. After a dozen years of possession I love her quite madly, oh, so sweetly madly.' Say it to me, Red Cloud." ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Malley {{stated that}} he wanted to create a [...] "hybrid" [...] work that {{received}} inspiration from American and Japanese comics, and that he [...] "wanted to reach towards the japanese comics from my own starting point." [...] When asked if he considers Scott Pilgrim to be a manga, O'Malley responded by saying [...] "Um… No, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> thinking <b>about</b> that today. <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> thinking <b>about</b> the whole OEL thing. I think it’s influenced… I like the term 'manga-influenced comics,' but I only like it because no one else likes it." ...|$|R
6000|$|This plan delighted Miss Ruth, but I saw {{in it the}} {{beginning}} of the workings of a deep-laid scheme. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to sit down when Mrs. Aleshine said to me in a low voice, as she left us: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to yell {{a signal}} cry when I saw Don, with hair rising stiff, run forward. He took a dozen jumps, then yelping broke down the steep, yellow and green gorge. He {{disappeared}} before I {{knew what had}} happened.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Turn it to any purpose? You can, Miss Willoughby, and I {{shall have}} the honour {{to lay the}} method before you, of course only for your consideration, and under seal of secrecy. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to write to you asking for an interview.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I have <b>just</b> {{tried to}} <b>be</b> natural {{in my own}} way and would love to play such characters. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> passionate <b>about</b> acting in films." [...] — Jadhav {{speaking}} about her role in Dhag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} here, Bone; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{thinking}} <b>about</b> it, that's all. You're always drumming it into me about not taking anything for granted. Anyway, {{by the time}} I go to Plato I'll know----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce {{stopped him}} as he was going up-stairs to his room. [...] "Victor, don't worry about me. While it looks as though I have lost a good deal of money through Pettus, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> by no means bankrupt. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> met your mother. She has not enriched me--I mean The Voices have not--neither have they impoverished me. It's just the same with Leo. She's almost exactly where she was when she came East. It would seem {{as if they had been}} playing with us just to show us how unsubstantial earthly {{possessions}} are." ...|$|R
6000|$|Edward {{shook his}} head. [...] "I was merely envying Miss Drewitt her {{possession}} of you," [...] he said, carelessly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to remark that I wished {{you were my}} uncle too, when she came indoors. I suppose she wanted you to hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet. [...] "Why, certainly, Miss Armytage." [...] For so imperturbable {{a young man}} he seemed oddly breathless in his eagerness to welcome her. [...] "Are you looking for O'Moy? He left me nearly half-an-hour ago to go to breakfast, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to follow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil you do, Woods!" [...] {{cried the}} captain, {{looking up from}} his bit of dry toast, in astonishment. [...] "Why, my dear fellow--this is odd-- {{excessively}} odd, if the truth must be said.--To own the real state of the case, chaplain, you have won me over, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to make proper acknowledgments of your victory!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This werry minit," [...] {{answered}} the sailor. [...] "In fact <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> castin' <b>about</b> {{in my mind}} w'en you came up how I could best throw Ally Babby off the scent as to w'ere <b>I</b> <b>was</b> goin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|The landlord, who {{had shared}} the general {{suspicion}} abroad in the community, stared. [...] "Are you sure of that? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> wondering <b>about</b> these folks. They have {{the reputation of}} being as poor as Job's off ox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-night," [...] <b>I</b> thought, and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> {{to voice}} my {{decision}} to Xodar, when, without warning, the door of our prison opened and a guard stepped in.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to clamber {{along the}} jagged rocks which {{lie at the}} base of the cliff next to the sea, in search of some {{foothold}} to the top, when I chanced to see a canoe rounding the end of the island. I threw my-self down behind a large boulder where I could watch the dugout and its occupants without myself being seen.|$|E
60|$|He almost chirped the {{delightful}} {{words in}} a high, pleasant voice, but except {{for the first three}} of them, they were too many for my small Latin, and I afterwards forgot to test the aptness of his quotation. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to ask him (with some little unwillingness) to translate the whole ode for me, when I heard Fanny's step at the door. I desisted.|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} settled some months {{in our new}} home, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> half way through my sixth year, when one morning at breakfast we {{children}} were informed to our utter dismay that we {{could no longer be}} permitted to run absolutely wild; that a schoolmaster had been engaged who would live in the house and would have us in the schoolroom during the morning and part of the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Arthur, I'm {{sorry if}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cross <b>just</b> now <b>about</b> Abdul Said. It was stupid {{of me to}} {{interfere}} with something that wasn't my business.|$|R
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer David Campese defended {{himself by}} stating that, [...] "...I did not {{deliberately}} try to {{slap the ball}} down when Winterbottom attempted to pass to Underwood in the second half. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> worried <b>about</b> stopping Winterbottom and I tried to get man and ball by wrapping my arms around him {{as well as the}} ball." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{talking to}} ’im about my boy, same as <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> to you,’ ses the old lady, ’and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> telling ’im <b>about</b> the poor child losing ’is finger——’ ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{got down}} into the area I felt indescribably foolish literally, as the saying is, in a hole. There {{was nothing but a}} closed door, {{shuttered}} windows, the steps down which we had come, the ridiculous well in which I found myself, and the ridiculous man who had brought me there, and who stood there with dancing eyes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to turn back when Rupert caught me by the elbow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I trailed {{around to}} the rocks where we had the tumble last winter, and then I came up as silently as a Comanche after a scalp. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> ready to fire when the deer took alarm, but I caught him when he raised his head, and all he gave was one leap {{and it was all}} over. Where is father? I must tell him." [...] And Ralph looked around impatiently.|$|E
60|$|The heavenly {{gentleness}} of {{his smile}} made his apologies irresistible. The richness of his deep voice added its own indescribable charm to the interesting business question {{which he had}} just addressed to me. In truth, we were almost TOO nicely off for Trousers; we were quite overwhelmed by them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to say so, {{when the door opened}} again, and an element of worldly disturbance entered the room, in the person of Miss Verinder.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the 1992 {{election}} MacKenzie {{used the}} front-page headline [...] "If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has claimed his response was: [...] "Prime Minister, I have on my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to pour all over you." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{now we must}} {{endeavour}} to {{find some}} additional proof of the general character and composition of water; and for this purpose I will keep you a little longer, so that at our next meeting we may be better prepared for the subject. We have the power of arranging the zinc which you have seen acting upon the water by the assistance of an acid, {{in such a manner}} as to cause all the power to be evolved in the place where we require it I have behind me a voltaic pile, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to shew you, {{at the end of this}} lecture, its character and power, that you may see what we shall have to deal with when next we meet. I hold here the extremities of the wires which transport the power from behind me, and which I shall cause to act on the water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I swan!" [...] he exclaimed, {{staring at}} her in admiration and {{neglecting}} his pie, [...] "I've always thought you had it in you to get on, Janet. I guess I've told you you've always put me in mind of Eliza Bumpus--the one that held out against the Indians till her husband {{came back with the}} neighbours. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> reading <b>about</b> her again the other night." ...|$|R
