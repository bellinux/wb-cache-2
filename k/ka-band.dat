Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32GHz <b>Ka-band.</b> NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented <b>Ka-band</b> receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft <b>Ka-band</b> telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. <b>Ka-band</b> tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier.

While three-zone models consisting of an iron core, or a eutectic mixture of iron and iron sulfide, plus a rocky mantle and an outer layer of ice are possible, Rhea's relatively small density suggests that the satellite is not iron rich.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel tri-band (X/Ku/Ka-band) planar antenna array with dual polarizations and shared aperture. Compared with traditional dual-polarized arrays, the proposed array has advantages of low cost, low profile, and high integration. Three types of antennas resonating at different frequencies, including the perforated patch, stacked patch, and slim crosspatch, are innovatively interleaved {{in the same}} aperture. The crosspatch fed by proximity coupling is presented as Ku-band element for its advantages of compact size, high isolation, and pure polarization. The techniques such as series feed and reverse feed are utilized to implement the six feed networks in a compact size with reduced cross polarizations.

40|$|Spaceborne {{synthetic}} aperture radars (SARs) exhibit the appealing imaging feature {{of very high}} spatial resolution (on the order of meters). At frequency above C-band, the atmospheric effects, and particularly the signature of precipitating clouds, cannot be neglected on both amplitude and phase received signal. The impact of precipitation on SAR slant-view imagery {{is due to a}} combination of surface and volumetric backscattering, coupled with path attenuation and with a significant dependence on frequency, polarization, and spatial distribution of hydrometeors. The actual spatial resolution (on the order of hundreds of meters) of these effects is larger than the SAR nominal one due to the random nature of the moving distributed atmospheric target. This paper is devoted to the numerical forward modeling of SAR response at X-, Ku-, and <b>Ka-bands</b> due to precipitating clouds in order to better understand the physical correlation between SAR echo and precipitation. To this aim, a high-resolution mesoscale atmospheric numerical model is used to extract the 3 -D distribution of liquid and ice hydrometeors. A detailed sensitivity analysis of SAR backscattering is carried out with respect to hydrometeor columnar and slant water contents, relative contribution of volumetric and surface scattering, incidence angle and ground inhomogeneity, polarimetric observables, and frequency scaling signatures. The numerical results show that the slant-view of SAR observations plays a determinant role and the use of a multifrequency polarimetric SAR may be very useful to characterize precipitation effects and, to a certain extent, retrieve its content at very high spatial resolution...|$|R

The mass weighted mean diameter (D-m in mm) and normalized DSD scaling parameter for concentration (N-w in mm(- 1) m(- 3)) show pronounced seasonal differences at low to medium rain {{rates in the}} disdrometer data, {{in accordance with the}} previous studies, but not in the GPM-DPR data. Similar features are observed every year in disdrometer measurements and over different spatial domains in GPM-DPR measurements, indicating that sampling mismatch errors are insignificant. The reasons for the absence of seasonal differences in DSDs derived from GPM-DPR are examined by simulating the reflectivities at Ku- and <b>Ka-bands,</b> utilizing the disdrometer measurements and T-matrix scattering indices. Results suggest that the D-m and N-w retrieved from single-frequency and dual-frequency algorithms utilizing the disdrometer data also show seasonal differences in accordance with the observations with under and overestimation of D-m and N-w, respectively. When compared with the disdrometer, the D-m values retrieved from the GPM-DPR (official products) are severely underestimated at high rain rates (R> 8 mmh(- 1)) during the SW monsoon season. On the other hand, during low rain rates (R< 8 mmh(- 1)), a slight underestimation (overestimation) of D-m is seen during the SW (NE) monsoon. The mean N-w values retrieved from GPM-DPR agree poorly with disdrometer data during both the monsoon seasons...|$|R
