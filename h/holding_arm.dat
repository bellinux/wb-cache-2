Preferably, the zones are inclined downwardly towards downstream for aiding {{movement of the}} vehicles downstream by gravity. Zone one is a storage zone which preferably has vents adjacent its upstream end and its downstream end for controlling the speed of movement of vehicles into zone one and from zone one to zone two. Zone two is the processing zone which receives vehicles from zone one and releases the vehicles to zone three. Zone two includes an air blocking vehicle stop at its downstream end against which a first vehicle is held, and includes a <b>holding</b> <b>arm</b> which holds a second vehicle while the leading first vehicle is released. The first vehicle is released to zone three, but only when three is clear of vehicles and a second vehicle is positioned behind the first vehicle. Thereafter, the second vehicle is released {{and moves to the}} downstream end of zone two and becomes the leading vehicle for continuing the cycle. Additional vehicles moving through the conduit are decelerated in zones one and two with the aid of air trapped behind the air blocking vehicle stop and/or parked vehicles. An accelerator may be provided in zone two for providing a rapid start of the leading vehicle from zone two into zone three. Vehicle position sensors are positioned in the various zones for sensing the presence of vehicles and controlling the movement of the vehicles through the conduit.

40|$|Background and Aims: Residual ridge {{resorption}} is an unpredictable, unavoidable and time-dependent process which occurs in denture-wearing patients {{especially those who}} use mandibular dentures. This process causes more problems in mandible because of its less support, tongue forces and more resorption. Inserting implants {{in many of these}} patients requires bone grafts. Overdentures are also more expensive. Denture adhesives are the last option to improve retention and masticatory function in denture-wearers with severe resorption of alveolar ridge. Nowadays only a few denture adhesives are used in Iran and there is not much information about their standard features including, pH, bond strength and washability. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine and compare the mentioned characteristics of four denture adhesives (Professional, Corega, Fittydent and Fixodent) and to introduce the most suitable denture adhesive for clinical use. Materials and Methods: All the methodologies of ISO 10873 : 2010 were applied. To measure the pH value, 1 ± 0. 1 g of each denture adhesive was diluted with 5 g of propylene glycol and mixed with water. Using pH meter, pH of each group was measured separately for 4 times (n= 4) and results were recorded. For the washability test, 4 dentures were fabricated (n= 4) and each group of denture adhesives was placed on a denture according to manufacture instructions. For simulating mouth environment specimens were placed in water at 37 ± 2 ̊C bath for 1 hour and then washed with a plastic brush. Specimens were examined for any residual adhesive and the results were recorded. For bond strength test, a sample holder was gently filled with denture adhesives and was attached to the <b>holding</b> <b>arm</b> of bond strength testing device (Santam, STM 20, Iran). Specimens were placed in 300 ml water bath at 37 ± 2 ̊C for 10 minutes, and then shaken to be dried and placed in the bond strength testing device. 10 N force with 5 mm/min rate was applied to the specimen. The force was maintained for 30 s and then device arm was pulled back and the highest number was recorded with computer software (Santam Machine Controller v 4. 19, Iran). The test performed 8 times (n= 8) for each adhesive and 8 results were recorded. Data were analyzed using ANOVA test for comparing the bond strength with a significant level fixed at 0. 05. Results: Professional and Corega adhesives had more neutral pH than that of Fittydent and Fixodent which were more acidic. Washability test showed no remaining mass of any adhesive and there was not any statistically significant difference between groups (P> 0. 05). Fittydent and Corega adhesives showed higher bond strength than that of Professional and Fixodent and this difference was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Professional and Corega adhesives had less acidity. Thus they cause less harmful effects on the oral mucosa than that of Fittydent and Fixodent and should be indicated in patients with little-tolerant oral mucousa such as diabetous, iron-deficiency anemia and hypertention. All the groups had acceptable washability. Fittydent and Corega had higher bond strength than that of Professional and Fixodent. Therefore in complete-denture-wearers who require more retention as a result of severe {{ridge resorption}}, macrotruma, and maladaptiivity, Fittydent and Corega seems to be more acceptable...|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point for this NWOI funded Ph. D. research is the observation that although UN accountability mechanisms are increasingly <b>holding</b> <b>armed</b> groups ‘accountable’ under human rights law, the legal basis for the responsibility of armed groups under human rights law remains controversial Structured into four parts, this study addresses the uncertainty {{at the core of}} the debate about whether and when armed groups are bound by human rights obligations. Part I of the study identifies the normative value that human rights law brings to the legal framework that applies in non-international armed conflicts vis-a-vis international humanitarian law. It shows that human rights law brings most value to activities connected to the exercise of authority over persons or territory, the maintenance of public order and the suppression of criminal activity outside the conduct of hostilities. Drawing on social science literature on rebel governance and armed conflict generally, the study demonstrates that there is significant added value in <b>holding</b> <b>armed</b> groups to account under human rights law. Part II of the study brings clarity to the circumstances in which armed groups can acquire obligations under international human rights law. It does this by conducting a comparative and theoretical analysis of the legal personality of armed groups under international humanitarian law, the law of belligerency and the law of insurgency. By analysing these legal frameworks, the study draws conclusions about the material and theoretical circumstances which are required for an armed group to acquire legal personality under human rights law. Part IV of the study brings clarity to how and when armed groups can be held bound by human rights norms. In doing so, the study considers whether the source of an armed group’s legal obligations under international law are most likely rooted in treaty law, its control of territory, international criminal law or customary international law. Part IV of the study synthesises the study’s findings to draw conclusions about the circumstances in which it may be justifiable for UN accountability mechanisms to <b>hold</b> <b>armed</b> groups responsible under human rights law...|$|R
