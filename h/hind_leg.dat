5|$|Grasshopper beam engines were beam engines pivoted at one end, {{the long}} {{horizontal}} arm resembling the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> of a grasshopper. The type was patented by William Freemantle in 1803.|$|E
5|$|The Archostemata have {{an exposed}} plate called the metatrochantin {{in front of}} the basal segment or coxa of the <b>hind</b> <b>leg.</b> Myxophaga {{contains}} about 65 described species in four families, mostly very small, including Hydroscaphidae and the genus Sphaerius. The myxophagan beetles are small and mostly alga-feeders. Their mouthparts are characteristic in lacking galeae and having a mobile tooth on their left mandible.|$|E
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
500|$|The courbette: a {{movement}} where the horse balances on its <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and then essentially [...] "hops," [...] jumping with the forelegs {{off the ground}} and <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> together.|$|R
5000|$|The {{domestic}} {{horse is}} almost alone among extant equines in having chestnuts on the <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> [...] Chestnuts are {{absent from the}} <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> of asses and zebras. [...] The majority of domestic horses have chestnuts on all four legs, as does the Przewalski's horse, but a few horse breeds are reported to lack chestnuts on the <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> [...] These include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Horse {{with weak}} or slack loin might have good lateral bend, but {{collection}} suffers as true collection depends on coiling loin {{to bend the}} <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> Because the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and hocks aren’t able to be positioned under body, the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> string out behind, so the horse {{is more likely to}} go on the forehand. This creates coordination and balance problems, as well as forelimb lameness.|$|R
5|$|BMNH R.3078 {{was found}} at Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in strata of the Upper Oxford Clay and {{consists}} {{of a series of}} vertebrae from the rear half of the skeleton. Other remains, including a front leg with fossilized cartilage in its joint, a <b>hind</b> <b>leg,</b> and a partial sacrum have been referred to and accepted as C. stewarti. A whiplash tail from the same locality was thought by Charig as possibly belonging to Cetiosauriscus, but the assignment is not fully accepted by paleontologists. With that much material, Cetiosauriscus {{is one of the most}} complete sauropods from the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the <b>hind</b> <b>leg,</b> shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
50|$|Stringhalt is {{a sudden}} flexion {{of one or}} both <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> in the horse, most easily seen while the horse is walking or trotting. It is most evident when the horse is backing up slowly, turning on the {{affected}} leg, or suddenly frightened. It can involve one or both <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> of the horse. It is a spasmodic contraction of the lateral extensor tendons of the <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R

25|$|The terms profemur, mesofemur and metafemur {{refer to}} the femora of the front, middle and <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> of an insect, respectively. Similarly protibia, mesotibia and metatibia {{refer to the}} tibiae of the front, middle and <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E
5|$|The thorax and abdomen are {{segmented}} {{and have}} a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines {{and there are a}} pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.|$|E
3000|$|... h is {{considered}} to be 0 when the tip is aligned with the <b>hind</b> <b>leg’s</b> tip, and 1 when the middle leg’s tip is aligned with the front leg’s tip, i.e., the distance to the <b>hind</b> <b>leg’s</b> tip is 200.|$|R
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|R

5|$|Large three-toed {{footprints}} {{are known}} in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert {{went so far}} as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named Iguanodon, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to Iguanodon. A trackway in England shows what may be an Iguanodon moving on all fours, but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus Iguanodon are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil Iguanodon is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the <b>hind</b> <b>leg,</b> or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E

5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
25|$|Preparation and Timing: The rider {{prepares for}} the {{transition}} by using half-halts to balance the horse, and bends him slightly in the intended direction. Since the first footfall of the canter is the outside <b>hind</b> <b>leg,</b> the rider times the aids {{to ask for the}} canter when the outside <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> is engaged (i.e. under the body). So, at the trot the rider would ask when the inside front leg touches the ground (its shoulder will be forward). At the walk, the rider will ask when the outside shoulder starts to move back.|$|E
25|$|Beat One: the {{grounding}} {{phase of}} the outside <b>hind</b> <b>leg.</b> There are many riders who think a front leg is the first beat of the canter, which is incorrect. At this time, the other three legs are off the ground.|$|E

25|$|Ideally, the {{advancing}} rear hoof oversteps {{the spot where}} the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> reaches forward.|$|E
