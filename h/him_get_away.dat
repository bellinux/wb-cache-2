25|$|On the 18th The Mexican Imperial General O'Horán, persuaded Díaz to {{meet him}} halfway at night and used red light signals to {{identify}} himself while sneaking out undiscovered from the capital. Díaz escorted by drummers and buglers responded with the same signal, that unfortunately revealed his position to the Imperialist shooters who instantly opened fire on him. O'Horán blamed Márquez for the incident and swore his innocence. The second night O'Horan {{came out of the}} capital and met Díaz, which they did this time. He offered to surrender the city, including Márquez and the other principal officers, with the sole condition of obtaining a passport to go abroad. Díaz felt that such an offer is pointless considering the city was helpless, and that as for the other leaders I would fulfill my duty. O'Horán insisted that however the city would fall the capture of the wanted officers was uncertain, but his offer guaranteed both. Díaz refused again and warned the General that although he let <b>him</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> that time he would put him under custody as soon as the city was to be captured.|$|E
