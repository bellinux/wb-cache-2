25|$|When {{a cancer}} bladder cell line, T24P, {{which does not}} express H19 was {{transfected}} with a <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> expressing the H19 gene {{under the control of}} the cytomegalovirus promoter, many changes were seen in the resulting cells when compared to both the original T24P cell line and a H19-antisense <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> transfected T24P cell line. While there was no difference in proliferation in 10% FCS (normal condition) between the 3 cell lines, when grown in 0.1% FCS (starved serum), the H19-transfected cells maintained their rate of growth while both the control and the antisense H19 transfected cells decreased their rate of proliferation by approximately 50%.|$|E
25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library. Libraries may be highly complex (as when cloning complete genomic DNA from an organism) or relatively simple (as when moving a previously cloned DNA fragment into a different plasmid), but it is almost always necessary to examine {{a number of different}} clones {{to be sure that the}} desired <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> is obtained. This may be accomplished through a very wide range of experimental methods, including the use of nucleic acid hybridizations, antibody probes, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reduction}} of IGF2 expression {{could be a}} reason for the slower growth of cells treated with Azad. As well, in a mouse bladder carcinoma cell line, where transfection of a human H19 <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> results in high expression of H19, the methylation of the H19 promoter reduces H19 expression.|$|E
50|$|DNA-directed RNA {{interference}} (ddRNAi) is a gene-silencing {{technique that}} utilizes <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> to activate an animal cell’s endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> {{are designed to}} express self-complementary double-stranded RNAs, typically short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA), that once processed bring about silencing of a target gene or genes. Any RNA, including endogenous mRNAs or viral RNAs, can be silenced by designing constructs to express double-stranded RNA complementary to the desired mRNA target.|$|R
50|$|Delivery of ddRNAi <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> is {{simplified}} by {{the existence}} of a number of clinically-approved and well-characterized gene therapy vectors developed for the purpose. Delivery is a major challenge for RNAi-based therapeutics with new modifications and reagents continually being developed to optimize target cell delivery. Two broad strategies to facilitate delivery of <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> to the desired cells are available: these use either viral vectors or {{one of a number of}} classes of transfection reagents.|$|R

2500|$|The H19 gene {{contains}} 3 Sp1 binding sites, however these 3 {{sites are}} present {{in a part of}} the sequence that has shown no transcriptional activity in deletion assays. As a result, these Sp1 binding sites are not expected to contribute much to the regulation of H19 gene transcription. The H19 gene sequence also contains binding sites for the C/EBP family of transcription factors. One of these C/EBP transcription factor binding sites also contains a CpG site. [...] In vitro methylation of this CpG site on a <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> strongly inhibited transcription of the H19 gene.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{delivered}} <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> {{contains a}} selectable marker, then stably transformed cells can be selected and cultured using tissue culture methods.

5000|$|A <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> is an artificially {{constructed}} {{segment of}} nucleic acid {{that is going}} to be [...] "transplanted" [...] into a target tissue or cell. It often contains a DNA insert, which contains the gene sequence encoding a protein of interest, that has been subcloned into a vector, which contains bacterial resistance genes for growth in bacteria, and promoters for expression in the organism. A <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> may express wildtype protein, prevent the expression of certain genes by expressing competitors or inhibitors, or express mutant proteins, such as deletion mutations or missense mutations. A <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> is often used in molecular biology to analyze macromolecules such as proteins or RNA in more detail.|$|E

Through the use of standard diagrams based on SBOL-visual (BBF RFC 16) symbols, we hope to facilitate communication about synthetic <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> between research groups. This standard applies the use of the established SBOLv symbols on the Web to clearly represent synthetic constructs.

No CAT activity was detected in protoplasts transfected with the hemimethylated form of pUC 118 CaMVCAT. Transfection of petunia protoplasts with ss <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> bearing the coding and noncoding sequences of the CAT gene also resulted in the appearance of CAT activity, indicating expression of ss <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> in transfected protoplasts.

50|$|Because {{the desired}} type of DNA {{recombination}} {{is a rare}} event {{in the case of}} most cells and most constructs, the foreign sequence chosen for insertion usually includes a reporter. This enables easy selection of cells or individuals in which knockout was successful. Sometimes the <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> inserts into a chromosome without the desired homologous recombination with the target gene. To eliminate such cells, the <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> often contains a second region of DNA that allows such cells to be identified and discarded.|$|E
50|$|Knockout is {{accomplished}} {{through a combination}} of techniques, beginning in the test tube with a plasmid, a bacterial artificial chromosome or other <b>DNA</b> <b>construct,</b> and proceeding to cell culture. Individual cells are genetically transfected with the <b>DNA</b> <b>construct.</b> Often the goal is to create a transgenic animal that has the altered gene. If so, embryonic stem cells are genetically transformed and inserted into early embryos. Resulting animals with the genetic change in their germline cells can then often pass the gene knockout to future generations.|$|E

40|$|Large <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> of {{arbitrary}} sequences can currently {{be assembled}} with relative ease by joining short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (oligonucleotides). The ability to mass produce these synthetic genes readily {{will have a}} significant impact on research in biology and medicine. Presently, high-throughput gene synthesis is unlikely, due to the limits of oligonucleotide synthesis. We describe a microfluidic PicoArray method for the simultaneous synthesis and purification of oligonucleotides that are designed for multiplex gene synthesis. Given the demand for highly pure oligonucleotides in gene synthesis processes, we used a model to improve key reaction steps in DNA synthesis. The oligonucleotides obtained were successfully used in ligation under thermal cycling conditions to generate <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> of several hundreds of base pairs. Protein expression using the gene thus synthesized was demonstrated. We used a DNA assembly strategy, i. e. ligation followed by fusion PCR, and achieved effective assembling of up to 10 kb <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs.</b> These results illustrate the potential of microfluidics-based ultra-fast oligonucleotide parallel synthesis as an enabling tool for modern synthetic biology applications, such as the construction of genome-scale molecular clones and cell-free large scale protein expression...|$|R

Recent {{progress in the}} design and construction of nano-sized structures using DNA has opened a new field of nanotechnology. The unique properties of nano-sized <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> can be exploited to develop programmable materials for efficient delivery of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances in DNA nanotechnology and its applications as delivery systems are summarized. In particular, we focus on the delivery of DNA containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide, or CpG motif, to immune cells expressing Toll-like receptor 9.

40|$|Abstract The Retina {{is a good}} {{model system}} for studies of neural {{development}} and disease because of its simplicity and accessibility. To analyze gene function rapidly and conveniently, we developed an electroporation technique in mice and rats for use in vivo and in vitro. The efficiency of electroporation into the neona-tal retina is quite good, and transgene expression persists {{for more than a}} month. With this technique, various types of <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs,</b> including RNA interference (RNAi) vectors, are readily introduced into the retina without DNA size limitation. In addition, more than two different <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> can be introduced into the retina at once, with very high cotransfection efficiency.

40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (BRSV) is {{a primary}} cause of lower respiratory tract disease in calves.

[...] Gene doping agents could be designed with either polymorphism, or for endurance athletes, some <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> that interfered with expression like a small interfering RNA.|$|E
50|$|To {{introduce}} a reporter gene into an organism, scientists place the reporter gene and the {{gene of interest}} in the same <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> to be inserted into the cell or organism. For bacteria or prokaryotic cells in culture, this is usually {{in the form of a}} circular DNA molecule called a plasmid. It is important to use a reporter gene that is not natively expressed in the cell or organism under study, since the expression of the reporter is being used as a marker for successful uptake of the gene of interest.|$|E

The ability to mass produce synthetic genes holds great potential for biological research, but widespread availability of de novo <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> is currently hampered by their high cost. In this work, we describe a microfluidic platform for parallel solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotides that can greatly {{reduce the cost of}} gene synthesis by reducing reagent consumption (by 100 -fold) while maintaining a ∼ 100 pmol synthesis scale so {{there is no need for}} amplification before assembly.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of exocytosis {{has left the}} molecular details of the process unclear. We present a minimal, artificial secretory cell designed for amperometric studies of release of signalling molecules through the fusion pore of single vesicles. In replacement of SNARE-proteins, the cell model has been equipped with an analog composed of complimentary <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs,</b> one on the vesicle {{and one on the}} target membrane. The <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> hybridize in a zipper-like fashion bringing about docking of the vesicles and following the addition of Ca 2 +, fusion of the vesicles is completed. Exocytotic events recorded from the artificial cell closely approximate exocytosis in live cells. The results together with simulations of vesicular release demonstrate that the lipid-based fusion pore initially retains stability and limits diffusion of the secreted molecules...|$|R
50|$|Unlike small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{therapeutics}} {{that turn}} over within a cell and consequently only silence genes transiently, <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> are continually transcribed, replenishing the cellular ‘dose’ of shRNA, thereby enabling long-term silencing of targeted genes.

Rather than generating transgenic flies with the enhancer linked directly to the gene of interest (which takes about a year, if you are starting without the appropriate <b>DNA</b> <b>construct),</b> you simply mate (cross) one transgenic fly with another transgenic fly.|$|E
50|$|Figure 2 {{illustrates}} {{the most common}} type of ddRNAi <b>DNA</b> <b>construct,</b> which is designed to express a shRNA. This consists of a promoter sequence, driving expression of sense and antisense sequences separated by a loop sequence, followed by a transcriptional terminator. The antisense species processed from the shRNA can bind to the target RNA and specify its degradation. shRNA constructs typically encode sense and antisense sequences of 20 - 30 nucleotides. Flexibility in construct design is possible: for example, the positions of sense and antisense sequences can be reversed, and other modifications and additions can alter intracellular shRNA processing. Moreover, a variety of promoter loop and terminator sequences can be used.|$|E

In this work, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first gene synthesis in a microfluidic environment. The use of microfluidic technology greatly reduces reaction volumes and the corresponding reagent and handling costs. Additionally, microfluidic technology enables large numbers of complex reactions to be performed in parallel. Here, we report the fabrication of a multi-chamber microfluidic device and its use in carrying out the syntheses of several <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs.</b> Genes up to 1 [*]kb in length were synthesized in parallel at minute starting oligonucleotide concentrations (10 – 25 [*]nM) in four 500 [*]nl reactors.

Recently, Tol 2 transposase-mediated transgenesis {{has emerged as a}} powerful tool to insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> into the genome of zebrafish. For efficient transgenesis, the genomic DNA piece in the BAC construct needs to be flanked by Tol 2 transposon sites, and the constructs should contain a transgenesis marker for easy identification of transgenic animals. We report a set of plasmids that contain targeting cassettes that allow the insertion of Tol 2 sites and different transgenesis markers into BACs. Using BACs containing these targeting cassettes, we show that transgenesis is as efficient as iTol 2, that preselecting for expression of the transgenesis marker increases the transgenesis rate, and that BAC transgenics faithfully recapitulate the endogenous gene expression patterns and allow for the estimation of the endogenous gene expression levels...|$|R
