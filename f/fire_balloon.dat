5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II the Japanese <b>fire</b> <b>balloon</b> was {{designed}} as a cheap weapon intended {{to make use of the}} jet stream over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. They were relatively ineffective as weapons, but they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small amount of damage.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{invasion}} of Japan incorporated an Alsos Mission. Japanese <b>fire</b> <b>balloon</b> attacks on the United States had aroused fears that the technique might be used in combination with biological agents, which the Japanese Unit 731 {{was known to be}} experimenting with. In March 1945, the physicist and seismologist L. Don Leet was appointed as head of the scientific section of the Alsos Mission to Japan. Leet had previously worked with the Manhattan Project on the Trinity nuclear test. Plans were drawn up to prepare and equip a T-Force {{along the lines of the}} one in Europe, but made up of personnel already in the Pacific. The mission differed from its European counterpart in that it was solely American and consisted of only one intelligence agency. Responsibility for nuclear matters was subsequently handled by a separate Manhattan Project Intelligence Group organized by Groves.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected {{when there were}} equipment failures. While there were some problems {{believed to be the}} result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage. However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese <b>fire</b> <b>balloon</b> struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down. With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues. By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Tillinghast never {{offered his}} craft for public viewing or inspection, {{and the media}} grew more skeptical, {{explaining}} the sightings were most likely the planet Venus, or <b>fire</b> <b>balloons.</b>|$|R
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's <b>fire</b> <b>balloons.</b> These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these <b>fire</b> <b>balloons</b> out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|R

500|$|On 10 March 1945, a Japanese <b>fire</b> <b>balloon</b> {{struck a}} power line, and the {{resulting}} power surge caused the Manhattan Project's reactors at the Hanford to be temporarily shut down. This generated great concern at Los Alamos that the site might come under attack. One night found everyone staring at a strange light in the sky. Oppenheimer later recalled this demonstrated that [...] "even {{a group of scientists}} is not proof against the errors of suggestion and hysteria".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "balls of fire" [...] {{phenomenon}} {{reported from}} the Pacific Theater of Operations differed somewhat from the foo fighters reported from Europe; the [...] "ball of fire" [...] resembled a large burning sphere which [...] "just {{hung in the}} sky", though it was reported to sometimes follow aircraft. On one occasion, the gunner of a B-29 aircraft hit one with gunfire, causing it to break up into several large pieces that fell on buildings below and set them on fire. There was speculation that the phenomena {{could be related to}} the Japanese <b>fire</b> <b>balloon</b> campaign. As with the European foo fighters, no aircraft were reported as having been attacked by a [...] "ball of fire".|$|E
2500|$|Between November 1944 and April 1945, the Japanese Navy {{launched}} over 9,000 fire balloons toward North America. Carried by {{the recently}} discovered Pacific jet stream, {{they were to}} sail over the Pacific Ocean and land in North America, where the Japanese hoped they would start forest fires and cause other damage. About three hundred were reported as reaching North America, but little damage was caused. Six people (five children and a woman) became the only deaths due to enemy action to occur on mainland United States during World War II {{when one of the}} children tampered with a bomb from a balloon near Bly, Oregon and it exploded. The site is marked by a stone monument at the Mitchell Recreation Area in the Fremont-Winema National Forest. Recently [...] released reports by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian military indicate that fire balloons reached as far inland as Manitoba. A <b>fire</b> <b>balloon</b> is also considered to be a possible cause of the third fire in the Tillamook Burn. One member of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion died while responding to a fire in the Northwest on August 6, 1945; other casualties of the 555th were two fractures and 20 other injuries.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, the Empire of Japan {{experimented with}} <b>fire</b> <b>balloons</b> {{carrying}} bombs that floated across the Pacific to the U.S. One of these bombs dropped and exploded {{in a field}} in Timnath.|$|R
50|$|The E77 balloon {{bomb was}} a U.S. anti-crop {{biological}} munition {{based on the}} design of Japanese <b>fire</b> <b>balloons.</b> The E77 used feathers as a vector to disseminate anti-crop agents from a hydrogen-filled balloon and was first developed in 1950.|$|R
50|$|From late 1944 {{until early}} 1945, the Japanese {{launched}} over 9,300 <b>fire</b> <b>balloons,</b> of which 300 were found or {{observed in the}} U.S. Despite the high hopes of their designers, the balloons were ineffective as weapons: causing only six deaths (from one single incident) and {{a small amount of}} damage.|$|R
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War resulted in major changes for Vancouver. Local militia units quickly recruited extra members and Vancouver's Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, for example, had a battalion overseas in England within 4 months, and they remained in Europe fighting {{until the end of}} the war. The British Columbia Regiment, 15th Field Regiment RCA, 6th Field Engineers, HMCS Discovery and others all contributed to the war effort. Massive new spending by the governments and employment in the military and factories provided a much needed economic boost after the Great Depression of the 1930s. Among the many products and weapons for war service produced in the Vancouver area were minesweepers and corvettes for the Royal Canadian Navy; anti-aircraft guns in Burnaby and the Boeing aircraft factory in nearby Richmond produced parts for B-29 bomber aircraft. The old defences for Vancouver Harbour were upgraded with coast artillery positions at Point Grey (the Museum of Anthropology is built on top of this); Stanley Park; under the Lion's Gate Bridge and at Point Atkinson. In 1942, a few months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Canadians were [...] "evacuated" [...] from the West Coast. The Americans did the same with their citizens of Japanese ancestry. [...] Canadians of Japanese descent were placed into holding areas such as the barns at Hastings Park and then interned in camps in the interior by the federal government which evoked the War Measures Act. Due to the fear of bombing and of poison gas attacks, a blackout was imposed on the West Coast in 1942 and school children and others were issued gas masks. Japan did indeed attack the West Coast. A Japanese submarine shelled Estevan Point Lighthouse, Japanese soldiers invaded and held island in Alaska and Japanese balloon bombs (<b>Fire</b> <b>balloon)</b> were floated across the Pacific Ocean on air currents to wreak their havoc on the forests and citizens of Canada and the USA. Locally these ballon bombs landed as close to Vancouver as Point Roberts, but their existence was kept a secret until very late in the war.|$|E
60|$|Nor, {{so far as}} I can read, has any proper account {{yet been}} given of the balance, in serene air, of the warm air under the cold, in which the warm air is at once {{compressed}} by weight, and expanded by heat, and the cold air is thinned by its elevation, yet contracted by its cold. There is indeed no possibility of embracing the conditions in a single sentence, any more than in a single thought. But the practical balance is effected in calm air, so that its lower strata have no tendency to rise, like the air in a <b>fire</b> <b>balloon,</b> nor its higher strata to fall, unless they congeal into rain or snow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Bishop had {{not lost}} his Eton tastes, and only liked {{to see them}} play games, and the little fat merry-faced lads were always on the {{look-out}} {{for a bit of}} fun with him. One evening a tea-drinking was given in the hall in honour of us. The Mota boys sung in twilight the story of the first arrival of the Mission vessel and of their wonder at it. The air, with a monotonous, not unpleasing refrain, reminded us of some old French Canadian ditties. I remember well the excitement when the Bishop sent up a <b>fire</b> <b>balloon.</b> It sailed slowly towards the sea, and down rushed the whole Melanesian party, shrieking with delight after it. Our dear friend's own quarters were very tiny, and a great contrast to his large airy room at St. John's. He occupied a corner house in the quadrangle, to be close to the boys. Neither bedroom nor sitting-room was more than ten feet square. Everything was orderly, as was his wont. Photographs of the faces and places he loved best hung on the walls. Just by the door was his standing desk, with folios and lexicons. A table, covered with books and papers in divers languages, and a chair or two, completed his stock of furniture. The door stood open all day long in fine weather, and the Bishop was seldom alone. One or other of the boys would steal quietly in and sit down. They {{did not need to be}} amused, nor did they interrupt his work. They were quite content to be near him, and to get now and then a kind word or a pleasant smile. It was the habitual gentle sympathy and friendliness on his part that won the confidence of the wild timid people who had been brought up in an element of mistrust, and which enabled them after a while to come and open their hearts to him.|$|E
5000|$|In Asia and {{elsewhere}} around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, {{to be launched}} for play {{or as part of}} long-established festivities.

60|$|At first I {{had great}} success, for I brought {{with me a}} list of names written down by some member of the Southwark Irish Literary Society, and for six weeks went hither and thither {{appealing}} and persuading. My first conversation was over a butter-tub in some Dublin back street, and the man agreed with me at once; everybody agreed with me; all felt that something must be done, but nobody knew what. Perhaps they did not understand me, perhaps I kept back my full thoughts, perhaps they only seemed to listen; it was enough that I had a plan, and was determined about it. When I went to lecture in a provincial town, a workman's wife, who wrote patriotic stories in some weekly newspaper, invited me to her house, and I found all her children in their Sunday best. She made a little speech, very formal and very simple, in which she said that what she wrote had no merit, but that it paid for her children's schooling; and she finished her speech by telling her children never to forget that they had seen me. One man compared me to Thomas Davis, another said I could organise like Davitt, and I thought to succeed as they did, and as rapidly. I did not examine this applause, nor the true thoughts of those I met, nor the general condition of the country, but I examined myself a great deal, and was puzzled at myself. I knew that I was shy and timid, that I would often leave some business undone, or purchase unmade, because I shrank from facing a strange office or a shop a little grander than usual, and yet, here was I delightedly talking to strange people every day. It was many years before I understood that I had surrendered myself to the chief temptation of the artist, creation without toil. Metrical composition is always very difficult to me, nothing is done upon the first day, not one rhyme is in its place; and when at last the rhymes begin to come, the first rough draft of a six-line stanza takes the whole day. At that time I had not formed a style, and sometimes a six-line stanza would take several days, and not seem finished even then; and I had not learnt, as I have now, to put it all out of my head before night, and so the last night was generally sleepless, and the last day a day of nervous strain. But now I had found the happiness that Shelley found when he tied a pamphlet to a <b>fire</b> <b>balloon.</b>|$|E

50|$|During World War II, the US Office of Censorship sent {{messages}} to newspapers and radio stations, which were acted on by recipients, asking {{them not to}} report any sightings or explosions of <b>fire</b> <b>balloons,</b> so the Japanese would have no information on the balloons' effectiveness when planning future actions. As a result, the Japanese learned the fate of only one of their bombs, which landed in Wyoming, but failed to explode. The Japanese stopped all launches after less than six months. The press blackout in the U.S. was lifted after the first deaths from <b>fire</b> <b>balloons,</b> {{to ensure that the}} public was warned, though public knowledge of the threat could have possibly prevented the deaths. News of the loss of over 4,000 lives when UK ship RMS Lancastria was sunk during the war was voluntarily suppressed to prevent it affecting civilian morale, but was published after it became known overseas.|$|R
50|$|Japan used {{recently}} discovered high-altitude air currents to send <b>fire</b> <b>balloons</b> (or fu-go) carrying explosive payloads to the American mainland.
