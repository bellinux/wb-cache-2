50|$|In cardiac physiology, preload is the {{end diastolic}} volume that {{stretches}} the right or left ventricle of the heart to its greatest dimensions under variable physiologic demand. In other words, it is the <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> of the cardiomyocytes prior to contraction; therefore, it {{is related to the}} sarcomere length at the end of diastole. Parameters such as ventricular end diastolic volume or pressure are used to measure preload since the ideal length of the cardiac sarcomere cannot be measured. Passive filling of the (heart) ventricle and subsequent atrial contraction thus allows an echocardiographically volumetric measurement. Preload is theoretically most accurately described as the <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> of a single cardiomyocyte prior to contraction. This cannot be measured in vivo and therefore other measurements are used as estimates. Estimation may be inaccurate, for example in a chronically dilated ventricle new sarcomeres may have formed in the heart muscle allowing the relaxed ventricle to appear enlarged. The term end-diastolic volume is better suited to the clinic, although not exactly equivalent to the strict definition of preload. Atrial pressure is a surrogate for preload.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the frequency of on-going hamstring stretching required to maintain knee extension ROM following an <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> programme. Study Design: A test-retest randomised control trial with repeated measures was undertaken with 63 university-aged males as participants. Background: Stretching exercises are commonly prescribed during warm-up and cool-down, and within training and rehabilitation programmes with a common aim to improve muscle extensibility and joint range of motion. Previous research has demonstrated that stretching the hamstring muscle group once a day, five days a week for a six-week period improves knee extension range of motion. However, it has been demonstrated that this improvement is short-lived and starts to reduce once the stretching intervention is ceased. To maintain the improvement in range of motion gained following an <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> programme, an on-going stretching programme may be required. There is, however, little research to demonstrate the optimal frequency of on-going stretching required to maintain the range of motion once the initial improvements have been achieved. Method: Participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups and a control group. The two intervention groups both stretched for 30 seconds three times, once per day, five days a week, for an initial six weeks. The intervention was an active knee extension static hamstring stretch in a supine position. After the six-week <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> programme, participants allocated to intervention group one continued stretching with the same stretching routine once a day, three days per week, and participants in intervention group two once a day, for one day per week, for a further six weeks. Participants in the control group did not stretch over the 12 -week intervention period. Knee extension range of movement was assessed by an active knee extension test using an electronic goniometer at baseline, week six and week 12. Results: Following the <b>initial</b> six-week <b>stretching</b> programme there was a significant (p 0. 05) was observed in knee extension range of motion in the control group. Conclusion: The findings of this study were consistent with previous research that has demonstrated a six-week static hamstring stretching programme significantly improves the knee extension range of motion. The on-going hamstring stretching programme with the frequency of three times a week was required to maintain the initial improvement in knee extension ROM for 6 weeks. This finding may be useful to maintain the benefits of stretching exercises with minimal effort, and therefore potentially improve compliance with on-going stretching exercises...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of the <b>initial</b> finite <b>stretching</b> or compressing of the strip containing a single crack on the Energy Release Rate (ERR) and on the SIF of mode II at the crack tips is studied {{by the use of}} the Three-Dimensional Linearized Theory of Elasticity. In the present paper these investigations are developed for a strip made from composite material. It is assumed that the ends of the strip are simply supported and this strip contains a crack whose edges are parallel to the face planes. It is supposed that the strip is stretched or compressed along the crack edges and after this stretching (compressing) the edges of the crack are loaded by additional uniformly distributed tangential (sliding) forces. Corresponding Boundary Value Problems were formulated {{with the use of the}} Three-Dimensional Linearized Theory of Elasticity. All investigations are carried out numerically by employing the FEM. The numerical results on the {{influence of}} the initial stresses on the values of the ERR and of the SIF of mode II are presented. In particular, it is established that the values of the ERR and of the SIF of mode II decrease (increase) monotonically with an increase (decrease) in the <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> (compression) ...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{the stretch}} reflex in decerebrate cats {{indicate}} a phase advance of peak sinusoidal tension in steady-state cycles between 0. 1 and 10 Hz. This phase advance is reduced in acute and chronic cerebellectomy, {{as shown in}} previous investigations. Also, the augmentation of muscle peak tension in <b>initial</b> sinusoidal <b>stretch</b> cycles at 0. 5 - 5 Hz {{has been found to}} be reduced during the time of reflex and motor instability in the several months following cerebellar ablation. This report shows the increased amplitude and phase lead of integrated electromyographic activity in initiating sinusoidal stretch cycles in the decerebrate cat. These reflex aspects are demonstrated in relation to the discharge of neurons in the dorsal spinocerebellar tract and of cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells in initial sinusoidal cycles. The intensity and phase advance of the discharge in dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurons is altered little, but these features are usually increased in Purkinje cells during <b>initial</b> <b>stretches</b> compared to continuous cycling. In terms of overall motor control, these findings are compatible with concepts of movement control, modulated by the cerebellum, in which the discharge of antagonist motor neurons is regulated in concert with that of agonist muscles upon initiation and termination of movement...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen an {{initially}} stretched {{rubber band}} is suddenly released at one end, an axial-stress front propagating at the celerity of sound separates {{a free and}} a stretched domain of the elastic material. As soon as it reaches the clamped end, the front rebounds and a compression front propagates backward. When {{the length of the}} compressed area exceeds Euler critical length, a dynamic buckling instability develops. The rebound is analysed using Saint-Venant's theory of impacts and we use a dynamical extension of the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation to obtain a relation between the buckled wavelength, the <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> and the rubber band thickness. The influence of an external fluid medium is also considered: owing to added mass and viscosity, the instability growth rate decreases. With a high viscosity, the axial-stress front spreads owing to viscous frictional forces during the release phase. As a result, the selected wavelength increases significantly...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of quantum excitations inside macromolecules which can undergo conformational transitions. In {{the first part of}} the paper, we use the path integral formalism to rigorously derive a set of coupled equations of motion which simultaneously describe the molecular and quantum transport dynamics, and obey the fluctuation/dissipation relationship. We also introduce an algorithm which yields the most probable molecular and quantum transport pathways in rare, thermally-activated reactions. In the second part of the paper, we apply this formalism to simulate the propagation of a charge during the collapse of a polymer from an <b>initial</b> <b>stretched</b> conformation to a final globular state. We find that the charge dynamics is quenched when the chain reaches a molten globule state. Using random matrix theory we show that this transition is due to an increase of quantum localization driven by dynamical disorder. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the natural}} {{helicoidal}} nanostructure, which thermomechanical features are studied carefully {{with the help of}} different mechanical models, is a DNA cell / molecule. Our study proves that the experimentally determined nonlinear fluctuations of the molecular length of DNA can be better understood by modeling the molecule as a helicoidal pretwisted nanostrip sensor with nonlinear function. The calculations presented here are in good agreement with the experimental data within 10 %. Other used by many researchers mechanical models such as an elastic rod, wormlike chain (WLC), accordion bellows, or an elastic core wrapped with rigid wires do not show the possible variance nonlinearity of thermomechanical DNA molecular length fluctuations. We have found that the nonlinear variance of the length fluctuations is an intrinsic property of the micro-nano-sensors with helicoidal shape. This model allows us to estimate the persistence length and twist-stretch coupling of a DNA molecule as well. It also shows the molecule's overwinding possibility at <b>initial</b> <b>stretching</b> with correct numerical representation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the water quality in the Tigreiro river, Jacuí river Basin, using different approaches. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in July 2010 (winter) and February 2011 (summer) at five sites. In this study were analyzed: microbiological, physical and chemical variables, benthic macroinvertebrates richness and diversity, rapid ecological assessment protocol and benthic biotic indices (% EPT, BMWP’-IAP, ASPT, SOMI). A total of 5, 852 individuals were collected belonging to 31 taxa of three Phyla: Annelida, Mollusca and Arthropoda. Chironomidae was the most abundant taxon (63. 70 %). A reduction in richness, diversity H’ and evenness J’ was observed from the <b>initial</b> <b>stretches</b> to the end stretches of Tigreiro river. The use of different approaches showed that sites in the rural area were less altered. The Tigreiro river was strongly impacted, mainly due to discharge of domestic effluents in the urban area, and the combination of different metrics was useful to detect impacted sites and the consequence for the water quality. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} {{application}} of a recently developed filament stretching protocol {{for the study of the}} extensional rheology of both treated and untreated carbon nanotubes (CNT) suspended within an epoxy resin. It was experimentally observed that filaments formed by treated and untreated CNT suspensions behaved differently after <b>initial</b> <b>stretching.</b> The filament thinning process of the base epoxy was consistent with a simple Newtonian fluid, whilst the filament of treated CNT suspensions also thinned in a Newtonian way but with an enhanced extensional viscosity. Filaments formed with untreated CNT suspensions behaved in a non-uniform way with local fluctuation in filament diameter, and it was not possible to obtain reliable extensional viscosity data. Irregularity of the untreated CNT filaments was consistent with coupled optical images, where spatial variation in CNT aggregate concentration was observed. In the case of treated CNT suspensions, the enhanced extensional viscosity was modelled in terms of the alignment of CNTs in the stretching direction, and the degree of alignment was subsequently estimated using a simple orientation model...|$|R

40|$|In this work, by {{utilizing}} the nonlinear {{equations of motion}} of an incompressible, isotropic thin elastic tube subjected to a variable <b>initial</b> <b>stretches</b> both in the axial and the radial directions and the approximate equations of motion of an incompressible inviscid fluid, which {{is assumed to be}} a model for blood, we have studied the propagation of nonlinear waves in such a medium under the assumption of long wave approximation. Employing the reductive perturbation method we obtained the variable coefficient forced KdV equation as the evolution equation. By use of proper transformations for the dependent field and independent coordinate variables, we have shown that this evolution equation reduces to the conventional KdV equation, which admits the progressive wave solution. The numerical results reveal that the wave speed is variable in the axial coordinate and it decreases for increasing circumferential stretch (or radius). Such a result seems to be plausible from physical considerations. We further observed that, the wave amplitude gets smaller and smaller with increasing time parameter along the tube axis.
