50|$|The <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> {{model is}} {{unrealistic}} {{in that it}} implies uniform circulation (and hence, according to the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, uniform lift) at all sections on the wingspan. In a more realistic model, the lifting-line theory, the vortex strength varies along the wingspan, and the loss in vortex strength is shed as a vortex sheet all along the trailing edge, {{rather than as a}} single trail at the wing-tips. Nevertheless, the simpler <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> model used with a reduced effective wingspan but same mid-plane circulation provides an adequate model for the flows induced far from the aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} offer a {{broad spectrum}} of magnetization reversal processes and respective magnetic states, such as onion, <b>horseshoe,</b> or <b>vortex</b> states as well as various states including domain walls. These states can be correlated with stable intermediate states at remanence, enabling new quaternary memory devices storing two bits in one particle. The stability of these intermediated states was tested with respect to shape modifications, variations in the anisotropy axes, and rotations and fluctuations of the external magnetic field. In our micromagnetic simulations, 6 different stable intermediate states were observed at vanishing magnetic field in addition to the remanence state. The angular region of approx. 5 °– 12 ° between nanoring and external magnetic field was identified as being most stable with respect to all modifications, with an onion state as technologically best accessible intermediate state to create quaternary memory devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis {{is to increase the}} understanding of fluid flow and heat transfer development across a finned tube heat exchanger with help of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Three different geometries of finned tube bundles are considered. The finned tube bundles are made similar to existing experimental test rigs at NTNU. The purpose is to present a detailed comparison of the experimental data available and the result from a numerical model. Heat transfer and pressure drop performance is compared. The results are also compared with semi-empirical correlations from the published literature. This master thesis is a continuation of the project work. A main goal has been to expand the numerical model developed in the project work to include conjugate heat transfer. This has been successfully implemented by coupling the conduction and convection on the fins. Further a calculation method to predict the heat transfer on a row-to-row basis has been developed. The heat transfer coefficient and the fin efficiency are compared with the experimental data at each tube row for varying turbulent Reynolds numbers. The results shows that the heat transfer is predicted fairly good, but with some deviations. Generally the heat transfer is under-predicted for the two geometries having solid fins. The numerical model over-predicts the heat transfer for the geometry having serrated fins. The pressure drop performance is compared by looking at the pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet in the finned tube bundle. Larger deviations are seen between the numerical and experimental data for the pressure drop performance. Surprisingly, the pressure drop from the numerical model seems to be in better agreement with semi-empirical correlations from the published literature. The effects of uneven heat transfer distribution has been investigated. An uneven heat transfer distribution is first of all reflected in the fin efficiency. Fin efficiencies found from the experiments and fin efficiencies calculated from the numerical model are therefore compared to theoretical fin efficiencies and reputable corrected fin efficiencies from the literature. A qualitative analysis is performed by investigating relevant visualizations of the flow through the finned tube bundle. This analysis revealed several important effects happening in the finned tube bundles, affecting the heat transfer. This include boundary-layer development across the fins, <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortexes</b> at the junction of the fin and tube and flow separation downstream of the finned tube rows. It is concluded that the use of CFD have a big potential for improving the prediction of heat transfer and pressure drop in fin-tube waste heat recovery units. Suggestions for further work on how the numerical model could be expanded are presented...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{phenomena}} {{and the relative}} performance associated with several devices for controlling turbulent separated flow were investigated at low speeds. Vortex-generating devices examined included: submerged vortex generators (Wheeler doublet and wishbone types), spanwise cylinders, large-eddy breakup devices (LEBU) at small angle of attack (alpha), and vortex-generator jets (VGJ). Dye flow visualization tests in a water tunnel indicated that wishbone vortex generators in the forward orientation shed <b>horseshoe</b> vortices; wishbone <b>vortex</b> generators oriented in the reverse direction and doublet vortex generators shed streamwise counterrotating vortices; a spanwise cylinder located near the wall and LEBUs at alpha = - 10 deg produced eddies which rotated with the same sign as the mean vorticity in a turbulent boundary layer; and the most effective VGJs produced streamwise corotating vortices. Comparative wind tunnel tests conducted on a curved backward-facing ramp indicated that transferring momentum from the outer region of a turbulent boundary layer by embedded streamwise vortices {{is more effective than}} by transverse vortices for separation control applications...|$|R

50|$|The term <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> is {{also used}} in wind {{engineering}} to describe the flow pattern created by strong winds {{around the base of}} a tall building. This effect is amplified by the presence of a low-rise building just upwind. This effect was studied at the UK Building Research Establishment between 1963 and 1973 and the cause of the effect is described in contemporary wind engineering text books.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{performance and}} flow phenomena associated with several devices for controlling {{turbulent separated flow}} were investigated at low speeds. Relative performance of the devices was examined for flow over a curved, backward-facing ramp in a wind tunnel, and the flow phenomena were examined in a water tunnel using dye-flow visualization. Surface static pressure measurements and oil-flow visualization results from the wind tunnel tests indicated that transverse grooves, longitudinal grooves, submerged vortex generators, vortex generator jets (VGJ's), Viets' fluidic flappers, elongated arches at positive angle of attack, and large-eddy breakup devices (LEBU's) at positive angle of attack placed near the baseline separation location reduce flow separation and increase pressure recovery. Spanwise cylinders reduce flow separation but decrease pressure recovery downstream. Riblets, passive porous surfaces, swept grooves, Helmholtz resonators, and arches and LEBU's with angle of attack less than or = 0 degrees had no significant effect in reducing {{the extent of the}} separation region. Wall-cooling computations indicated that separation delay on a partially-cooled ramp is nearly the same as on a fully-cooled ramp, while minimizing the frictional drag increase associated with the wall cooling process. Dry-flow visualization tests in the water tunnel indicated that wishbone vortex generators in the forward orientation shed <b>horseshoe</b> vortices; wishbone <b>vortex</b> generators oriented in the reverse direction and doublet vortex generators shed streamwise counterrotating vortices; a spanewise cylinder located near the wall and LEBU's at angle of attack = - 10 degrees produced eddies or transverse vortices which rotated with the same sign as the mean vorticity in a turbulent boundary layer; and the most effective VGJ's produced streamwise co-rotating vortices. Comparative wind-tunnel test results indicated that transferring momentum from the outer region of a turbulent boundary layer through the action of embedded streamwise vortices is more effective than by transverse vortices for the separation control application studied herein...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of round jets in cross-flow was studied using flow visualization techniques and flying-hot-wire measurements. The study {{was restricted to}} jet to freestream velocity ratios ranging from 2. 0 to 6. 0 and Reynolds numbers based on the jet diameter and free-stream velocity {{in the range of}} 440 to 6200. Flow visualization studies, together with time-averaged flying-hot-wire measurements in both vertical and horizontal sectional planes, have allowed the mean topological features of the jet in cross-flow to be identified using critical point theory. These features include the <b>horseshoe</b> (or necklace) <b>vortex</b> system originating just upstream of the jet, a separation region inside the pipe upstream of the pipe exit, the roll-up of the jet shear layer which initiates the counter-rotating vortex pair and the separation of the flat-wall boundary layer leading to the formation of the wake vortex system beneath the downstream side of the jet. The topology of the vortex ring roll-up of the jet shear layer was studied in detail using phase-averaged flying-hot-wire measurements of the velocity field when the roll-up was forced. From these data it is possible to examine the evolution of the shear layer topology. These results are supported by the flow visualization studies which also aid in their interpretation. The study also shows that, for velocity ratios ranging from 4. 0 to 6. 0, the unsteady upright vortices in the wake may form by different mechanisms, depending on the Reynolds number. It is found that at high Reynolds numbers, the upright vortex orientation in the wake may change intermittently from one configuration of vortex street to another. Three mechanisms are proposed to explain these observations. R. M. Kelsot, T. T. Lims And A. E. Perr...|$|R
40|$|A wind-energy {{extraction}} {{method is}} examined, which exploits flutter of piezoelectric harvesters {{immersed in a}} wind flow. The harvesters nominally consisted of compliant piezoelectric patches coupled via a revolute hinge to a polymeric, triangular &ldquo;leaf&rdquo;, which might be incorporated en-masse into a &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. Several questions remained unanswered about the potential of such a device due to {{the complexities of the}} aero-structural-electrical physics coupling involved, aerodynamic proximity effects, and the lack of studies performed with these harvesters in turbulent (outdoor) flows. A parametric study was conducted in smooth, parallel flow at representative wind speeds, to examine the effect of changing the leaf geometry on the output-power characteristics of a single harvester. Increasing the leaf area past a certain size caused chaotic flutter of the harvester and inconsistent power output, because of the combined effects of increasing system length and width, tending the system to instability. Changing the leaf aspect ratio did not affect the flutter regime of the harvester for the wind speed testing range, showing that leaf area distribution does not affect flutter regime in a significant way for average wind speeds. Larger aspect ratios caused delayed flutter cut-in due to the increased stability of the system through the lower width &ndash; demonstrating that width of the immersed harvester had a greater effect on the stability rather than length. Delayed flutter cut-in for larger aspect ratios was also due to the larger inertia of the leaf about the hinge, requiring greater start-up energy from the flow. The performance of a single harvester was also evaluated over a range of different wind directions and flow speeds, and also in aspects of replicated ABL turbulence. It was found that the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) turbulence generally reduced harvester power output compared to smooth-flow conditions for parallel flow. Off-axis flow was generally detrimental to power output in smooth and turbulent flow, due to harvester flutter deviating from Limit-Cycle Oscillations (LCOs), but turbulent flow provided a marginal advantage over smooth flow due to the energy of fluctuations in the inertial subrange exciting higher-order modes of the harvester. Aerodynamic proximity effects were also examined for two harvesters in tandem using dual-camera smoke-flow visualisation, synchronised with voltage data acquisition from the harvesters. This permitted observation of detached flow structures from the leading harvester, which acted to amplify the output power of the trailing harvester at certain tandem spacings. There were two salient flow structures identified: a <b>horseshoe</b> cone <b>vortex</b> that tilted above and beneath the smoke-generation plane, and a Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) that was present on the suction side of the harvester flutter cycle. The horseshoe vortices increased the trailing harvester power output by elevating the PVDF patch tip velocity by inducing a pressure gradient towards the vortex core, increasing output voltage. The LEVs did not influence the trailing harvester in a significant way...|$|R
50|$|The <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> {{model is}} a {{simplified}} representation of the vortex system of a wing. In this model the wing vorticity is modelled by a bound vortex of constant circulation, travelling with the wing, and two trailing wingtip vortices, therefore having a shape vaguely reminiscent of a horseshoe. A starting vortex is shed as the wing begins {{to move through the}} fluid, which dissipates under the action of viscosity, as do the trailing vortices far behind the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{distribution}} of bound vorticity and the vorticity in the wake, the Biot-Savart law (a vector-calculus relation) {{can be used to}} calculate the velocity perturbation anywhere in the field, caused by the lift on the wing. Approximate theories for the lift distribution and lift-induced drag of three-dimensional wings are based on such analysis applied to the wing's <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system. [...] In these theories, the bound vorticity is usually idealized and assumed to reside at the camber surface inside the wing.|$|E

5000|$|Instead of {{only one}} <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> per wing, as in the lifting line theory, the VLM {{utilizes}} a lattice of horseshoe vortices, as described by Falkner in his first paper on this subject in 1943. The number of vortices used vary with the required pressure distribution resolution, and with required accuracy in the computed aerodynamic coefficients. A typical number of vortices would be around 100 for an entire aircraft wing; an Aeronautical Research Council report by Falkner published in 1949 mentions {{the use of an}} [...] "84-vortex lattice before the standardisation of the 126-lattice" [...] (p. 4).|$|E
50|$|Hairpin {{vortices}} {{resemble the}} <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex,</b> which exists because of perturbations of small upward motion due {{to differences in}} upward flowing velocities depending on the distance from the wall. These form multiple packets of hairpin vortices, where hairpin packets of different sizes could generate new vortices to add to the packet. Specifically, close to the surface, the tail ends of hairpin vortices could gradually converge resulting in provoked eruptions, producing new hairpin vortices. Hence, such eruptions are a regenerative process, in which they act to create vortices near the surface and eject them out onto the outer regions of the turbulent wall. Based on the eruptive properties, such flows can be inferred to be very efficient at heat transfer because of mixing. Specifically, eruptions carry hot fluids up while cooler flows are brought downwards during the converging of tails of the hairpin vortices before erupting.|$|E

40|$|The <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> {{system is}} a series of {{vortices}} which develop at the junction between an endwall and a bluff body during impinging flow. Pin-fin arrays are an internal cooling feature where bluff-bodies are arranged in an array to act as turbulators and increase heat transfer to a cooling fluid. The present study examines how the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system evolves at pin-fins of different row positions in a low aspect ratio pin-fin array. Time-resolved stereo particle image velocimetry was employed in the stagnation plane of pin-fins in rows 1, 3, and 5 for a Reynolds number, based on pin-fin diameter, of 2. 0 e 4.

In the upstream {{side of the}} cylinder, the adverse pressure gradient originates separation of the down-flow {{in front of this}} and near its base. The separated flow is organised in a system of vortexes dominated by a <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex.</b> Herein, the turbulent separated flow dominated by the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> in front of the cylinder is characterized in several locations along a developing turbulent boundary layer using instantaneous velocity fields obtained with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The flow in a scour hole, namely the downflow, the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system and the separation vortex are characterized. Mean velocities, Reynolds stresses, vorticity and streamlines of the flow field are discussed. It is shown that the intensity of the equivalent <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex,</b> defined as the vortex calculated for the mean velocity field, does not change considerably with Reynolds number based on the boundary layer thickness. Previously unreported results concerning the maximum size of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> are presented and discussed.

40|$|Highly porous {{materials}} {{are found in}} various industrial applications and environmental flows. In previous studies {{it was found that}} a turbulent flow along a highly porous wall experiences a higher skin friction as compared to a solid wall with similar surface roughness when the so-called permeability Reynolds number (Re_K) is larger than O(1). The main objective {{of the present study was}} to gain understanding of the characteristic structures and auto-generation mechanisms of turbulence for Re_K >> 1. To this purpose the Volume-Averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations were solved in a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a turbulent flow through a plane channel with an upper solid wall and a lower porous wall at Re_K = 5. 91. The DNS results are in good agreement with available Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data for the same flow geometry. A linear stochastic estimation technique was used to capture the structure associated with the characteristic ejection event that contributes most to the Reynolds shear stress near the porous wall. This structure is similar to a <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex.</b> Contrary to the conventional hairpin vortex found near solid walls, this <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> has a significantly higher inclination angle with the wall and its legs are much shorter. The latter is consistent with the observed absence of low and high-speed streaks near highly permeable walls. Next, the auto-generation mechanisms of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> were studied in another DNS in which the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> was released in the Reynolds-averaged flow field obtained from the former DNS. Two distinct auto-generation mechanisms were observed: (1) the generation of new structures at the upstream end of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex,</b> which evolve rapidly into a turbulent spot with an arrowhead shape, and (2) the interaction of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> with spanwise oriented Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex rollers originating from the inflexion point in the mean velocity profile near the porous wall...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies characterising {{horseshoe}} vortices upstream of circular cylinders in open channels {{have focused}} on changes in the Reynolds number. This study investigates {{the effect of the}} Froude number and other flow and geometrical parameters {{on the nature of the}} <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system that develops in front of a circular cylinder. The results show <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> dynamics dominated by cylinder diameter, Froude number and flow depth. Instantaneous vorticity fields were classified into either two or three groups of vortex formations based on their turbulence stress magnitudes with a high dependence shown upon the Froude number and cylinder diameter. The peak stress properties of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system was found to be controlled within a certain threshold of Froude numbers (Fr ≤ 0. 3 and Fr ≥ 1. 7). It was also found that a single point under the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> can represent the vortices better than the whole field that encompasses the whole system. The characteristics of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> formed upstream of a wall-mounted circular cylinder in an open channel were studied using two dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry. Experiments were conducted for different flow conditions and focused on Froude numbers, cylinder diameters, flow depths and bulk flow velocities. Two groups of experiments were conducted. The rest consisted of twenty five experiments with a wide range of Froude numbers, including sub-critical, critical and super-critical flow conditions. This group was analysed as a whole and then the lower sub-critical experiments followed by the upper sub-critical to super-critical experiments. Another set of nine sub-critical experiments were conducted focusing on the experimental design to segregate flow and geometrical parameters. Quadrant analysis was used to analyse the contribution of near-bed turbulent stresses in the region upstream of the cylinder. Applying multivariate statistical techniques, the relationship between geometrical parameters, flow conditions and the changes in the location and magnitude of the turbulent stresses under the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> were examined. This study, introduces the Froude number as a new governing parameter of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system, which can be important for fluvial systems with change of hydraulics regimes as mountainous rivers...|$|E
40|$|Together {{with the}} {{previous}} work [12] the present paper pro-vides an important picture of the flow field associated with the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex.</b> We wish to comment on two points dis-cussed in the paper: firstly the existence of one main vortex without {{the presence of a}} multivortex structure, and secondly the new flow field which is proposed close to the centerline. In a paper to be presented in the near future [13], the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> present at both ends of a cylinder placed across fully developed turbulent flow in a two-dimensional channel is ex-amined. Surface flow visualization indicated only one main <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> and a small corner vortex at the wall-cylinder junction. No multivortex system was apparent and in this sense the observations are in keeping with the results reported in the present paper. On the second point, it would appear that heat transfer measurements on the end wall [13] could not be explained by the proposed flow field close to the centerline. The heat transfer coefficient reduced with radial distance from the cylinder, except for a small peak close to the "heart " of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex,</b> in all angular direc-tions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation {{on the characteristics}} of a <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system near the juncture of a square cylinder and a horizontal base plate, using particle image velocimetry and flow visualization technique. Experiments were conducted for Reynolds numbers (based on the free stream velocity and the width of square cylinder) ranging from 2. 0 X 10 (2) to 6. 0 X 10 (3). The flow patterns are first classified into four major regimes: Steady <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system, periodic oscillation vortex system with small displacement, periodic breakaway vortex system, and irregular vortex system. The classifications can be demonstrated as a figure of Reynolds number versus the ratio of the height of square cylinder to undisturbed boundary layer thickness. The study then mainly focused {{on the characteristics of}} steady <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system (corresponding to Reynolds numbers ranging from 2. 0 X 10 (2) to 2. 5 X 10 (3)). The nondimensional characteristics, including the horizontal and vertical distances from the primary vortex core to frontal face of the vertical square cylinder and bottom boundary of the base plate, respectively, the height of stagnation point at frontal face of the square cylinder, and the down-flow discharge as well as circulation of the primary vortex, all increase with increase of the ratio of the height of square cylinder to undisturbed boundary layer thickness. However, they all decrease with the increase of the aspect ratio (i. e., the height-to-width ratio) of the square cylinder. The study provides essential properties of a steady <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> system and gives an insight for related engineering applications.

The combination of PIV and LDV not only gives the spatial distribution and time history of velocity near the juncture for spatial and time domain analyses, it also allows phase averaging the PIV velocity data to reduce noise and, in a turbulent flow, result in turbulence statistics. A flow visualization technique displaying particle streaklines has also been used to help the classification of the vortex system and visualize the flow motion and vortex evolution. The classification of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> was briefly categorized as steady, periodical oscillatory, and turbulence-like chaotic vortex systems through the use of the flow visualization technique and time-domain spectral analysis.

Since the computational area changes at step (3), this procedure has to be repeated at each time step. Results show that the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> scoops out {{the ground in front of}} the pole.

The vortex is believed to contribute to the degradation of the half model aerodynamic performance. An attempt was made to reduce the aerodynamics losses by modifying the junction <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> through the use of localized suction just upstream of the model leading edge. Wind tunnel tests on a rectangular and untwisted, wing only, modified LS(1) - 0413 half model were conducted at Reynolds numbers of 0. 44 x 10 (6), 0. 88 x 10 (6) and 1 x 10 (6). Without suction the force and moment balance measurements of the half model showed the anticipated deviation from full model values, e. g. lower lift curve slope and higher drag values. Effects of localized suction were limited to Reynolds number of 0. 44 x 10 (6) and improvements were seen only near stall angles of attack. Flow visualization for the no suction case showed that a <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> did not exist over much of the incidence range for this particular model and hence there was little room for suction to effect junction flow.

The range of the Reynolds number (Re), based upon the free stream velocity (U□) and the width of vertical plate (W), is from 200 to 1200. Some {{characteristics of}} the steady horseshoe-vortex structure, including down-flow profiles and the circulation of primary vortex, are quantified and discussed in detail in this study. 本研究係利用先進之質點影像測速儀（PIV），配合定水頭染液注入及懸浮微粒追 蹤可視化法，於層流邊界層為來流條件下，針對低雷諾數（Re＝ 200 1200 ）、且邊界層厚 度相對較大的情形下（H╱δ< 2 ）之直立平板的穩態馬蹄型渦流流場加以研究，並分析 各項參數（雷諾數Re、無因次化之直立平板高度H╱δ、直立平板高寬比（H╱W）對於渦 流流場的影響。在渦流特性的定量研究分析方面，發現：直立平板前緣端之下降流與主渦 環流量等渦流特性，在考慮高寬比、以邊界層厚度作為無因次化之長度尺度的情形下，皆 與H╱δ呈現線性或對數變化的關係，此外，各特性彼此間亦存在著強烈的相關性...|$|E
40|$|The <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> {{is given}} in Oseen flow as a {{constant}} spanwise distribution of lift Oseenlets. From this, the vortex line is represented in steady, incompressible Oseen flow. The velocity near to the vortex line is determined, as well as near to and far from the far field wake. The velocity field in the transverse plane near to the vortex line is shown to approximate to the two-dimensional Lamb–Oseen vortex, and the velocity field in the streamwise direction is generated by the bound vortex line of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> giving a streamwise decay much faster {{than that of the}} Batchelor vortex. The far field wake description is shown to be consistent with laminar wake theory...|$|E
40|$|The nozzle exit flowfield was {{measured}} at two axial locations with a miniature five-hole probe. Measurements {{were taken from}} hub-to-tip, blade-to-blade at 21 radial locations and at two axial locations downstream of the nozzle trailing edge to resolve the flowfield accurately including the nozzle wake, secondary flow region, <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> and losses. All three components of the velocity, stagnation pressure, static pressure, and pitch and yaw angles have been resolved very accurately. The wake data {{seems to indicate that}} the decay of the wake is faster than the wake of an isolated nozzle row. The cause of this is attributed to the presence of the rotor downstream. A distinct vortex core has been observed near the tip. The indications are that the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> and the passage vortex have merged to produce a single loss core region. Roughly a third of the blade height passage near the tip and a third of the blade height near the hub is dominated by secondary flow, passage vortex and the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> phenomena. Only the middle third of the nozzle behaves as per design. These and other data are presented, interpreted and synthesized to understand the nozzle flowfield...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of experimental and theoretical investigations of the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> systems caused by boundary layer separation upstream of obstacles mounted on a wall. Flow visualization enabled these vortex systems to be described in detail for both laminar and turbulent flow upstream of the obstacles, for flow velocities between 0. 3 ms- 1 and 25 ms- 1. Pressure distributions on the wall beneath such systems are presented and the variation of the vortex and separation positions upstream of various obstacles is described in detail. A complex unsteady behaviour of laminar <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> systems is described, and the frequency spectra of turbulent vortex systems are presented. For laminar vortex systems a theoretical study of the equations of motion has been made and the distributions of vortex circumferential velocity and pressure within the vortex cores have been derived, plausible assumptions having been made for the vertex radial velocity distribution. Some measurements have been made of the flow velocity within laminar <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> systems using smoke flow visualization techniques. The scour around obstacles mounted in a bed of sand beneath a water flow, caused by such <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vortex</b> systems, is also studied. A dimensional analysis has been carried out to determine what dimensionless combinations of the flow variables might influence the scour depth. Small scale experiments were carried out to determine how the scour depth varied with these dimensionless groups. The results of these experiments are compared with the results of previous investigations and the way the scour depth varies with these dimensionless groups has been clearly shown. A theoretical analyisis of one aspect of the phenomenon of scour around obstacles is also presented...|$|E
