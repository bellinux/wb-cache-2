5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A <b>handguard,</b> made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
25|$|The ARM {{light machine}} gun variant is {{additionally}} equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden <b>handguard.</b> The wooden <b>handguard</b> remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear <b>handguard</b> ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, {{can be used to}} open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose which damaged them.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} rifle version {{which is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic <b>handguard</b> and pistol grip, a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular metal skeleton stock as fitted to all variants except the Galil Sniper.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: KeyMod and M-LOK <b>handguards</b> {{from various}} manufacturers. The tops of these <b>handguards</b> feature Picatinny rails. These <b>handguards</b> {{were used in}} a KeyMod™ vs. M-LOK™ Modular Rail System {{comparison}} in 2017 by the US Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division ...|$|R
25|$|Rifles {{manufactured}} through late 1960 {{were provided}} with walnut <b>handguards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M-LOK {{system can}} be seen as a further {{development}} of the Magpul MOE slot, but the two are not compatible. Newer M-LOK accessories can be used on older MOE slotted <b>handguards</b> if an adapter plate is used, however there is no adapter available for using older MOE slotted accessories on newer M-LOK <b>handguards.</b>|$|R
25|$|The FAMAS Infantry is an {{improvement}} of the FAMAS F1, obtained by retrofiting an accessory rail onto {{the top of the}} <b>handguard.</b> This allows mounting combat optics, most notably reflex sights or the 4× magnification SCROME J4 scope.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic <b>handguard</b> and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel {{skeleton}} stock. The rifle {{can be used with}} a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front <b>handguard</b> and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E
25|$|The Gas-Block, <b>handguard</b> {{retainers}} and folding-stock mechanism {{components are}} cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, trigger guard, dust cover (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.|$|E
50|$|Master FLG K short barreled {{version with}} finger slip {{vertical}} forward grip <b>handguards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{stocks and}} <b>handguards</b> on M14Ks are {{shortened}} {{versions of the}} GI birch or walnut stock, but {{make use of the}} original front ferrule. The front sling mount is relocated slightly to rear, to accommodate the shortened stock. Most <b>handguards</b> are of the solid, fiberglass variety (albeit shortened), but a limited number were made with shortened wood <b>handguards.</b> The steel buttplate was deleted in favor of a rubber recoil pad, which greatly reduces perceived recoil. A limited number of M14Ks were manufactured with the BM-59 Alpine / Para folding stock. These too had the shortened stocks and <b>handguards,</b> making for an extremely compact package especially suited to vehicular and airborne operations. A couple of M14Ks were built for SEAL Team members using the tubular folding stock assembly on a cut-down M14E2 stock found on some of the Team's full-size M14s prior to adoption of the Sage International EBR stock for M14 applications. These are by far one of the rarest variants of the M14K.|$|R
50|$|Daewoo K1A/K1C Carbine/SMG, {{issued to}} tank/helicopter/vehicle crews, some elite-units use K1As with {{aftermarket}} <b>handguards,</b> rail-systems and sights.|$|R
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} large number of lightweight, {{corrosion-resistant}} synthetic materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire control selector and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, <b>handguard</b> and carry handle are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver.|$|E
25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the return mechanism and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry handle with integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, <b>handguard</b> and magazine socket.|$|E
25|$|The kusarigama {{also has}} {{non-lethal}} kata designed to trap and apprehend a swordsman, partially {{by using the}} long chain as a restraint. A famous user of the kusarigama outside of Shintō Musō-ryū was Shishido Baiken, {{who was killed in}} a duel with the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. During kata practice a safer, all-wooden version (except the metal <b>handguard)</b> is used with softer materials replacing the chain and weight. For demonstrations (embu) a kusarigama with a metal blade is sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Triumph {{introduced}} {{a special edition}} version that includes ABS brakes, the two-box pannier kit and <b>handguards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Protective {{hardware}} such as {{brake and}} clutch <b>handguards</b> for protection against branches and leaves i.e. [...] "bark busters" ...|$|R
5000|$|It uses {{either a}} [...] "bird cage" [...] flash suppressor, or a flash hider (designed for Special Forces). The design also {{incorporates}} an upward-curved charging handle, a wire side-folding stock (based on the East German design, but offset {{slightly to the}} left), and a traditional vertical handgrip. The md. 86 use laminated wood lower <b>handguards,</b> and Bakelite pistol grips and upper <b>handguards.</b> None of the components have had any polymer versions.|$|R
25|$|The Tantal {{features}} a metal wire side-folding stock (folds {{to the right}} side), ended with a profiled shoulder pad. The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic buttstock designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both {{the upper and lower}} <b>handguard</b> and pistol grip are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the Tantal.|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the <b>handguard).</b> The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is produced using a cold hammer forging process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. The barrel assembly consists of the gas block, a collar with a bayonet lug that {{is also used to}} launch rifle grenades and a slotted flash suppressor.|$|E
25|$|The rifle's front <b>handguard</b> is of a ribbed design, {{with heat}} {{ventilation}} holes. This design improves barrel cooling in situations when sustained fire is performed. The SS2's barrels were originally produced in Germany before Pindad switched to South Korean-made barrels due to arms embargo {{problems at the}} time. The charging handle {{is on the right}} side of the SS2 with the fire/safety selector on the left side with provision for single and full auto fire alongside safe mode. Upper and lower receivers are made from aluminum alloy and are connected via cross pins.|$|E

25|$|The Squad Designated Marksman Rifle (SDMR) is a mid-length carbine {{similar in}} {{configuration}} to the SEAL Recon Rifle. It features a railed upper receiver, a mid-length gas system, a Daniel Defense 16-inch cold-hammer forged barrel, a Daniel Defense free-floating railed <b>handguard,</b> a 4x32 Trijicon Advanced Combat Optic, a Magpul STR buttstock, a Hogue grip containing a cleaning kit and a cerakote finish. An initial batch of forty (40) units of this more compact squad designated marksman rifle variant were {{turned over to}} selected AFP Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the Scout Rangers for testing and evaluation.|$|E
25|$|G36A2: This is an {{ordnance}} designation {{allocated to}} an upgraded {{variant of the}} G36 used by the German Army. The G36A2 {{is equipped with a}} quick-detachable Zeiss RSA reflex red dot sight mounted on a Picatinny rail that replaces the original red dot sight of the dual combat sighting system. The G36A2 upgrade kit also consists of the shorter G36C stock (Designed for better handling with use of body armor and load bearing equipment), new <b>handguard</b> made of aluminium (provides better heat resistance during long periods of firing) with an optional 4 Picatinny rails and a vertical foregrip with an integrated switch for operating an Oerlikon Contraves LLM01 laser light module.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} {{modified}} with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds {{to the right}} side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the <b>handguard</b> when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6×40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the initial}} {{deployment}} in Iraq, JSDF elements {{that had the}} possibility of seeing combat (for example the Western Army Infantry Regiment) were issued a removable foregrip and a 25 mm Weaver rail was installed under the front <b>handguards</b> of their Type 89s to accommodate it. Shortly afterwards, the restriction was lifted and all units began to receive foregrips despite common complaints about damage to the <b>handguards</b> that were caused by the mount.|$|R
50|$|Combat divers {{also use}} a version with {{straight}} <b>handguards,</b> as the forward grip {{is considered to be}} cumbersome for amphibious operations.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a variant}} with quad-rail <b>handguards</b> and {{telescopic}} CAA CBS-style buttstock and sometimes with extended quad-rail and cut carry handle.|$|R
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower <b>handguard.</b> The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E
25|$|One of the Bizon's {{more unusual}} {{features}} is the magazine, {{which is often}} mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel {{is in fact a}} 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide and mounts under the <b>handguard</b> in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production magazine capacity of 64 was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the front sight, and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the trigger guard. Some magazines were produced with indicator holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.|$|E
500|$|The Winchester Model 1200 was {{introduced}} in 1964 as a low-cost replacement for the venerable Model 12. A small number of these weapons were acquired by the United States Army in 1968 and 1969. [...] The military style Model 1200 was essentially the same weapon as the civilian version, except it had a ventilated <b>handguard,</b> sling swivels, and a bayonet lug. The Model 1200 was succeeded by the Winchester Model 1300 in 1983 when U.S. Repeating Arms Company became the manufacturer of Winchester firearms. Production of the Model 1300 ceased in 2006, when USRAC went bankrupt.|$|E
5000|$|The M16A2 weighs 8.8 lb {{loaded with}} a 30-round magazine, {{because of the}} {{adoption}} of a thicker barrel profile. The thicker barrel is more resistant to damage when handled roughly and is also slower to overheat during sustained fire. Unlike a traditional [...] "bull" [...] barrel that is thick its entire length, the M16A2's barrel is only thick forward of the <b>handguards.</b> The barrel profile under the <b>handguards</b> remained the same as the M16A1 for compatibility with the M203 grenade launcher.|$|R
50|$|The SAF is a blowback-operated select-fire gun, firing from {{a closed}} bolt. It {{is based on}} the Swiss SIG SG 540 assault rifle which was {{produced}} under license in Chile in the 1980s. In general the design is a shortened version of the SIG 540 rifle, but the rifle's rotating bolt has been replaced with a simple blowback bolt. The SAF also has a bolt hold-open catch that engages after the final shot. Otherwise, the receiver, stock, fore-end, trigger/hammer assembly and floating firing pin design are from the SIG 540. The upper and lower receiver, as well as the trigger guard are steel, pistol grip and <b>Handguards</b> are all made from polymer. The ambidextrous safety/fire selector switch, as well as the interchangeability with SIG 552/553 <b>handguards,</b> is a feature found on the latest versions. Older versions used own <b>handguards.</b>|$|R
50|$|It can be {{distinguished}} from other AR-15 and M-16 pattern rifles by its long, revolver-like pistol grip, somewhat rounded <b>handguards,</b> and the unique shape of its stock.|$|R
