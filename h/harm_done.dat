5|$|One {{strategy}} for reducing <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet {{sold in the}} UK which combined 500mg paracetamol with 100mg methionine, an amino acid formerly used {{in the treatment of}} paracetamol overdose.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E

25|$|The {{laws were}} a civil {{rather than a}} {{criminal}} code, concerned with the payment of compensation for <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> and the regulation of property, inheritance and contracts; the concept of state-administered punishment for crime was foreign to Ireland's early jurists.

25|$|No {{scholars}} {{dispute the}} <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> to the enslaved people {{but the effect}} of the trade on African societies is much debated, due to the apparent influx of goods to Africans. Proponents of the slave trade, such as Archibald Dalzel, argued that African societies were robust and not much affected by the trade. In the 19th century, European abolitionists, most prominently Dr. David Livingstone, took the opposite view, arguing that the fragile local economy and societies were being severely harmed by the trade.|$|E

Kuhn, a onetime star litigator, considered arguing the case himself, but ultimately deferred to Paul Porter and Louis Hoynes. At oral arguments on March 20, 1972, Goldberg reiterated Flood's arguments about the <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> to players by the reserve system. Baseball's lawyers responded to them, but primarily invoked the game's place in American culture and the greater good done it by the reserve system.|$|E

25|$|The return {{fire from}} Fort Clark was ineffectual, either falling short or passing overhead, and no hits {{were made on}} the bombarding ships. Shortly after noon, the {{defenders}} ran low on ammunition, and about 12:25p.m. they ran out completely. At this point, they abandoned the fort, some fleeing to Fort Hatteras, while others took to boats. Col. Max Weber, commanding the Federal troops already on shore, noted this and put some men in to take possession, but the fleet did not know this and continued firing for another five minutes. It was during this interval of confusion that the landing force suffered its only casualty, {{one of the soldiers}} being seriously wounded in the hand by a shell fragment. Fortunately, some of the troops were able {{to get the attention of}} the gunners on the ships by waving a large American flag, and the bombardment stopped with no further <b>harm</b> <b>done.</b> Stringham and his captains then turned their attention to Fort Hatteras.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the U.S. federal {{government}} took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended {{ideas of the}} Consumers' Bill of Rights with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken {{in an effort to}} ensure the quality of care of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry. Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many interest groups, including the American Medical Association (AMA) and Big Pharma came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of health insurance status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill. As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass Congress in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Vanity Fair was {{the latest}} {{magazine}} under fire for allegedly altering {{the appearance of a}} celebrity featured in its pages for its February issue. The celebrities under speculation were Lupita Nyong’o, an actress from 12 Years A Slave, who had her photo lightened during publication, and Lena Dunham, an actress from the HBO series Girls. For Lupita’s case, the magazine tweeted the photo and it began with fans accusing the company of altering her complexion. However some believe that the Vanity Fair images are simply a product of bright set lighting, rather than deliberate skin lightening. The magazine still took some heat and guilt from the whole ordeal. Lupita herself was pleased with the work, and saw no <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> to herself or to hold Vanity Fair or the photographer liable of anything. In weeks prior to Lupita's case, Vogue magazine, a partner and buyer of Vanity Fair in 1936, was accused of altering Lena Dunham's photos. Dunham considered the modified photos to be offensive. Jezebel, then offered up $10,000 to see unretouched version of the spread. The proposal was then refused by the actress.|$|E

40|$|In five multi-method studies this {{dissertation}} {{examined how}} context based morality may explain increased incidence of combat related psychological difficulties among US service personnel. We were {{particularly interested in}} the relationship between causing harm to others and moral self-perceptions and related emotional consequences. In studies 1 and 2 we found that our samples of Iraq and Afghan war veterans reported that a soldier would feel increased levels of guilt and shame and negative moral judgments of the self when they return home and reflect on incidents of harm that may have occurred during their deployments. These two studies were supported by three short experiments showing that different moral judgments of harm were made depending on whether the <b>harm</b> <b>doing</b> was interpersonal or intergroup. Interpersonal <b>harm</b> <b>doing</b> was judged more harshly than intergroup harm leading us to believe that while in combat <b>harm</b> <b>doing</b> had minimal consequences on the self-perceptions and emotions of a soldier and that when they returned home to civilian life where interpersonal moral standards are more prevalent their self-perceptions and emotional wellbeing was affected by their prior conduct. ...|$|R

[...] "Formal cooperation" [...] {{in abortion}} extends not just to the mother who freely submits, but also to the doctor, nurses and anyone who directly aids in the act. The Church has ministries of reconciliation, such as Project Rachel, for those who sincerely repent of their sin of formal cooperation in abortion.|$|E
500|$|Witch {{trials in}} early modern Scotland were the {{judicial}} proceedings in Scotland between the early sixteenth {{century and the}} mid-eighteenth century concerned with crimes of witchcraft. In the late middle age there were a handful of prosecutions for <b>harm</b> <b>done</b> through witchcraft, but {{the passing of the}} Witchcraft Act 1563 made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. The first major series of trials under the new act were the North Berwick witch trials, beginning in 1589, in which King James VI played a major part as [...] "victim" [...] and investigator. He became interested in witchcraft and published a defence of witch-hunting in the Daemonologie in 1597, but he appears to have become increasingly sceptical and eventually took steps to limit prosecutions.|$|E

In 1925, Aigler defended intercollegiate athletics against charges that they had a negative effect on institutions of higher learning.

[...] "The greatest vice in American college life today is loafing", said Aigler. [...] "There is no doubt that this far overshadows the harm created by intercollegiate athletics. No one would be more pleased than I to see a Phi Beta Kappa (honorary scholarship society) man receive as much recognition by the public as do our leading athletes. But such a condition would be contrary to human nature. Intellectual attainments do not make such an appeal, and that is why athletics are so prominent in colleges and universities today." ...|$|E
