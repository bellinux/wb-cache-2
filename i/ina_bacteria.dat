40|$|A {{replica plating}} method for rapid quantitation of ice nucleation-active (<b>INA)</b> <b>bacteria</b> was developed. Leaf {{washings}} of plant samples from California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, and Wisconsin were {{tested for the}} presence of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Of the 95 plant species sampled, 74 were found to harbor <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Only the conifers were, as a group, unlikely to harbor <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria.</b> All of the <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> isolated resembled either Pseudomonas syringae or Erwinia herbicola. Sufficient numbers of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> were present on the samples to account for the ice nuclei associated with leaves that are necessary for freezing injury to occur.

40|$|Ice {{nucleation}} active (<b>INA)</b> <b>bacteria</b> is a {{group of}} bacteria with the ability to catalyze the ice formation at temperature above - 10 °C and causing frost injury in plants. Since, most of the literature on <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> were from subtropical area, studies of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> from tropical area are needed. We sampled eight fruits and 36 leaves of 21 plant species, and then identified through biochemical and genetic analysis. <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> were characterized for INA protein classification, pH stability, and optimization of heat endurance. We discovered 15 <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> from seven plants species. Most of bacteria are oxidase and H 2 S negative, catalase and citrate positive, gram negative, and cocoid formed. These <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> were classified in to three classes based on their freezing temperature. Most of the isolates were active in heat and pH stability assay. Some isolates were analysed for 16 S rRNA gene. We observed that isolates from Morinda citrifolia shared 97 % similiarity with Pseudomonas sp.

40|$|Ice {{nucleation}} {{temperatures of}} individual leaves {{were determined by}} a tube nucleation test. With this assay, a direct quantitative relationship was obtained between the temperatures at which ice nucleation occurred on individual oat (Avena sativa L.) leaves and the population sizes of ice nucleation active (<b>INA)</b> <b>bacteria</b> present on those leaves. In the absence of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria,</b> nucleation of supercooled growth-chamber grown oat leaves did not occur until temperatures were below approximately − 5 °C. Both nucleation temperature and population size of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> were determined on the same individual, field-grown oat leaves. Leaves with higher ice nucleation temperatures harbored larger populations of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> than did leaves with lower nucleation temperatures. Log 10 mean populations of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> per leaf were 5. 14 and 3. 51 for leaves with nucleation temperatures of − 2. 5 °C and − 3. 0 °C, respectively. Nucleation frequencies (the ratio of ice nuclei to viable cells) of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> on leaves were lognormally distributed. Strains from two very different collections of Pseudomonas syringae and one of Erwinia herbicola were cultured on nutrient glycerol agar and tested for nucleation frequency at − 5 °C. Nucleation frequencies of these bacterial strains were also lognormally distributed {{within each of the}} three sets. The tube nucleation test was used to determine the frequency with which individual leaves in an oat canopy harbored large populations of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> throughout the growing season.

40|$|Chemical and {{biological}} {{properties of the}} ice nucleating sites of Pseudomonas syringae, strain C- 9, and Erwinia herbicola have been characterized. The ice nucleating activity (<b>INA)</b> for both <b>bacteria</b> was unchanged in buffers ranging from pH 5. 0 to 9. 2, suggesting {{that there were no}} essential groups for which a change in charge in this range was critical. The <b>INA</b> of both <b>bacteria</b> was also unaffected by the addition of metal chelating compounds. Borate compounds and certain lectins markedly inhibited the INA of both types of bacterial cells. Butyl borate was not an inhibitor, but borate, phenyl borate, and m-nitrophenyl borate were, in order, increasingly potent inhibitors. These compounds have a similar order of affinity for cis hydroxyls, particularly for those found on sugars. Lentil lectin and fava bean lectin, which have binding sites for mannose or glucose, inhibited the <b>INA</b> of both <b>bacteria.</b> All other lectins examined had no effect. The inhibition of INA by these two types of reagents indicate that sugar-like groups are at or near the ice nucleating site. Sulfhydryl reagents were potent inhibitors of the <b>INA</b> of both <b>bacteria.</b> When treated with N-ethylmaleimide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, or iodoacetamide, the INA was irreversibly inhibited by 99 %. The kinetics of inactivation with N-ethylmaleimide suggested that E. herbicola cells have at least two separate ice nucleating sites, whereas P. syringae cells have possibly four or more separate sites. The effect of infection with a virulent phage (Erh 1) on the INA of E. herbicola was examined. After multiple infection of a bacterial culture the INA was unchanged until 40 to 45 min, which was midway through the 95 -min latent period. At that time, the INA activity began falling and 99 % of the INA was lost by 55 min after infection, well before any cells had lysed. This decrease in INA before lysis is attributed to phage-induced changes in the cell wall...|$|R

In this study, the growth kinetics and ice nucleation activity (<b>INA)</b> of the <b>bacterium</b> P. syringae cit 7 were investigated under {{a variety of}} culture conditions as well as in batch and continuous bioreactors. The 2 ̆ 2 drop freezing assay 2 ̆ 2 technique used for measurement of INA was first investigated and the effect of several variables on this assay was examined.

The INA expressed by the bacteria was independent of cooling rate at cooling rates less than 0. 2 dollar∘dollarC/min. Cell growth at temperatures exceeding 25 dollar∘dollarC led to a decrease in INA expression of cells. Similarly, cell growth at pH of 8. 0 also decreased the <b>INA</b> of the <b>bacteria.</b> Microaerophylic conditions during cell growth also decreased INA in the P. syringae cit 7 bacteria. In a 1 L bioreactor, the optimum cell growth temperature P. syringae cit 7 was found to be 28 dollar∘dollarC. INA of the cells developed in the lag as well as log phase of growth. The maximum INA in the bioreactor was obtained {{at the end of the}} exponential phase of growth at each temperature investigated. In the bioreactor growth at temperatures greater than 25 dollar∘dollarC led to a significant decrease in INA. Batch cell growth kinetics in the 15 L bioreactor followed a similar trend to the 1 L bioreactor.;Under continuous cultivation in a 1 L bioreactor at 25 dollar∘dollarC, and pH 7. 0, the INA of P. syringae decreased with an increase in dilution rate. A maximum specific growth rate of 0. 08 hdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar, and a Kdollarlcub srcubdollar of 0. 21 g/L were obtained under these conditions. Under continuous conditions, cell productivity reached a maximum at a dilution rate of 0. 054 hdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar and then continuously decreased. A mechanistic, unstructured model describing the batch growth kinetics in the 1 L bioreactor was found to adequately represent the growth and INA in the bioreactor. The results of this investigation can be applied towards large scale production of P. syringae bacteria for snow making applications...|$|R

This thesis investigates the connection between bacterial infection and frost as a possible cause for such damage, and {{the role played by}} internal and external factors (e. g. plant frost sensitivity, fertilisation) in the dieback observed. Bacterial floras isolated from ten Salix clones growing on fertilised/unfertilised mineral soil or nitrogen-rich organic soil, were studied. Culturable bacterial communities present both in internal necrotic tissues and on the plant surface (i. e. epiphytes) were isolated on two occasions (spring and autumn). The strains were biochemically characterised (with gram, oxidase and fluorescence tests), and tested for ice nucleation-activity. Their pathogenic properties were studied with and without association to a freezing stress. Certain strains were eventually identified with BIOLOG plates and 16 S rRNA analysis.

These INA populations ranged from less than 10 to over 106 CFU/g (fresh weight) of blossoms and, in Hood River Valley orchards, generally comprised over 10 % of the total bacterial population. Populations of <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> fluctuated during the year with highest levels developing on buds and flowers during the cool, wet spring, followed by a drop in populations during the warmer, drier, summer months and finally a gradual increase in the autumn.

The INA P. syringae strains from individual orchards were diverse with respect to bacteriocin typing and in ice nucleation frequency. The consistent absence of detectable <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> or presence of low populations in most of the orchards surveyed during periods when critical temperatures (i. e., − 2 to − 5 °C) were common indicated a limited role for <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> in frost susceptibility of most Pacific Northwest orchards...|$|E

However, {{little is known about}} the concentration of Ice(+) bacteria in precipitation, their genetic and phenotypic diversity, and their relationship to air mass trajectories and precipitation chemistry. In this study, 23 precipitation events were collected over 15 months in Virginia, USA.

In this study, two additional <b>INA</b> <b>bacteria</b> strains were isolated from the palial fluid of Geukensia demissa: Psychrobacter sp. and Shewanella sp. The ice-nucleation activity of both strains was characterized and Psychrobacter was found to consistently induce nucleation at temperatures 1 - 3 °C higher than Shewanella. Based on 16 S rRNA sequencing, neither of these bacteria have yet been identified. The effects of Psychrobacter on the freeze tolerance of summer-acclimatized Geukensia were assessed and compared to the freeze tolerance of winter-acclimatized specimens. This assessment was accomplished through whole-organism death experiments involving 12 -hour periods of exposure to sub-zero temperatures and cell viability tests using a LIVE/DEAD sperm viability kit (Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene, OR).

They differ in a number of morphological features, mainly in habit and leaf trichome. The bacterial colonization of their leaves is highly variable. Over all species and sampling dates, observed values ranged from non-detectable to a maximum of 1. 4 × 107 CFU g− 1 in C. nepeta. The average size of the microbial community varied among species by a factor of about 10, from 1. 3 × 104 CFU g− 1 in A. unedo and L. stoechas to 1. 3 × 105 CFU g− 1 in M. officinalis and C. nepeta. Within species variability was far larger than that among species or among seasons. Apart from the fact that low values were recorded in summer, the marked seasonality of the Mediterranean climate was not reflected in the phyllosphere bacterial populations. Essential-oil producing species were not less colonized than the others.

40|$|An aerosol-cloud {{modeling}} {{framework is}} described {{to simulate the}} activation of ice particles and droplets by biological aerosol particles, such as airborne ice-nucleation active (<b>INA)</b> <b>bacteria.</b> It includes the empirical parameterisation of heterogeneous ice nucleation and a semi-prognostic aerosol component, which have been incorporated into a cloud-system resolving model (CSRM) with double-moment bulk microphysics. The formation of cloud liquid by soluble material coated on these partially insoluble organic aerosols is represented. It determines their partial removal from deep convective clouds by accretion onto precipitation in the cloud model. This "aerosol-cloud model" is validated for diverse cases of deep convection with contrasting aerosol conditions, against satellite, ground-based and aircraft observations. Simulations are performed with the aerosol-cloud model for a month-long period of summertime convective activity over Oklahoma. It includes three cases of continental deep convection simulated previously by Phillips and Donner (2006). Elevated concentrations of insoluble organic aerosol, boosted {{by a factor of}} 100 beyond their usual values for this continental region, are found to influence significantly the following quantities: (1) the average numbers and sizes of ice crystals and droplets in the clouds; (2) the horizontal cloud coverage in the free troposphere; (3) precipitation at the ground; and (4) incident solar insolation at the surface. This factor of 100 is plausible for natural fluctuations of the concentration of insoluble organic aerosol, in view of variability of cell concentrations for airborne bacteria seen by Lindemann et al. (1982). In nature, such boosting of the insoluble organic aerosol loading could arise from enhanced emissions of biological aerosol particles from a land surface. Surface wetness and solar insolation at the ground are meteorological quantities known to influence rates of growth of certain biological particles (e. g. bacteria). Their rates of emission into the atmosphere must depend on these same quantities, in addition to surface wind speed, turbulence and convection.

40|$|Utilising the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS), the {{immersion}} freezing behaviour of droplet ensembles containing monodisperse particles, generated from a Snomax™ solution/suspension, was investigated. Thereto ice fractions were {{measured in the}} temperature range between − 5 °C to − 38 °C. Snomax™ is an industrial product applied for artificial snow production and contains Pseudomonas syringae} bacteria which have long been used as model organism for atmospheric relevant ice nucleation active (<b>INA)</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The ice nucleation activity of such bacteria is controlled by INA protein complexes in their outer membrane. In our experiments, ice fractions increased steeply in the temperature range from about − 6 °C to about − 10 °C and then levelled off at ice fractions smaller than one. The plateau implies that not all examined droplets contained an INA protein complex. Assuming the INA protein complexes to be Poisson distributed over the investigated droplet populations, we developed the CHESS model (stoCHastic modEl of similar and poiSSon distributed ice nuclei) which allows for the calculation of ice fractions as function of temperature and time for a given nucleation rate. Matching calculated and measured ice fractions, we determined and parameterised the nucleation rate of INA protein complexes exhibiting class III ice nucleation behaviour. Utilising the CHESS model, together with the determined nucleation rate, we compared predictions from the model to experimental data from the literature and found good agreement. We found that (a) the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate expression quantifying the ice nucleation behaviour of the INA protein complex is capable of describing the ice nucleation behaviour observed in various experiments for both, Snomax™ and P. syringae bacteria, (b) the ice nucleation rate, and its temperature dependence, {{seem to be very}} similar regardless of whether the INA protein complexes inducing ice nucleation are attached to the outer membrane of intact bacteria or membrane fragments, (c) the temperature range in which heterogeneous droplet freezing occurs, and the fraction of droplets being able to freeze, both depend on the actual number of INA protein complexes present in the droplet ensemble, and (d) possible artifacts suspected to occur in connection with the drop freezing method, i. e., the method frequently used by biologist for quantifying ice nucleation behaviour, are of minor importance, at least for substances such as P. syringae, which induce freezing at comparably high temperatures. The last statement implies that for single ice nucleation entities such as INA protein complexes, it is the number of entities present in the droplet population, and the entities' nucleation rate, which control the freezing behaviour of the droplet population. Quantities such as ice active surface site density are not suitable in this context.
