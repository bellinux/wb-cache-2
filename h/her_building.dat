5|$|Argus {{was laid}} down in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in Dalmuir, as the Conte Rosso. She was renamed after her {{purchase}} in September 1916 and was launched on 2 December 1917, <b>her</b> <b>building</b> having been slowed by labour shortages. The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918. Formally named after Argus of the 100 Eyes from Greek mythology, Argus was nicknamed the Hat Box or the Flatiron due to her flat-topped appearance.|$|E

In {{exchange for a}} 60 percent subsidy of <b>her</b> <b>building</b> costs by the Navy Ministry, she {{was designed to be}} converted to an auxiliary aircraft carrier, one of 10 such ships subsidized by the IJN.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that <b>her</b> <b>building</b> had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts turrets and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
5|$|Marseillois {{was ordered}} on 16 January 1762, {{to be built}} in Toulon on a design by the {{engineer}} Coulomb, and named the same day by Louis XV, following the request of her patrons. The chamber of commerce of Marseille further requested that the ship be built in Marseille, but Coulomb determined that the harbour there was too shallow for the launch of a 74-gun ship, and the order for Marseillois was eventually confirmed at Toulon. There, lack of timber in the shipyards, that were already busy building Languedoc, Zélé and Bourgogne, delayed the construction of Marseillois until 1764. <b>Her</b> <b>building</b> was directed by the engineer Chapelle.|$|E

5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed <b>her</b> <b>building</b> would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E

25|$|Justice Blackmun, {{joined by}} Justice Brennan and Justice White, wrote a dissent arguing against an {{automatic}} rule {{to determine whether}} there is a taking, and objected to drawing an artificial distinction between temporary and permanent physical presence. Instead, there should be a multi-factor balancing test that considers: (1) whether the State has interfered in some minimal way with the use of space on <b>her</b> <b>building</b> and (2) the extent of the State's interference, and whether it is so severe as to constitute a compensable taking.|$|E

25|$|Helena (Stephanie Leonidas) {{works with}} her parents (Gina McKee and Rob Brydon) at their family circus, but desires to run away and join real life. At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors {{determine}} that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves <b>her</b> <b>building</b> to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area {{and two of the}} performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine (Jason Barry), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows.|$|E
500|$|Sevastopol (...) {{was built}} by Shipyard No. 200, 61 Communards in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 5 November 1939 and {{estimated}} as 11.6% complete on 22 June 1941. She was captured by the Germans when they occupied Nikolayev in late 1941, but the Germans did little with her other than {{to use some of}} her material for defensive positions and some was apparently shipped to Germany. Before the Germans evacuated the city they damaged <b>her</b> <b>building</b> slip and hull with explosives and made her a constructive total loss.

Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, she was laid down on 1 June 1937 and {{launched}} 9 April 1940. She was originally to have been named Beatty but this was changed to Howe, after Admiral Richard Howe. [...] Howe was completed on 29 August 1942 after <b>her</b> <b>building</b> time was extended, as needed war supplies were diverted to work of a higher priority such as the construction and repair of both merchant ships and escort ships. Like her sister-ship Anson, Howe spent most of her career in the Arctic providing cover for Russian convoys.|$|E

500|$|Kronshtadt (...) {{was built}} by the Shipyard No. 194, Marti in Leningrad. She was laid down 30 November 1939 and judged 10.6% {{complete}} when the Germans invaded. <b>Her</b> <b>building</b> slip was too short for her entire length so her stern was built separately. Some of her material was used during the Siege of Leningrad to repair other ships and in defensive works, but {{she could have been}} finished {{after the end of the}} war. Proposals were made to complete her as an aircraft carrier and as a base ship for a whaling flotilla, but both ideas were rejected and she was ordered scrapped on 24 March 1947. Her dismantling began shortly afterwards and was completed the following year.|$|E

500|$|Howe {{joined the}} Home Fleet on 30 August 1942, <b>her</b> <b>building</b> time extended, owing to more urgent {{demands of the}} industry. Like her sister ship Anson, she spent {{the early years of}} her combat career in Arctic waters, {{covering}} convoys bound for Russia. On 31 December 1942, Howe and her sister ship [...] provided distant cover for convoy RA.51, which safely arrived in Loch Ewe on 9 January 1943. Howe and King George V also provided distant cover for convoy RA.53 on 1 March 1943 and helped to recover merchantmen whose ships had been sunk. In 1943 [...] Howe was transferred to Gibraltar with King George V to take part in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily; the US battleships Alabama and South Dakota substituted for their absence from the Home Fleet. The two British ships shelled Trapani naval base and Favignana during 11–12 July. Based in Algiers, the pair also offered cover during Operation Avalanche-the Allied landings at Salerno-setting out on 7 September.
