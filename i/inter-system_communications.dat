We have {{developed}} NetPay, a micro-payment protocol characterized by off-line processing, customer anonymity and relatively high performance and security using one-way hashing functions for encryption. In our NetPay prototypes we have designed and implemented {{two kinds of}} NetPay vendor systems which use thin-client user interfaces, a component-based server-side infrastructure and CORBA remote objects for <b>inter-system</b> <b>communications.</b> We describe three alternative ways to integrate NetPay interface facilities into these existing E-Journal web applications. We describe the relative strengths and weaknesses with each approach and our experiences building prototypes of them. Key words: Electronic commerce; Micro-payment; System integration...|$|E
40|$|Many {{software}} {{systems are}} evolving complex system of systems (SoS) for which inter-system communication is mission-critical. Evidence indicates that transmission failures and performance {{issues are not}} uncommon occurrences. In a NASA-supported Software Assurance Research Program (SARP) project, we are researching a new approach addressing such problems. In this paper, we are presenting an approach for analyzing <b>inter-system</b> <b>communications</b> with the goal to uncover both transmission errors and performance problems. Our approach consists of a visualization and an evaluation component. While the visualization of the observed communication aims to facilitate understanding, the evaluation component automatically checks the conformance of an observed communication (actual) to a desired one (planned). The actual and the planned are represented as sequence diagrams. The evaluation algorithm checks the conformance of the actual to the planned diagram. We have applied our approach to the communication of aerospace systems and were successful in detecting and resolving even subtle and long existing transmission problems...|$|E
40|$|This video shows a brief {{overview}} over Neptus, a command and control infrastructure for heterogeneous teams of autonomous vehicles. Having different,types of vehicles at our laboratory and from our partners, there was an increasing {{need to create a}} common infrastructure to all these systems. Additionally, a tool to support the entire mission life cycle (Planning, Execution, Review and Dissemination) was lacking. Neptus was created to provide vehicle independence and seamless <b>inter-systems</b> <b>communications.</b> Currently, Neptus has been already tested with Remotely Operated Vehicles, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Autonomous Surface Vehicles and Wireless Sensor Networks. Some of these systems were operated simultaneously by various operating consoles that were sharing the same communication infrastructure. The received data was being relayed to a web server that allowed for the real-time mission following by using a common web browser...|$|R
40|$|CAS/ß is a Computer Algebra System graphic user {{interface}} designed to be highly portable and extensible. It has been developed by composition of pre-existing software tools such as Maple, Sisyphe, or Ulysse systems, ZicVis 3 -D plotting library, etc, using control integration technology {{and a set of}} high level graphic toolkits to build the formula editor and the dialog manager. The main aim of CAS/ß is to allow a wide range of runtime reconfigurations and extensions. For instance, it is possible to add new tools to a running system, to modify connections between working tools, to extend the set of graphic symbols managed by the formula editor, to design new high level editing commands based on the syntax or semantics of mathematical formulas, to customize and extend the menu-button based {{user interface}}, etc. More generally, CAS/ß can be seen equally as a powerful system-independent {{graphic user interface}} enabling <b>inter-systems</b> <b>communications,</b> a toolkit to allow fast development of custo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents and}} discusses new design techniques for mixed analog-digital circuits with emphases on low power and small area for standard low-cost CMOS VLSI technology. The application {{domain of the}} devised techniques is radio frequency identification (RFID) systems, however the presented techniques are applicable to wide range of mixed mode analog-digital applications. Hence the techniques herein apply {{to a range of}} smart wireless or mobile systems. The integration of both analog and digital circuits on a single substrate has many benefits such as reducing the system power, increasing the system reliability, reducing the system size and providing high <b>inter-system</b> <b>communications</b> speed - hence, a cost effective system implementation with increased performance. On the other hand, some difficulties arise from the fact that standard low-cost CMOS technologies are tuned toward maximising digital circuit performance and increasing transistor density per unit area. Usually these technologies have a wide spread in transistor parameters that require new design techniques that provide circuit characteristics based on relative transistor parameters rather than on the absolute value of these parameters. This research has identified new design techniques for mostly analog and some digital circuits for implementation in standard CMOS technologies with design parameters dependent on the relative values of process parameters, resulting in technology independent circuit design techniques. The techniques presented and discussed in this dissertation are (i) applied to the design of low-voltage and low-power controlled gain amplifiers, (ii) digital trimming techniques for operational amplifiers, (iii) low-power and low-voltage Schmitt trigger circuits, (iv) very low frequency to medium frequency low power oscillators, (v) low power Gray code counters, (vi) analog circuits utilising the neuron MOS transistor, (vii) high value floating resistors, and (viii) low power application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are particularly needed in radio frequency identification systems. The new techniques are analysed, simulated and verified experimentally via five chips fabricated through the MOSIS service. Thesis (Ph. D.)
