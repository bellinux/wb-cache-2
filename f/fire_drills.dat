5|$|Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Hellmuth Heye {{was given}} {{command of the}} ship at her {{commissioning}}. After her commissioning in April 1939, Admiral Hipper steamed into the Baltic Sea to conduct training maneuvers. The ship also made port calls to various Baltic ports, including cities in Estonia and Sweden. In August, the ship conducted live <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> in the Baltic. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the ship was still conducting gunnery trials. She was briefly used to patrol the Baltic, {{but she did not}} see combat, and was quickly returned to training exercises. In November 1939, the ship returned to the Blohm & Voss dockyard for modifications; these included the replacement of the straight stem with a clipper bow and the installation of the funnel cap.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} {{likewise}} {{unprepared for the}} emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock {{for a few minutes}} before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but Titanics passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, Charles Joughin, and his staff to do so. No lifeboat or <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> had been conducted since Titanic left Southampton. A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>drill</b> {{is one of}} {{the steps}} taken to {{mitigate}} the risk trapped in a building during outbreak of fire. Hence, it is very important for every building to practice <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> especially high-rise building. Referring to Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia(BOMBA), high-rise building had a higher risk compared to other type of buildings. However, there might be problems arise to practice <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> especially in high-rise building. This research intends to study on <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> procedure and identify any possible common problems arises when practicing <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> in high-rise building in Kuala Lumpur. Information was gained through regulations and guidelines associated with <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> procedure and also parties involved in the practice. Besides, a survey is done for awareness of occupants in high-rise building on <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> practice. For the case study, three high-rise building are selected in Kuala Lumpur based on specific criteria. Analysis for this research comprises of comparative and descriptive approach as well as statistical analysis which are documented based on case studies and questionnaire survey. The findings indicates that there is no standardized procedure in <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> while the most common problems that can be seen in practicing <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> are lack of commitment among occupants, lack of information on <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> and output on weaknesses after <b>fire</b> <b>drill</b> been practiced...|$|R

2500|$|Eight {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury after the disaster: the captain; two inspectors; and the president, secretary, treasurer, and {{commodore}} of the Knickerbocker Steamship Company.

[...] The jury could not reach a verdict on the other two counts of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.
