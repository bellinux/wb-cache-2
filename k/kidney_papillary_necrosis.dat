40|$|The kidney {{is one of}} {{the major}} routes of {{excretion}} of drugs and metabolites, and given its high blood flow and metabolic activity, it is highly susceptible to injury by toxic drugs and herbs. In addition, high concentrations of toxic metabolites are in close contact with tubular cells due to urine concentration, especially during a state of fluid deprivation. The incidence of nephrotoxicity related to alternative medicines is not known. However, regarding the large number of individuals consuming herbs as alternative remedies and regarding the lack of control of over-the- counter products, clinicians should consider alternative medicine consumption in the differential diagnosis of unexplained kidney injury. This chapter will describe the major forms of renal involvement associated with the use of traditional medicinal products, including acute kidney injury, tubular function defects, electrolyte disturbances, systemic hypertension, chronic <b>kidney</b> disease, renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis,</b> lithiasis, and urothelial cancer. The most famous example of kidney injury caused by herbal products is aristolochic acid nephropathy, which was first reported in 1993; it eventually involved hundreds of cases of chronic kidney disease and urothelial cancer in Europe and Asia, and raised global public health concerns. In addition, the so-called “Balkan endemic nephropathy” is obviously due to wheat contamination with the seeds of Aristolochia clematitis naturally growing in the fields, leading to chronic kidney failure and urothelial cancers. In addition to aristolochic acids included in Aristolochia species, several nephrotoxic herbs have also been written up in case reports and article reviews and are described in terms of their specific nephrotoxic pathways. Finally, besides these mechanistic aspects, we will review and compare various methods proposed to assess the renal toxicity of herbs and natural products, i. e. in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches. Further developments in “omics” investigation would be helpful for screening potential subjects at risk of developing kidney injuries. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|From about 1950, {{doctors in}} Switzerland were {{becoming}} {{aware that the}} pattern of renal disease was changing. In 1953, Spühler and Zollinger described 44 cases of chronic interstitial nephritis [1]. <b>Papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was observed in 22 cases, and {{it was noted that}} many of the patients had taken antibiotics and/or an analgesic containing phenacetin. Subsequently, it became clear that a pathologic entity of chronic interstitial nephritis with <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was associated with long-standing abuse of analgesics [2, 3]. Spühler and Zollinger's necropsy cases had bilateral contracted kidneys with surfaces presenting extensive areas of atrophy with some intervening nodular areas. Although the <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was thought to be ischemic in origin. Gloor [4], as early as 1960, pointed to some special features of this lesion and suggested that papillary changes preceded the chronic interstitial nephritis. Reported from Switzerland were many cases, commonly linked with the consumption of a mixture of phenacetin, caffeine, isopropyl-antipyrine, and pyrithildion. It then became apparent that this form of kidney disease, which was associated with the phenacetin in the mixtures taken, was common in Scandinavia [5], where a popular mixture contained phenacetin, caffeine, and phenazone (antipyrine) [6], In 1957, Schourup made a clear distinction between the classical acute type of <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis,</b> seen with diabetes or obstruction and infection, and the new chronic and insidious form associated with analgesic abuse [7]. With the exception of Gloor, European pathologists tended to believe that the <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> resulted from compression of vasa recta in the outer medulla, as an expression of a cortical and outer medullary inflammatory process. It was recognized, however, that urinary tract infection, though common, was often a late development or might not occur at all [8]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{nephrotoxicity}} of diphenylamine, {{the parent}} compound of the mefenamate family of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was evaluated in male Syrian hamsters, male Sprague-Dawley rats, and male Mongolian gerbils.

Total renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was also observed in five of ten and four of ten male Syrian hamsters intraperitoneally treated with diphenylamine at respective doses of 600 mg/kg body weight/day and 800 mg/kg body weight/day. Focal intermediate renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was induced in two hamsters orally given diphenylamine at 600 mg/kg body weight/day and in two of ten hamsters intraperitoneally given diphenylamine at 800 mg/kg body weight/day. Apex-limited necrosis of the medullary interstitial cells and vasa recta and degeneration of the renal interstitial matrix occurred in two Sprague-Dawley rats orally administered diphenylamine at 800 mg/kg body weight/day.

Histologically, renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> (RPN) appears as coagulative necrosis, characterized by a pale centre with surrounding inflammatory cells [11]. Symptoms of RPN most commonly include fevers, chills, flank pain, and hematuria. Sloughed papillae can cause ureteral obstruction and hydronephrosis, further worsening renal function. The platinum based agents, cisplatin and nedaplatin, are associated with RPN [12].
