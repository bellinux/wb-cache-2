50|$|It {{has been}} used to treat chronic {{psoriasis}} vulgaris and non-infected acute eczematous dermatoses (eczema). One study demonstrated that 0.05% <b>halometasone</b> cream was more effective than 0.05% betamethasone cream in treating dermatitis, though both were well-tolerated with no systemic adverse effects reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Halometasone</b> is {{a potent}} (Group III) {{synthetic}} tri-halogenated corticosteroid for topical application possessing pronounced anti-inflammatory, antiexudative, antiepidermoplastic, antiallergic, and antipruritic properties. It has been approved in many European countries including Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal and other countries such as China, Hong Kong, Turkey, Israel, South Africa and India.|$|E
50|$|Actinic {{granuloma}} is an asymptomatic granulomatous {{reaction that}} affects sun-exposed skin, most commonly on the face, neck, and scalp. It {{is characterized by}} annular or polycyclic lesions that slowly expand centrifugally and have an erythematous elevated edge and a hypopigmented, atrophic center. Advise to reduce exposure to the sun and to use sunscreen. Treatment with topical <b>halometasone</b> cream, pimecrolimus cream.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy and safety of <b>halometasone</b> cream to treat chronic generalized eczema and the effects of <b>halometasone</b> cream on serum cortisol (COR) levels. Sixty consecutive outpatients diagnosed with chronic generalized eczema between January and April 2017 were included and divided into groups A, B, and C with a lesion area of 30 %– 40 %, 41 %– 50 %, and 51 %– 60 %, respectively. Groups A, B, and C were treated with <b>halometasone</b> cream with a daily dose of 15 [*]g, 20 [*]g, and 30 [*]g for 7 – 14 days, respectively. Ten patients were randomly selected from each group for serum COR measurement at days 0, 7, and 14. On day 14, group B had significantly higher cure rate (47. 1 %) than groups A (17. 9 %) and C (13. 3 %) and significantly higher effectiveness rate (82. 4 %) than group C (40. 0 %) (all P< 0. 05). Serum COR levels were not affected in group A but were reduced significantly in groups B and C on days 7 and 14 (all P< 0. 05). No adverse reaction was observed. <b>Halometasone</b> cream appeared to relieve chronic generalized eczema effectively and safely. High dosage (≥ 20 [*]g daily for 14 days) may temporarily reduce endogenous COR production substantially, although it may be more effective...|$|E
40|$|Background: Topical steroids {{remain the}} {{mainstay}} of treatment in eczema, an inflammatory skin reaction characterized by pruritus, redness, scaling, and clustered oozing papulovesicles. <b>Halometasone</b> is a new potent corticosteroid approved in the Indian market for topical application {{in the treatment of}} dermatitis. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>halometasone</b> in the treatment of acute or chronic noninfected eczematous dermatosis in Indian population. Materials and Methods: A prospective, open, multicentric, phase 3, noncomparative clinical trial conducted at outpatient departments of seven centres. Two hundred endogenous eczema patients meeting study criteria were enrolled. <b>Halometasone</b> 0. 05 % cream was applied twice daily for 30 days in chronic and 20 days in acute eczema patients. Calculation of eczema area and severity index, and assessment of investigator′s global assessment of severity of eczema and severity of pruritus score were done at each visit and compared with baseline. All adverse events (AE) were captured and documented. Laboratory investigations including haematological tests, urinalysis, renal and liver function tests were performed at baseline and at end of treatment. Results: Of the 200 patients enrolled, 180 were chronic and 20 were acute eczema patients. It was found that there was a significant (P< 0. 001) improvement in all efficacy parameters compared with baseline. The treatment was shown to be successful in 91 % patients. AE were reported in 30 patients and there was no serious AE reported. There was no clinically significant difference in laboratory investigations with treatment. Conclusions: <b>Halometasone</b> was shown to be safe and very effective in Indian patients with acute and chronic eczema and the drug was well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|The human {{blanching}} assay {{was used}} to assess the potency of two new proprietary corticosteroid creams. The blanching abilities of 0. 1 % desonide cream and 0. 05 % <b>halometasone</b> cream were evaluated relative to the blanching elicited by 0. 05 % clobetasol 17 -propionate cream, 0. 1 % betamethasone 17 -valerate cream and 0. 05 % clobetasone 17 -butyrate cream. The results of the trial indicated that the 0. 1 % desonide cream falls into the potent group of topical corticosteroid preparations and the 0. 05 % halomethasone cream falls into the moderately potent group...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} fixed drug combination (FDC) <b>halometasone</b> 0. 05 % and fusidic acid 2 % (group A) vs FDC betamethasone 0. 12 % and neomycin sulfate 0. 5 % cream (group B) in acute or chronic infected eczematous dermatosis, through a randomized open-label, comparative, multicentric study. Materials and Methods: A total of 152 patients were randomized to either Group A or Group B. EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), IGA (Investigator′s global assessment), scale for severity of eczema, pruritus, and safety parameters were assessed at baseline, Day 5 /Day 10, Day 10 / 20, and Day 20 /Day 30 for acute/chronic cases. Skin swabs were tested at screening, Day 10, {{and end of the}} study. Results: Staphylococcus aureus was the frequently encountered causative agent. There was a significant reduction within the study groups in EASI, IGA scales for severity of eczema, pruritus at various visits, compared to baseline. At the end of study, 83. 87 % in group A and 65. 71 % in group B were culture negative. Cure rate was 54. 28 % and 50 % in group A and B, respectively. Five adverse events were reported in five patients, of which three patients withdrew from the study. Conclusion: <b>Halometasone</b> 0. 05 % and Fusidic acid 2 % cream is effective, safe, well tolerated with comparable efficacy to the comparator in the treatment of acute and chronic infected eczematous dermatosis...|$|E
