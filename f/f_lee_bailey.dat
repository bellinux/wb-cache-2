50|$|Ito {{presided over}} the 1995 murder trial of O.J. Simpson, at which Simpson was acquitted. His {{decision}} to allow television coverage of the trial was controversial, and Ito faced criticism for seeming to enjoy the press and for allowing too many sidebars, recesses, etc. In his book Outrage, Vincent Bugliosi faults Ito for allowing {{the issue of race}} to enter the trial by permitting <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey's</b> cross-examination of Mark Fuhrman with respect to his use of racial epithets.|$|R
50|$|Tellem {{was born}} in Danville, California, the {{daughter}} of an anesthesiologist mother and surgeon father.

As an undergraduate at the University of California Berkeley, she interned one summer for Congressman Ron Dellums (D-Calif.) on Capitol Hill and met her future husband, Arn Tellem. After earning a JD from the University of California Hastings College of the Law, she practiced law for four years in Los Angeles. Among her first jobs was chasing down people who claimed to be heirs to Howard Hughes's estate. Tellem then jumped to entertainment, working initially as the legal expert on famed lawyer <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey's</b> short-lived 1982 show Lie Detector.

Douglas and Shawn Holley. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence.

25|$|Hearst's {{attorney}} <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> {{used the}} Stockholm Syndrome argument {{as part of}} the defense at trial.

Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial.

25|$|PFC Michael Bernhardt – Rifleman; {{he dropped}} out of the University of Miami to {{volunteer}} for the Army. Bernhardt refused to kill civilians in My Lai. Later, Captain Ernest Medina threatened Bernhardt, trying to deter him from exposing the massacre. As a result, Bernhardt was given more dangerous assignments such as point duty on patrol. He would later be afflicted with a form of trench foot as a direct result. Bernhardt told Ronald Ridenhour, who was not present in My Lai during the massacre, about the events, thus pushing him to continue his investigation. Later he would help expose and detail the massacre in numerous interviews with the press, and he served as a prosecution witness in the trial of Medina, where he was subjected to intense cross examination by defense counsel <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> backed by a team of attorneys including Gary Myers. Michael Bernhardt is a recipient of the New York Society for Ethical Culture's 1970 Ethical Humanist Award.|$|E
25|$|In {{producing}} the special, the only existing master 16mm prints {{of the original}} series kinescope films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several kinescope films which spanned the entire run of the original series, including a few that {{did not make the}} final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some unspooled film remained on the floor after the group's rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey.</b> Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.|$|E

500|$|Seltzer and the Press later {{received}} harsh {{criticism for}} their {{handling of the}} case. Federal district judge Carl A. Weinmann, in his 1964 ruling that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial, partially blamed the media, particularly the Press: [...] "If {{ever there was a}} trial by newspaper, this is a perfect example. And the most insidious example was the Cleveland Press. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury". The United States Supreme Court ruled on June 6, 1966 in Sheppard v. Maxwell that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial because of the negative publicity he received in the press. <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> one of Sheppard's lawyers, later wrote that [...] "Seltzer used his newspaper like a club, ordering politicians around like minions and intimidating everyone who disagreed with him. If Seltzer was roused, he would spread a personally penned editorial across eight columns of his newspaper, seeking to grind some unfortunate dissident under his heel".|$|E

2500|$|That same year, fellow defense {{attorney}} Robert Shapiro also {{published a book}} about the trial, entitled The Search for Justice. He criticized <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> as a [...] "loose cannon" [...] and Johnnie Cochran for bringing race into the trial. In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD for racial reasons, but believed the verdict was correct due to reasonable doubt.|$|E
2500|$|A {{television}} programme was broadcast on WOR in New York on 30 November 1969, hosted by celebrity lawyer <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> in which Bailey cross-examined LaBour and other [...] "witnesses" [...] about the rumour, {{but he left}} it to the viewer to determine conclusions.

2500|$|Immediate {{reaction}} to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the [...] "not guilty" [...] verdict, {{while the majority of}} whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not. O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel included Johnnie Cochran, Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, and <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey.</b> Marcia Clark was the lead prosecutor for the State of California.|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} Burr's death, American Bar Association {{president}} R. William Ide III released a statement: [...] "Raymond Burr's portrayals of Perry Mason represented lawyers {{in a professional}} and dignified manner. … Mr. Burr strove for such authenticity in his courtroom characterizations that we regard his passing as though we lost one of our own." [...] The New York Times reported that Perry Mason had been named second—after <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> and before Abraham Lincoln, Thurgood Marshall, Janet Reno, Ben Matlock and Hillary Clinton—in a recent National Law Journal poll that asked Americans to name the attorney, fictional or not, they most admired.|$|E
2500|$|Despite an {{aggressive}} cross-examination by <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> Fuhrman denied {{on the stand}} that he was racist or had used the word [...] "nigger" [...] to describe black people in the 10 years prior to his testimony. But a few months later, the defense played audio tapes of Fuhrman repeatedly using the word – 41 times, in total. The tapes had been made between 1985 and 1994 by a young North Carolina screenwriter named Laura McKinney. She had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a screenplay she was writing on police officers. The Fuhrman tapes {{became one of the}} cornerstones of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility.|$|E
2500|$|Attorney <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> who {{was working}} on a habeas corpus {{petition}} for his client Sheppard, attended the Overseas Press Club event, heard what Kilgallen told the crowd, and then asked her privately if she would help him. [...] "Some days later," [...] as Bailey wrote in his memoir The Defense Never Rests, [...] "we obtained a deposition from Dorothy that was inserted into the petition submitted to" [...] Carl Andrew Weinman, judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Bailey also included in the habeas corpus petition a statement from Edward Murray, who had worked in 1954 as a court clerk at the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Similar to Kilgallen's statement, Murray's statement indicated that the original Sheppard judge, Edward J. Blythin, had declared Sheppard guilty even before the grand jury's August 17, 1954, indictment of Sheppard.|$|E
