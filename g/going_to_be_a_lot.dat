500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say."

[...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes {{that were on the}} edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going {{to make it to the}} screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!"

The band had, according to Hoppus, [...] "a million ideas {{and a lot of}} energy and enthusiasm to make a great record". Pierre strove for the record to have a sound that resembled the bands Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the neighbors had called police to the band and Hoppus several times for being too loud at night time, especially when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to work on a song late at night. According to Pierre, Hoppus was not interested in putting his own stamp on the music, but rather bringing out the best in what he saw in the group. Hoppus generally modeled his production after Jerry Finn (a longtime producer of Blink-182), and therefore it involved much watching and listening. [...] "Mark kept telling us, 'Your name is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> bigger on the front than mine is on the back'," [...] recalled Justin Pierre, [...] "So he would throw suggestions out there but always say, 'Feel free to turn these down.'
