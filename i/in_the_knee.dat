30|$|The {{principal}} {{findings of}} the present study were that <b>the</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> response to V-V torque was greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee,</b> and that <b>the</b> laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> with additional posterior tibial load got close to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> ACL appeared to carry a substantial role in restraining V-V rotation of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint.|$|R

Power and Glory then attacked Jannetty while their manager, Slick, distracted the referee. Although Jannetty was able to mount a brief comeback, Roma and Hercules wore him down and got the victory after performing a PowerPlex—a superplex from Hercules followed by a diving splash from Roma.|$|E

5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) fought Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) in an Elimination Last Team Standing {{match in}} the next encounter. Though the match was billed as a Last Team Standing match, it was held under Texas Death match rules. A Texas Death match {{is similar to a}} Last Team Standing match, however, the {{competitor}} must pin or make his opponent submit before the referee begins his count. Daniels pinned Storm following hitting him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with a steel chair to begin the ten count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach the ten count after being pinned following a top rope legdrop by Harris. With the outcome of the match down to the competition between Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair. Harris then pinned Skipper to begin the ten count; Skipper did not get to his feet, giving the win to AMW.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Ohio State, Lavelli roomed with Les Horvath and Don McCafferty and {{played on the}} {{freshman}} team under coach Trevor Rees. Brown switched Lavelli to end (the position is now called wide receiver). His playing time with the football team was limited, however, due to injury. He became a first-string end as a sophomore in 1942, but was ailing from a charley horse in his thigh and sat out {{the first game of}} the season against a Fort Knox military team. He had recovered by the third game of the season and started in a game against Southern California. Lavelli was hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> while grabbing for a pass near the end of the game, however, and broke a bone. He was sidelined for the rest of the season. The Buckeyes won the college football national championship that year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the live}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Buck Quartermaine defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. In the first televised match, Razor Ramon defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jeff Jarrett, who was accompanied by The Roadie. Ramon used his strength to dominate {{the opening of the}} match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of dropkicks and then choked Ramon with a sleeper hold. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was thrown over the top rope. He hit his knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via countout. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the figure four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the Razor's Edge. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.|$|E
30|$|ACL {{deficiency}} {{may affect}} <b>the</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human <b>knee</b> joint (Imbert et al. 2014; Imbert et al. 2015; Markolf et al. 1984). Markolf et al. (Markolf et al. 1984) reported a 36 % increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> V-V laxity at full extension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> on application of 20  Nm of V-V torque. Therefore, <b>the</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> patients with injury {{to both the}} ACL and the MCL can be much greater than that with isolated MCL injury. Additionally, the anterior tibial translation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> was shown to be greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee,</b> even under non-weight bearing conditions (DeFrate et al. 2006; Matsuo et al. 2014; Mishima et al. 2005). We postulated that anterior tibial translation might be associated with greater V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> objectives {{of this study were}} 1) to evaluate <b>the</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> on application of V-V torque and 2) to clarify the effect of additional posterior tibial load on <b>the</b> laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee.</b> We hypothesized that <b>the</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> under V-V torque was greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee,</b> and that <b>the</b> laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> was attenuated by adding posterior tibial load.|$|R

Assessment of varus-valgus (V-V) instability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> {{is crucial for}} the management of the concomitant ACL-collateral ligaments injury. We evaluated the V-V laxity and investigated the effect of additional posterior tibial load on <b>the</b> laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee.</b> Our hypothesis was that <b>the</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> was greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee</b> and attenuated by additional posterior tibial load.|$|R
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey.

White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register.

5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

30|$|As the ACL {{worked against}} {{anterior}} tibial drawer, the anterior tibial translation under anterior tibial load increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-injured <b>knee</b> (Amis & Dawkins 1991; Markolf et al. 1984). Amis et al. (1991) {{reported that the}} anterior tibial translation increased by approximately 140 % after removal of the ACL on application of 150  N of anterior tibial load at 20 ° of flexion. Besides, Markolf et al. (1984) reported the increased V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> response to V-V torque, as compared to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee.</b> Our {{results showed that the}} V-V laxity increased under V-V torque, while <b>the</b> <b>in</b> situ force of the ACL was 16 – 30  N under 5  Nm of varus and valgus torques, respectively. Thus, the ACL also had a restraining force against V-V rotation of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint (Grood et al. 1981; Markolf et al. 1990). <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> tibia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> located more anteriorly than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intact <b>knee</b> even under non-weight bearing conditions (DeFrate et al. 2006; Matsuo et al. 2014; Mishima et al. 2005). Matuso et al. (2014) reported that the anterior tibial translation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> was 1.4  mm greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> supine and extended <b>knee</b> position. Hence, <b>the</b> anterior tibial translation was assumed {{to be associated with the}} greater V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> V-V laxity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> was attenuated by adding posterior tibial load because the anterior tibial translation was restrained. These findings suggest that posterior tibial load should be applied during assessment of V-V instability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> for accurate physical evaluation of the V-V laxity.|$|R

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} defects have a poor {{capacity for}} repair. Most {{of the current}} treatment options result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of fibro-cartilage, which is functionally inferior to normal hyaline articular cartilage. We studied the effectiveness of allogenic chondrocyte transplantation for focal articular cartilage defects in rabbits. Chondrocytes were cultured in vitro from cartilage harvested from <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joints of a New Zealand White rabbit. A 3  mm defect was created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articular cartilage of both <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> other rabbits. <b>The</b> cultured allogenic chondrocytes were transplanted into <b>the</b> defect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>knees</b> and closed with a periosteal flap, while <b>the</b> defects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>knees</b> served as controls and were closed with a periosteal flap alone, without chondrocytes. Healing of the defects was assessed at 12  weeks by histological studies. Allogenic chondrocyte transplantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed repair tissue (P= 0. 04) compared with that found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>knees.</b> <b>The</b> histological quality score of the repair tissue was significantly better (P= 0. 05), with more hyaline characteristics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> treated with allogenic chondrocytes than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>knees.</b> Articular cartilage defects treated with allogenic chondrocyte transplantation result in better repair tissue formation with hyaline characteristics than those in control knees...|$|R
