Exceptions include some pelagic cucumbers and the species Rynkatorpa pawsoni, which has a commensal relationship with deep-sea anglerfish.

Some sea cucumbers position themselves in currents and catch food that flows by with their open tentacles. They also sift through the bottom sediments using their tentacles. Other species can dig into bottom silt or sand until they are completely buried. They then extrude their feeding tentacles, ready to withdraw at any hint of danger.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{total of}} about 7,000 extant species of {{echinoderm}} as well as about 13,000 extinct species. They are found in habitats ranging from shallow intertidal areas to abyssal depths. Two main subdivisions are traditionally recognised: the more familiar motile Eleutherozoa, which encompasses the Asteroidea (starfish, 1,745 recent species), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars, 2,300 species), Echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dollars, 900 species) and <b>Holothuroidea</b> (sea cucumbers, 1,430 species); and the Pelmatozoa, some of which are sessile while others move around. These consist of the Crinoidea (feather stars and sea lilies, 580 species) and the extinct blastoids and Paracrinoids. A fifth class of Eleutherozoa consisting of just three species, the Concentricycloidea (sea daisies), were recently merged into the Asteroidea.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of melanins considering that they are an aggregate of smaller component molecules, such as nitrogen containing melanins. There are two classes of pigments: black and brown insoluble eumelanins, which are derived from aerobic oxidation of tyrosine {{in the presence of}} tyrosinase, and the alkali-soluble phaeomelanins which range from a yellow to red brown color, arising from the deviation of the eumelanin pathway through the intervention of cysteine and/or glutathione. Eumelanins are usually found in the skin and eyes. Several different melanins include melanoprotein (dark brown melanin that is stored in high concentrations in the ink sac of the cuttlefish Sepia Officianalis), echinoidea (found in sand dollars, and the hearts of sea urchins), <b>holothuroidea</b> (found in sea cucumbers), and ophiuroidea (found in brittle and snake stars). These melanins are possibly polymers which arise from the repeated coupling of simple bi-polyfunctional monomdric intermediates, or of high molecular weights.

Sea Shepherd crew joined Park Services officers at the barricades erected by fishers around the buildings. Another team of Sea Shepherd crew were dispatched to guard Lonesome George, one of the Galápagos Islands’ most famous turtles, as the fishers had threatened to kill him if the quota on sea cucumber was not lifted. About 100 residents of San Cristóbal Island marched in protest against the fishers actions. In July, the High Court of Ecuador upheld the Park Service limits on the take of sea cucumber. The Park Service banned the catch of sea cucumber for 2005 and 2006 {{to allow for the}} populations to recover from over-fishing.

50|$|About 75% of the {{population}} of North Halmahera are dependent on agriculture, especially plantation coconut and clove. In 2004, coconut production amounted to 55435 ha and 66.199 thousand tonnes and cloves 3,175.5 hectares and 320.71 tonnes. Palm plantation area in 2002 amounted to 47900 ha with a production of 68.5 thousand tonnes. Sub Tobelo, South Tobelo and Galela are the highest oil producing areas and contain several oil terminals. Aside from those mentioned above, the main crops grown are banana, rice, corn, peanuts, soybeans, cassava, maize, coffee, cocoa, nutmeg and some types of fruits such as oranges, mango and durian. Some types of livestock have been developed, including goat, cattle, chickens, hens, and pigs. The North Halmahera Regency has some 536000 ha of forest, 145500 ha of which is protected and 26250 ha of which is under production. Mining reserves have been identified in the area, namely gold, natural gas and nickel ore. There are gold mines in Kao District and Loloda District (Dotia village). Geothermal energy resources are also available in the District of Galela (Mamuya village). On Doi Island, some reserves of iron and copper have been found.Based on research results of the Marine Fisheries Research Institute (1983), the potential of fish resources (standing stock) found in North Halmahera waters is estimated at 644,382.48 tonnes. Fishing is important to the economic activity of the region. Most people in North Halmahera Regency inhabit coastal areas and depend upon these marine ecosystems as a source of social economic life. Until the year 2002, the contribution of capture fisheries production amounted to 98,782.21 tonnes or roughly 65% of the total overall production. In addition to the fish resources, several types of other resources have high economic value and have been exploited by the fishing communities in the coastal areas and small islands, such as crustacea, Egg Sea cucumbers (<b>Holothuroidea),</b> mollusc, and seaweed. The fishing equipment used by most fishermen in the region of North Halmahera is traditional, such as nets. The extent of coastal and marine areas with a high water quality allows for the development of marine aquaculture, especially Grouper, lobster, seaweed and pearls. Until now, optimisation and productivity of aquaculture in North Halamahera has been low. Until the year 2002 the total area of cultivation of marine, brackish and pond reached 128,110 ha, producing just 46.550 tonnes, or 0.03% of the total volume of production.|$|E

A study of the {{diversity and}} distribution of sea cucumber (<b>Holothuroidea)</b> in shallow waters at Baluran National Park, East Java, Indonesia was carried out from July until September 2015. The method {{used in this study}} was systematic transect in low tide condition. Samples were collected by hands at intertidal sites. Identification of sea cucumber species based on morphological ossicles. Twenty one species of <b>Holothuroidea</b> belonging two orders and four families were found in this study. The most dominant family found was Holothuriidae (16 species), followed by Stichopodidae (2 species), Synaptidae (2 species), and Chiridotidae (1 spesies). Four species (Holothuria olivacea, H. verrucosa, Labidodemas rugosum, and Chiridota smirnovi) are new record for Java waters and one species (H. papillifera) is a new record for Indonesian waters. Two morphospecies (H. aff. macroperona and Stichopus cf. monotuberculatus) need reconfirmation to species level. The highest abundance species of <b>Holothuroidea</b> was found at under rock with 15 species. Whereas, the highest number of individuals was found in seagrass areas with 5457 individuals.

40|$|The {{echinoderm}} fauna of North-eastern Atlantic {{is one of}} {{the best}} known worldwide. However, despite a great number of published works on Atlantic echinoderms, this group remains poorly know in Northwest African waters, where the available information basically comes from the old oceanographic expeditions carried out from the late 19 th- to mid- 20 th centuries (Challenger, Prince Albert I of Monaco, Travailleur et Talisman, Michael Sars, Valdivia, Atlantide). During the four multidisciplinary Maurit surveys, carried out annually from 2007 to 2010 onboard R/V Vizconde de Eza in Mauritanian EEZ, between Cape Blanc (21 ° N) and the Senegalese border (16 ° N), a total of 342 trawling stations were sampled between 79 and 1867 m depth. Most of stations were located in soft bottoms and were accomplished with a commercial trawl and a beam-trawl. Only 26 stations were deployed in hard bottoms, namely canyons borders, the giant cold-water coral reef and a seamount, using a rock dredge. This paper deals with the echinoderms obtained in these surveys and compares soft-bottoms and hard bottom assemblages. Echinoderms were collected in 271 stations (79. 2 %) of which 252 (93. 0 %) were located in soft bottoms and only 19 (7. 0 %) in hard substrata. Global diversity reaches 100 species identified in both soft and hard substrata, including 29 <b>Holothuroidea,</b> 28 Asteroidea, 27 Ophiuroidea, 13 Echinoidea and 3 Crinoidea. Eighty-two species were collected on soft bottoms, 25 were collected on hard substrata, but only six were reported in both. Ophiuroidea and Asteroidea were the most diverse echinoderms found on soft bottoms, versus <b>Holothuroidea</b> and Ophiuroidea in hard bottoms.
