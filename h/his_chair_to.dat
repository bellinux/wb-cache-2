5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E

Rahmi Koç retired from this duty on April 4, 2003, transferring <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> his eldest son Mustafa Koç. Rahmi Koç is currently Honorary Chairman of the Koç Holding.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 Huxley {{moved to}} King's College London as Professor of Zoology, but in 1927, to the amazement {{of his colleagues}} and on the prodding of H. G. Wells whom he had promised 1,000 words a day, he {{resigned}} <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> work full-time with Wells and his son G. P. Wells on The Science of Life (see below). For some time Huxley retained his room at King's College, and continued as Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department. From 1927 to 1931 he was also Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution, where he gave an annual lectures series. No-one realised {{it at the time}} (why would they?), but he had {{come to the end of}} his life as a university academic.|$|E
60|$|Doctor Wybrow {{rose from}} <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{determined}} <b>to</b> close the interview.|$|R

25|$|There {{were then}} {{questions}} about Pinochet's allegedly fragile health. After medical tests, Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled in January 2000 {{that he should}} not be extradited. This triggered protests from human rights NGOs, and led in January 2000 the Belgian government, along with six human rights groups (including Amnesty International), to depose a complaint against Straw's decision before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Belgium, as well as France and Switzerland, had deposed extradition requests in the wake of Spain's demand. Despite the protests of legal and medical experts from several countries, Straw finally ruled, in March 2000, to set free Pinochet and authorize his free return to Chile. On 3 March 2000 Pinochet returned to Chile. His first act when landing in Santiago de Chile's airport was to triumphally stand up from <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> acclaim his supporters. He was first greeted by his successor as head of the Chilean Armed Forces, General Ricardo Izurieta. President Ricardo Lagos, who had just sworn in on 11 March, said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} European {{version of}} the music video for [...] "Trouble" [...] was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video footage was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. A Wild West-themed video, it features Martin as a prisoner in a dark warehouse, tied with ropes to a chair, being circled by cars in the freezing cold. The {{other members of the}} band are seen on the upper floor in a slow motion sequence where Buckland and Champion struggle with bass guitarist Guy Berryman, tying him to another chair and forcing him to look in front. At this point, Martin's struggling causes <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> tip over, and he hits the ground on his side. He sings the final line of the song ("They spun a web for me..."), before the darkness abruptly turns to daylight. [...] A beautiful sunrise is then revealed, but as the camera pans out, it is revealed to be fake and part of a large theater backdrop, with Martin still lying on his side, tied to the chair.|$|E
2500|$|The summit also {{touched the}} {{situation}} in Togo and welcomed a delegation, led by Kokou Tozoun, minister of foreign affairs.

2500|$|Jackson died at his {{plantation}} on June 8, 1845, {{at the age}} of 78, {{of chronic}} tuberculosis, dropsy, and heart failure. According to a newspaper account from the Boon Lick Times, [...] " [...] fainted whilst being removed from <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant. ... When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live." ...|$|E

60|$|The captain smiled deprecatingly, and, drawing <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> close <b>to</b> the table, {{began to}} examine the box.|$|R

60|$|HOTCHKISS. Take my place, Mr Soames. [He {{gives up}} <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> him, and retires to the oak chest, {{on which he}} seats himself].|$|E
