Most of the developers are volunteers and few developers are paid by some companies. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team who are responsible for overall project <b>direction,</b> <b>setting</b> and enforcing project rules and approving new commiters, or the granting of SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, for example, responsibility for managing the ports collection is delegated to the Ports Management Team.|$|E

5000|$|A {{point at}} {{infinity}} {{of the curve}} is a zero of p of the form (a, b, 0). Equivalently, (a, b) is a zero of pd. The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that, over an algebraically closed field (typically, the field of complex numbers), pd factors into a product of linear factors. Each factor defines a point at infinity on the curve: if bx − ay is such a factor, then it defines the point at infinity (a, b, 0). Over the reals, pd factors into linear and quadratic factors. The irreducible quadratic factors define non-real points at infinity, and the real points are given by the linear factors.If (a, b, 0) is a point at infinity of the curve, one says that (a, b) is an asymptotic <b>direction.</b> <b>Setting</b> q = pd the equation of the corresponding asymptote is ...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} notion of finite order lacunarity for <b>direction</b> <b>sets</b> in R^d+ 1.

This generalizes to higher dimensions a planar result due to Bateman. Combined with earlier work of Alfonseca, Bateman, Parcet and Rogers, this notion of lacunarity and Kakeya-type sets also yields a characterization in all dimensions for directional maximal operators to be L^p-bounded.

The engines are mounted so that the end which would normally point forwards in a rear-wheel-drive car, instead faces {{the center of the}} MFA and MFB carriages. Due to this mounting design and nature of combustion engines and {{to the fact that the}} train runs forward in both directions, a so-called [...] "reverse gear" [...] had to be attached to automatic gearboxes. They are responsible for making the axles turn the right way. These gears are normally not controlled directly by the train's driver; instead, the train's on-board computers check which of the two cabs is active to determine the train's primary driving <b>direction,</b> <b>setting</b> the reverse gears accordingly.|$|E
