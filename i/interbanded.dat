During this time span, schistose metamorphic rocks of amphibolite and greenschist facies exhibiting polyphase deformation were formed and accreted below the ophiolite slice.

The upper lens of the Main orebody may be further subdivided into six texturally distinct, laterally extensive mine units. In the eastern upper lens, where textural variations are best developed, fluid inclusions indicate that most ore mineralization took place over the temperature range of 165 ø to 210 øC and involved a brine containing 20 to 38 wt percent NaC 1 equiv.

Ore reserves may probably exceed I 000 million tonnes and this makes Moncorvo the largest iron ore deposit in the European Union. Compact poorly banded massive layers may exceed 90 meters in thickness {{which is quite}} an extraordinary feature for a Phanerozoic deposit. If the thickness of Precambrian deposits may reach a few hundred meters, the thickness of Phanerozoic deposits never exceed a maximum of 15 meters generally forming a number of comparatively thin layers confined to a particular member of a sedimentary sequence. A detailed microscopic analysis of the ores revealed that initially a compact magnetite/quartzite layer, detrital in character (the magnetite occasionally showing chromite cores), was deposited by entrapment in near shore lagoons where rivers debouched, {{rather than in the}} open sea. This stage was followed by oscilating and transgressive shore lines which gave rise to breaks in sedimentation in combined river delta and shallow water marine environment where detrital material and fine iron oxide and clay suspensions were deposited in fluctuating environments. These events gave rise to layers of both magnetite (martite) and specularite intergrown with quartz, silicates and phosphates. Textural and mineralogical studies show that the deposits consist of ferruginous clastic sediments and are not chemically deposited cherts.

The pyrite is intimately <b>interbanded</b> with ore-grade Pb-Zn miner alization at the Mount Isa mine but is also abundant {{north and south of}} the mine at several stratigraphic horizons within the Urquhart Shale. Detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and sulfur isotope studies of the Urquhart Shale, mostly north of the mine, reveal that the fine-grained pyrite (delta(34) S = - 3. 3 to + 26. 3 parts per thousand) formed by thermochemical sulfate reduction during diagenesis. The sulfate source was local sulfate evaporites, pseudo morphs of which are present throughout the Urquhart Shale (i. e., gypsum, anhydrite, and barite). Deep-burial diagenetic replacement of these evaporites resulted in sulfate-bearing ground waters which migrated parallel to bedding. Fine-grained pyrite formed where these fluids infiltrated and then interacted with carbon-rich laminated siltstones. Comparison of the sulfur isotope systematics of fine-grained pyrite and spatially associated base metal sulfides from the Mount Isa Pb-Zn and Cu orebodies indicates a common sulfur source of ultimately marine origin for all sulfide types. Different sulfur isotope ratio distributions for the various sulfides are the result of contrasting formation mechanisms and/or depositional conditions rather than differing sulfur sources. The sulfur isotope systematics of the base metal and associated iron sulfide generations are consistent with mineralization by reduced hydrothermal fluids, perhaps generated by bulk reduction of evaporite-sourced sulfate-bearing waters generated deeper in the Mount Isa Group, the sedimentary sequence which contains the Urquhart Shale. The available sulfur isotope data from the Mount Isa orebodies are consistent with either a chemically and thermally zoned, evolving Cu-Pb-Zn system, or discrete Cu and Pb-Zn mineralizing events linked by a common sulfur source...|$|E

Northern Eastern Ghats belt, north of the Godavari rift {{has been defined as}} the Eastern Ghats Province, while that to the south has been defined as the Ongole domain; and although, these distinct crustal domains also record different ages of granulite metamorphism, both of these domains are dominated by the two lithologies. Many of the workers considered the khondalites as the oldest component with unknown basement and the charnockite- protoliths as intrusive into the khondalites. However, published geochronological data do not corroborate the aforesaid relations. Onset of khondalite sedimentation in the Proterozoic Eastern Ghats Province, constrained by detrital zircon data, as around 1. 3 Ga and the charnockite-protolith emplacement between 1. 9 and 2. 9 Ga, argue against intrusion of felsic magma (tonalite, now enderbite!) in to the khondalites. The field relations of the hornblende-mafic granulite with the two gneiss components together with Sm-Nd isotopic data of the hornblende-mafic granulites (both the xenoliths within charnockites and those <b>interbanded</b> with the khondalites) indicate that khondalite sediments were deposited on older mafic crustal rocks. Mafic basement and supracrustal rocks were subsequently deformed and metamorphosed together during collisional orogeny at high to ultra-high temperatures – partial melting of mafic rocks producing the charnockitic melt; and partial melting of pelitic sediments producing the peraluminous granitoids. This is compatible with all the geochronological data as well as the petrogenetic model of partial melting for the charnockitic rocks in the Eastern Ghats Belt.

Presence of interstitial biotites, occurrence of fluorite, absence of microcline points towards the high temp. of formation of granites and their A-type signatures. The granites have lower CaO, higher alkali values. Based on the normative calcn. granites straddle {{in the field of}} monzogranite-granodiorite-granite. They exhibit calc-alk. trend in Na-Ca-K diagram. Granites exhibit strong peraluminous nature in A/NK vs. A/CNK diagrams. In Y-Nb discrimination diagram granites occur in the "Within Plate" region. The Y-Nb-Zr/ 4 trilinear diagram infers that granites are derived from re-working of the deep continental crust or under plated crust. Field, petrol. and geochem. signature points towards A-type granites at Andipatti. Emplacement of anorthosites into pre-existing domal and basin structures at Oddanchatram and Kadavur along the lineament running parallel to Northern border of Kodikanal-Palani Hill ranges represent intrusion during collisional processes. As a result granulite facies metamorphism took place around 550 Ma and then the terrain experienced extensional tectonics, with the development of prominent /re-activation of the of Kambam and Achankovil lineaments/shear zones followed by intrusion of granites. Geochem. studies indicate that granites from Varshanadu have formed from the partial melting of deep crustal granulite source and have intruded along prominent shear zones. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{reveal a}} new mechanism of light amplification in graphene under {{the conditions of}} <b>interband</b> population inversion. It is enabled by the indirect <b>interband</b> transitions, with the photon emission preceded or followed by the scattering on disorder. The emerging contribution to the optical conductivity, which we call the <b>interband</b> Drude conductivity, appears to be negative for the photon energies below the double quasi-Fermi energy of pumped electrons and holes. We find that for the Gaussian correlated distribution of scattering centers, the real part of the net Drude conductivity (<b>interband</b> plus intraband) can be negative in the terahertz and near-infrared frequency ranges, while the radiation amplification by a single graphene sheet can exceed 2. 3 %.

40|$|To {{understand}} the impurity effect on Tc in FeAs superconductors, we analyze a simple two-band BCS model with repulsive <b>interband</b> interaction. The realized fully-gapped superconducting state with sign reversal, which is predicted by spin fluctuation theories in this compound, is suppressed by impurities {{due to the}} <b>interband</b> hopping of Cooper pairs, if the <b>interband</b> impurity scattering I' {{is equal to the}} intraband one I. When |I'/I| < 1, in highly contrast, Tc is almost unchanged by strong impurity scattering since the <b>interband</b> scattering is almost prohibited by the multiple scattering effect. Since |I'/I| ∼ 0. 5 is expected, the robustness of superconductivity against impurities in FeAs superconductors is naturally understood in term of the sign reversing fully-gapped state.
