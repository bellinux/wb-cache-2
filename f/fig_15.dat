5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (<b>Fig.</b> <b>15).</b> By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E

60|$|Fig. 13 is {{representative}} of the richest conditions of Gothic capital which existed {{at the close of the}} thirteenth century. The builder of the Ducal Palace amplified them into the form of fig. 9, but varying the leafage in disposition and division of lobes in every capital; and the workmen trained under him executed many noble capitals for the Gothic palaces of the early fourteenth century, of which fig. 12, from a palace in the Campo St. Polo, is one of the most beautiful examples. In figs. 9 and 12 the reader sees the Venetian Gothic capital in its noblest developement. The next step was to such forms as <b>fig.</b> <b>15,</b> which is generally characteristic of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century Gothic, and of which I hope the reader will at once perceive the exaggeration and corruption.|$|E
6000|$|The Pelvis, or bony girdle of the hips, of Man is {{a strikingly}} human {{part of his}} organization; the {{expanded}} haunch bones affording support for his viscera during his habitually erect posture, and giving space for the attachment of the great muscles which enable him to assume and to preserve that attitude.

This curvature is not to be confounded with that rippling or undulating character of every portion of the slaty crystalline rocks above described. I am now speaking of all kinds of rocks indifferently;--not of their appearance in small pieces, but of their great contours in masses, thousands of feet thick. And it is almost universally true of these masses that they do not merely lie in flat superposition one over another, as the books in Fig. 8; but they lie in waves, more or less vast and sweeping according to the scale of the country, as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>15,</b> where the distance {{from one side of the}} figure to the other is supposed to be four or five leagues.|$|E
6000|$|... 99. The {{relation}} of the current of electricity produced, to the magnetic pole, to the direction of rotation of the plate, &c. &c., may be expressed by saying, that when the unmarked pole (44. 84.) is beneath {{the edge of the}} plate, and the latter revolves horizontally, screw-fashion, the electricity which can be collected {{at the edge of the}} plate nearest to the pole is positive. As the pole of the earth may mentally be considered the unmarked pole, this {{relation of}} the rotation, the pole, and the electricity evolved, is not difficult to remember. Or if, in <b>fig.</b> <b>15,</b> the circle represent the copper disc revolving in the direction of the arrows, and a the outline of the unmarked pole placed beneath the plate, then the electricity collected at b and the neighbouring parts is positive, whilst that collected at the centre c and other parts is negative (88.). The currents in the plate are therefore from the centre by the magnetic poles towards the circumference.|$|E

The {{examples}} of the concave family in the Byzantine times are found principally either in large capitals founded on the Greek Corinthian, used chiefly for the nave pillars of churches, or in the small lateral shafts of the palaces. It appears somewhat singular that the pure Corinthian form should have been reserved almost exclusively for nave pillars, as at Torcello, Murano, and St. Mark's; it occurs, indeed, together with almost every other form, on the exterior of St. Mark's also, but never so definitely as in the nave and transept shafts. Of the conditions assumed by it at Torcello enough has been said; {{and one of the}} most delicate of the varieties occurring in St. Mark's is given in Plate VIII., <b>fig.</b> <b>15,</b> remarkable for the cutting of the sharp thistle-like leaves into open relief, so that the light sometimes shines through them from behind, and for the beautiful curling of the extremities of the leaves outwards, joining each other at the top, as in an undivided flower.|$|E

60|$|Scuta {{slightly}} convex, thrice {{as long as}} broad; {{upper part}} much acuminated; occludent margin almost straight; basal margin nearly {{at right angles to}} the occludent margin; the tergal margin is separated from the lateral margin by an angle more or less prominent; a slight curved ridge runs from the umbo to this angle, and this deserves especial notice, inasmuch as it indicates the outline which the valve assumed in its earliest growth, and which is permanently retained in most of the older fossil species. Along the occludent margin, there is a trace of a ledge, developed in a variable degree, and which is noticed only on account of the plainly visible ledge along this same margin, in the allied genus Oxynaspis. The umbo, or centre of calcification, is seated close to the occludent margin, and at about one fourth of the length of the valve from the apex. Internally, (<b>fig.</b> <b>15,</b> a´, Pl. V,) the part above the umbo is flat; and beneath this upper part, there is a large rounded hollow (d) for the adductor muscle: a fold or indentation (a) running downwards from the umbo, extends in a very oblique line across the occludent margin. This fold is of high interest as giving lodgment to the Complemental Males, and will hereafter often be referred to.|$|E
60|$|Cats, when terrified, {{stand at}} full height, and arch their backs in a {{well-known}} and ridiculous fashion. They spit, hiss, or growl. The hair {{over the whole}} body, and especially on the tail, becomes erect. In the instances observed by me the basal part of the tail was held upright, the terminal part being thrown on one side; but sometimes the tail (see <b>fig.</b> <b>15)</b> is only a little raised, and is bent almost from the base to one side. The ears are drawn back, and the teeth exposed. When two kittens are playing together, the one often thus tries to frighten the other. From {{what we have seen}} in former chapters, all the above points of expression are intelligible, except the extreme arching of the back. I am inclined to believe that, {{in the same manner as}} many birds, whilst they ruffle their feathers, spread out their wings and tail, to make themselves look as big as possible, so cats stand upright at their full height, arch their backs, often raise the basal part of the tail, and erect their hair, for the same purpose. The lynx, when attacked, is said to arch its back, and is thus figured by Brehm. But the keepers in the Zoological Gardens have never seen any tendency to this action in the larger feline animals, such as tigers, lions, &c.; and these have little cause to be afraid of any other animal.|$|E
6000|$|... 41. But {{there is}} yet another and a weightier charge to be brought against our modern Pseudo-Greek {{ornament}}ation. It is, first, wrongly placed; secondly, wrongly finished; and, thirdly, utterly without meaning. Observe in these two Gothic ornaments, and in every other ornament that ever was carved in the great Gothic times, there is a definite aim at the representation of some natural object. In <b>fig.</b> <b>15</b> you have an exquisite group of rose-stems, with the flowers and buds; in fig. 16, various wild weeds, especially the Geranium pratense; in every case you have an approximation to a natural form, and an unceasing variety of suggestion. But how much of Nature have you in your Greek buildings? I will show you, taking for an example the best you have lately built; and, in doing so, I trust that nothing that I say will be thought to have any personal purpose, and that {{the architect of the}} building in question will forgive me; for it is just because it {{is a good example of}} the style that I think it more fair to use it for an example. If the building were a bad one of the kind, it would not be a fair instance; and I hope, therefore, that in speaking of the institution on the Mound, just in progress, I shall be understood as meaning rather a compliment to its architect than otherwise. It is not his fault that we force him to build in the Greek manner.|$|E
