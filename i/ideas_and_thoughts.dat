5|$|Douglas {{published}} no {{writings of}} his own and left no records of his <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts.</b> The only publication with which he was associated was the Abbey Square Sketch Book, which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17thcenturies, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed plate in the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the Abbey Gateway in Chester.|$|E

25|$|In the United States and Canada, tenure is a {{contractual}} right that grants {{a teacher or}} professor permanent position or employment. It is given as a legal protection against summary dismissal without just cause. Tenure encouraged the development of <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts,</b> {{even if they are}} not popular among the community. In those countries, tenure is granted only to professors and teachers who prove to be exceptionally productive in their careers.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} proceeds, one can note that many events are perceptual and not certain. By reading both stories some sense {{can be made}} from this poetic styled puzzle. The words written are a vague mix of poetry and stream of {{consciousness}} prose. Both Hailey and Sam depict their feelings as well as <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> towards one another. It is truly difficult to summarize the plot as most readers will understand the parts of story in different ways.|$|E
25|$|As more {{transgender}} {{people are}} represented and included {{within the realm}} of mass culture, the stigma that is associated with being transgender can influence the decisions, <b>ideas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> based upon it. Media representation, culture industry, and social marginalization all hint at popular culture standards and the applicability and significance to mass culture as well. These terms {{play an important role in}} the formation of notions for those who have little recognition or knowledge of transgender people. Media depictions represent only a minuscule spectrum of the transgender group, which essentially conveys that those that are shown are the only interpretations and ideas society has of them.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of archetypal psychology {{is influenced by}} Carl Jung's analytical psychology and Classical Greek, Renaissance, <b>and</b> Romantic <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b> Hillman’s influences include Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Henry Corbin, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus, who share a common concern for psyche.|$|R

25|$|Students {{with special}} needs {{struggle}} not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing. Dialogue journals as an individualized means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations. For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> with teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 1955, a non-violent {{splinter}} group of nationalists calling themselves La Quinta Columna (The 5th Column) {{broke away from}} the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party due to not supporting the <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> of Albizu Campos, as to a Puerto Rico relationship with Spain as its Mother country and their nationalistic love for Puerto Rico as their Motherland. The other reason for the {{splinter group}} was due to the violence {{that took place in the}} 1950s. This splinter group would later become known in 1968 as El Movimiento Indio Taino de Boriken (The Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico) which was primarily made up of the children of the Puerto Rican Nationalists whom would come to establish the indigenous grassroots civil rights movement in Puerto Rico.|$|E

They find shelter in a seemingly-abandoned {{underground}} structure, but discover a wonderous old lady, Philine-Codec Comtesse de Cybersdorf, {{who used to}} be married to Pjölk until he tried to killer her in a rage, which ends in her losing a leg. She tells Aliana and Fratt that it was actually Echsenfriedl who was the re-inventor of the printing press, and he the creative brain behind Pjölk's <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts.</b> Pjölk was the man in public only because it was impossible for Echsenfriedl. The Comtesse is about to tell them crucial information about Echsenfriedl, but then cannibalizing undead striking miners invade the room and kill her before she gets the chance to reveal the truth.|$|E

25|$|The main {{influence}} {{on the development of}} archetypal psychology is Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical Greek, Renaissance, <b>and</b> Romantic <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b> Influential artists, poets, philosophers, alchemists, and psychologists include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus.

2500|$|The <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> of the German Youth Movement, {{founded in}} 1896, {{had a major}} impact on the German youth at the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century. The movement aimed at providing free space to develop a healthy life. A common trait of the various organizations was a romantic longing for a pristine state of things, and a return to older cultural traditions, with a strong emphasis on independent, non-conformist thinking. They propagated a return to nature, confraternity and shared adventures. The Deutsche Jungenschaft vom 1.11.1929 (abbreviated as [...] "d.j.1.11.") was part of this youth movement, founded by Eberhard Koebel in 1929. Christoph Probst was a member of the German Youth Movement, and Willi Graf was a member of [...] "Neudeutschland" [...] ("New Germany"), and the [...] "Grauer Orden" [...] ("Grey Convent"), which were illegal Catholic youth organizations.|$|E

60|$|The {{fact was}} that {{the news of the}} arrival of the Dipsey at Cape Tariff had come to Sardis a week after Clewe's descent into the shaft, and he was absorbed, body and soul, in his {{underground}} discoveries. He was not wanting in sympathy, or even affection, for the people who had been doing his work, and his interest in their welfare and their achievements was as great as it ever had been, but the <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> which now occupied his mind were of a character which lessened and overshadowed every other object of consideration. Most of the messages sent to Cape Tariff had come from Margaret Raleigh.|$|E

I tell you, Mrs. Archibald," [...] he said, turning to her, earnestly, [...] "it is getting to be unbearable. The whole evening, ever since you left the camp-fire, she has been talking to me on the subject of mental assimilation--that is, the {{treatment}} of our <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> as if they were articles of food--intellectual soda biscuit, or plum pudding, for instance--in order to find out whether our minds can digest these things and produce from them the mental chyme and chyle necessary to our intellectual development.

6000|$|... 'It {{strikes me}} {{that the way to}} teach a class or a {{congregation}} is to bring out the doctrine from the very words of Scripture carefully, critically examined and explained. Only think, Sophy, of the vague desultory way in which we all, more or less, read; and we have accepted a phraseology without enquiring to a great extent, and use words to which we attach no definite meaning. Few in the congregation could draw out in clear words what they mean when they talk of faith, justification, regeneration, conversion, &c. &c. All language denoting <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> is transferred to the region of the mind from denoting at first only external objects and sensations. This is in accordance with the mystery of all, the union of mind and matter--which no pagan philosopher could comprehend--the extreme difficulty of solving which caused Dualism and Asceticism on the one hand, and neglect of all bodily discipline on the other. Mind and matter must be antagonistic, the work of different beings: man must get rid of his material part to arrive at his true end and perfection.|$|E

60|$|Varied {{were these}} guests that {{gathered}} round old Deleglise's oak. Cabinet Ministers {{reported to be}} in Homburg; Russian Nihilists escaped from Siberia; Italian revolutionaries; high church dignitaries disguised in grey suitings; ex-errand boys, who had discovered that with six strokes of the pen they could set half London laughing at whom they would; raw laddies with the burr yet clinging to their tongues, but who we knew would one day have the people dancing {{to the music of}} their words. Neither wealth, nor birth, nor age, nor position counted. Was a man interesting, amusing; had he <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> of his own? Then he was welcome. Men who had come, men who were coming, met there on equal footing. Among them, as years ago among my schoolmates, I found my place--somewhat to my dissatisfaction. I amused. Much rather would I have shocked them by the originality of my views, impressed them with the depth of my judgments. They declined to be startled, refused to be impressed; instead, they laughed. Nor from these men could I obtain sympathy in my disappointment.|$|E
60|$|She passed {{across the}} opening of the by-street, still walking in the slack way of one who takes the pleasures of the streets. She passed from view; Hilary {{strained}} his eyes to see if Hughs were following. He waited several minutes. The man did not appear. The chase was over! And suddenly it flashed across him that Hughs had merely dogged her to see that she had no assignation with anybody. They had both been playing the same game! He flushed up in that shady little street, in which he was the only person to be seen. Cecilia was right! It was a sordid business. A man more in touch with facts than Hilary would have had some mental pigeonhole into which to put an incident like this; but, being by profession concerned mainly with <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts,</b> he did not quite know where he was. The habit of his mind precluded him from thinking very definitely on any subject except his literary work--precluded him especially in a matter of this sort, so inextricably entwined with that delicate, dim question, the impact of class on class.|$|E

By the same post, I have also received a note from my sister, who is now stopping down at the Kentish rectory where Kea lives with her English relations, and who says, among sundry other pieces of domestic criticism, [...] "What a dainty, charming, lovable girl your pretty little Hawaiian really is, Tom! So gentle and good-natured, and so sweetly pensive! I can hardly believe, myself, there's anything of the cannibal Sandwich Islander in her! She's as fair as I am, and quite as European in all her <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>thoughts</b> and sentiments. When she doesn't talk nonsense about Pélé, in fact, I almost forget she isn't one of ourselves, she's so perfectly English. But the rector says he can't allow her to teach in the Sunday school till she's quite got over that heathenish rubbish. By the way, I shouldn't be surprised if she and her Cousin Hugh were some day to make a nice little match of it, if only Hugh can ever persuade her that it wouldn't be bigamy, and that she isn't already duly married to some ugly, mythical, humpbacked creature of the name of Maloka." ...|$|E
