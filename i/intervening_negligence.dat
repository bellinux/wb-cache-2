5000|$|Contributory {{negligence}} of the aggrieved {{person might}} be a defence. This is sometimes misleadingly called [...] "culpa-compensation," [...] which suggests both some sort of quantitative relation between them, {{and the notion of}} damage to the defendant by the plaintiff, neither of which notions {{has anything to do with}} the matter. The true principle is one of causal connexion. The causal nexus was broken if there intervened, between the culpa of the defendant and the damage, some other cause without which the damage would not have occurred. Where a man wounded another not mortally, who died in consequence of being neglected, he was liable for the wounding but not for the death. But if the original act was wilful it is generally held, though there is no explicit text, that <b>intervening</b> <b>negligence</b> of the injured person was no defence, though there was the same breach of causal nexus. The texts dealing with the case where the intervening event was a wrongful act of a third person present some difficulty, but their doctrine seems to be as follows: Where a slave, wounded by A and then by B, died, if each act would certainly have killed, A had wounded, B had killed. If several wounded and it was clear which killed, he alone was liable for the killing. If it was not made out that one killed, more than another, all were liable for killing. If it was clear that A's wound would have killed, but not clear whether B's would or not, apart from A's previous act, both were liable. But there is much controversy on this. It is generally held that the texts cannot be reconciled.|$|E
