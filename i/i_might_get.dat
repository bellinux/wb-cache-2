500|$|Tony Hadn, a {{volunteer}} for J-FLAG, stated that Williamson was [...] "so courageous. He never stopped to think, 'oh, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> {{in trouble for}} this,' {{so in that sense}} he was very selfless." [...] He was succeeded as J-FLAG's leader by Gareth Williams, who informed press that Williamson [...] "was the only out gay person in Jamaica who had the courage to put his face on television, I was very close to him... His murder was really a traumatic loss for our community." [...] One member of J-FLAG stated that [...] "Brian Williamson is our Martin Luther King". Four days later, J-FLAG held a memorial devoted to Williamson, which was attended by almost two hundred people; the memorial involved personal tributes, poetry slams, and lip synching to Whitney Houston songs.|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E
500|$|That same year, Cooper {{made two}} films with {{director}} and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York, {{one of the}} most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called [...] "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called [...] "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his [...] "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, [...] "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> one of these. That's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll see," [...] said Cynthia. [...] "I've been {{thinking}} {{that might be}} the best way, after all. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not <b>get</b> a school, it's so late." ...|$|R
2500|$|The songs,all {{written by}} Davis herself, are mostly built around funk grooves, driving {{percussion}} and heavy guitars. Davis' vocal stylings are expressive and boisterous (as on [...] "If I'm In Luck <b>I</b> <b>Might</b> <b>Get</b> Picked Up"), but also playful and sensual (as on [...] "Anti Love Song"). On the former she boldly sings [...] "I'm wigglin' my fanny, I'm raunchy dancing, I'm-a-doing it doing it". [...] "Steppin' In Her I. Miller Shoes", {{tells the story}} of a talented young woman who comes to the 'jungle' with big dreams, only to end up a tragic victim of the entertainment industry. The up-tempo song features hard rock guitars and backing vocals by The Pointer Sisters. In a 2007 interview Davis revealed that the song was based on the life of Devon Wilson, a one-time girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix with whom Davis had been close friends. Wilson is also the subject of [...] "Angel" [...] by Hendrix. With their hard-funk/rock-fused sounds, few of the songs catered to radio play; perhaps the closest is [...] "In The Meantime" [...] featuring prominent organ and the most restrained and straightfoward performance on the album.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> one, {{but they}} are all gone now," [...] {{answered}} Wingate, and slouched off, whistling in that peculiar manner of his.|$|E
6000|$|... "Four hundred yards. Nope, I don't risk it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> him, {{and then}} again I mightn't, an' your dad is mighty anxious about the powder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{an offer}} I wouldn't make to every one, Pratt," [...] he concluded. [...] "Just happens I'm rather at a loose end--had a nasty week at Newmarket. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> even <b>get</b> {{you a few}} days down at our place in Norfolk, {{if you know how}} to handle a gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reckon <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>get</b> used to packing my gun all the time," [...] replied Ellen. [...] "Reckon I'll {{be treated}} {{more like a}} man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never a word did Mr. Crow {{say about}} what I'd done toward fixing Foxy so he couldn't do any more mischief, and try as <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>get</b> in a word {{edgewise}} {{in the way of}} explaining that if it hadn't been for me Mr. Man's boy Tommy's dog Towser wouldn't {{have had a chance to}} get the best of Mr. Foxy Fox.|$|R
60|$|Fuzzy was drunk--not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously, as you or <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get,</b> but decently, appropriately, and inoffensively, as {{becomes a}} gentleman {{down on his}} luck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't kick 'cause you praise me," [...] Jake {{replied with}} a laugh; [...] "but don't lay it on too thick for fear <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> proud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think they}} have a sort of idea I'm slacking or something. At any rate, Walkinshaw told me that if I bucked up <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> tried again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh; that I {{have not}} at all thought of;--probably to India, as <b>I</b> <b>might</b> manage to <b>get</b> a {{regiment}} there. But in truth it would matter very little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I was calc'latin' {{to go to}} Lumberville this week, anyway, to buy {{a carpet}} and a chamber set. <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>might</b> 's well <b>get</b> the money today." ...|$|R
6000|$|So the {{acquaintance}} became {{closer and}} closer, {{and at last}} Will ventured to say: “If I were back in England, mademoiselle, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>get</b> your Lucien out. You could give me his name and the prison {{in which he is}} confined, and it would be hard if I could not manage to aid him to escape.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} there's nowt else," [...] the boy said, [...] "except perhaps some day I might, perhaps--but it ain't likely--but <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> to be a viewer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll push {{right on}} by the Traverse. There's a ranch I should make by {{daylight}} where <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a mount. I'm {{going to see the}} thing through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. Chauncy; [...] "and that is {{the very}} reason I like my ticket. If I had yours, I should be afraid <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> the prize." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too bad {{it began}} to snow so heavily just as I was {{climbing}} the tree," [...] remarked Gif. [...] "If it hadn't been for that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have <b>gotten</b> quite a view and maybe located the bungalow without difficulty. However, this {{may prove to be}} the right trail after all. Come on, before it gets dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} object to the drawbacks," [...] said the doctor's niece, [...] "presuming them to be of some use; but <b>I</b> fear <b>I</b> <b>might</b> fail in <b>getting</b> on so well with the privileges." ...|$|R
60|$|I had a hope, {{which was}} not quite strong {{enough to be a}} belief, that, {{supported}} by their life-preservers, the two women might paddle themselves along; and that, by giving them in turn a helping hand, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> eventually <b>get</b> them to the steamer. There was a strong probability that I would not succeed, but I did not care to think of that.|$|R
60|$|ANNIE. Oh! no, Miss; from you. You see, I've got a {{young man}} that wants to marry me. And if I don't let him, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> into trouble meself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{come in for}} a drink {{presently}} myself," [...] Laverick declared. [...] "I {{should like}} to see them. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> an idea as to their nationality, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{forgotten}} about the water, but the hatch is smashed," [...] he said. [...] "I expect they dropped the boat upon it in heaving her out. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> down that way." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when at last}} I mounted my wheel I {{sped away}} rapidly towards the north. I had ordered my baggage {{expressed}} to a town fifty miles away, and I hoped that if I rode steadily and kept my eyes straight {{in front of me}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> safely <b>get</b> out of Cathay, for the boundaries of that fateful territory could not extend themselves indefinitely.|$|R
6000|$|Hodder {{turned his}} eyes from her face. [...] "Miss Marcy has been lonely," [...] he explained, [...] "and <b>I</b> thought we <b>might</b> <b>get</b> her a room near by, where she might see them often. She {{is going to do}} embroidery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there goes}} the captain to his cabin now. If I am going to warn him <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>get</b> the beastly job over for I have little stomach {{to talk with the}} brute at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of the West-coast mailboats call at Dakar. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> {{the coal}} and a {{schooner}} on a bond there. Of course, {{the people would}} want a heavy profit under the circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot," [...] he replied. [...] "I should plead guilty--Mr. Dobson {{says that}} if I plead guilty, counsel can plead extenuating circumstances--intense {{provocation}} and so forth--and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a more lenient sentence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw some}} fish in here some weeks ago," [...] he explained. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a couple for breakfast. But you lads {{will have to}} wait until I strike luck." ...|$|E
60|$|I answered, laughing, that <b>I</b> {{thought we}} <b>might</b> <b>get</b> through {{it in that}} time, but that he must come also; for he would find that his renown had preceded him, {{and that he was}} almost as great a personage as I was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two-fifty, to be precise. My sister {{took your}} clothes away to mend. Now, it's {{possible}} that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> manage to <b>get</b> {{you into the}} office of some lumber or general trading company {{in one of the}} cities. How would that do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, then, on {{the other}} hand," [...] said Albert, [...] "I should run some risk of {{embarrassing}} myself, if things did not turn out well. If I were to be sick, so that I could not attend to so much business, or if I should Jose any of my stock, or if the crops should not do well, then <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not <b>get</b> enough {{to pay back the}} debt." ...|$|R
