25|$|The jaw {{muscles of}} Sebecus were likely {{similar to those}} of living crocodilians, but the distinctively deep skull of Sebecus {{indicates}} that the muscles were longer. In Sebecus, the shape of the skull and jaws provides more room for adductor muscles, or muscles that close the jaws. The supratemporal fenestrae {{at the top of the}} skull are relatively wide, allowing for the passage of large muscles. In crocodilians, the <b>depressor</b> muscle that opens the jaws originates near the top of the skull and inserts into a projection at the back of the jaw called the retroarticular process. Living crocodilians have a straight retroarticular process at the back of the jaw and a low point of origin for the <b>depressor</b> muscle. Sebecus, with its deeper skull, has a higher point of origin for the <b>depressor,</b> but the retroarticular process curves upward to make the length of the <b>depressor</b> about the same as it is in crocodilians. Like living crocodilians, the <b>depressor</b> muscle of Sebecus was relatively underdeveloped. Therefore, while the closure of the jaws would have been very strong, the ability to open the jaws would be much weaker.|$|E

Its anterior portion, the thickest part of the muscle, depresses the lower jaw; it also serves to draw down the lower lip and angle of the mouth in the expression of melancholy, i.e. surprise or horror. However, the platysma plays only a minor role in depressing the lip which is primarily performed by the <b>depressor</b> anguli oris and the <b>depressor</b> labii inferioris by Dr. Hardy Franklin.|$|E

25|$|The jaws were {{apparently}} operated by relatively weak muscles. Ouranosaurus had only small temporal openings behind the eyes, {{from which the}} larger capiti-mandibularis muscle {{was attached to the}} coronoid process on the lower jaw bone. Small rounded horns in front of its eyes made Ouranosaurus the only known horned ornithopod. The back of the skull was rather narrow and could not compensate for the lack of a greater area of attachment for the jaw muscle, that the openings normally would provide, allowing for more power and a stronger bite. A lesser muscle, the musculus <b>depressor</b> mandibulae, used to open the lower jaws, was located {{at the back of the}} skull and was connected to a strongly projecting, broad and anteriorly oblique processus paroccipitalis. Ouranosaurus probably used its teeth to chew up tough plant food. A diet has been suggested of leaves, fruit, and seeds as the chewing would allow to free more energy from high quality food; the wide beak on the other hand indicates a specialisation in eating large amounts of low quality fodder. Ouranosaurus lived in a river delta.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{clinical}} practice, physicians personally assess {{patients in}} order to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with {{an examination of the}} patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g. stethoscope, tongue <b>depressor)</b> are typically used. After examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g. blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts {{is an important part of}} the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions. Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.|$|E
25|$|Research on the catecholamines was {{interwoven}} {{with research}} on their receptors. In 1904, Dale became {{head of the}} Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratory in London and started research on ergot extracts. The relevance of his communication in 1906 ″On some physiological actions of ergot″ lies less in {{the effects of the}} extracts given alone than in their interaction with adrenaline: they reversed the normal pressor effect of adrenaline to a <b>depressor</b> effect and the normal contraction effect on the early-pregnant cat’s uterus to relaxation: adrenaline reversal. The pressor and uterine contraction effects of pituitary extracts, in contrast, remained unchanged, as did the effects of adrenaline on the heart and effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Dale clearly saw the specificity of the ″paralytic″ (antagonist) effect of ergot for ″the so-called myoneural junctions connected with the true sympathetic or thoracic-lumbar division of the autonomic nervous system″ – the adrenoceptors. He also saw its specificity for the ″myoneural junctions″ mediating smooth muscle contraction as opposed to those mediating smooth muscle relaxation. But there he stopped. He did not conceive any close relationship between the smooth muscle-inhibitory and the cardiac sites of action of catecholamines.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Adequate neck contour {{is one of}} {{the goals}} in facial rejuvenation. In some patients, {{treating}} the submandibular salivary gland (SMSG) ensures a satisfying result. Hematoma, sialoma, and paralysis of the <b>depressors</b> of the lower lip may occur when the deep neck is approached. The objective of this work is to present a new tactic to prevent the aforementioned complications. Two hundred forty consecutive neck lift patients with partial resection of the SMSG were studied. The tactic consisted of placing sutures to facilitate the retraction of the platysma muscle and the accompanying marginal mandibular and cervical branches of the facial nerve during the resection of the SMSG. It also included stitches that bring the platysma muscle in contact with the remaining SMSG, sealing the dissected area. The first 25 (control) subjects did not undergo the tactic; the remaining 215 (study group) did. The occurrence of paralysis of the <b>depressors</b> of the lower lip and of hematoma and sialoma originating from the SMSG resection was observed. When comparing the control group with the study group, the rates of hematoma (8 % vs 0 %) and sialoma (24 % vs 0 %) were significantly higher in the former. Paralysis of the <b>depressors</b> of the lower lip also had a higher rate in the control group (4 % vs 0. 9 %) although this difference was not statistically significant. The surgical tactic described is efficient in preventing the occurrence of hematoma, sialoma, and paralysis of the <b>depressors</b> of the lower lip in neck lift with partial resection of the SMSG...|$|R
500|$|Insects and spiders {{were taken}} from {{decaying}} wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups. The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its adze-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood, while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by [...] "gaping" [...] motions. There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature {{of the head and}} neck between males and females. Huia had very well developed <b>depressor</b> jaw muscles, and an occipital crest that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force. Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.|$|E

60|$|The {{explanation}} of the contraction of this muscle, {{under the influence of}} low spirits or dejection, apparently follows from the same general principles {{as in the case of}} the obliquity of the eyebrows. Dr. Duchenne informs me that he concludes from his observations, now prolonged during many years, that this is one of the facial muscles which is least under the control of the will. This fact may indeed be inferred from what has just been stated with respect to infants when doubtfully beginning to cry, or endeavouring to stop crying; for they then generally command all the other facial muscles more effectually than they do the <b>depressors</b> of the corners of the mouth. Two excellent observers who had no theory on the subject, one of them a surgeon, carefully watched for me some older children and women as with some opposed struggling they very gradually approached the point of bursting out into tears; and both observers felt sure that the <b>depressors</b> began to act before any of the other muscles. Now as the <b>depressors</b> have been repeatedly brought into strong action during infancy in many generations, nerve-force will tend to flow, on the principle of long associated habit, to these muscles as well as to various other facial muscles, whenever in after life even a slight feeling of distress is experienced. But as the <b>depressors</b> are somewhat less under the control of the will than most of the other muscles, we might expect that they would often slightly contract, whilst the others remained passive. It is remarkable how small a depression of the corners of the mouth gives to the countenance an expression of low spirits or dejection, so that an extremely slight contraction of these muscles would be sufficient to betray this state of mind.|$|R

From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for transference.|$|E

2500|$|Situated {{beneath the}} mandibles, paired maxillae {{manipulate}} food during mastication. Maxillae can have hairs and [...] "teeth" [...] along their inner margins. At the outer margin, the galea is a cupped or scoop-like structure, which sits over {{the outer edge}} of the labium. They also have palps, which are used to sense the characteristics of potential foods. The maxillae occupy a lateral position, one on each side of the head behind the mandibles. The proximal part of the maxilla consists of a basal cardo, which has a single articulation with the head, and a flat plate, the stipes, hinged to the cardo. Both cardo and stipes are loosely joined to the head by membrane so they are capable of movement. Distally on the stipes are two lobes, an inner lacinea and an outer galea, one or both of which may be absent. More laterally on the stipes is a jointed, leglike palp made up of a number of segments; in Orthoptera there are five. Anterior and posterior rotator muscles are inserted on the cardo, and ventral adductor muscles arising on the tentorium are inserted on both cardo and stipes. Arising in the stipes are flexor muscles of lacinea and galea and another lacineal flexor arises in the cranium, but neither the lacinea nor the galea has an extensor muscle. The palp has levator and <b>depressor</b> muscles arising in the stipes, and each segment of the palp has a single muscle causing flexion of the next segment.|$|E

60|$|When infants scream they firmly {{contract}} {{the muscles}} round their eyes, and this draws up the upper lip; {{and as they}} have to keep their mouths widely open, the <b>depressor</b> muscles running to the corners are likewise brought into strong action. This generally, but not invariably, causes a slight angular bend in the lower lip on both sides, near {{the corners of the}} mouth. The result of the upper and lower lip being thus acted on is that the mouth assumes a squarish outline. The contraction of the <b>depressor</b> muscle is best seen in infants when not screaming violently, and especially just before they begin, or when they cease to scream. Their little faces then acquire an extremely piteous expression, as I continually observed with my own infants between the ages of about six weeks and two or three months. Sometimes, when they are struggling against a crying-fit, the outline of the mouth is curved in so exaggerated a manner as to be like a horseshoe; and the expression of misery then becomes a ludicrous caricature.|$|E

60|$|The Mandibles (Pl.

In the same individual there is not unfrequently one tooth, more or less, {{on opposite sides of}} the mouth. Internally, the mandibles are furnished on their outer and inner sides with several ligamentous apodemes, in Lithotrya roughened with points (Pl. X, fig. 2), for the attachment of the muscles; of these (fig. 1), there is a chief <b>depressor</b> and elevator, attached at their lower ends to near the basal fold of the mouth, and a lateral muscle, attached to the broad basal end of the palpi, and serving, apparently, to oppose the edge of mandible to mandible. The Maxillæ in the different genera (Pl. X, figs. 9 to 15) differ considerably in outline; they are generally about half the size of the mandibles; at the upper corner, there are always two or three spines larger than the others, and often separated from them by a notch; the rest of the spinose edge is straight, or irregular, or step-formed, or with the lowest part projecting, or with one or two narrow prominences bearing fine spines. All these spines, quite differently from the teeth of the mandibles, are articulated on the edge of the organ, and stand in a double row. At a point corresponding with the upper articulation of the mandibles, a long, thin, narrow, rigid apodeme, projects inwards (fig. 10), and running down nearly parallel to the thin, outer, flexible membrane of the mouth, is attached to the corium, and thus serves as a support to the whole organ. This apodeme is embedded in muscles (Pl. X, fig. 10); there are other large muscles attached to the inner side of the organ, and again others running laterally towards the mandibles. The apodeme, of course, is moulted with the integuments of the mouth. The Outer Maxillæ (Pl. X, figs. 16, 17) serve as a lower lip; they are thicker than the other trophi; they have their inner surfaces clothed with spines, sometimes divided into an upper and lower group, and occasionally separated by a deep notch: there are often long bristles outside. They are furnished with at least two muscles; in sessile Cirripedes I have seen that they are capable of a rapid to and fro movement, and I have no doubt that their function is to brush any small creature, caught by the cirri, towards the maxillæ, which are well adapted to aid in securing the prey, and to hand it over to the mandibles, by them to be forced down the oesophagus. On the exterior face of the outer maxillæ, above a trace of an upper articulation, either two small orifices or two large tubular projections can always be discovered; and these, as will presently be mentioned, I believe to be olfactory organs.|$|E
