He then broke his tibia in a Club World Cup match in Yokohama against Al Sadd. Doctors said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out of action {{for up to six}} months, but this {{eventually}} led to him missing the entire 2011–12 season with both Barcelona and the Spanish football team at Euro 2012.|$|E

5|$|Barrons' position, as of February 2011, was as Assistant Chief of the General Staff. In May 2011 {{he became}} Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations) in {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general. On 24 January 2013 {{it was announced that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed Commander Joint Forces Command in April 2013. As of 2015, Barrons was paid a salary of between £175,000 and £179,999 by the department, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time. In April 2016, he handed over command of Joint Forces Command to General Sir Christopher Deverell.|$|E
5|$|DeVeber did {{not serve}} long either as {{minister}} or Member of the Legislative Assembly: having received word that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed to the Senate, he resigned from cabinet on March 1, 1906—exactly four months after his appointment—and from the legislature March 7. He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{gained the}} {{position}} of revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick in 1838. This required him to travel to Northern England twice a year. Jane often complained about these trips, but Hogg enjoyed visiting the north.

Milligan wrote eight issues of Justice League Dark, with writer Jeff Lemire taking over on issue nine.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Narayan was hospitalised. A {{few hours}} before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put on a ventilator, he was {{planning}} on writing his next novel, {{a story about a}} grandfather. As he was always very selective about his choice of notebooks, he asked N. Ram to get him one. However, Narayan did not get better and never started the novel. He died on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.|$|E
5|$|Just before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arraigned, {{he drove}} {{into a field}} and shot himself, leaving behind {{a wife and two}} children. His was one of four suicides by Looking Glass targets. Critics {{wondered}} if these suicides, which investigators had said they expected, were worth it. In 1999, Comfort also took his own life, citing despondency over the stresses of his job.|$|E

Vick's mother, Brenda, accepted the award from the Afterschool Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{started the}} 2003 season 4–4, but lost their final eight games. With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with team management, and asked, if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fired, that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of}} the season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{marked the}} last {{attempt by the}} French Navy to launch an {{invasion}} of {{any part of the}} British Isles. It also ended the last hopes the United Irishmen had of obtaining outside support in their struggle with the British. After the action, Tone was recognised aboard the captured French flagship and arrested. He was brought ashore by the British at Buncrana, on the Inishowen Peninsula. He was later tried for treason, convicted, and committed suicide while in prison in Dublin, hours before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hanged.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce had {{requested}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried {{with his sister}} and daughter at Stoke Newington, just north of London. However, the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey. The family agreed and, on 3 August 1833, Wilberforce {{was buried in the}} north transept, close to his friend William Pitt. The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament, as well as by members of the public. The pallbearers included the Duke of Gloucester, the Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham and the Speaker of the House of Commons Charles Manners-Sutton.|$|E
5|$|Achieving her {{objective}} was, however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared to accept}} reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> burned at the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E
50|$|However, Cel {{was behind}} the Branwyn's Tears {{incident}} in LA. In punishment, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confined for six months after being coated with the oil himself, something akin to torture.|$|R

5|$|Bristol Rovers {{denied that}} they were {{interested}} in signing Fortune-West in June 2003, before Doncaster Rovers of the Third Division signed him on a two-year contract. His first season with the club, 2003–04, saw him score 12 goals in 43 appearances as they won the Third Division championship, earning promotion to the Second Division. During this season, he formed a strike partnership with Gregg Blundell. Fortune-West suffered a knee injury caused by wear and tear to the knee joint in October 2004, which resulted in him undergoing surgery, before returning to the team in March 2005. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> offered a new deal in April 2005 and finished the season with 7 goals in 28 appearances. The 2005–06 season was his last with Doncaster, as he was released after scoring 4 goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} title, Hill learned before the season's close that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dropped by Williams {{in favour of}} Frentzen for the {{following}} season. Hill left Williams as the team's second most successful driver {{in terms of race}} victories, with 21, second only to Mansell. Hill's 1996 world championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, making him one of only three people to receive the award twice – the others being boxer Henry Cooper and Mansell. Hill was also awarded the Segrave Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.|$|E
5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed {{the outbreak of the}} revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E
50|$|Ivan Marchenko {{is not on}} the Most Wanted Nazis list. Marchenko, if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> caught, {{would be}} 103 years old as of 2014, and {{therefore}} unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought <b>to</b> trial.|$|R
