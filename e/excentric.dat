5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most <b>excentric</b> variant in that the ounce was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike {{in the rest of the}} Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, is interesting because 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an ounce.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1994 the President and Board of Trustees of Middlebury College adopted a “One Percent for Art” policy. This {{decision}} set aside {{one percent of the}} cost of any renovation or new construction at the College for the purchase, installation, maintenance, and interpretation of works of art publicly displayed on campus. There are 19 works in Middlebury's campus public art collection, including Frisbee, George Rickey's Two Open Rectangles, <b>Excentric,</b> Variation VI, Tony Smith's Smog, and a version of Robert Indiana's Love series. The collection also includes works by Dan Graham, Scott Burton, Jules Olitski, Joseph Bueys, Matt Mullican, Jenny Holzer, Christian Petersen, Buky Schwartz, George Rickey, Clement Meadmore, and Jonathan Borofsky.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Fabiola Hinojosa, of Televisa Espectáculos stated that the album [...] "shows that despite being a rocker at heart, she has no problem recording in another genre and experiment with new rhythms." [...] Hinojosa also praised the rock song [...] "No Puedo Parar", arguing that [...] "if someone who never before had heard another song from her would believe that she [...] only performs in the rock genre". Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo said that [...] "Guzmán is back and wants to reclaim her place on the music market." [...] Rodríguez also reminded that Guzmán keeps trying to incorporate new or alternative rhythms to her music even if the results are not commercially successful, such as her albums Cambio de Piel (1996) produced by Spanish musician Carlos Narea, or Lipstick (2004), helmed by American artist Desmond Child, and A + No Poder is no exception, since the [...] "Queen of Rock in Mexico" [...] includes songs that [...] "hark back to {{the era of the}} nineties, but so potentiated with harder songs where the guitars, drums and her hoarse voice come together in musical chords." [...] Alex Alexdy of Hey Espectáculos referred to this album as a [...] "well balance between rock and pop" [...] that shows Guzmán's <b>excentric</b> side who opted for a rock album with some ballads and new rhythms such as reggaeton.|$|E
40|$|We {{attempt to}} grasp the {{mathematics}} behind the planetary theories of the Syrian astronomer Ibn al-Shatir (1304 - 1375) in his treatise Nihayat al-Sul. Following the Maragha school of astronomers, by composing circular movements with constant angular velocity, Ibn al-Shatir attains two goals. He eliminates the need of <b>excentrics</b> and equant points in astronomy; but he also describes longitudes and latitudes with a unique method, with no more orbs than what is strictly necessary to the longitudes. A better understanding of rotation as a spatial transformation enables this ultimate economy of thought. In our commentary, we take Venus as an example offering an interesting problem about the latitudes. It {{is the opportunity to}} give the edition of the chapter of the Nihayat al-Sul dedicated to the latitudes of Mercury and Venus. Comment: 32 pages, in French, 10 figures.

5000|$|According to The Engineer of 1890:The Agenoria has upright {{cylinders}} working half-beams, {{thus reducing}} {{the stroke of}} the pistons to the cranks. The cylinders are 7 ½ in. diameter, with a stroke of 3 ft. There is a parallel motion to the piston-rod, and the feed pump is worked {{from one of the}} half-beams. The fire is within a large tubular boiler, branching into two tubes, with the chimney {{at the end of the}} boiler, the barrel of which is 10ft. long and 4ft. diameter. The <b>excentrics</b> for driving the slides are loose on the axle, with a clutch to drive either way, and there is hand gear to the valves to cause the axle to turn half round to bring the right clutch into action. The exhaust steam is discharged into the chimney, but it does not necessarily follow that it acted as a steam blast. Indeed, the great height given to the chimney can have no other object than to create the required draught. The driving wheels are 4 ft. diameter, and there are coupling rods to the front wheels, which are provided with springs.|$|R

6000|$|... 249. I now {{proceeded}} {{to compare the}} effect of similar and dissimilar poles upon iron and copper, adopting for the purpose Mr. Sturgeon's very useful form of Arago's experiment. This consists in a circular plate of metal supported in a vertical plane by a horizontal axis, and weighted a little at one edge or rendered <b>excentric</b> so as to vibrate like a pendulum. The poles of the magnets are applied near the side and edges of these plates, and then the number of vibrations, required to reduce the vibrating arc a certain constant quantity, noted. In the first description of this instrument[A] {{it is said that}} opposite poles produced the greatest retarding effect, and similar poles none; and yet within a page of the place the effect is considered as of the same kind with that produced in iron.|$|E
60|$|Strange, {{that while}} the earth {{preserved}} her monotonous course, I dwelt with ever-renewing wonder on her antique laws, and now that with <b>excentric</b> wheel she rushed into an untried path, I should feel this spirit fade; I struggled with despondency and weariness, but like a fog, they choked me. Perhaps, after the labours and stupendous excitement of the past summer, the calm of winter and the almost menial toils it brought with it, were by natural re-action doubly irksome. It was not the grasping passion of the preceding year, which gave life and individuality to each moment--it was not the aching pangs induced by the distresses of the times. The utter inutility that had attended all my exertions took from them their usual effects of exhilaration, and despair rendered abortive the balm of self applause--I longed to return to my old occupations, but of what use were they? To read were futile--to write, vanity indeed. The earth, late wide circus for the display of dignified exploits, vast theatre for a magnificent drama, now presented a vacant space, an empty stage--for actor or spectator {{there was no longer}} aught to say or hear.|$|E
6000|$|The last volume {{which he}} published, {{that on the}} Philosophy of Mathematics, is in some respects a still sadder picture of {{intellectual}} degeneracy than those which preceded it. After the admirable résumé of the subject in {{the first volume of}} his first great work, we expected something of the very highest order {{when he returned to the}} subject for a more thorough treatment of it. But, being the commencement of a Synthèse Subjective, it contains, as might be expected, a great deal that is much more subjective than mathematical. Nor of this do we complain: but we little imagined of what nature this subjective matter was to be. M. Comte here joins together the two ideas, which, of all that he has put forth, are the most repugnant to the fundamental principles of Positive Philosophy. One of them is that on which we have just commented, the assimilation between Positivism and Fetishism. The other, of which we took notice in a former article, was the [...] "liberté facultative" [...] of shaping our scientific conceptions to gratify the demands not solely of objective truth, but of intellectual and aesthetic suitability. It would be an excellent thing, M. Comte thinks, if science could be deprived of its sécheresse, and directly associated with sentiment. Now it is impossible to prove that the external world, and the bodies composing it, are not endowed with feeling, and voluntary agency. It is therefore highly desirable that we should educate ourselves into imagining that they are. Intelligence it will not do to invest them with, for some distinction must be maintained between simple activity and life. But we may suppose that they feel what is done to them, and desire and will what they themselves do. Even intelligence, which we must deny to them in the present, may be attributed to them in the past. Before man existed, the earth, at that time an intelligent being, may have exerted [...] "its physico-chemical activity so as to improve the astronomical order by changing its principal coefficients. Our planet may be supposed to have rendered its orbit less <b>excentric,</b> and thereby more habitable, by planning a long series of explosions, analogous to those from which, according to the best hypotheses, comets proceed. Judiciously reproduced, similar shocks may have rendered the inclination of the earth's axis better adapted to the future wants of the Grand Etre. A fortiori the Earth may have modified its own figure, which is only beyond our intervention because our spiritual ascendancy has not at its disposal a sufficient material force." [...] The like may be conceived as having been done by each of the other planets, in concert, possibly, with the Earth and with one another. [...] "In proportion as each planet improved its own condition, its life exhausted itself by excess of innervation; but with the consolation of rendering its self-devotion more efficacious, when the extinction of its special functions, first animal, and finally vegetative, reduced it to the universal attributes of feeling and activity."[25] This stuff, though he calls it fiction, he soon after speaks of as belief (croyance), to be greatly recommended, as at once satisfying our natural curiosity, and [...] "perfecting our unity" [...] (again unity!) [...] "by supplying the gaps in our scientific notions with poetic fictions, and developing sympathetic emotions and aesthetic inspirations: the world being conceived as aspiring to second mankind in ameliorating the universal order under the impulse of the Grand Etre." [...] And he obviously intends that we should be trained to make these fantastical inventions permeate all our associations, until we are incapable of conceiving the world and Nature apart from them, and they become equivalent to, and are in fact transformed into, real beliefs.|$|E
