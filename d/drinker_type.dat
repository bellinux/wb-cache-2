40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of using nipple drinkers during brooding on the performance of Large White turkeys. There were 6 different drinkers tested: the control and 5 nipple drinker systems. The control was the Plasson Drinker and the nipple systems tested were the Plasson Easy Start (PES), Val-Co Turkey Drinker (VC), Lubing Traditional Nipple (LTN), Lubing EasyLine (LEL) and ZiggityTM Big-Z Activator (BZ). Three experiments were conducted with turkeys brooded using the 6 drinker types. Some nipple drinker treatments were used in the rearing periods. At 20 wk, Body Weight (BW) was reduced for toms brooded to 6 wk on the LTN and brooded and reared on the VC. The use of LEL and LTN (during brooding) resulted in improved Feed Conversion (FC) at 20 wk. Trial 2 -experiment 1 with hens of two strains was terminated at 3 wk because of excessive mortality from dehydration with some drinker types. In trial 2 -experiment 2, there were no poult hydration issues. The BW of hens at 6 wk brooded on the Plasson Drinker and the VC were higher compared to the BW of hens brooded on the PES and the BZ with the BW of hens on the LEL being intermediate. The use of the LTN resulted in significantly lower hen BW compared with all other drinkers through 10 wk. By 16 wk, there were no longer differences in hen BW due to <b>drinker</b> <b>type.</b> <b>Drinker</b> <b>type</b> did not have an effect on hen FC. Nipple drinkers can be used effectively to brood turkeys with some types also being useful during the rearing period. However, poor quality, inactive, or diseased poults may be at risk for dehydration on some nipple drinker systems...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the association between}} consumption of different alcoholic beverages and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of the baseline data of the DiSA-UMH study, an ongoing cohort study with Spanish health science students (n =  1098) aged 17 - 35 years. Dietary information was collected by a validated 84 -item food frequency questionnaire. Participants were grouped into non-drinkers, exclusive beer and/or wine drinkers and <b>drinkers</b> of all <b>types</b> of alcoholic beverages. Mediterranean diet adherence was determined by using a modification of the relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMED; score range: 0 - 16) according to consumption of 8 dietary components. We performed multiple linear and multinomial regression analyses. Results: The mean alcohol consumption was 4. 3  g/day (SD: 6. 1). A total of 19. 5 %, 18. 9 % and 61. 6 % {{of the participants were}} non-drinkers, exclusive beer and/or wine drinkers and <b>drinkers</b> of all <b>types</b> of alcoholic beverages, respectively. Participants who consumed beer and/or wine exclusively had higher rMED scores than non-drinkers (β: 0. 76, 95 %CI: 0. 25 - 1. 27). <b>Drinkers</b> of all <b>types</b> of alcoholic beverages had similar rMED scores to non-drinkers. Non-drinkers consumed less fish and more meat, whereas <b>drinkers</b> of all <b>types</b> of alcoholic beverages consumed fewer fruits, vegetables and more meat than exclusive beer and/or wine drinkers. Conclusions: The overall alcohol consumption among the students in our study was low-to-moderate. Exclusive beer and/or wine drinkers differed regarding the Mediterranean diet pattern from non-drinkers and <b>drinkers</b> of all <b>types</b> of alcohol.

40|$|AbstractDual process {{accounts}} of the alcohol-behaviour link hypothesise that differences in drinking patterns will moderate the effects of exposure to alcohol-related cues on behaviour, such as when a placebo is administered. We test this hypothesis by adapting a paradigm used in alcohol myopia research {{to examine the effects}} of alcohol-related priming on self-enhancement behaviour amongst social drinkers. Participants were asked to engage in a computerised self-rating task prior to being exposed to alcohol related and/or motivational primes. A staged computer error then occurred, and participants were then asked to complete their self ratings again – this method allowed for an immediate assessment of the impact of alcohol and motivational primes on self enhancement. As predicted by alcohol myopia theory, the overall effect of priming with alcohol-related cues was not significant irrespective of response-conflict manipulations. However, <b>drinker</b> <b>type</b> moderated this effect such that heavier drinkers self-enhanced more after exposure to alcohol-related cues, but only in high-conflict conditions. This suggests that the efficacy of a placebo may be significantly moderated by individual differences in reactions to alcohol-related stimuli, and that dual process {{accounts of}} the effects of alcohol on behaviour better explains this variation than alcohol myopia theory...|$|E

40|$|The {{link between}} {{individual}} earnings {{and alcohol use}} has never been investigated in Finland. The aim of this thesis is to add a missing piece into the existing alcohol use literature by providing the first study on this matter. The study {{is based on an}} empirical analysis that utilizes data from the Finnish Drinking Habits Survey 2008. Individual earnings information has been connected to the survey data from the national taxation register. The empirical analysis is conducted using multiple separate OLS-models to account for different aspects of the alcohol-earnings relationship. According to the results of the analysis, alcohol use is strongly correlated with earnings and several interesting findings were made. First, drinkers earn more than abstainers. Second, the relationship between alcohol use and earnings follows an inverse u-shaped path, with peak earnings taking place at 2. 6 drinks per day for men and at 1. 2 drinks per day for women. In addition, the number of intoxication is negatively correlated with earnings for men, but the same correlation does not exist for women. The results revealed that alcohol-earnings relationship also differs between socioeconomic positions and different <b>drinker</b> <b>types.</b> Wine <b>drinkers</b> earn 5 percent more than beer drinkers and 15 percent more of generic drinkers and some indication about the beneficial effects of drinking in a social manner was also found.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that arterial stiffness, an important marker of cardiovascular health, is associated with alcohol consumption. However, the role of longer-term consumption patterns in the progression of arterial stiffness over time remains unclear. A longitudinal cohort design {{was used to evaluate}} the association between alcohol consumption over 25  years and subsequent changes in arterial stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data (N= 3869; 73 % male) were drawn from the Whitehall II cohort study of British civil servants, in which participants completed repeat pulse wave velocity assessments of arterial stiffness across a 4 - to 5 -year interval. Repeated alcohol intake measurements were used to categorize participants into alcohol consumer types, accounting for longitudinal variability in consumption. Sex-stratified linear mixed-effects modeling was used to investigate whether <b>drinker</b> <b>types</b> differed in their relationship to pulse wave velocity and its progression over time. Males with consistent long-term heavy intake > 112  g of ethanol/week had significantly higher baseline pulse wave velocity (b= 0. 26  m/s; P= 0. 045) than those who drank consistently moderately (1 - 112  g of ethanol/week). Male former drinkers showed significantly greater increases in arterial stiffness longitudinally compared to consistently moderate drinkers (b= 0. 11  m/s; P= 0. 009). All associations were nonsignificant for females after adjustment for body mass index, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, diabetes mellitus, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that consistently heavy alcohol consumption is associated with higher cardiovascular risk, especially among males, and also provides new insights into the potential impact of changes in drinking levels over time. It discusses the additional insights possible when capturing longitudinal consumption patterns in lieu of reliance on recent intake alone.

University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, College of Arts and Sciences, Sarasota, FL 34243 Background: Previously, alcohol expectancies {{have been}} {{measured}} by using words. Word {{studies have shown}} expectancies to be correlated with drinking, and words have been manipulated in true experiments to show causal influence on alcohol consumption. Pictures were used rather than words in this task. Pictures may capture a more broad variety of responses when looking at individual differences in the expectancy processes influencing drinking. Method: 157 undergraduate students were presented with 32 images of drinking behaviors {{as part of a}} card sort task. The images showed positive, negative, and neutral images. Participants were asked to sort images into categories and then label the categories. The task had three purposes: 1) to test whether, like words, pictures could be mapped as memory networks, 2) to determine how these images were organized in memory, and 3) to determine any individual differences between non-, light, and heavy drinkers in memory organization of the images. Results: 1) Demonstrating face validity, pictures with similar content were grouped together. 2) Similar to the organization of alcohol expectancy words, images were organized based on the affective dimensions of valence and arousal. 3) There were only slight differences between <b>drinker</b> <b>types.</b> These differences tended to be in images with social/sexual content. Conclusion: Results 1 and 2 support future investigation of alcohol expectancies as images rather than words. However, there should be more focus on social and sexual images. Also, future studies should examine qualitative differences in the labeling of image categories...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract 1. Feather pecking {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} facing the egg industry in non-cage systems and is set to become even more of an issue with the European Union ban on the keeping of laying hens in barren battery cages which comes into force in 2012 and a UK ban on beak-trimming in 2011. Reducing feather pecking without resorting to beak treatment is an important goal for the poultry industry. 2. We report here a longitudinal study that included over 335, 500 birds from 22 free range and organic laying farms. Accelerated failure time models and proportional hazards models were used to examine the effects of a wide range of factors (management, environment and bird) on development of substantial feather damage in lay. Particular emphasis was placed on risk factors during rear and on practices that could feasibly be changed or implemented. 3. The age at which a flock exhibits substantial feather damage could be predicted both by factors in the environment and by early symptoms in the birds themselves. Factors that were associated with earlier onset of severe feather damage included the presence of chain feeders, raised levels of carbon dioxide and ammonia, higher sound and light levels, particularly in younger birds. Increased levels of feather damage (even very slight) in birds at 17 - 20 weeks of age was also highly predictive of the time of onset of severe feather damage during lay. Raised levels of feed intake also indicated that a flock was at risk of early severe feather damage. 4. Birds that stayed on the same farm for rear and lay showed later onset of serious feather damage than those that experienced a change in farm from rear to lay. However, an increased number of changes between rear and lay (e. g. feeder type, <b>drinker</b> <b>type,</b> light levels etc) was not associated with earlier onset of serious feather damage. Further research needs to be done on the role of the transition from rear to lay as a risk factor for FP in lay. Keywords Feather pecking, alternate systems, risk predictio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} experiments which investigated the water use of growing/finishing pigs (25 - 90 kg), newly weaned pigs (5 - 12 kg) and gestating sows. <b>Drinker</b> <b>type</b> was found to affect water use in growing pigs. For example significantly more water (28 %) was used from Mono-flo nipple drinkers than Arato bite drinkers (P< 0. 01). For all classes of pigs studied water use was significantly increased by increasing the water delivery rate. The percent increase in water use over the extremes of water delivery rate tested in individual trials were respectively: ration fed growing pigs, 105 % (300 - 900 cm³ /min P< 0. 001); ad libitum fed growing pigs, 52 % (200 - 1100 cm³/min P< 0. 01); gestating sows, 25 % (500 - 2500 cm³/min P< 0 : 01); and newly weaned pigs 109 % (175 - 700 cm³ /min P< 0. 001). In newly weaned piglets, increasing the water delivery rate from 175 to 700 cm³/min resulted in a significant increase in feed intake (44 g/piglet/day, P< 0. 001) and growth rate (37 g/piglet/day, P< 0. 01). For growing pigs (27 - 55 kg), a relationship was established between water intake, feed intake and liveweight, from which it could be hypothesised that the pig had a limit to daily volumetric intake. This was found to be 12. 0 ± 1. 2 % of liveweight. When feed intake was restricted, water intake increased to maintain the 12 % volumetric limit. This hypothesis was validated from other published work extending the weight range to 105 kg. Evidence was produced indicating that newly weaned pigs also have a constant volumetric daily limit. It is suggested that in cases where feed intake needs to be restricted, water intake could be manipulated in order to limit feed intake. This would permit the wider use of ad lib feeding systems and the welfare benefits these allow. The water use of a grower/finisher unit was modelled according to a 12 % volumetric limit and the factors affecting water intake and wastage. The water intake of grower/finisher pigs was predicted using this model. This enabled the percentage of water wasted by different drinker types and delivery rates to be estimated. For wet fed pigs, increasing the water to feed ratio from 1. 63 : 1 to 3. 25 : 1 significantly increased feed digestibility (P< 0. 05). As many experiments conducted to evaluate the digestible energy of feeds may have used low feed to water ratios (generally around 2 : 1) it is suggested that many of these studies have attributed incorrect nutritional values to raw materials used in diets for pigs.

40|$|Dois sistemas de bebedouros utilizados na criação avícola, {{pendular}} e chupeta (nipple), foram estudados objetivando avaliar a qualidade microbiológica da água fornecida às aves, em relação à presença de coliformes totais e fecais, aeróbios mesófilos, bolores e leveduras. Realizaram-se coletas de água no primeiro, 14, 28 e 42 dias de idade, sendo os dias de amostragem divididos em três períodos, de acordo com o horário de limpeza dos bebedouros pendulares: primeira, antes da limpeza; segunda, logo após a limpeza e terceira, ao meio dia. Os bebedouros avaliados apresentaram índices de contaminação em relação ao NMP de coliformes fecais acima dos limites estabelecidos pela Portaria do MS-Brasil. As contagens para UFC de bolores e leveduras obtidas para bebedouros pendulares apresentaram índices de contaminação maiores do que os chupeta. Em uma segunda etapa do estudo, foi avaliado o efeito da cloração constante sobre a qualidade microbiológica da água, usando os mesmos parâmetros anteriores. Foram instaladas bombas dosadoras de cloro em cada galpão reguladas para manter concentração de 2 mg/L de cloro residual livre. A cloração contínua da água melhorou a qualidade microbiológica em relação ao NMP de coliformes totais e fecais nos bebedouros avaliados. Quanto aos aeróbios mesófilos, os bebedouros apresentaram-se fora dos padrões estabelecidos pela Portaria MS-Brasil, sendo o chupeta o que apresentou melhor desempenho. O bebedouro chupeta apresentou índices de contaminação da água inferiores aos apresentados pelos pendulares. Mesmo assim, foram considerados fora dos padrões para água potável. Two drinker systems used {{by commercial}} broiler growers, the bell <b>drinker</b> <b>type</b> and the nipple drinker, were studied aiming {{to evaluate the}} microbiological quality of the water supplied to the birds in relation to occurrence of total and fecal coliforms, mesophilic aerobic, moulds and yeast. The water samplings were taken on the 1 st, 14 th, 28 th and 42 th days of age. The days of sampling, {{in accordance with the}} cleaning schedule for the bell type drinkers, were divided into three periods: before the cleaning, right after cleaning and at noon. The evaluated drinkers presented patterns of contamination in relation to the most probable number (mpn/ 100 ml) of fecal coliforms above that of the limit number established by the Ministry of Health, Brazil. The counts for mould and yeast (cfu/mL) obtained from bell type drinkers showed a higher pattern of contamination when compared to the nipple drinker. In a second stage of the study, the effect of constant flow chlorination was evaluated on the microbiological quality of the water, using the same standard parameters as previous described. Dosage measurement pumps of chlorine were installed in each poultry house and managed to keep a concentration of 2 mg/l of free residual chlorine. Continuous flow water chlorination improved the microbiological quality in relation to the MPN of total and faecal coliforms in the evaluated drinkers. In relation to the mesophilic aerobic, the evaluated drinkers showed {{to be out of the}} standards established by the MH-Bresil, while the nipple type was the drinker that presented the best performance.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study on group {{differences}} in alcohol-related sickness absence. It consists of four papers: The first is an extensive review article of international research on the alcohol ?? sickness absence association. The second and third articles present studies of group differences in alcohol-related sickness absence in Norway. The fourth article {{is a study}} of group differences in attitudes towards alcohol-related sickness absence and presenteeism in Norway. Paper 1 is {{a review of the}} alcohol-absence association, to my knowledge the first review of studies on this topic. Following a literature search of peer reviewed journals, our inclusion criteria were met by 27 articles testing 48 associations. The study found that empirical evidence for an association between alcohol use and both long- and short-term absence was strong. All associations with a high quality score were statistically significant. The association did not vary systematically across measures of alcohol use. The association was found to apply to both genders and in all socio-economic strata, but in some instances more strongly in lower socio-economic strata. Paper 2 is a study of a sample of employees from the Young in Norway study. Self-reported measures on alcohol-related sickness absence and various drinking measures were applied to study differences according to gender and <b>drinker</b> <b>types.</b> Men reported alcohol-related absence almost twice as often as women did. Since none of the drinking-absence associations for the three alcohol measures were significantly stronger for men, it was concluded that the gender difference in alcohol-related absence was likely due to a gender difference in drinking patterns. The heaviest drinkers reported a disproportionally large share of alcohol-related sickness absence, {{but the vast majority of}} such absence was still found among the moderate drinkers. The results indicated that the prevention paradox applies to alcohol-related sickness absence among young employees of both genders. For paper 3 the sample used in paper 2 was merged with registry data on income, education and occupation, and differences in alcohol-related sickness absence according to socioeconomics and family roles was examined. Being male, single, not having children and having a low income were associated with alcohol-related sickness absence, but the association was not significant for education and social status. Introducing drinking frequency and drinking to intoxication in the regression model attenuated some associations with alcohol-related sickness absence, indicating that group differences are only partly a result of differences in drinking patterns. Paper 4 examine attitudes towards alcohol-related absence and reduced efficiency at work (presenteeism) due to alcohol. Results show that employees are more restrictive towards absence than towards presenteeism. Both behaviours were condemned more strongly with frequent occurrence. Employees with a high intoxication frequency and/or own experience with these behaviours were more tolerant. Women were less tolerant of alcohol-related absence than men, and employees with a higher educational level were less tolerant of alcohol-related presenteeism than those with a low educational level...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a leading}} cause of global suffering. The harms caused by alcohol to the individual, their peers and the society in which they live provokes public health concern. Elevated levels of consumption and consequences have been noted in those aged 18 - 29 years. University students represent a unique subsection of society within this age group. University authorities have attempted to tackle this issue throughout the past decade. However, the issue persists. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} contribute to the evidence base for policy and practice in relation to alcohol harm reduction among third-level students in Ireland. Methods: A mixed methods approach was employed. A systematic review of the prevalence of hazardous alcohol consumption among university students in Ireland and the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2014 was conducted. In addition, a narrative synthesis of studies of drinking types evidenced among youths in western societies was undertaken. A cross-sectional study focused on university students’ health and lifestyle behaviours with particular reference to alcohol consumption was undertaken using previously validated instruments. Undergraduate students registered to one university in Ireland were recruited using two separate modes; classroom and online. Studies investigated the impact of mode of data collection, the prevalence of hazardous alcohol consumption and resultant adverse consequences for mental health and wellbeing. In addition a study using a Q-methodology approach was undertaken to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural factors influencing current patterns of alcohol consumption. Data were analysed using IBM SPPS statistics 20, Stata 12, MPLUS and PQ Method. Results: The literature review focusing on students’ alcohol consumption found that there has been both an increase in hazardous alcohol consumption among university students and a convergence of male and female drinking patterns throughout the past decade. Updating this research, the thesis found that two-thirds of university students consume alcohol at a hazardous level, detailing the range of adverse consequences reported by university students in Ireland. Finally, the heterogeneous nature of this drinking was described in a narrative synthesis exposing six types of consumption. The succeeding chapters develop this review further by describing three typologies of consumption, two quantitative and one quali-quantilogical. The quantitative typology describes three types of drinking for men (realistic hedonist, responsible conformer and guarded <b>drinker)</b> and four <b>types</b> for women (realistic hedonist, peer-influenced, responsible conformer and guarded drinker). The quali-quantilogical approach describes four types of consumption. These are defined as the ‘guarded drinker’, the ‘calculated hedonist’, the ‘peer-influenced drinker’ and the ‘inevitable binger’. Discussion: The findings of this thesis highlight the scale of the issue and provide up-to-date estimates of alcohol consumption among university students in Ireland. Hazardous alcohol {{consumption is}} associated with a range of harms to self and harms to others in proximity to the alcohol consumer. The classification of <b>drinkers</b> into <b>types</b> signal the necessity for university management, health promotion practitioners and public health policy makers to tackle this issue using a multi-faceted approach...|$|R

Respondents were 1, 494 men and 2, 176 women aged between 55 and 74 from the GENACIS Canadian survey. The dependent variable was self-rated health, an individual’s perception {{of his or her}} own general health, a measure used as a proxy for health status. The independent variables were drinking profiles (<b>types</b> of <b>drinkers</b> and nondrinkers) as well as other demographic, psychosocial, and health-related variables (control variables). After adjustment for other determinants of health, regression analyses showed that (1) frequent/moderate drinkers were more likely to have a better self-rated health compared with nondrinkers (lifetime abstainers and former drinkers) and (2) self-rated health did not differ significantly between frequent/moderate <b>drinkers</b> and other <b>types</b> of <b>drinkers</b> (frequent/nonmoderate and infrequent drinkers). Our results suggest that drinking is related to a better self-rated health compared with nondrinking regardless of the drinking profile.

Utilizou-se um delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 2 x 2, sendo dois níveis de energia (2600 e 2800 kcal EM kg- 1) e duas condições de crista (com e sem corte), formando quatro tratamentos com oito repetições, com uma ave por unidade experimental. Na 24 ª semana, iniciou-se a coleta de dados para a análise estatística, sempre intercalando a semana de pesagem das aves com a coleta de sêmen, o qual foi coletado através do método Americano e, para contagem de células espermáticas, fez-se a diluição do sêmen a base de formol salina tamponada para posterior leitura na câmara de Neubauer. Avaliou-se a fertilidade dos machos inseminando artificialmente seis fêmeas por tratamento, duas vezes por semana com 0, 05 mL de sêmen por fêmea. Os ovos foram coletados quatro vezes por dia, identificados, desinfetados e incubados em condições similares. No 21 ° dia de incubação, os ovos que não eclodiram foram quebrados e examinados macroscopicamente para calcular a fertilidade. Os níveis de energia estudados não revelaram diferença significativa no peso corporal e no volume de sêmen dos galos durante o período experimental. Já o corte da crista reduziu 9, 5 % do peso corporal e 24 % da fertilidade em relação a aves com crista inteira. Nas semanas 29 ª, 35 ª, 37 ª, e 43 ª, observou-se maior concentração de células espermáticas em aves que receberam dieta com 2600 kcal EM kg- 1. Conclui-se que o nível de 2600 kcal EM kg- 1 é suficiente para atender os parâmetros reprodutivos dos galos e a presença da crista é fundamental para manter a alta fertilidade em aves de 42 e 43 semanas de idade. The {{experiment was}} carried out to evaluate {{which is the best}} the diet energy level diet for male broiler breeders of cutting Cobb 500 and the influence of the presence of the crest on parameters such as body weight, semen volume, sperm cell concentration and fertility. Were used 32 roosters for 22 to 44 weeks of age, they were randomly assigned to cages equipped with feeders and <b>drinkers</b> <b>type</b> gutter. The experimental design was entirely casualized in a factorial scheme 2 x 2 two comb conditions (with and without crest) and two levels of metabolizable energy (2600 and 2800 kcal kg- 1). There was four treatments with eight replications, with one bird per experimental unit. At week 24 th began collecting data for statistical analysis, when merging the week weighing the birds to the collection of semen, which was collected through the American method and count of sperm cells, The dilution of semen-based formaldehyde buffered saline and then reading in a Neubauer chamber. We assessed male fertility through artificial insemination of six females per treatment, twice weekly with 0. 05 mL of semen per female. Eggs were collected four times a day, identified, disinfected and incubated in the same conditions. After 21 of incubation, eggs not hatched were broken and macroscopically examined to calculate the fertility. The energy levels studied revealed no significant difference in body weight and volume of semen of roosters during the experimental period. Since cutting the crest reduced body weight and fertility of 9. 5 % and 24 % respectively in relation to birds crested whole. In the weeks 29 th, 35 th, 37 th and 43 th there was a higher concentration of sperm cells in birds fed the diet with 2600 kcal kg- 1. It is concluded that the level of 2600 kcal kg- 1 is sufficient to meet the reproductive parameters of roosters and the presence of the crest is needed to maintaining high fertility in 42 and 43 weeks of age birds...|$|R

This study compares the relationship between drinking profiles and self-rated health with and without adjusting for other determinants of health among a sample of older adults from the general population. Respondents were 1, 494 men and 2, 176 women aged between 55 and 74 from the GENACIS Canadian survey. The dependent variable was self-rated health, an individual’s perception {{of his or her}} own general health, a measure used as a proxy for health status. The independent variables were drinking profiles (<b>types</b> of <b>drinkers</b> and nondrinkers) as well as other demographic, psychosocial, and health-related variables (control variables). After adjustment for other determinants of health, regression analyses showed that (1) frequent/moderate drinkers were more likely to have a better self-rated health compared with nondrinkers (lifetime abstainers and former drinkers) and (2) self-rated health did not differ significantly between frequent/moderate <b>drinkers</b> and other <b>types</b> of <b>drinkers</b> (frequent/nonmoderate and infrequent drinkers). Our results suggest that drinking is related to a better self-rated health compared with nondrinking regardless of the drinking profile. Drinking and healthy lifestyle guidelines specific to older adults should be studied, discussed, and integrated into public health practices. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred persons {{arrested for}} {{driving under the}} {{influence}} (DUI), 30 social drinkers, 30 depressed patients, 30 incarcerated criminals, and 30 alcoholics completed the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI) and Court Reporting Network (CRN) interview. A cluster analysis of HPI scores for the DUI group revealed 5 personality types: Impulsive-Extravert, Normal, Neurotic-Introvert, Neurotic-Hostile, and Unassertive-Conformist. The types differed predictably on demographic variables, drinking behavior, and driving records as assessed by the CRN. The Impulsive-Extravert and Nor-mal types had HPI profiles similar to social <b>drinkers.</b> The Neurotic-Introvert <b>type</b> most resembled depressed patients, and the Neurotic-Hostile type most resembled incarcerated criminals. Results clarify previous findings on DUI personality types and establish a basis for tailoring therapeutic treatments to different types of DUI offenders. Recent advances in the field of personality structure have converged, providing a consensus regarding the superordinate personality dimensions underlying a comprehensive taxonomy of personality traits (Digman, 1990; McCrae & John, 1992). The Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality hierarchically or-ganizes personality traits into five basic dimensions: I. Extraver-sion, 11. Agreeableness, 111. Conscientiousness, IV. Emotional Stability (vs. Neuroticism), and V. Intellect or Openness to Ex-perience. These dimensions broadly assess important individ-ual differences in interpersonal, motivational, emotional, atti-tudinal, and experiential style. This convergence has provided a working model allowing personality psychologists to proceed with the conceptual and empirical tasks they have long set fo...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantially}} {{increased risk}} for heavy drinkers and a slightly reduced risk for lighter drinkers results in the J-shaped alcohol-mortality curve. Limited data suggest a more favorable mortality experience for drinkers of wine than for drinkers of liquor or beer. To examine these relations, the authors performed a cohort study of participants in a large Northern California prepaid health care program. Demographic and history {{data were collected from}} 128, 934 adults undergoing health evaluations in 1978 – 1985, with subsequent death ascertained by an automated linkage system. Cox proportional hazards models with eight covariates were used to determine relative risk estimates according to total alcohol intake and days per week of drinking wine, wine types, beer, or liquor. The J-shaped alcohol-mortality relation was stable for 20 years. Independently, frequency of wine drinking was associated with lower mortality risk (p < 0. 001) largely because of lower coronary disease risk. Similar risk reductions were associated with red wine, white wine, other types of wine, and combinations of wine types. Much of the lower risk associated with light drinking was related to wine drinking. The authors conclude that <b>drinkers</b> of any <b>type</b> of wine have a lower mortality risk than do beer or liquor drinkers, but it remains unclear whether this reduced risk is due to nonalcoholic wine ingredients, drinking pattern, or associated traits. alcohol drinking; alcoholic beverages; beer; mortality; risk; wine Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ICD- 9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} five {{waves of the}} Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey to examine the {{relationship}} between living arrangements, smoking, and drinking among older adults in China from 1998 – 2008. We found that living arrangements had strong implications for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption among the elderly. First, the likelihood of smoking was lower among older men living with children, and older women living either with a spouse, or with both a spouse and children; and the likelihood of drinking was lower among both older men, and women living with both a spouse and children, compared with those living alone. Second, among dual consumers (i. e., being a drinker and a smoker), the amount of alcohol consumption was lower among male dual consumers living with children, while the number of cigarettes smoked was higher among female dual consumers living with others, compared with those living alone. Third, among non-smoking drinkers, the alcohol consumption was lower among non-smoking male <b>drinkers</b> in all <b>types</b> of co-residential arrangements (i. e., living with a spouse, living with children, living with both a spouse and children, or living with others), and non-smoking female drinkers living with others, compared with those living alone. Results highlighted the importance of living arrangements to cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption among Chinese elderly. Co-residential arrangements provided constraints on Chinese older adults’ health-risk behaviors, and had differential effects for men and women...|$|R
40|$|Background: Response {{disinhibition}} {{plays an}} important role in addictive behaviors. However, results of studies on the performance on response inhibition tasks of individuals evidencing potentially problematic levels of alcohol drinking are mixed. Objectives: We assessed conditions under which persons with a relatively high risk of alcohol dependence show inhibition deficits in such tasks and investigated the nature of those deficits. Methods: Fifty-eight male undergraduate students, 27 of which were high-risk drinkers according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, performed a go/no-go inhibition task with differing percentages of no-go trials (50 % vs. 25 %), stimulus presentation times (600 vs. 200 ms), and types of go and no-go stimuli (alcohol related vs. -unrelated). Response inhibition was indexed by response time (RT) to go trials and response accuracy on go and no-go trials. Results: There were no differences between low- and high-risk drinkers on any of the three outcome measures under the 600 -ms stimulus presentation condition. Under the 200 -ms condition, the high-risk drinkers showed faster RTs to go stimuli, and more errors on both go- and no-go trials than the low-risk <b>drinkers,</b> irrespective of <b>type</b> and percentage of no-go stimuli. However, the accuracy differences between the two groups disappeared after controlling for the RT on go trials, suggesting a speed-accuracy trade-off. Conclusion: High-risk drinkers' response inhibition deficits are not restricted to alcohol-related cues and are especially likely to occur under conditions prompting fast responding. These findings could be used to inform treatment, suggesting the promotion of strategies aimed at preventing high-risk alcohol users from making quick decisions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Heart rate (HR) {{acceleration}} {{during the}} ascending limb {{of the blood}} alcohol curve {{has proven to be}} a reliable measure of the sensitivity to the activating effects of alcohol. In this study, we investigated the correlation between an ethanol-induced cardiac change and the strength of implicit alcohol-related arousal and approach associations and attentional bias for alcohol-related stimuli in heavy <b>drinkers.</b> These 3 <b>types</b> of implicit alcohol-related cognitions have been proposed to reflect the strength of incentive sensitization that is experienced after repeated alcohol use. Methods: Forty-eight heavy drinking men performed a modified version of the Implicit Associ-ation Test (IAT) to measure their implicit alcohol arousal and approach–avoidance associations. A modified version of the emotional Stroop was used to measure attentional bias for alcohol-related stimuli (blocked and unblocked). Next, a high dose of alcohol (1. 0 mL/kg body weight 95 % USP alcohol) was administered in a short period of time. Resting baseline HR, blood alcohol concentra-tions, mood, and craving for alcohol were assessed before alcohol administration and for 2 hours post–alcohol consumption. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, a negative association was found between implicit arousal associations and alcohol-induced HR change. This indicates that strong arousal associations were correlated with a decrease in alcohol-induced HR. Approach associations and attentional bias were not correlated with alcohol-induced HR change, but both were correlated positively with each other. Conclusions: Alcohol-arousal associations and other implicit cognitions (attentional bias, approach associations) are not positively related to individual differences in the sensitivity to alcohol’s activating effects, at least not in the present sample consisting primarily of family history-negative heavy drinkers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alcohol {{consumption}} patterns are dependent upon culture and context. The {{aim of this}} study was to interview people aged 18 – 34 year old living in four cities in different regions of the world to explore differences in a range of alcohol measures to assist in determining culturally appropriate alcohol initiatives for this age group. Method: Multistage random sampling was consistent across the four cities (Ilorin (Nigeria), Wuhan (China), Montevideo (Uruguay) and Moscow (Russia)). The questionnaire was forward and back translated into relevant languages and face-to-face interviewing undertaken. The data were weighted to the population of each city. Uni-variable analysis (ever consumed, first time consumed, age when drunk for first time, number of days consumed, type consumed) and logistic regression modeling were undertaken. The final model for each city was adjusted for age, sex, marital status, highest education and employment status. In total 6235 interviews were undertaken (1391 in Ilorin, 1600 in Montevideo, 1604 in Moscow and 1640 in Wuhan). Results: Alcohol was consumed by 96. 4 % in Montevideo, 86. 1 % in Moscow, 53. 4 % in Wuhan and 33. 3 % in Ilorin. There was very little difference by gender except Ilorin males were more likely to consume alcohol than females. Alcohol was consumed on more days for Ilorin males; Wuhan females consumed alcohol on the least number of days; Ilorin had the most abstainers; Montevideo and Moscow the highest proportion of light drinkers; Ilorin and Montevideo the highest proportion of heavy <b>drinkers.</b> Differences by <b>type</b> of alcohol were also apparent. The final logistic regression model provided different models including higher alcohol consumption rates for males, 25 – 34 years of age, divorced/separated marital status and employed part time for Ilorin respondents; males and higher educated for Montevideo; males, 25 to 29 years of age and higher educated for Moscow; and 25 – 29 years of age, non-married and vocationally trained for those in Wuhan. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption in these four cities does not increase with age as found in most high income countries. The alcohol {{consumption patterns}} during this stage of the life cycle are important to assess so that high level, as well as country-specific, planning and interventions can be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Scholars in {{the burgeoning}} field of {{drinking}} studies usually {{fall into two}} broad camps: those investigating {{the social and cultural}} importance of alcohol consumption, in terms of identity formation, gender relations, generational attitudes, and material culture; and those examining economic and political aspects of the history of, and contemporary policies towards, alcohol, including taxation, commerce, production, regulation, and public health. The central aim of this volume is to propose one methodological pathway in which these two broad perspectives can participate in a dialogue to establish how the economic, political, and socio-cultural dimensions of drinking are connected. In contemporary Britain, the focus of political discourse about alcohol consumption is on the need to regulate public consumption of alcohol to reduce drink-related disorder, crime, and health problems; consequently, fiscal, licensing, pricing, and marketing policies have been mooted or tried as solutions. Essential to the shaping of constructive political and economic policies towards alcohol consumption, however, is a proper understanding of the social and cultural importance of drinking within a particular society. This volume, therefore, seeks to examine the economic, political, and socio-cultural dynamics of alcohol consumption in different historical and cultural contexts, and from a range of disciplinary perspectives, to highlight the multifaceted and complex layers of meaning, practice, ritual, regulation, community, and identity that are involved in alcohol consumption. Furthermore, by highlighting this complexity and diversity in issues surrounding alcohol use, the volume aims to highlight what might be missing from contemporary debates about alcohol in Britain. The volume is organised around a central methodology we term “Biographies of Drink”. Drawing on Arjun Appadurai’s work in The Social Life of Things (1986), the volume conceives of alcoholic drinks and alcohol consumption as multi-dimensional referents involved in complex economic, political, and social processes and debates that are culturally specific. By pursuing a flexible biographical methodology – applied variously to particular drinks or brands, drinking environments or clubs, legislative acts or policies, individual <b>drinkers</b> or drinking <b>types,</b> and so on – the aim is to make connections across economic, political, social and cultural issues that often remain divorced within the scholarship on drinking. Moreover, the common biographical approach, telling the stories of drink-related phenomena from cradle to grave, or tracing the social, cultural, economic and political aspects of a moment of particular significance within a biography of drink, provides numerous opportunities for cross-cultural comparison and interdisciplinary dialogue, through which provocative insights emerge and, hopefully, stimulate further scholarship.
