We focused {{on all of the}} weekly overviews during the year 2008 containing tables with data of seafood alert and <b>information</b> <b>notifications</b> and border rejections. Data have been parsed into an Excel spreadsheet file and stored into the following column headings: seafood, food preservation, reason for notifying or rejection, country of origin, reference number. Relationships between product and hazard categories, way of storing, country of origin have been assessed. The results have been shown by means of graphs. The aim of this paper is making a database with specific informations on seafood and correlated hazards and country of origin available for both studying historical trends and predicting future risks...|$|E
40|$|Within the SAFE FOODS project, an {{analysis}} of data notified to RASFF {{was carried out in}} order to explore the possibility to identify emerging trends in food safety hazards (Kleter et al., 2009). Kleter et al. (2009) used data from weekly overviews of the notifications during a four-year period from July 2003 until June 2007 as a basis for calculations and trend analysis. The authors obtained weekly overviews containing tables with data of alert and <b>information</b> <b>notifications</b> from the RASFF website (RASFF, 2007). In this paper, we have reported briefly the outcomes obtained by Kleter et al. (2009) and for giving a vision more current of the main food and feed hazards, we have also reported data obtained from the annual report 2010. The annual report 2010 was obtained from Italian Ministry of Health website (Ministero della Salute, 2011). Moreover, to understand the RASFF role in presence of a risk for human and/or animal health, we have carried out a study of the recent melamine case. The information regarding the melamine case were obtained from the RASFF annual reports (RASFF, 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|The International Health Regulations (IHR), an {{international}} law {{under the auspices}} of the World Health Organization (WHO), mandates that countries notify other countries of "travelers under public health observation. " Between November 10, 2014, and July 12, 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made 2, 374 notifications to the National IHR Focal Points in 114 foreign countries of travelers who were monitored by US health departments because they had been to an Ebola-affected country in West Africa. Given that countries have preidentified focal points as points of contacts for sharing of public health <b>information,</b> <b>notifications</b> could be made by CDC to a trusted public health recipient in another country within 24 hours of receipt of the traveler's information from a US health department. The majority of US health departments used this process, offered by CDC, to notify other countries of travelers intending to leave the United States while being monitored in their jurisdiction.

Using the location and the time interval since a location change, we have examined the features of the user's response to <b>information</b> <b>notification.</b> For a period of three weeks, four subjects carried mobile terminals which randomly notified them about daily information. The obtained results showed that the responsiveness is high just before and after change of subject’s location. The responsiveness decreased with the increase of the time interval since a location change. The change of the responsiveness differed with the subject location and its change through time was symmetric for the time intervals before and after the location change. An effective control of the notification timing could be obtained using the information about the user's location and the time interval since the change of user's location. 1...|$|R

Students are guided through individual or group projects to learn and apply many of the IT concepts they learn in a course. However, a significant percentage of IT projects depend on the existence of large sets of information or live data.

Mobile Flood Assistant (Mo-FA) is an integrated Android-based mobile application to assist Malaysian citizens who live in flood prone areas with an early warning alert and to facilitate the current practice in search and rescue operation. Mo-FA consists of 2 main modules namely Flood <b>Information</b> and <b>Notification</b> Module, and e-SOS Module. The Flood <b>Information</b> and <b>Notification</b> Module aims to provide early warning to the public on possible flood occurrence.

Relevant information such as the nearest evacuation centers and routes will be displayed on a map to facilitate affected victims to move to a safe area. The second module aims to facilitate the rescue teams to locate the victims’ whereabouts upon receiving SOS message sent by the victims. Considering the fact that mobile phone is a device which we keep close to us at almost all the time, Mo-FA could become a perfect tool to provide various flood related information and to provide a method for quick information distribution to the public and rescue teams...|$|R

The realization of the building of communication and information infrastructure of the region was finished last year and the implementation of some systems has been preformed currently (eg integration of mobile MMR 50 meteorological radar to the infrastructure level sensors on rivers, etc.). The goal of implementation MMR 50 meteorological radar is to increase the level of monitoring current developments and precipitation forecast over the territory of the Zlin Region. In the article will be described IVVS ZK project in terms of features and the location of the MMR 50 Meteorological Radar. The practical part will be compared outcomes radar measurements of MMR 50 Meteorological Radar with meteorological radars of CZRAD Radar Network. Outcomes of the measurement will be demonstrated on examples of convective and stratiform precipitation clouds. Following the radar measurements will be compared to the description of predictions TITAN Nowcasting System, {{which is part of the}} equipment of MMR 50 Meteorological Radar with Nowcasting Systems of Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on current {{possibilities}} of the measurement and predictions of intense convective precipitation through the mobile meteorological radar (MMR 50). This meteorological radar equipment {{is part of the}} <b>Information,</b> <b>Notification</b> and Warning system of the Zlin Region in the Czech Republic, which consists of information and communication infrastructure for dealing with extraordinary events. The first chapter describes basic principles of radar precipitation measurement, e. g. radar estimate of rainfall intensity and radar products. The second chapter presents a methodology of measuring and predicting of intense convective precipitation using the mobile meteorological radar (MMR 50), including other possibilities of precipitation forecast as NWP models, aerological, satellite, station measurements, statistics of historical situations, the risk of flash floods on the degree of soils saturation and the possibility of observation of dangerous accompanying phenomena. The last chapter deals with the verification of the principles of radar measurements and forecasts in a case study on 24 th July 2015. Torrential rainfall in a combination with hail and strong wind gusts caused heavy flooding in the central part of Zlin region, which caused considerable material damage. Timely and quality information about the current and future formation and development of intense convective precipitation is essential for flood prevention measures. Acquired findings and conclusions can be used for crisis management in case of a possible occurrence of flash floods. Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University [IGA/ FAI/ 2016 / 023...|$|R
