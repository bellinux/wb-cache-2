We then perform a Monte Carlo study to examine their differences in terms of option pricing, and we study the convergence of the discrete time option prices to their implied continuous time values. The results show that there are differences between the two models, though the discrete time GARCH prices converge quickly to the continuous time SV values. Finally, a large scale empirical analysis using individual stock options and options on an index is performed comparing the estimated prices from discrete time models to the corresponding continuous time model prices.

40|$|Market {{participants}} {{are faced with}} the problem of finding a good trade-off between the model adequacy and its tractability. The aim of this thesis is to develop tractable and intuitive models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> credit and equity areas and to assess their performance according to different criteria of interest for practitioners. Although sometimes criticized for its inability to reproduce quoted option prices which manifests itself in what is commonly referred to as the volatility smile, the Black-Scholes model and its implied volatility are widespread and their success is due to their very simple and intuitive concept. The first contribution of this thesis consists of the introduction of two kinds of alternative implied volatility, namely the implied Lévy space volatility and theimplied Lévy time volatility, and of the investigation of the resultingskew adjustment. Moreover, we show that under the Lévy parameter settings, the model performs systematically better than the classical Black-Scholes model as regards the risk of the commonly used delta hedging strategy. This is illustrated by looking at the daily hedging error and P&L distributions and by noting that, for the Lévy models under investigation, the empirical variance is smaller and, {{for a wide range of}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>options,</b> <b>the</b> empirical acceptability indices are higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black-Scholes setting. The second part of this thesis illustrates the impact of calibration risk under <b>the</b> Heston model. <b>In</b> particular, we show that different plausible calibration procedures lead to different optimal parameter sets and hence to significantly different prices for a wide range of exotic products, emphasizing the necessity to take into account some additional safety margin for the pricing of these structured products, as it has been recommended in a recent directive of the Basel Committee. The third contribution consists of the extension of the alpha-VG model where the constraints on the subordinator parameters are relaxed such that the calibration does not require the existence of a liquid multivariate derivatives market which is nowadays pretty rare since the marginal characteristic functions become dependent onthe whole parameter set. Moreover, the stocks log-return volatility, which is an indicator of the trading volume, becomes dependent on both theidiosyncratic and common subordinator settings, making the generalized model more coherent with the empirical evidence of the presence of both an idiosyncratic and a common component <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business clock. Furthermore we emphasize the presence of model risk inside a particular class of multivariate models by pricing standard multivariate options. Finally, we compare the exponential Lévy model with the classical Gaussian copula model for the pricing of CDO-squared tranches, using several approximations of the recursive approach, namely a full Monte Carlo approximation and a Monte Carlo approximation which rests either on the multivariate Normal approximation of the joint inner CDO loss distributionor on the multivariate Poisson approximation of the joint number of defaults affecting the inner CDOs. The numerical study shows <b>in</b> particular that <b>the</b> multivariate Poisson approximation method outperforms the multivariate Normal approximation for CDOs-squared made up of inner equity tranches. nrpages: 314 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Local Volatility {{model is}} a {{well-known}} extension of the Black-Scholes constant volatility model whereby the volatility is dependent on both time and the underlying asset. This model can be calibrated to provide a perfect fit {{to a wide range}} of implied volatility surfaces. The model is easy to calibrate and still very popular in FX option trading. In this paper we address a question of validation of the Local Volatility model. Different stochastic models for the underlying can be calibrated to provide a good fit to the current market data but should be recalibrated every trading date. A good fit to the current market data does not imply that the {{model is a}}ppropriate and historical backtesting should be performed for validation purposes. We study delta hedging errors under the Local Volatility model using historical data from 2005 to 2011 for the AUD/USD implied volatility. We performed backtests for a range of option maturities and strikes using sticky delta and theoretically correct delta hedging. The results show that delta hedging errors under the standard Black-Scholes model are no worse than that of the Local Volatility model.

40|$|The {{most popular}} model for pricing options, both in {{financial}} literature {{as well as}} in practice has been <b>the</b> Black-Scholes model. <b>In</b> spite of its wide spread use the model appears to be deficient in pricing deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and deep out of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>options</b> using statistical estimates of volatility. This limitation has been taken into account by practitioners using the concept of implied volatility. The value of implied volatility for different strike prices should theoretically be identical, but is usually seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market to vary. In most markets across the world it has been observed that the implied volatilities of different strike prices form a pattern of either a ‘smile’ or ‘skew’. Theoretically, since volatility is a property of the underlying asset it should be predicted by the pricing formula to be identical for all derivatives based on that same asset. Hull [1993] and Nattenburg [1994] have attributed the volatility smile to the non normal Skewness and Kurtosis of stock returns. Many improvements to the Black-Scholes formula have been suggested in academic literature for addressing the issue of volatility smile. This paper studies the effect of using a variation of the BS model (suggested by Corrado & Sue [1996] incorporating non-normal skewness and kurtosis) to price call options on S&P CNX Nifty. The results strongly suggest that the incorporation of skewness and kurtosis into the option pricing formula yields values much closer to market prices. Based on this result and the fact that this approach does not add any further complexities to the option pricing formula, we suggest that this modified approach should be considered as a better alternative. ...|$|R
