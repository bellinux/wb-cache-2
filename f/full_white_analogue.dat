40|$|Coat colour {{heredity}} patterns, from crosses and paternal backcrosses involving {{black and}} brown spotted Merino rams and <b>full</b> <b>white</b> Merino ewes, were investigated through segregation analyses. Statistical tests validate {{the hypothesis of}} a dominance with complete penetrance of: (i) <b>full</b> <b>white</b> over pigmented, (ii) black over brown, and (iii) uniform over spotted pattern, as well as, of a dominant epistasis of white/pigmented over both black/brown and uniform/spotted. Besides, the pigmented pattern segregations are independent of {{the sex of the}} individuals. These results largely agree with those already reported in literature, yet they are in contrast with the hypothesis of a <b>full</b> <b>white</b> obtainable only on a pheomelanic background coupled with a modifying effect due to the spotted gene. Moreover, epistatic effects of white have been never described...|$|R

5000|$|The {{method for}} {{measuring}} ANSI lumens {{is defined in}} the IT7.215 document which was created in 1992. First the projector is set up to display an image in a room at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. The brightness and contrast of the projector are adjusted so that on a <b>full</b> <b>white</b> field, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between a 5% screen area block of 95% peak white, and two identically sized 100% and 90% peak white boxes {{at the center of the}} white field. The light output is then measured on a <b>full</b> <b>white</b> field at nine specific locations around the screen and averaged. This average is then multiplied by the screen area to give the brightness of the projector in [...] "ANSI lumens".|$|R
