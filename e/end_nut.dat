40|$|Background: Soy {{consumption}} {{may affect}} serum leptin levels and exert its beneficial effects in this way. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of soy consumption on serum leptin levels in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. Methods: In this clinical trial, 42 postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome were included. The patients followed three kinds of diets: control diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension= DASH), soy protein diet, or soy nut diet for eight weeks. Serum leptin level was measured by ELISA method. Results: No significant weight change were seen in patients during three phases of trial. There was no significant difference between the end values of serum leptin concentrations following these diets (Geometric mean ± SD: 16. 9 ± 2. 5 ng/ml at the end of control diet, 16. 1 ± 1. 6 ng/ml at the end of soy protein diet, and 15. 9 ± 1. 7 ng/ml at the <b>end</b> of soy <b>nut</b> diet). Percent difference compared to control for serum leptin levels showed that neither soy protein nor soy nut diets could significantly alter this variable (p = 0. 32).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of two series of experimental and analytical studies on the structural behavior of an innovative moment-resisting connection to concrete-filled circular hollow sections using blind bolts. The first part of the paper presents a large-scale T-stub connection with full instrumentation tested to failure in tension, and the second part presents a series of pullout tests to explore the anchorage behavior of cogged bars within concrete-filled steel tubes. The favorable strength and stiffness characteristics of this type of connection showed that it could be an alternative to conventional welded moment-resisting connections. A 3 D finite-element (FE) model was developed to simulate the behavior of blind-bolted T-stub connections when subject to tension. The FE model took into account material nonlinearities, geometrical discontinuities, and complex contact interactions among the bolt heads, tube wall, <b>end</b> plates, and <b>nuts.</b> The FE results were found to be in good quantitative agreement with the actual connection behavior. A stiffness model composed of various nonlinear springs was also developed to predict the pullout behavior of cogged bars within concrete-filled steel tubes. The cogged extensions to the blind bolts were very effective in relieving the stress concentration on the thin tube wall. The tensile load can be shared between membrane action of the tube wall and anchorage of the cogged bars. Thus, by using the blind-bolted connections with cogged extensions to connect the beam flanges to the column, moment transfer between the beam and column can be effectively achieved within a structural frame of composite construction...|$|R

60|$|Why, however, has the coco-nut three pores {{at the top}} {{instead of}} one, and why are two out of the three so {{carefully}} and firmly sealed up? The explanation of this strange peculiarity is only {{to be found in}} the ancestral history of the coco-nut kind. Most nuts, indeed, start in their earlier stage as if they meant to produce two or more seeds each; but as they ripen, all the seeds except one become abortive. The almond, for example, has in the flower two seeds or kernels to each nut; but in the ripe state there is generally only one, though occasionally we find an almond with two--a philipoena, as we commonly call it--just to keep in memory the original arrangement of its earlier ancestors. The reason for this is that plants whose fruits have no special protection for their seeds are obliged to produce a great many of them at once, in order that one seed in a thousand may finally survive the onslaughts of their Argus-eyed enemies; but when they learn to protect themselves by hard coverings from birds and beasts, they can dispense with some of these supernumerary seeds, and put more nutriment into each one of those that they still retain. Compare, for example, the innumerable small round seedlets of the poppyhead with the solitary large and richly stored seed of the walnut, or the tiny black specks of mustard and cress with the single compact and well-filled seed of the filbert and the acorn. To the very <b>end,</b> however, most <b>nuts</b> begin in the flower as if they meant to produce a whole capsuleful of small unstored and unprotected seeds, like their original ancestors; it is only at the last moment that they recollect themselves, suppress all their ovules except one, and store that one with all the best and oiliest food-stuffs at their disposal. The nuts, in fact, have learned by long experience that it is better to be the only son and heir of a wealthy house, set up in life with a good capital to begin upon, than to be one of a poor family of thirteen needy and unprovided children.|$|R
40|$|The paper reveals one of {{possible}} methods for higher productivity {{and reliability of}} building self-propelled pneumopunchers which are intended for making holes in soil while using trenchless method and constructing various engineering communications under car, tram and rail lines, airport runways. A new design of building pneumopuncher with increased productivity due to higher speed for hole formation in soil and its reliability has been presented in the paper. A formula for determination of displacement increment for a new pneumopuncher {{in comparison with the}} conventional one has been obtained in the paper. The paper describes a design and operation principal of the building self-propelled pneumopuncher which is equipped with a locking mechanism with the purpose to neutralize action of soil elastic forces and reactive repulsive force. The locking mechanism keeps the pneumopuncher in the hole. The pneumopuncher consists of a body with anvil, movable hammer, a manifold which is set in axial deepening of the hammer, a nut and a locking mechanism. Improvement of operational pneumopuncher reliability is attained {{due to the fact that}} the locking mechanism is made in the form of two coaxially positioned inner and outer cups having a common basis. A piston is installed in the middle of the inner cup, a spring is fixed over the piston and a rod with a breaking shoe is positioned at the end. Height of the inner cup is less the outer cup height and there is an annular cavity between them which is connected with a chamber.
