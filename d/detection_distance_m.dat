40|$|Abstract—Autonomous {{driving in}} complex urban environments, {{including}} traffic merge, four-ways stop, overtaking, etc., requires {{a very wide}} range sensorial capabilities, both in angle and distance. This paper presents a vision system, designed to help merging into traffic on two-ways intersections, and able to provide a long <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> (over 100 <b>m)</b> for incoming vehicles. The system is made of two high resolution wide angle cameras, each one looking laterally (70 degrees) with respect of the moving direction, performing a specific background subtraction based technique, along with tracking and speed estimation. The system works when the vehicle is stopped at intersections, and is triggered by the high-level vehicle manager. The system has been developed and tested on the Oshkosh Team’s vehicle TerraMax TM, one of the 11 robots admitted to the DARPA Urba...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} hyperspectral image sensor based on MIR-laser {{backscattering}} spectroscopy for contactless detection of explosive substance traces. The spectroscopy system comprises a tunable Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) with a tuning range of 7. 5 µm to 9. 5 µm as an illumination source and a high performance MCT camera for collecting the backscattered light. The resulting measurement data forms a hyperspectral image, where each pixel vector contains the backscattering spectrum of a specific location in the scene. The hyperspectral image data is analyzed for traces of target substances using {{a state of the}} art target detection algorithm (the Adaptive Matched Subspace Detector) together with an appropriate background extraction method. The technique is eye-safe and allows imaging detection of a large variety of explosive substances including PETN, RDX, TNT and Ammonium Nitrate. For short stand-off <b>detection</b> <b>distances</b> (< 3 <b>m),</b> residues of explosives at an amount of just a few 10 ?g, i. e. traces corresponding to a single fingerprint, could be detected. For larger concentration of explosives, stand-off <b>detection</b> over <b>distances</b> of up to 20 m has already been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In hope of {{developing}} a method for oil spill detection in laser remote sensing, a series of refined and crude oil samples were investigated using time-resolved fluorescence in conjunction with parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC). The time resolved emission spectra of those investigated samples were taken by a laser remote sensing system on a laboratory basis with a <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> of 5 <b>m.</b> Based on the intensity-normalized spectra, both refined and crude oil samples were well classified without overlapping, by the approach of PARAFAC with four parallel factors. Principle component analysis (PCA) has also been operated as a comparison. It turned out that PCA operated well in classification of broad oil type categories, but with severe overlapping among the crude oil samples from different oil wells. Apart from the high correct identification rate, PARAFAC has also real-time capabilities, which is an obvious advantage especially in field applications. The obtained results suggested that the approach of time-resolved fluorescence combined with PARAFAC would be potentially applicable in oil spill field detection and identification...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a novel {{detection}} method for underwater moving targets by detecting their {{extremely low frequency}} (ELF) emissions with inductive sensors. The ELF field source of the targets is modeled by a horizontal electric dipole at distances more than several times of the targets’ length. The formulas for the fields produced in air are derived with a three-layer model (air, seawater and seafloor) and are evaluated with a complementary numerical integration technique. A proof of concept measurement is presented. The ELF emissions from a surface ship were detected by inductive electronic and magnetic sensors as the ship was leaving a harbor. ELF signals are of substantial strength and have typical characteristic of harmonic line spectrum, and the fundamental frequency has a direct relationship with the ship’s speed. Due to the high sensitivity and low noise level of our sensors, {{it is capable of}} resolving weak ELF signals at long distance. In our experiment, a <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> of 1300 <b>m</b> from the surface ship above the sea surface was realized, which shows that this method would be an appealing complement to the usual acoustic detection and magnetic anomaly detection capability...|$|R
40|$|Speckle patterns, {{present in}} the laser {{reflection}} from an object, reflect the micro-structure of the object where the laser is illuminated on. When the object surface vibrates, the speckle patterns move accordingly, and this movement can be recovered with a high-speed camera system. Due to the {{low signal to noise}} ratio (SNR), it is a challenging task to recover the micro-vibration information and reconstruct the audio signal from the captured speckle image sequences fast and effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on pixels' gray value variations in laser speckle patterns to work out with the challenging task. The major contribution of the proposed method relies on using the intensity variations of the adaptively selected seed points to recover the vibration information and the audio signal with a novel model that effectively fuses the multiple seed points' information together. Experiments show that our method not only recovers the vibration information with high quality but is also robust and runs fast. The SNR of the experimental results reach about 20 dB and 10 dB at the <b>detection</b> <b>distances</b> of 10 <b>m</b> and 50 m, respectively. ? 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the speech {{acquisition}} ability of a non-contact method, a 94 GHz millimeter wave (MMW) radar sensor was employed to detect speech signals. This novel non-contact speech acquisition method was shown to have high directional sensitivity, and to be immune to strong acoustical disturbance. However, MMW radar speech is often degraded by combined sources of noise, which mainly include harmonic, electrical circuit and channel noise. In this paper, an algorithm combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and mutual information entropy (MIE) was proposed for enhancing the perceptibility and intelligibility of radar speech. Firstly, the radar speech signal was adaptively decomposed into oscillatory components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD. Secondly, MIE {{was used to determine}} the number of reconstructive components, and then an adaptive threshold was employed to remove the noise from the radar speech. The experimental results show that human speech can be effectively acquired by a 94 GHz MMW radar sensor when the <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> is 20 <b>m.</b> Moreover, the noise of the radar speech is greatly suppressed and the speech sounds become more pleasant to human listeners after being enhanced by the proposed algorithm, suggesting that this novel speech acquisition and enhancement method will provide a promising alternative for various applications associated with speech detection...|$|R

40|$|A brief {{study of}} the O- 1 A {{airplane}} to determine possible means for reducing the aircraft aural <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> was conducted. This effort involved measuring the noise signature of the basic airplane, devising methods to attenuate the noise, and then estimating the effect of several selected modifications on the aural <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> of the aircraft. A relatively simple modification utilizing a 6. 5 ft diameter, six-blade propeller and including a muffler having a volume of 0. 725 cu ft is indicated to reduce the aural <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> of the O- 1 aircraft from about 6 miles {{at an altitude of}} 1, 000 ft and 2 to 3 miles at an altitude of 300 ft to approximately half these values.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{investigated the}} predictive performance of pavement marking retroreflectivity measured {{under various conditions}} of continuous wetting. The researcher compared nighttime <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> of pavement markings in simulated rain conditions and the retroreflectivity of the same pavement markings in several continuous wetting conditions. Correlation analyses quantified the predictive performance of the resulting retroreflectivity values from the continuous wetting conditions. The researcher measured the retroreflectivity of 18 pavement marking samples under 14 different conditions. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has three standards for measuring the retroreflectivity of pavement markings under: dry (E- 1710), recovery (E- 2177), and continuous wetting conditions (E- 2176). Using three ASTM standard conditions resulted in three sets of retroreflectivity data, and variations of the continuous wetting standard produced an additional 11 sets of continuous wetting condition data. The researcher also incorporated <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> values measured for the same 18 pavement marking samples under three different simulated rainfall conditions at night. The three conditions included: high (0. 87 in/hr), medium (0. 52 in/hr), and low (0. 28 in/hr) flow rates, these rates were to simulate typical rainfall rates {{in the state of}} Texas. The correlation analyses measures the linear relationship as well as the logarithmic relationship between the <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> and the retroreflectivity of the pavement markings. A pavement markings' retroreflectivity is typically used as a <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> performance indicator, therefore a high degree of correlation between retroreflectivity and <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> would be desired. A high degree of correlation would indicate that a measured retroreflectivity value of a pavement marking would provide a good indication of the expected <b>detection</b> <b>distance.</b> The researcher conducted analyses for several subgroups of the pavement markings based on the markings type or characteristics. Dry, recovery, and all the continuous wetting retroreflectivity data were correlated to the <b>detection</b> <b>distances.</b> Correlation values found during this thesis research did not show a high degree of correlation for most of the subgroups analyzed. This indicates that measured retroreflectivity would not provide very good predictive performance of the pavement markings <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> in rainy conditions...|$|R

High-frequency compressor noise, which is characteristic of turbojet powerplants, and which is prominent at close range for this airplane, has no measurable effect on aural <b>detection</b> <b>distance.</b> The use of fluted-engine exhaust nozzles to change the far-field noise spectra is suggested as a possible means for reducing the aural <b>detection</b> <b>distances.</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>distances</b> associated with eight-lobe and four-lobe nozzles are estimated for a 1, 000 -foot altitude and grassy terrain to decrease from 4 miles to about 3 miles, and from 3 miles to about 2 miles for a 300 -foot altitude and grassy terrain...|$|R

Two modifications to the airplane configuration are suggested as having the best potential for substantially reducing aural <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> with small penalty to airplane performance or stability and control. These modifications include changing the present 3 -blade propeller to a 5 -blade propeller, changing the propeller diameter, and changing the propeller gear ratio, along with the use of an engine exhaust muffler.

40|$|AbstractThe use of in-seam waves for void {{detection}} in mines {{requires the}} capability of capturing high frequency signals over large distances. For instance, the Airy phase of Love waves which are used for void detection in coal mines ranges from several hundred to over one thousand Hertz and the expected travel distance of these signals is at least 90 m (equivalent to a <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> of 45 <b>m)</b> for the technique to be considered practical. In order to obtain high quality and broadband signals, sensors are conventionally grouted {{at the bottom of}} boreholes so that the attenuation due to the fractured surface is minimized and the coupling effect is improved. However, to be economically feasible, the expensive and high sensitive sensors must be retrievable {{so that they can be}} used repeatedly at the same or other locations. Because of these concerns, a retrievable sensor installation technique was developed. This paper provides a detailed review of the technique as well as a brief discussion of its applications. The technique is simple and reliable for both installation and retrieval operations and can be used for boreholes oriented in any directions. The technique has been demonstrated in over 200 sensor installation/retrieval operations under various borehole conditions, including bituminous coal, anthracite coal, shale, sandstone and trona. With this technique, we were able to detect the high frequency signals required for our projects. For instance, the signals used at a trona mine for void detection have a typical frequency of 5 kHz with the travel distance of 150 – 200 m. The results of these operations have shown that sensors installed in the prescribed manner exhibit predictable, consistent, and repeatable performance. The technique also provides an economical and reliable means for many other field seismic monitoring applications where high quality and broadband signals are essential, such as microseismic monitoring and geotomography studies...|$|R

Camera traps {{can be used to}} estimate the abundance of terrestrial mammals, including elusive species, provided that the sensitivity of the sensor, estimated as the effective <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> (EDD), is quantified. Here, we show how the EDD can be inferred directly from camera trap images by placing markers at known distances along the midline of the camera field of view, and then fitting distance-sampling functions to the frequency of animal passage between markers. EDD estimates derived from simulated passages using binned <b>detection</b> <b>distances</b> approximated those obtained from continuous <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> measurements if at least five intervals were used over the maximum <b>detection</b> <b>distance.</b> A field test of the method in two forest types with contrasting vegetation density, with five markers at 2. 5 m intervals, produced credible EDD estimates for 13 forest-dwelling mammals. EDD estimates were positively correlated with species body mass, and were shorter for the denser vegetation, as expected. Our findings suggest that this simple method can produce reliable estimates of EDD. These estimates can be used to correct photographic capture rates for difference in sampling effort resulting from differences in sensor sensitivity between species and habitats. Simplifying the estimation of EDD will result in less biased indices of relative abundance, and will also facilitate the use of camera trap data for estimating animal density. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{restarting}} automaton processes a given word {{by executing}} {{a sequence of}} local simplifications until a simple word is obtained that the automaton then accepts. Such a computation is expressed as a sequence of cycles. A nondeterministic restarting automaton M is called correctness preserving, if, for each cycle u⊢Mcv, the string v belongs to the characteristic language LC(M) of M, if the string u does. Our first result states that {{for each type of}} restarting automaton X∈{R,RW,RWW,RL,RLW,RLWW}, if M is a nondeterministic X-automaton that is correctness preserving, then there exists a deterministic X-automaton M 1 such that the characteristic languages LC(M 1) and LC(M) coincide. When a restarting automaton M executes a cycle that transforms a string from the language LC(M) into a string not belonging to LC(M), then this can be interpreted as an error of M. By counting the number of cycles it may take M to detect this error, we obtain a measure for the influence that errors have on computations. Accordingly, this measure is called error <b>detection</b> <b>distance.</b> It turns out, however, that an X-automaton with bounded error <b>detection</b> <b>distance</b> is equivalent to a correctness preserving X-automaton, and therewith to a deterministic X-automaton.
