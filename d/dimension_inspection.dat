40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is mainly to develop an {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) -based intelligent <b>dimension</b> <b>inspection</b> and tool wear compensation method for precision tuning. With the use of vibration signal processing/characteristics analysis technology combined with ICT, statistical analysis, and diagnosis algorithms, the method can be used to proceed with an on-line <b>dimension</b> <b>inspection</b> and on-machine tool wear auto-compensation for the turning process. Meanwhile, the method can also monitor critical tool life to identify the appropriate time for cutter replacement to reduce machining costs and improve the production efficiency of the turning process. Compared to the traditional ways, the method offers the advantages of requiring less manpower, and having better production efficiency, high tool life, fewer scrap parts, and low costs for inspection instruments. Algorithms and diagnosis threshold values for the detection, cutter wear compensation, and cutter life monitoring were developed. In addition, a bilateral communication module utilizing FANUC Open CNC (computer numerical control) Application Programming Interface (API) Spec was developed for the on-line extraction of instant NC (numerical control) codes for monitoring and transmit commands to CNC controllers for cutter wear compensation. With use of local area networks (LAN) to deliver the detection and correction information, the proposed method was able to remotely control the on-machine monitoring process and upload the machining and inspection data to a remote central platform for further production optimization. The verification experiments were conducted on a turning production line. The results showed that the system provided 93 % correction for size inspection and 100 % correction for cutter wear compensation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{an optimal}} planning problem for workpiece localization with coordinate measurements. The fundamental issue {{is to find}} the best probing locations and a suitable sampling size, such that the uncertainty of the localization error is within a predefined limited bound. First, we introduce two sequential optimization algorithms to incrementally increase the localization accuracy, defined by the determinant of the information matrix of the measurements. Then, a reliability analysis method is incorporated for finding a sample size that is sufficient to reduce the uncertainty of the localization error to a limited bound. By combining these two analysis tools, we present a near-optimal probing strategy for finding the best probing locations and a suitable sampling size. With this strategy, given the desired translation and orientation error bounds and desired confidence limit, we can experimentally determine the least number of points needed to measure. Simulation and experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed probing strategy.

A machine visual system eliminates any errors related to human fatigue and accommodates increases in production without increasing {{the long term}} cost. In this thesis a machine-based {{visual inspection}} system for cardiac pacing and defibrillation leads was developed and tested. The main objective {{of this research is}} to develop the methods and algorithms necessary to inspect dimensions of cardiac pacing and defibrillation lead connectors. To create the inspection vision system it is necessary to select a proper illumination technique, camera, lenses and image processing algorithm. This thesis presents the design of such a vision system for the <b>dimension</b> <b>inspection</b> of the connector of a particular lead. In the algorithms, pattern recognition is used over filtered images to identify connector features. The connector dimensions are checked to corroborate that they comply with the ISO standard. To determine the error percentage we measure each connector with a caliper and compared those values with the ones given by the vision system. The error percentage values are between 0 % and 13 %. The error percentage is less than 1 % in the majority of the connector’s parts. These results wer...|$|E

40|$|The {{connecting}} rod {{is a critical}} part inside the marine engine. The inspection of its important parameters {{is directly related to}} the assembly and quality of the marine engine. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is a conventional choice to measure the parameters of a {{connecting rod}}. However, CMM requires significant resources in time and cost, which leads researchers into in-situ measurement. This article presents a fast and in-situ measuring method by using a laser-based measuring head. Two measuring strategies are adopted in the inspection process. For positional measurements (such as the hole–center distance), whose accuracy requirement is generally low, the coordinate system of the numerical control (NC) machine is combined with the measuring head to acquire the positional parameters. For dimensional measurements (such as inner diameters), whose accuracy requirement is rather high, the NC machine is used just as transportation. Note that the measuring head has the ability to perform the <b>dimension</b> <b>inspection</b> independently. The accuracy of the measuring head is high enough to meet the dimensional accuracy requirements. Experiments are performed to validate the proposed method. The measuring error of the inner diameters is from 5 μm to 7 μm. The measuring error of hole–center distance is within 15 μm. The measurement of all these parameters can be done within 1 min...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{coordinate}} measurements {{present a}} range of new challenges to measurement instruments and to the numerical algorithms, which significantly determine {{the performance of the}} measurements. Advanced measurement techniques provide a means of obtaining the data points that are accurately representative of the inspected surfaces. Numerical form evaluation algorithms characterize geometric dimensions and verify the conformance to a given tolerance from the 3 D measurement data, which is linked the design process and <b>dimension</b> <b>inspection.</b> This thesis addresses mainly the form evaluation algorithms. Generally, two types Qf algorithms are employed in the form evaluation software of coordinate measurements: the least squares methods and the Mini-max methods. Other methods, such as minimum average deviation method, error curve analysis methods have also been proposed and employed. Different algorithms are based on different mathematical principles and may provide different form evaluation parameters on the same data set. This inconsistency is a significant issue and is a focus of current research. This thesis examines the present controversy to help users to select and employ appropriate form evaluation algorithms. For these purposes, taking spheres as an example, a set of criteria has been drawn up for comparing the existing form evaluation algorithms and selecting a proper algorithm for a specific measurement case. The criteria aim to control and minimize the influence of the measurement error, form errors and the evaluation algorithms on the inspection results. Based on these criteria, appropriate procedures for comparison and selection of the algorithms, such as computer simulation and experimental methods have been developed. General recommendations for the use of these algorithms have been given. From the conclusions of comparison and selection of the algorithms, it is found that the non-linear least square method (NLS) can derive a random measurement uncertainty on the estimated radius of a sphere which is independent of the form error of the measured spheres. Therefore, the random error propagation model of the estimated radius derived by the NLS method has been formulated, which can be used to provide a measurement uncertainty for any single measurement and applied to predict the random errors of a CMM. Also, by analysing the estimated parameters of the calibrated sphere, such as the deviation of the estimated radius, sphericity and residual error, the squareness errors of a CMM has been modelled mathematically and predicted. The criteria for judging the algorithms are concerned with the accuracy indices of the estimated geometric parameters. For any algorithm, it is assumed that data points are reasonably accurate and representative of the geometric elements concerned. To obtain a reliable assessment of geometric form, data pre-processing is necessary. In this thesis, an approach of data pre-processing by operating on the data according to the functional requirements of nominally spherical objects has been introduced and applied. Taking eroded electrical contacts as examples, an approach to pre-processing data, referred to as the Defect Removal Method, is proposed and developed.

This process is faster, more complete, and more accurate than using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) or other more traditional methods. An automatic inspection method and apparatus using structured light and machine vision camera is used to inspect an object {{in conjunction with the}} geometric model of the object. Camera images of the object are analyzed by computer to produce the location of points on the object's surfaces in three dimensions. Point-cloud data is taken from a laser scanner or other 3-D scanning device. During a setup phase before object inspection, the points are analyzed with respect to the geometric model of the object. The software provides a graphical comparison of the manufactured part compared to the CAD model. Many points are eliminated to reduce data-taking and analysis time to a minimum and prevent extraneous reflections from producing errors. When similar objects are subsequently inspected, points from each surface of interest are spatially averaged to give high accuracy measurements of object <b>dimensions.</b> The <b>inspection</b> device uses several multiplexed sensors, each composed of a camera and a structured light source, to measure all sides of the object in a single pass.|$|R

These identifiers represent a point in the temporal, spacial, and quality scalable <b>dimensions,</b> respectively. The <b>inspection</b> of these fields permits to identify NALUs belonging to a specific enhancement layer.

40|$|In the aeronautic industry, the {{performance}} demonstration of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) procedures relies on Probability of Detection (POD) analysis. This statistical approach measures {{the ability of}} the procedure to detect a flaw with regards to one of its characteristic <b>dimensions.</b> The <b>inspection</b> chain is evaluated as a whole, including equipment configuration, probe efficiency but also operator manipulations. Traditionally, a POD study requires an expensive campaign during which several operators apply the procedure on a large set of representative samples. Recently, new perspectives for the POD estimation have been introduced using NDT simulation to generate data. However, the best approach {{to take into account the}} influence of the operator is still under debate. For instance, even if the probe positioning uncertainty can be theoretically modeled, the choice of the underlying probability distribution is often poorly justified. Cognitive aspects are excluded from this approach. To address these difficulties, we propose a concept of operational NDT simulator [1]. This work presents the first steps in the implementation of such simulator for ultrasound phased array inspection of composite parts containing Flat Bottom Holes (FBH). The final system will look like a classical ultrasound testing equipment with a single exception: the displayed signals will come from numerical simulations. Our hardware (ultrasound acquisition card, 3 D position tracker) and software (position analysis, inspection scenario, synchronization, simulations) environments are developed as a bench to test the meta-modeling techniques able to provide fast-simulated hyper-realistic ultrasound signals. The early results obtained by on-the-fly merging of real and simulated signals confirm the feasibility of our approach: the replacement of real signals by purely simulated ones has been unnoticed by operators. Thus, we believe this simulator paves the way for significant improvements in POD studies (accuracy, costs, study scope, etc.) but also for richer inspection scenarios in operators training...|$|R

To achieve fully automated production both making the product and inspecting it for quality assurance needs to be automated. Robotic manufacturing processes {{have been around for}} a long time and has greatly increased the efficiency of modern industry. In this thesis existing framework for automatic 3 D inspection is examined, and an attempt at making a working 3 D inspection implementation is made. The work is centered around offline inspection planning, using a model reference to generate a path for fully inspecting a 3 D object with a sensor attached to a robot arm. Continuing previous work, the inspection planning algorithm proposed by A. Bircher et. al. 2015 is adapted further in an attempt to make it optimal for planning inspection of small to medium sized objects with an industrial robot arm. The modification of the structural inspection planning algorithm is evaluated compared against the algorithm without modification by comparing resulting path length and algorithm convergence. The augmentations appear to increase the performance of the inspection planning algorithm when planning in 5 <b>dimensions.</b> To simulate <b>inspection</b> with a UR 5 robot, a camera mount for the Intel RealSense SR 300 sensor is 3 D printed and attached to the wrist link. Sensor position relative to the wrist joint is measured and used to make a custom URDF and SRDF for the UR 5 such that collision between the sensor and other joints can be prevented and sensor position can be controlled accurately. The resulting inspection paths are simulated in Gazebo with two different approaches to motion planning. To further test in detail how effective individual improvements to the algorithm have been with regards to inspection path quality the algorithm is separated into different iterative versions, where the path generated by each version with otherwise identical parameters are simulated, and the resulting motion of the robot is compared with the intended path. The augmentations of the inspection planner improve robot behavior. However, logging sensor state reveals the sensor has incorrect orientation when reaching the waypoints. The Cartesian motion planner fails to produce a full trajectory for most paths. The inverse kinematics based point to point planner leads to undesirable behavior such as arcing motions between waypoints and goal overshoot. To test basic functionality for point cloud acquisition some of the generated paths are run on the real robot, while both the robot state and 3 D sensor output is being logged. The SR 300 performed poorly, possibly due to poor lighting conditions. It is concluded that the inspection planner should be rewritten to incorporate trajectory planning in joint space. The inspection planner appears to perform well but needs additional measures for adapting the path for inspection with manipulators...|$|R
