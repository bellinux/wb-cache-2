40|$|The transcriptionally {{regulatory}} {{regions of}} the lymphomagenic Akv and SL 3 - 3 murine leukemia retroviruses (MLVs) contain two types of E-box consensus motifs, CAGATG. One type, EA/S, {{is located in the}} upstream promoter region, and the other, <b>E(gre),</b> is located in a tandem repeat with enhancer properties. We have examined the requirements of the individual E-boxes in MLV transcriptional regulation. In lymphoid cell lines only, the <b>E(gre)</b> -binding protein complexes included ALF 1 or HEB and E 2 A basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Ectopic ALF 1 and E 2 A proteins required intact <b>E(gre)</b> motifs for mediating transcriptional activation. ALF 1 transactivated transcription of Akv MLV through the two <b>E(gre)</b> motifs equally, whereas E 2 A protein required the promoter-proximal <b>E(gre)</b> motif. In T- and B-cell lines, the <b>E(gre)</b> motifs were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity, while the EA/S motif had some effect. In contrast, neither <b>E(gre)</b> nor EA/S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3 T 3 cells lacking DNA-binding ALF 1 or HEB and E 2 A proteins. The Id 1 protein was found to repress ALF 1 activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ectopic Id 1 repressed <b>E(gre)</b> -directed but not EA/S-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines. In conclusion, <b>E(gre)</b> motifs and interacting basic helix-loop-helix proteins are important determinants for MLV transcriptional activity in lymphocytic cell lines...|$|R
40|$|Although {{transcription}} {{factors of}} the basic helix-loop-helix family {{have been shown to}} regulate enhancers of lymphomagenic gammaretroviruses through E-box motifs, the overlap of an E-box motif (<b>Egre)</b> with the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) has obscured their function in vivo. We report here that <b>Egre,</b> but not the GRE, affects disease induction by the murine T-lymphomagenic SL 3 - 3 virus. Mutating all three copies of <b>Egre</b> prolonged the tumor latency period from 60 to 109 days. Further mutating an E-box motif (Ea/s) outside the enhancer prolonged the latency period to 180 days, suggesting that Ea/s works as a backup site for <b>Egre.</b> While wild-type SL 3 - 3 and GRE and Ea/s mutants exclusively induced T-cell lymphomas with wild-type latencies mainly of the CD 4 + CD 8 − phenotype, <b>Egre</b> as well as the <b>Egre</b> and Ea/s mutants induced B-cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemia in addition to T-cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphomas induced by the two <b>Egre</b> mutants had the same phenotype as those induced by wild-type SL 3 - 3, indicating the incomplete disruption of T-cell lymphomagenesis, which is in contrast to previous findings for a Runx site mutant of SL 3 - 3. Mutating the <b>Egre</b> site or <b>Egre</b> and Ea/s triggered several tumor phenotype-associated secondary enhancer changes encompassing neighboring sites, none of which led to the regeneration of an E-box motif. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for the E-box but not the GRE in T lymphomagenesis by SL 3 - 3, unveil an inherent broader disease specificity of the virus, and strengthen the notion of selection for more potent enhancer variants of mutated viruses during tumor development...|$|R

40|$|Description: The {{aim of this}} {{tutorial}} will be {{to present}} new perspectives on the representation of self-knowledge in epistemic logic. The basic goal of the tutorial {{is to provide a}} self-contained introduction to epistemic logic, but the ambition is to present some recent developments in the field (use of double-indexing, epistemic updates), and to show how the framework can be extended in order to shed light on some recent philosophical debates about self-knowledge. For the most part the tutorial will be based on joint work with my colleagues Denis Bonnay (Bonnay and <b>Egré</b> 2009, Bonnay and <b>Egré</b> forthcoming) and Jérôme Dokic (Dokic and <b>Egré</b> 2009), in which these issues are investigated. Background: In epistemic logic, an agent is called positively introspective if she knows that she knows that p whenever she knows that p, and negatively introspective if she knows that she does not know p whenever she does not know that p. Both principles are usually assumed in standard models of belief and knowledge (for instance in the partitional models of knowledge used in game theory). However both assumptions have been the object of intense debate in epistemology and the philosophy of mind. Timothy Williamson, in particular, has presented an influential argument against the principle of positive introspection {{in the context of a}} general discussion of epistemological internalism (Williamson 2000). Williamson’s argument is challenging philosophically and from a logical point of view, in particular because it has a strong affinity with the sorites paradox and related epistemic paradoxes (including the Surprise Examination paradox, and some puzzles involving common knowledge). Program: We will first review the basics of epistemic logic and will use Williamson’s argument in order to compare different semantics for knowledge and belief, showing how they make different predictions for introspection (namely Williamson’s margin for erro...|$|R

The second movement is a typical dance from Romania called Brâul, for which traditionally a sash or a waistband was used. This melody came from <b>Egres</b> (present-day Igriș), in the Banat region. The third dance comes also from <b>Egres</b> (Igriș), but its theme is much darker and its melody recreates Middle Eastern instruments, such as the flute. The fourth dance came from Bucsony (present-day Bucium), in the district of Torda-Aranyos (today Alba county in Romania). The fifth dance is an old Romanian dance similar to the Polka and comes from Belényes (present-day Beiuş, in Bihor county), near the border between Hungary and Romania. The sixth and last dance is formed by two different melodies: the first one comes from Belényes (present-day Beiuș) and the second one comes from the then named Nyagra (present-day Neagra) village within the Palotailva (present-day Lunca Bradului) commune. Both on the orchestral version and on the original piano version, these two dances are performed without a discernible pause, the reason for which is anyone's guess.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} of population around urban areas, major infrastructures are increasingly utilised by masses of people. Recent crowd disasters suggest that enhancing safety at those mass gathering places under emergencies poses a great challenge. In case of an emergency, following a man-made or natural disaster, people must be evacuated effectively and efficiently. However, while escaping under panic, interactions between people and physical features of the escape area could considerably impede the collective efforts of humans. Thus, proper considerations {{should be given to}} the plan and design of the features of escape areas, since adjustment of small structural feature or layout in the escape area can {{have a significant impact on}} collective pedestrian movements. Turning angle is one of those features of the escape area that must be designed carefully. Although several previous literature on crowd disasters have highlighted the effects of turning movements, limited qualitative and quantitative studies have addressed this phenomenon, particularly under panic conditions. In this work, we describe some recent experiments conducted at Monash University with panicking ants and how those data can be used to investigate the effect of turning angle on evacuation dynamics during the collective panic <b>egres...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{four major}} (“Galilean”) {{satellites}} of Jupiter form a miniature Solar System, whose “years ” are measured in days. Astronomers have monitored {{the motions of}} these worlds from Galileo’s time to the present to improve their orbital models and to {{study the effects of}} tides on the movements of Io and Europa. (In order outward from Jupiter, the Galileans are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.) The most accurate ways to measure the positions of these moons are by photographic astrometry with large tele-scopes and by CCD photometry of the eclipses of these bodies by the shadow of Jupiter. The A. L. P. O. program, however, preserves continuity with almost four centuries of visual timings of these eclipses, investigating the sources of error in making visual timings. The “standard ” to which we have compared our timings is the “E- 2 ” ephemeris developed by Dr. Jay Lieske of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The A. L. P.

The second is a criticism of Williamson's thesis that knowledge is not luminous, elaborating on previous work by Dokic & <b>Egre</b> (2004), based on the intuition that knowledge is modular and that a representation of this modularity is needed at the logical level in order to avoid the paradoxical conclusions which result rom Williamson's assumptions...|$|R
