40|$|Since 2009 {{collaboration}} between Sustainable Agriculture Trainers’ Network (SATNET), National Organic Agriculture Movement of Uganda (NOGAMU) and Organic Denmark (OD) {{has seen the}} establishment of over 130 ecological Farmer Family Learning Groups (FFLGs) in the Rwenzori region composed of up to 3255 farming families. Compared to the forms of conventional agriculture in which much effort has been invested {{in this part of}} the country and in the country as a whole, the FFLGs in the Rwenzori region clearly demonstrate the social and economic benefits of agricultural development approaches based on ecological/organic alternatives and strengthening of farmer collaboration. While environmental dimensions form an important motivation behind these efforts, this paper emphasize the social and economic benefits the FFLGs have fetched out of the use of ecological/organic farming alternatives. Socially, ecological farming in FFLGs has yielded benefits such as; Promoting/sustaining the culture of sharing agro-inputs, Social capital building at community level where the FFLGs operate, Learning and innovation collaborations among farmers on varying farm conditions, <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>trust</b> that is vital for collective marketing of produce that leads to higher incomes, and; appreciation for indigenous knowledge that builds confidence among farmers and serves as a stronghold for adoption of approved ecological innovations. On the economic aspect, attributes of ecological farming methods in the FFLGs such as; Cost cutting particularly on labor through farmers working together on each other’s farm, Cost effective Seed management systems that overcome the costly seed dependence common among conventional farmers, Increased production and productivity associated with optimum use of the ecological potential of farm lands and Ecological resilience to economic losses achieved through diversified farming and timely planting. The above benefits associated with ecological/organic farming alternatives are equally important in justifying the FFLG approach and must be made more visible not least given their potential role in convincing other stakeholders of the merits of these efforts...|$|E

30|$|However, {{beyond this}} number, the {{reputation}} {{system does not}} work in ordinary lives, {{because there is no}} reputational information about others. Therefore, when the number of community members exceeds the Dunbar’s number, 150, society needs another trust machine to ensure the trust of the extended community. This second machine in human history is the state composed of the government and the bureaucracy that has been introduced for this purpose. There are many arguments about the origin and role of the state and government, but I think that their ultimate role is to <b>guarantee</b> <b>trust</b> in our society. In fact, the state <b>guarantees</b> <b>trust</b> in society by taking complete responsibility for jurisdiction, security, diplomacy, and national defense. Historically, if the trust in society collapses, the dynasties or political powers that have operated or dominated the state or nation also collapse and become replaced with others. Therefore, the most fundamental role of the state and government is to ensure the trust of a large community that cannot be maintained by a reputation system alone. The bureaucracy can be said to be the execution tool of the state and government to ensure trust in society.|$|R

If this trust institution {{is related to the}} clause of Article 1152 of Civil Law Code, indeed, be contrary.

The purpose of this research is to analyze and to find out The Implementation of Legal Protection through Trust Contract in Practice for Parties and The Weaknesses in Providing Legal Protection for Creditors in a <b>Trust</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Contract. The research method applied in this research was through juridical empiric approach with primary and secondary data collection. The implementation of legal protection for creditors in a <b>trust</b> <b>guarantee</b> contract was started from the making of burden certificate of <b>trust</b> <b>guarantee</b> made by notary and continued to emphasize by registration of the certificate. The Act of <b>Trust</b> <b>Guarantee</b> (UUJF) strived to provide a protection technique for the interest of creditors. Unfortunately, the system was not applied by emphasizing concretely in a protection implementation system through execution on <b>trust</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Finally, it gave a choice for creditors to come to an agreement by giving additional cost and providing poor appreciation and not maximum regarding legal protection for creditors. The weaknesses in legal protection implementation for creditors in a concord agreement was caused by the regulation (UUJF) giving weak position for creditors such as no consistency in execution regarding the execution implementation. Whereas, the object of <b>trust</b> <b>guarantee</b> concerning the movable goods is very mobile so that there is possibilities of embezzlement. Instead, in a <b>trust</b> <b>guarantee</b> contract, frequently, there is no consistency of the importance of control by trust receiver on trust collateral possessed by debtors. ...|$|R
