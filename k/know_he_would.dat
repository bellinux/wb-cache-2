5|$|Hoffman {{provides}} the Group with information {{leading them to}} Pocatello, Idaho, {{where a group of}} even more cloned girls is found living in a commune. The police fear that a cult-involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Partly as {{a result}} of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first {{important}} figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with , brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be interested in a diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp if only the French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John's conviction that it was only by making peace with France would it be possible to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{also kept}} close {{relations}} with the Darin family {{as a means to}} <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> treat the film [...] "with respect". He sent letters to that effect to Sandra Dee and son Dodd. Steve Blauner (who is portrayed by John Goodman in the film) also served as a historical consultant. Dodd originally considered Spacey's plan to sing his father's material a sacrilege, but eventually fell into sync with Spacey's deeply empathetic approach to Darin's life.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} of his death, 471 members of UP had already been assassinated {{throughout}} the country. According to his obituary from Semana, [...] "Jaime Pardo Leal <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be killed. His family <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be killed. Patriotic Union <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be killed. Journalists <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be killed. The whole country <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be killed. And finally, he was killed. It was 3:45 in the afternoon on Sunday, October 11." [...] Pardo had received many death threats, and although he initially refused protection from the government he ended up accepting it finally as the threat level increased. On the day of his death he had decided to dispatch his security and kept only one of his bodyguards as he went to his farm in the La Mesa town, near to Bogota. As he drove back to Bogota, men shot at him from another car. Although he was transported immediately to the nearby hospital, he died before he could be helped.|$|R
500|$|Michael and Bird {{investigate}} in the case, and Michael, with evidence, {{finds out}} where Rex is, and runs away. Meanwhile, Rex wakes up {{inside of a}} shed, handcuffed to the floor. He tries to dial 911 {{on the cell phone}} but Cooper comes in, interrupting him. Michael speaks to Nancy, who admits that she helped Cooper escape but didn’t <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> abduct anyone. She claims that she helped him because he claimed that he was innocent. Tara notes that Cooper had phoned Tara, and told him to go to a payphone near his police station. He goes there, and speaks to Cooper, who tells him to meet him at a warehouse. Cooper then apologizes to Rex, stating that [...] "no son should pay for the sins of the fathers", and walks out of the shack. Michael meets with him; he claims that he met him for [...] "justice", and said that he was innocent. Cooper explains that Rex will die without him, confirming that he will die from dehydration possibly soon. He goes home and takes a sleeping pill, transferring to the [...] "red reality". Later, in the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah is alive and Rex isn't), he speaks with Cooper at jail. He says that he didn't do it, and asks if he knows who did. He claimed that Jim Mayhew, another cop, committed the crime and framed him.|$|E

Oprah revealed that Thicke's initial appearance garnered a strong reaction, noting that people called the show {{to say that they}} didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be on. Oprah explained, [...] "So what I {{wanted to do was to}} accommodate all of the people who missed it the first time... In order to do that, I had to do something I've never done before.

2500|$|On January 30, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Daschle's friendship and business partnership with businessman Leo Hindery could cause problems for Daschle's Senate confirmation. Daschle has been a paid consultant and advisor to Hindery's InterMedia Partners since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a limousine and chauffeur. Daschle reportedly did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. A spokeswoman for Daschle said that he [...] "simply and probably naively" [...] considered the use of the car and driver [...] "a generous offer" [...] from Hindery, [...] "a longtime friend." [...] Daschle told the Senate Finance Committee that in June 2008—just as he was letting the press <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to be HHS secretary in an Obama administration—that [...] "something made him think that the car service might be taxable" [...] and he began seeking to remedy the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Yzerman's first {{off-season}} with Tampa Bay {{began with}} a splash. With the sixth pick of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, the Lightning selected forward Brett Connolly despite a history of injuries while playing for the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Prince George Cougars. When asked about Connolly's injuries being {{a factor in the}} decision to draft him, Yzerman boldly declared, [...] "I think it was a factor that he was available with the 6th pick. Because if he had been healthy all year, based on everything I <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have been available with the 6th pick." [...] On July 1, 2010, veteran blueliner Andrej Meszaros was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second round pick in 2011. Later that day, the Lightning signed their star winger Martin St. Louis to a four-year, $22.5million contract extension to come into effect on July 1, 2011. On July 19, in another move with the Flyers organization, the Lightning traded defenseman Matt Walker and Tampa Bay's fourth round pick in 2011 for high-scoring winger Simon Gagne. Other off-season acquisitions included the signing of forwards Sean Bergenheim, Dominic Moore and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, along with defensemen Brett Clark, Randy Jones and Pavel Kubina and goaltender Dan Ellis, as well as the re-signing of restricted free agent forward Steve Downie to a two-year, $3.7million deal.|$|E
