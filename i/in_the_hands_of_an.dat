5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located {{at the entrance to the}} stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E

5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inexperienced officer, and {{that most of the}} credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|On Spectrum's {{airborne}} headquarters, Cloudbase, Spectrum commander-in-chief Colonel White {{concludes that}} Brown was a traitor and was concealing a bomb on his person. Unaware of the Mysterons' subversion of his officers, he orders Scarlet's reconstruction {{to fly the}} President to a second Maximum Security Building in London. When {{the body of the}} original Brown is discovered {{at the scene of the}} SPC crash, it dawns on White that the President is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is not human. Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E
5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, QANTAS Limited and Britain's Imperial Airways (a {{forerunner of}} British Airways) formed a new company, Qantas Empire Airways Limited (QEA). Each partner held 49%, with two per cent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} arbitrator. The new airline commenced operations in December 1934 flying between Brisbane and Darwin using obsolescent DH.50 and de Havilland DH.61 biplanes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} is to use speech recognition software. In the past the hardware costs alone were so high {{that this was not}} a viable option in public schooling. However, in recent years as technology improved and prices fell, schools around the world introduced tablet computers to the classroom. And so the required computing power is already <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increasing number of children. One of the major advantages of using speech recognition software is that it can give feedback and so can be used to help improve pronunciation.|$|E

25|$|His son, William V, was 3 {{years old}} when his father died, and a long regency characterised by {{corruption}} and misrule began. His mother delegated most of {{the powers of the}} regency to Bentinck and her favorite, Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg. All power was concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unaccountable few, including the Frisian nobleman Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins. Still a teenager, William V assumed the position of stadtholder in 1766, the last to hold that office. In 1767, he married Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, the daughter of Augustus William of Prussia, niece of Frederick the Great.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 prince Trubetskoy (1813–1889) {{challenged}} Koene's {{story and}} published a different {{explanation of the}} events. According to Trubetskoy, all five test samples were sent to Warsaw and ended up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anonymous Polish plunderer who later emigrated to France. After his death Trubetskoy became his widow's agent; two or three coins were allegedly sold to an American collector and perished in a shipwreck, two remained in Trubetskoy's possession. Russian collectors contested Trubetskoy's account and suspected that the so-called Trubetskoy rubles were fake. After World War II Valentin Yanin partially redeemed Trubetskoy: according to Yanin, the legendary shipment of samples to Warsaw was a coverup of Cancrin's invention, rather than Trubetskoy's own hoax.|$|E
25|$|A major problem, afflicting early {{production}} Typhoons in particular, was {{a series}} of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance bell crank linkage had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.|$|E

25|$|The Shah's {{opportunity}} {{came with}} a series of rebellions in the Ottoman Empire: Abaza Mehmed Pasha, the governor of Erzurum, rose in rebellion, while Baghdad had been since 1621 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> officer of the Janissaries, the subashi Bakr, and his followers. Bakr had sought his recognition as the local pasha from the Porte, but the Sultan had ordered Hafız Ahmed Pasha, the governor of Diyarbakir, to intervene. Bakr then turned to Abbas, who sent troops to Bakr's aid. To forestall a Persian capture of Baghdad, Hafız Ahmed quickly restored relations with Bakr, who returned to Ottoman allegiance. In response, the Persians besieged Baghdad and took it on 14 January 1624, with the aid of Bakr's son, Muhammad. The fall of the city was followed by the massacre of a large part of its Sunni inhabitants, as the Shah endeavored to transform Baghdad into a purely Shiite city.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} is especially dramatic {{due in large}} part to the massive scale of the country's revenues from oil and other natural resources. The Guardian noted that the nation is enormously wealthy due to vast oil reserves, but that that wealth is concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elite minority. Despite its GDP per capita of $32,026 – which makes it richer than any other African country and places it above Spain, Portugal, and Russia – Equatorial Guinea is ranked 136th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index measure of quality of life. While the people of Equatorial Guinea technically have a per capita GDP similar to Spain or Italy, the vast majority live in poverty worse than Afghanistan or Chad, according to Arvind Ganesan of Human Rights Watch in 2009, attributing this disparity to the government's corruption, incompetence, and disregard of its own people's well-being. Most people in Equatorial Guinea remain in abject poverty, with no access to healthcare or education. Meanwhile, any criticism of the ruling class is non-existent due to the government's use of force and intimidation to silence opposition.|$|E

500|$|Epigraphical {{evidence}} suggests that Patroclus then visited Ceos. He made Ioulis, {{one of the four}} cities of the island, his headquarters, and apparently refounded the city of Koressos, naming it after Queen Arsinoe. A garrison was installed on the island, under the epistates Hieron of Syracuse. While there, Patroclus received a request from the citizens of Thera who were troubled by internal strife. He selected a board of five judges from Ioulis, to put the affairs of Thera in order. Patroclus also appointed an epistates, Apollodorus, probably also from Ioulis, but his exact role, i.e., whether his role was temporary, linked with the mission of the judges, or as commander of a permanent garrison on the island, is unclear. At about the same time, Patroclus expanded his ring of naval bases around the Greek mainland, occupying Methana in the Argolid, which he also renamed Arsinoe. As the Athenian port of Piraeus was probably still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Antigonid Macedonian garrison, he also fortified an uninhabited island off the coast of Attica, named after him [...] "Isle of Patroclus". At about this time, Patroclus dedicated a phiale to the panhellenic sanctuary at Delos.|$|E
