5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|Praxis almost {{disappeared}} {{in the years after}} the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974. Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s. However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In earlier centuries it was common practice for a student to wear if for the length of his studies. Students occasionally slept in it when consumption of wine frustrated their efforts to reach home. The cape would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a deep cut for each girlfriend. Today the academic attire is a ceremonial dress to use in formal students ceremonial. It is also somewhat expensive, and not the practical dress of time past.|$|E

500|$|For working her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted a large team of songwriters and producers.

I wont give up the fight.

500|$|Hawley did {{not want}} the {{audience}} to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the first run and have [...] "no resolution of any kind", and felt that by creating a complete story with a clear ending related to Haller's conflict with the Shadow King, audiences who were confused by the show's complicated narrative would be able to [...] "feel like they got it through the coherent story." [...] Hawley plotted this story out to take only [...] "eight hours", which is why he asked FX for a shorter first season of eight episodes. Hawley noted that the characters' conflict is a metaphor for an internal struggle, given the Shadow King's position as a parasite within Haller's mind. He was also more interested in setting up a longer-running rivalry than having the antagonist be a [...] "villain-of-the-year", and so the season leaves the character to be an external threat to Haller in the second season.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later, Madonna posted {{an image of}} a sunset with the words [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] on them, and a caption which the media {{interpreted}} as lyrics from a new song. The lines posted were: [...] "Day turns into night. I won't give up the fight. Don't want to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> my days... saying I wasn't amazed". Additional images showed Madonna with singer Natalia Kills in front of a microphone, and with Martin Kierszenbaum, the founder and chairman of Cherrytree Records, and senior executive of A for Interscope Records, Madonna's label. By mid-April 2014, she had also revealed on Instagram the names of songwriters Toby Gad and Mozella and record producer Symbolyc One with images of the group working in studio. The list of personnel grew to include producer Ariel Rechtshaid and sound engineer Nick Rowe. In an interview with Sirius XM Radio, Kierszenbaum described the recording process: ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!'

500|$|Dawson {{was given}} two {{versions}} of the script, one labeled [...] "The Klingon" [...] and the other [...] "The Human". The scripts treated the human and Klingon forms of Torres as two separate characters, emphasizing their flaws. Dawson observed that Human Torres lacked strength and courage, while Klingon Torres lacked logic and control. She felt that the Klingon should receive more attention, especially when Torres struggles with that side of her identity throughout the series. She also wanted the episode to capture Klingon Torres' respect for Human Torres. Dawson added that the episode's central theme was [...] "learning to respect the parts of one's self that make up the whole person". [...] "Faces" [...] was noted for establishing Torres' ongoing inability to reconcile her human and Klingon identities, in [...] "the most literal battle". [...] Biller disagreed with the episode's resolution, arguing that Torres should remain human. He felt that the episode should have a longer impact on Torres' character development, and believed: [...] "e couldn't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the episode and say that Torres has now resolved all her issues and is at peace with herself". This story arc continued in the later episodes [...] "Day of Honor" [...] and [...] "", in which Torres eventually accepted her Klingon heritage.|$|E

500|$|Although {{for much}} of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly {{preferred}} the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, [...] "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all." [...] Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as [...] "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, [...] "the greater they are, the worse they play me." [...] Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, [...] "I've run out of fingers". [...] Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, [...] "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> it by dint of absolute determination." ...|$|E

From the age of 8, Horowitz knew he wanted to be a writer, realizing [...] "the only time when I'm totally happy is when I'm writing". He graduated from the University of York with a lower second class degree in English literature and art history in 1977, where he was in Vanbrugh College.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{the game}} was to be more open world based, with the {{possibility}} that each NPC {{could turn into a}} Thing at any moment completely randomized. Curtis also hoped the player could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the game with many, perhaps all, of the NPCs still alive. However, this kind of open-endedness proved impossible to implement, with Curtis, pointing out [...] "it was of course very naïve as it caused huge problems with the squad command menu and dynamically balancing the encounters and resources required for the NPC." [...] Ultimately, NPC characters were scripted to change into Things at specific points, irrespective of the player's actions. This led to a much criticized aspect of the game; the player can test an NPC to find he is human only for him to change into a Thing mere second later. Programmer Diarmid Campbell explains ...|$|E

2500|$|A single {{house could}} have several {{interested}} parties, {{with the ground}} landlord or freeholder, being unaware {{of the actions of}} his or her leaseholder. Leaseholders would frequently lease out various parts of a house, while the weekly tenants sublet to lodgers, who sometimes sublet to other lodgers. Per cubic foot the rents in the Old Nichol were four to ten times higher than those of the finer streets of the London West End, averaging between 2s3d to 3s for a single room and around 7s6d for a three-room lodging. This provided high profits to speculative property dealers, which a housing reform campaigner of the time called [...] "the vampyres of the poor". [...] Many of the properties in the Old Nichol were held on fast-expiring leases, and leaseholders thought to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the lease without spending any money on maintenance or improvements.|$|E
2500|$|On February 28, 1914, Jack Pferdner, {{captain of}} the steamer Agnes, was serving on Nestor while Agnes was {{temporarily}} out of service. [...] Nestor was towing logs. [...] Near Prescott about 3 miles upriver from Rainier, some logs broke loose. [...] Pferdner walked out on the log tow to secure the loose logs. [...] This was called “dogging”. [...] The log Pferdner was walking on rolled, and he was thrown head-first into the river. [...] Pferdner came up and tried to grab on to the log, but it kept rolling, {{and he could not}} get a grip. [...] Capt James Peck, in charge of Nestor, yelled at Pferdner to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the log, but by this time, Pferdner was too exhausted to comply. [...] He let go of the log and sank under the water, and was not seen again. [...] Grappling hooks were used to search, all afternoon, for Pferdner’s body, but the only thing that was found was the hatchet that Pferdner had been holding when he was thrown into the water.|$|E
2500|$|Les Femmes (1969) was a flop, {{although}} the screwball comedy The Bear and the Doll (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: Les Novices (1970), Boulevard du Rhum (1971) (with Lino Ventura). The Legend of Frenchie King (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked [...] "Underneath what people call [...] "the Bardot myth" [...] was something interesting, {{even though she}} was never considered the most professional actress in the world.
