5|$|The Arp2/3 complex {{simultaneously}} controls nucleation of actin polymerization and branching of <b>filaments.</b> Moreover, autocatalysis {{is observed}} during Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. In this process, {{the newly formed}} <b>filaments</b> activate other Arp2/3 complexes, facilitating the formation of branched <b>filaments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine <b>filaments,</b> and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small <b>filaments,</b> and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} <b>filaments,</b> which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|The <b>filaments</b> exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been {{interpreted}} as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual <b>filaments</b> appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the <b>filaments</b> were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E

50|$|Myosin {{belongs to}} a family of motor proteins, and the muscle isoforms of this family {{comprise}} the thick <b>filament.</b> The thin <b>filament</b> is made of the skeletal muscle isoforms of actin. Each myosin protein 'paddles' along the thin actin <b>filament,</b> repeatedly binding to myosin-binding sites along the actin <b>filament,</b> ratcheting and letting go. In effect, the thick <b>filament</b> moves or slides along the thin <b>filament,</b> resulting in muscle contraction. This process {{is known as the}} sliding <b>filament</b> model.|$|R
5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric actin and serve as nucleation sites for new actin <b>filaments.</b> The complex binds {{to the sides of}} existing ("mother") <b>filaments</b> and initiates growth of a new ("daughter") filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother. Branched actin networks are created {{as a result of this}} nucleation of new <b>filaments.</b> The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} <b>filaments</b> of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow <b>filaments</b> of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing <b>filaments</b> and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing <b>filaments.</b> Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing <b>filaments</b> so that the new <b>filaments</b> can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{important}} component in <b>filament</b> formation is the Arp2/3 complex, which binds {{to the side}} of an already existing <b>filament</b> (or [...] "mother filament"), where it nucleates the formation of a new daughter <b>filament</b> at a 70 degree angle relative to the mother <b>filament,</b> effecting a fan-like branched <b>filament</b> network.|$|R

50|$|The <b>filament</b> was {{originally}} made by drawing out a <b>filament</b> of glass from a crucible of molten glass. To produce a sufficiently thin and long <b>filament</b> an arrow was fired {{across the room}} so that it dragged the <b>filament</b> from the molten glass.

5|$|The <b>filaments</b> are {{preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the <b>filaments</b> were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include <b>filaments</b> of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these <b>filaments</b> extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial <b>filaments.</b> These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E

Before the <b>filament</b> is extruded the nurdels are heated to 80°C to reduce water content. From there the nurdles are fed into a single screw extruder where it is heated and extruded into a <b>filament.</b> The diameter is often measured by a laser as part of a quality control mechanism to ensure correct diameter of the <b>filament.</b> The <b>filament</b> is then fed through a warm water tank which cools the <b>filament</b> which gives the <b>filament</b> its round shape.

The nuclear lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the nuclear pores and in {{the disintegration of the}} nuclear envelope during mitosis and its reassembly {{at the end of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|The {{posterior}} thoracic {{group is}} made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed appendages. The segments of these appendages are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace. They bear a fringe of long, slender <b>filaments,</b> all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans. Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the <b>filaments</b> were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive. The <b>filaments</b> at the tipmost segment are often bunched together. These appendages are believed to be the exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs. They are possibly biramous, with some specimens showing traces of what may be small endopodites at their bases.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (<b>filaments</b> {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like <b>filaments</b> are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
