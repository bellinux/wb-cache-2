5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various <b>international</b> <b>institutions,</b> from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in <b>international</b> <b>institutions.</b> The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) as an <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> within an English School framework. The thesis aims to explore fundamental questions regarding RtoP’s {{role in the}} international society: Is RtoP an <b>international</b> <b>institution?</b> Did the Libyan intervention change RtoP as an <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> and if so, in what way? In order to answer such questions, the thesis takes its departure in K. J. Holsti’s conceptualization of institutions as a constellation of patterned practices, ideas and norms, {{which is used to}} develop an analytical framework; enabling us to study RtoP as an <b>institution</b> within the <b>international</b> society and to study institutional change. First of all, the thesis examines how RtoP has developed into an <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> by identifying ideas, norms and practices relating to RtoP in the international society. More specifically, the thesis examines key points in the history of RtoP dating back to 2001 with the publication of the report “Responsibility to Protect” by the International Commission on State Sovereignty and Intervention. The report coined the idea of RtoP and placed it firmly on the international agenda. Subsequently, the thesis focuses on the evolvement of RtoP throughout the international society leading up to acceptance of RtoP at the United Nations General Assembly in 2005. In 2006, the great powers of the United Nations Security Council reaffirmed their support to the RtoP as an idea and consequently began to apply RtoP in practice. In continuation hereof, the thesis shows how the institutional character of RtoP has recently been strengthened, focusing in particular on the Libyan intervention. In this regard, the thesis examines both the reasons for applying RtoP in Libya, but also the type of institutional change the intervention produced. The thesis concludes that RtoP is a relatively new <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> with a low standardization of practices, ideas and norms. However, the Libyan intervention has spurred new discussions among the great powers in the United Nations Security Council on how RtoP is to by applied in the future; causing increased complexity to RtoP as an <b>international</b> <b>institution...</b>|$|R
