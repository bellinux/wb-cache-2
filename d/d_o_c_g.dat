40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{research}} is currently being conducted on wine pH because of {{its effect on the}} formation of turbidity in unfined white wines. The haze-forming tendency and the protein profile of an Italian white wine (Erbaluce di Caluso <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G.),</b> as affected by pH ranging from 3. 00 to 3. 60, a common pH range in wine, were analysed. The results indicated increased heat stability of the wine at lower pH, which was revealed by a lack of haze formation even above 70 °C. The pH increase was accompanied by a progressive shift in the haze formation temperature from 50 – 60 °C to 70 – 80 °C. The electrophoretic protein pattern of the wine was characterised, and proteins derived fromboth yeast and grape tissueswere identified. The statistical analysis of band intensities revealed that the solubility of five yeast and grape protein bands was modified by the pH shift. Most of the proteins involved were determined to be glycosylated, a feature that has been speculated to have an influence on the differential solubility of wine proteins in response to pH...|$|E
40|$|Grapevine pinot gris virus (GPGV) {{has been}} {{recently}} associated {{to a new}} grapevine disease in the Trentino region. Phylogenetic trees constructed with RNA dependent RNA polymerase and coat protein grouped this virus with a closely related thricovirus, Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus, isolated only in Japan. RT-PCR analysis carried out to check the presence of GPGV in symptomatic analysed vines from cv Glera in Valdobbiadene locations showed positive reaction with specific GPGV primers. The sequencing of PCR products showed identity with the nucleotide sequence of GPGV (Acc. num. NC_ 015782). Chlorotic mottling, mosaic patterns, puckering, shoots malformation and abnormal branching were the main symptoms observed in Prosecco grapevine. Symptoms recovery of the new shoots in infected vines has been observed in the warmer months from July. The diseased grapevines reduce yield and produce a low quality of berries, so that the infected plants must be removed causing an important economic loss {{in one of the}} most important grape-growing areas. Our analysis shows for the first time the presence of this new grapevine disease in the cv Glera on the Conegliano Valdobbiadene <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G.</b> area, suggesting a wide distribution of this new viral disease. A further investigation on GPGV spreading and epidemiology on cv Glera is in progress...|$|E
40|$|The soil carbon {{improves}} {{the physical and}} chemical properties of soil and it widely accepted that the carbon content in the soil {{is an important factor in}} the overall health of the soil and crops. In Italy and especially in Veneto region the loss of soil organic matter is a major problem for all sectors of agriculture and certainly also for the wine business. In order to restore soil organic matter has been proposed in this work a model of sustainable management for the re-use of plants and animals biomass (cattle manure, vine branches and grape marc) derived from agricultural practices. In particular, the research has focused on the study of the effects caused by the distribution of composted soil on the major aspects of production and quality of two vineyards, both located in the Conegliano-Valdobbiadene <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G.</b> zone. The characterization of composted soil improver has been obtained by the study of the evolution of some microbial groups active in fermentation processes and monitoring the changes in temperature, moisture, pH, carbon content, nitrogen, sulfur and heavy metals. The introduction of some innovative indices such as the capacity of the biodegradable organic substance evaluated by the degradation of cotton and silk wires inserted in the soil has allowed the diagnosis of the nutritional status of vine. The variables studied were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the statistical software "STATISTICA 12 " identifying in some cases large and significant differences (p < 0. 05). The treated vines showed an improvement in productivity and quality aspects of the grapes due to the contribution both of compost manure both of prunings residues and grape marc, with some variability related to the amount distributed and the method of distribution in the field. This improvement is certainly consequent on an increased biological fertility soil shown by a greater degradation of cotton and silk wires relating to the treated thesis compared to untreated control. ARISA analysis performed on samples of mature compost also showed unexpected and important processes of selection of useful microflora (bacteria and fungi). In conclusion, the compost has proved an excellent soil improver capable of restoring the soil fertility of the vineyards and improve the nutritional status of the vines. ...|$|E

The experimental vineyards were set up in 1993 and 1994 in Chianti Classico and in the Morellino di Scansano’ area respectively with ‘Sangiovese’ grapevines grafted onto twelve rootstocks (‘ 101 - 14 Mgt’, ‘ 1103 P’, ‘ 110 R’, ‘ 140 Ru’, ‘ 161 - 49 ’, ‘ 3309 C’ ‘ 41 B’, ‘ 420 A’, ‘ 775 P’, ‘ 779 P’, ‘K 5 BB’, ‘SO 4 ’)., In addition Gravesac was planted in the first zone and eight more rootstocks ('Rupestris Du Lot', ' 157 - 11 ', ' 34 EM', 'K 125 AA', ‘ 225 Ru’, ' 17 - 37 ', 'Fercal', ' 1045 P) ' in Chianti Classico. Both soils were non calcareous. In Chianti Classico the soil was a sandyclay (pH 8. 0) while in the 'Morellino di Scansano' area the soil was a clay loam sandy (pH 6. 9). This latter area was characterised by warmer and dry conditions during summer. In the 'Morellino di Scansano' area a less vine vigour was induced by 41 B’, 'Gravesac’ and ‘SO 4 ’ while ‘ 779 P’, ‘ 161 - 49 ’ and ‘ 140 Ru’ showed to increase plant vigour. The yield was not strictly correlated to vigour. The more productive vines were grafted onto ‘ 775 P’, followed by ‘ 779 P’, ‘ 101 - 14 ’, 110 R’, 140 Ru’ and ‘K 5 BB’', while ' 41 B' induced lower berry size and productivity and elevated sugar levels also maintaining good acidity, low pH, medium anthocyanin content of the berry. Berry sugar accumulation was the highest with ‘ 101 - 14 ’, 420 A’ and ‘ 110 R’, and lower with ’K 5 BB’. The berry anthocyanin and polyphenol richness were positively influenced by ‘SO 4 ’and ‘ 779 P’ {{and to a lesser extent}} by ‘’ 420 A’, ‘’ 101 - 14, ‘ 110 R’, ‘ 161 - 49 ’ and 140 Ru’, while 775 P’ ‘K 5 BB’, ‘Gravesac’, and ‘ 1103 P’ induced lower levels. In the Chianti Classico area ' 41 B’ and ‘ 420 A’ determined low vine vigour, while ‘Rupestris Du Lot’ significantly decreased yield. These results showed non-negligible differences of performances among the various rootstocks according to soil and climatic conditions.

Methodology: an exploratory and experimental study was carried out adding 100, 12 mg/L of {{dissolved organic carbon}} to synthetic water contaminated with Chlorpyrifos in order to feed the wetlands. A total amount of 20 samples were done, 16 of them in four experiments and the other ones in the intervals with no use of pesticides. Samples were taken on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in the six wetlands, three of them subsuperficial, and three of them superficial. The main variable answer was dissolved organic carbon, measured in the organic carbon analyzer. Results: a high efficiency in the removal of <b>d</b> <b>o</b> <b>c</b> was obtained with {{the two types of}} wetlands: 92, 3 % with subsuperficial flow and 95, 6 % with superficial flow.
