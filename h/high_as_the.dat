5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The {{center of the storm}} was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward in response to an area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> storm was disorganized.|$|E

5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> #2 {{quarterback in the}} country behind Joe Mauer, who {{would go on to}} play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first game of his senior season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder of his senior year. When he graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105. He set marks for most passing yards in a single season, passing yards in a single game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes in a game.|$|E
5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His ERA was nearly as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E

5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the {{pectoral}} fins are broad and roughly triangular. The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E

Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with the first pick in the 2001 NFL Draft, and there were questions about how well the team would cope {{with the loss of}} Vick and several other important players. Despite those fears, the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Normandy continued until August 1944, when the Allies {{broke out of}} the region and rapidly advanced to the German border. This campaign dominated the activities of eight of the ten Australian squadrons in the UK, as well as most of the airmen posted to RAF units. During July and August the RAAF units operated at or near their highest level of activity in the war to that point, but morale remained <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> airmen perceived that the contribution of air power to the campaign would be decisive. Large numbers of Australian airmen who were undergoing training or awaiting a posting on D-Day were assigned to combat units during the fighting to replace casualties of the Normandy campaign.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the water mobility mechanism of agarose gel, a consolidmeter was {{to prepare the}} foods. Dehydration time was shorter and also the value of void ratio was <b>higher</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> concentration of agarose increased. However, permiability was almost constant and dehydration ratio was lower. These result indicated that the holding capacity of water increased {{with the increase in}} concentration of agarose. The absorption ratio of water to the gel after dehydration was <b>higher</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> concentration of agarose increased. The reason was that the total capillary attraction caused by the dense network structure of gel increased. The rupture stress of gel when maxium loading weight was applied showed a higher value. The rupture stress of the gel after water absorption was lower than that of maxium loading weight...|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) {{at the back of}} the jawbone, is large and about as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising {{at the back of the}} jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The staircase has nine unusually high steps— high, about twice as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the {{both sides of the}} staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E

5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main hall of the Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main hall of the Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket sets are connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the roof frame from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI. Although the main petition office is the Complaints Office, petitions are usually sent to other offices and institutions (such as the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, the National People's Congress and party leadership as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> PSC) as well. Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout the country). In a case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E
