40|$|The Purpose of {{the paper}} is to prove the need of {{improving}} marketing logistics management at enterprises of agro-industrial complex {{with the use of}} balanced scorecard method that will allow objectively evaluate its effectiveness. Methodology. The survey is based on the use of general scientific research methods, methods of analysis and synthesis, method of abstraction. Results. Research of state sales of agricultural products in agrarian enterprises helped us to identify and organize the following disadvantages: intermediary structures that are engaged in marketing of agricultural products significantly increase their costs that excess in 2 - 4 times the original price of agricultural products; inadequacy of agricultural market infrastructure and lack of wholesale and retail markets for agricultural products; low level of development of information electronic communications; backwardness of transport infrastructure and poor quality of roads, particularly in rural areas; high level of physical and moral deterioration of transport; low level of development of industrial and technological base of agricultural enterprises warehousing. Practical implications. We systemized and proposed indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex based on the Balanced Scorecard in key areas: financial and cost-effectiveness indicators; indicators of internal logistics business processes; quality and development staff; indicators in the direction of working with clients. To the financial indicators and indicators of economic efficiency we included such as sales per 1 employer at marketing department (Qs/employer), proportion of logistics cost of marketing in the total cost of the enterprise (%), coefficient of the implementation of marketing plan (Cm), ROI in logistics marketing (%), profitability of marketing channels (%). Internal logistics business processes in enterprises of the agro-industrial complex represented by such indicators as the share of orders that executed late, including objective reasons (%), share of reject (fault of the manufacturer) (%), share of violating the terms of delivery, including objective reasons (%), speed of loading-unloading works (Sp). Indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics in the direction of quality and staff development at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex are characterized by such indicators as share of qualified personnel in marketing department (%), coefficient of employee turnover (Ce), share of <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> training in marketing department (%), level of investment return of staff training in marketing department (L). As the indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex in the direction of working with clients, we proposed such as the share of stable clients (%), reliability of supply (Csr), speed of customer and clients service (Csp), share of complaints on supply (%). Conclusions. Thus, using the proposed indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics in various areas, management of enterprises of the agro-industrial complex should determine the optimal set of parameters that will allow making realistic assessment of the results of functioning of its marketing logistics...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} {{of lung cancer}} is declining following a drop in smoking rates, {{but it is still}} {{the leading cause of death}} from cancer in England and Wales, with about 30, 000 deaths a year. Survival rates for lung cancer are poor everywhere, but they appear to be better in the rest of the European Community and the USA than in the UK. Only about 5 per cent of people with lung cancer survive for 5 years, and nearly all of these are cured by surgery after fortuitously early diagnosis. At present, only a small proportion of patients (probably about 5 per cent) with non-small-cell lung cancer are being given chemotherapy. Some centres treat a greater proportion. OBJECTIVES: This review examines the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four of the newer drugs - vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel - used for treating the most common type of lung cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer). The first three drugs are used for first-line treatment, but at present docetaxel is used only after first-line chemotherapy has failed. METHODS: This report was based on a systematic literature review and economic modelling, supplemented by cost data. RESULTS - NUMBER AND QUALITY OF STUDIES: A reasonable number of randomised trials were found - three for docetaxel, six for gemcitabine, five for paclitaxel and 13 for vinorelbine. The quality of the trials was variable but good overall. There was a wide range of comparators. Some trials compared chemotherapy with best supportive care (BSC), which involves care that aims to control symptoms, with palliative radiotherapy if needed, but not to prolong life. Others compared the newer drugs against previous drugs or combinations. RESULTS - SUMMARY OF BENEFITS: The gains in duration of survival with the new drugs are modest - a few months - but worthwhile in a condition for which the untreated survival is only about 5 months. There are also gains in quality of life compared with BSC, because on balance the side-effects of some forms of chemotherapy have less effect on quality of life than the effects of uncontrolled spread of cancer. RESULTS - COSTS: The total cost to the NHS of using these new drugs in England and Wales might be about GBP 10 million per annum, but is subject to a number of factors. There would be non-financial constraints on any increase in chemotherapy for the next few years, such as staffing; the number of patients choosing to have the newer forms of chemotherapy is not yet known; and the costs of the drugs may fall, for example, as generic forms appear. RESULTS - COST PER LIFE-YEAR GAINED: The available data did not provide an entirely satisfactory basis for cost-effectiveness calculations. The main problem was the lack of direct comparisons of the new drugs. In order to strengthen the analysis, three different modelling approaches were used: pairwise comparisons using trial data; cost-minimisation analysis, as if all the new regimens were of equal efficacy; and cost-effectiveness analysis pooling the results of several trials with different comparators, giving indirect comparisons of the new drugs by using BSC as the common comparator. A number of different scenarios were explored through extensive sensitivity analysis in each model. Outcomes were expressed in incremental cost per life-year saved or incremental cost, versus BSC. There was insufficient evidence from which to derive cost per quality-adjusted life-year. In first-line treatment, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and the lower-dose paclitaxel plus cisplatin combinations generally performed well against BSC under a range of different scenarios and especially when given as a maximum of 3 cycles. Incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) versus BSC varied depending on scenario, but baseline figures based on trial data and protocols were: single-agent vinorelbine, pound 2194 per LYG; vinorelbine plus cisplatin, pound 5206; single-agent gemcitabine, pound 5690; gemcitabine plus cisplatin, pound 10, 041; and paclitaxel plus cisplatin, pound 8537. In second-line chemotherapy, docetaxel gave a cost per LYG of pound 17, 546, again well within the range usually accepted as cost-effective. However, in routine care, the impact of therapy would be regularly reviewed, and continuation would depend on response, side-effects, patient choice and clinical judgement. Chemotherapy would be stopped in non-responders, making chemotherapy more cost-effective. A 'real-life' scenario in which 60 per cent of patients receive only 1 or 2 cycles of chemotherapy gives much lower costs per LYG, with single-agent gemcitabine, single-agent vinorelbine, and paclitaxel plus platinum appearing to be cost-saving compared with BSC; the incremental cost of gemcitabine plus cisplatin would be pound 2478 per LYG, and of vinorelbine plus cisplatin, pound 2808. At the very least, gains in duration of survival were achieved without diminution of quality of life (at best, they improved quality) and with relatively low incremental cost. Comparisons among the individual drugs should be viewed with caution because they have had to be based on indirect comparisons. RESULTS - LIMITATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS: Each of the three models had limitations. The cost-effectiveness estimates from the pairwise comparisons were based on single studies. The cost-minimisation analysis assumed that the regimens have equal efficacy in practice. The cost-effectiveness analysis had to be based on pooling data from individual trials. The costs of BSC, inpatient stay and outpatient visits were from Scottish data. Median rather than mean data on duration of survival have been used in the analysis, because most of the trials reported only median data. Median survival and number of drug cycles were calculated by averaging across a number of studies, rather than being reliant on one particular study. The costs of the less expensive antiemetics cited in the trials were omitted. The use of more modern and costly antiemetics would have a modest detrimental effect on cost-effectiveness. In the absence of published data, an estimate was made of the cost of side-effects of chemotherapy, in particular hospital admissions, and applied to all the new regimens. In practice, admissions related to side-effects and their respective costs are likely to vary by regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The new drugs for non-small-cell lung cancer extend life by only a few months compared with BSC, but appear to do so without net loss in quality of life and at a cost per LYG that is much lower than for many other NHS activities. Depending on assumptions used, these new drugs range from being cost-effective, as conventionally accepted, to being cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS - IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEWER DRUGS: One of the present constraints on chemotherapy is availability of inpatient beds. The advent of newer and gentler forms of chemotherapy given on an outpatient basis would not only overcome this, but it would allow more patients to be treated. This might apply particularly to older patients. The treatment of more patients would increase workload for oncologists, cancer nurses and pharmacists. The Government has already announced increased <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> for cancer care. The previously pessimistic attitudes to chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer are changing in the wake of the newer agents, and this shift is likely to increase referral. CONCLUSIONS - NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Recent advances in chemotherapy are welcome, but their effects remain small for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Much more research is needed into better drugs, better combinations, new ways of assessing the likelihood of response and especially direct comparisons between the new regimens. This research would be aided by having a greater proportion of patients involved in trials, but there will be infrastructure implications of increased participation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{research}} {{aim is to}} identify and evaluate "value" and "effectiveness" in the system of temporary staffing in one NHS Trust. Temporary staffing, known as Bank and Agency (B & A) staffing, is an increasing proportion of NHS expenditure (Bank staff are already contracted with the Trust and work extra shifts, while Agency staff are independently employed through the agency, costing more per shift). The system is reviewed in terms of quality, delivery and cost in relation to customers. The study assesses if unnecessary complexity, and poor standards significantly impact on effective performance. Design/methodology/approach - A diagnostic action research field based approach is taken with qualitative and quantitative analysis of the current system. This includes, cross-functional mapping, stakeholder value analysis and historical data collection. The theoretical perspective includes system theory, stakeholder theory and value. Findings - Research {{results indicate that the}} requirement for temporary staffing is predictable (previously thought to be unpredictable). Consequently, agency staffing can more readily be replaced with bank nurses. This could improve the outcomes of quality in service, delivery and reduce Trust expenditure. Research limitations/implications - Research results could be idiosyncratic and contextual therefore a comparative study is underway to determine validity. Indications are NHS <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> temporary <b>staffing,</b> particularly agency nurses, could be reduced while increasing effectiveness of the service.

50|$|While {{providing}} {{financial information}} to the government is a reasonable expectation to calculate a student’s financial need, {{it does not necessarily}} follow that colleges should have access to this information. Providing that information to schools may be problematic because schools learn about students’ other sources of funding and may adjust their financial aid packages accordingly. There is an asymmetric information problem since schools have full knowledge of their customers' ability to pay while students and their families have little information about costs that colleges face to provide their services. That is, when planning for the next academic year, a school will know its current and projected costs as well as each student’s ability to pay after receiving state and federal grants. According to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity (CCAP), “If the federal or state authorities increase financial support per student, the institution has the opportunity to capture part or all of that increased ability to pay by reducing institutional grants and/or raising their charges for tuition, fees, room, or board.” Importantly, it also notes that “the exception to this general pattern is modest aid targeted at only low-income students, like the Pell grant.” The center uses data about net proceeds (tuition plus room, board and other fees) as a percentage of median income to show that financial aid practices have not been effective in decreasing prices in an effort to increase access. Net proceeds at public four-year institutions rose from 15% to 20% of median income from 1987 to 2008.

We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} trend {{in the number of}} spin-offs generated by universities in the past thirty years. Past research reveals that the majority of these start-ups are located in the same region as the university from which they originated. In this paper, we investigate critically what universities do to encourage entrepreneurship to increase regional economic development. We will also discuss whether maximizing local entrepreneurship necessarily maximizes total welfare. Unfortunately, the scientific evidence reviewed in this paper indicates that policy changes at universities typically have very little impact on commercialization of research and the benefits to the universities are marginal. For example, current evidence indicates that creating incubators and science parks on university grounds have no discernable effects on local start-up rates. Further, from a theoretical perspective we have reviewed articles showing that introducing Technology Licensing Offices (TLOs), the most popular method to stimulate research commercialization, may likely introduce economic inefficiencies, hold-ups and decision biases that deviate from what is optimal. The median university among the top U. S. research-based institutions creates less than two academic spin-offs per year and so the relative effects on local economic conditions through TLO efforts and policies are bound to be marginal. Nevertheless the evidence also shows that the scientific stature of the faculty, the commercialization culture at the university, and the sheer number of science and engineering students graduated do have important positive effects on local start-up rates. Increasing <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> university <b>staff</b> and students causes increases in regional productivity growth and innovation and the marginal effects are much bigger in structurally weak regions. Evidence confirms that university spin-offs disproportionally favor local development. Maybe as much as 80 percent of all university spin-offs are and remain locally situated. However, universities that maximize local effects will not maximize their societal impact. Instead, it appears more efficient if universities simply try to maximize licensing revenues and not worry about the number of spin-offs and their locations...|$|R

This is particularly clear for countries such as Italy, Portugal and Sweden, where increases (decreases) in the <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> out-of-work benefits are coupled with lower (higher) mobility over time. Poland and Slovakia provide the opposite picture.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{major sources}} of {{financial}} support for the research undertaken by Edwards, Steptoe and Purdy between 1969 and 1978 are identified: the Ford Foundation, Oldham and District General Hospital (ODGH) Management Committee, and Miss Lillian Lincoln Howell via the American Friends of Cambridge University. Significant possible financial support from the World Health Organization was also identified. In addition, evidence of support in kind from GD Searle and Co. plus staff at ODGH was found. <b>Expenditure</b> <b>on</b> salaries of <b>staff</b> at Oldham was negligible, as most volunteered their time outside of their official paid duties. Work in Cambridge was evidently funded largely from Ford Foundation grants, as was Edwards' salary and probably that of Purdy. Clinical costs {{seem to have been}} largely borne by ODGH. The funds from Lillian Lincoln Howell supported travel and accommodation costs plus office costs. Overall, Edwards, Steptoe and Purdy achieved reasonable support for the programme of research, despite the initial rejection of funding by the Medical Research Council. However, this was at the expense of considerable inconvenience to Purdy and Edwards, and depended upon the good will of staff led by Muriel Harris in Oldham, who donated their time and expertise. As a result of our research, we conclude that, to Edwards, Steptoe and Purdy, should be added the names of two other hitherto neglected people who were essential to the success of this pioneering research: namely Muriel Harris and Lillian Lincoln Howell...|$|R

This is because this fixed <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> {{road transport}} proposed by Mr. Deputy Michal Doktor became {{no longer a}} novelty in 2009.
