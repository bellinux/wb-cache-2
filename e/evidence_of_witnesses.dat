Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside.

Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} this rule has been {{considered}} in cases when much of the prosecution case involves evidence by a witness who is absent from court.

That such an offer was made had been long published and long in print, with the remarks such as I have made upon it in the Ninth Report of the Select Committee; that the Committee had so done was well known to Mr. Hastings and Sir John D'Oyly; not one word on the part of Mr. Hastings, not one word on the part of Sir John D'Oyly was said to contradict it, until the appearance of the latter before the House of Commons.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} entitled, “Swearing an Oath toward Witness Testimony in Criminal Court. ” An oath is {{something}} that is sacred and is believed to result in sanctions if violated sin. An oath is expected that witness can give correct information. Beside that, the witness testifying under oath has become positive law with a maximum sanction of 7 (seven) to 9 (nine) years imprisonment. In fact, there are several cases on perjuries occurring in various regions in Indonesia. Eventhough the witness have been sworn but they often state false information. The Procedure Act in criminal cases is based on UU No. 8 tahun 1981 on Procedure of Criminal Act (Hukum Acara Pidana / KUHAP). It declares, that witness testimony is one <b>of</b> the <b>evidences.</b> Swearing an oath toward <b>witness</b> is one <b>of</b> the requirements validity <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> <b>evidence.</b> The results that the swearing an oath toward witness in giving testimony is one of the requirements validity <b>evidence</b> statement <b>of</b> <b>witness,</b> but not an absolute requirement. The witness was not sworn testimony, to have the strength <b>of</b> proving the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> testimony if there was relevance with the sworn testimony <b>of</b> other <b>witness.</b> Judge's assessment <b>of</b> the witness' testimony was free. The judge was not bound by the witness' testimony.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to summons proceedings, {{there is no}} distinction between the pleading stage and the trial stage in application proceedings. In essence, application procedure condenses the action process; the pleadings {{as well as the}} evidence are contained in the applications papers which go before the court. Application procedure is therefore reserved for matters in which the court can reach a decision on the documents before it, without resorting to the oral <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> because the parties do not dispute the material facts of the case.|$|E

The defence asked the appellate court to allow further examination of traffic recordings, which it argued supported {{the sequence of events}} put forward by Palfreeman and witnesses. The defence also asked for a review of the forensic evidence. Both requests were rejected. However, the court allowed re-examination of some of the witnesses who had changed their versions of events at trial. A change in law meant that civil claimants were no longer able to block the defence's use of original witness statements in its questioning.

5000|$|The use of {{the phrase}} was {{reviewed}} by the UK Supreme Court in Healthcare at Home Limited v. The Common Services Agency, where Lord Reed said: 1. The Clapham omnibus has many passengers. The most venerable is the reasonable man, who was born {{during the reign of}} Victoria but remains in vigorous health. Amongst the other passengers are the right-thinking member of society, familiar from the law of defamation, the officious bystander, the reasonable parent, the reasonable landlord, and the fair-minded and informed observer, all of whom have had season tickets for many years.2. The horse-drawn bus between Knightsbridge and Clapham, which Lord Bowen is thought to have had in mind, was real enough. But its most famous passenger, and the others I have mentioned, are legal fictions. They belong to an intellectual tradition of defining a legal standard by reference to a hypothetical person, which stretches back to the creation by Roman jurists of the figure of the bonus paterfamilias...3. It follows from the nature of the reasonable man, as a means of describing a standard applied by the court, that it would be misconceived for a party to seek to lead evidence from actual passengers on the Clapham omnibus as to how they would have acted in a given situation or what they would have foreseen, in order to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen. Even if the party offered to prove that his witnesses were reasonable men, the evidence would be beside the point. The behaviour of the reasonable man is not established by the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses,</b> but by the application of a legal standard by the court. The court may require to be informed by evidence of circumstances which bear on its application of the standard of the reasonable man in any particular case; but it is then for the court to determine the outcome, in those circumstances, of applying that impersonal standard.4. In recent times, some additional passengers from the European Union have boarded the Clapham omnibus. This appeal is concerned with one of them: the reasonably well-informed and normally diligent tenderer.|$|E
