I was pretty tentative in those days. We just sat around, Michael went through the little book he wrote lyrics <b>in,</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> just kind of strumming along behind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Fanning caused {{controversy}} when {{he chose}} to become a judge on television talent show You're a Star, to choose that year's act to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. He explained his decision: It’s indefensible. I just can’t defend this at all. It’s Eurovision for God’s sake. It’s all shite, everyone knows that. But I just don't care. I'm doing it for a laugh. Of course I'm going to get people slagging me off, but I'm used to all that. [...] I just thought, why not do it?" [...] he says. [...] "I've done everything else at this stage, including the Mercury Music Prize, IMRO Showcases and battle of the bands contests {{up and down the}} country. When I did 2TV from 1995 until 2000 I presided over the worst five years in 50 years of pop music history. It was all Boyzone videos and I'd slag them all to death. Then they'd be <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> the next week and I'd say 'lads, you're brilliant – three number ones in a row, well done'. I actually like Ronan and I like Keith as people, but I don't like their music. Everyone knows that. Indeed, Fanning helped both Keith and Ronan celebrate their weddings at Powerscourt Estate, Enniskerry, in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she came to the door of my house unbidden, my youngest son turned her away. Once, I was walking up to campus, and she fell <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'May I walk with you, Professor Bloom?' I said nothing." ...|$|E
