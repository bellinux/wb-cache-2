500|$|Dawkins {{suggests}} that atheists should be proud, not apologetic, stressing that atheism {{is evidence of}} a healthy, independent mind. He hopes that the more atheists identify themselves, the more the public will become aware of <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people are nonbelievers, thereby reducing the negative opinion of atheism among the religious majority. [...] Inspired by the gay rights movement, he endorsed the Out Campaign to encourage atheists worldwide to declare their stance publicly. He supported the UK's first atheist advertising initiative, the Atheist Bus Campaign in 2008, which aimed to raise funds to place atheist advertisements on buses in the London area.|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Barry Miles: [...] "Hippies didn't just pop up overnight, but 1965 {{was the first}} year in which a discernible youth movement began to emerge. Many of the key [...] "psychedelic" [...] rock bands formed this year." [...] On the West Coast, underground chemist Augustus Owsley Stanley III and Ken Kesey (along with his followers known as the [...] "Merry Pranksters") helped thousands of people take uncontrolled trips at Kesey's [...] "Acid Tests" [...] and in the new psychedelic dance halls. In Britain, Michael Hollingshead opened the World Psychedelic Centre and Beat Generation poets Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso read at the Royal Albert Hall. Miles adds: [...] "The readings acted {{as a catalyst for}} underground activity in London, as people suddenly realized <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> like-minded people there were around. This was also the year that London began to blossom into colour {{with the opening of the}} Granny Takes a Trip and Hung On You clothes shops." [...] Thanks to media coverage, use of LSD became widespread.|$|E

The series premiered on 10 March 2006, running until 14 April. The second episode, featuring Danny and Mickey running naked through Trafalgar Square, attracted a viewing audience of 6 million. Lester described the scene {{as one of his}} most embarrassing moments on-set, saying [...] "you forget <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> phone cameras there are... we thought [...] was fairly deserted, but as soon as someone shouted 'Action' there was a tourbus behind us and the whole top deck suddenly started filming".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1997, then-president of Alma College, Alan Stone, asked 480 {{colleges to}} boycott the U.S. News & World Report Rankings due to the peer {{assessment}} survey which counts for 22.5% of a college's ranking. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, in 1996, Alma College surveyed 158 colleges about the rankings. The result of the survey indicated that [...] "84 per cent of the respondents admitted that they were unfamiliar {{with some of the}} institutions they had been asked to rank. Almost 44 per cent indicated that they 'tended to leave responses for unfamiliar schools blank.'

2500|$|Alpha {{particles}} are tiny, positively charged particles that are spontaneously emitted by certain substances such as uranium and radium. [...] Rutherford himself had discovered them in 1899. In 1908 {{he was trying}} to precisely measure their charge-to-mass ratio. To do this, he first needed to know <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> alpha particles his sample of radium was giving off (after which he would measure their total charge and divide one by the other). [...] Alpha {{particles are}} too tiny to be seen even with a microscope, but Rutherford knew that alpha particles ionize air molecules, and if the air is within an electric field, the ions will produce an electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple counting device which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube. [...] Every alpha particle that passed through the tube would create a pulse of electricity that could be counted. [...] It was an early version of the Geiger counter.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1915 the Greek chargé d'affaires {{claimed that}} the deportations [...] "can not be any other issue than an {{annihilation}} war against the Greek nation in Turkey and as measures hereof they have been implementing forced conversions to Islam, in obvious aim to, that if {{after the end of}} the war there again would be a question of European intervention for the protection of the Christians, there will be as few of them left as possible." [...] According to George W. Rendel of the British Foreign Office, by 1918 [...] "...over 500,000 Greeks were deported of whom comparatively few survived." [...] In his memoirs, the United States ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1913 and 1916 wrote [...] "Everywhere the Greeks were gathered in groups and, under the so-called protection of Turkish gendarmes, they were transported, the larger part on foot, into the interior. <b>Just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> were scattered in this fashion is not definitely known, the estimates varying anywhere from 200,000 up to 1,000,000." ...|$|E
2500|$|Child labour {{has been}} a {{consistent}} struggle for children in Brazil ever since the country was colonised on April 22, 1500 by Pedro Álvares Cabral. Work that many children took part in was not always visible, legal, or paid. Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and {{was a part of}} their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood. [...] Yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is, there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period. Due to this lack of documentation, it is hard to determine <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century. The first documentation of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits. [...] Armando Dias, for example, died in November 1913 whilst still very young, a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked. Boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis.|$|E

However, Dunlap suspected that this outburst of pleasant behavior was actually sparked by Husky-Wayne trying to get ahead of some scandal, perhaps involving child molestation. These random accusations resulted in Jackie Broyles having no sponsor for Episode 149, during which Dunlap spent much time <b>just</b> wondering <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people he had baselessly accused of child molestation and whether some sort of master list of these victims might be assembled.|$|R

2500|$|A grassy knoll at Arlington National Cemetery {{adjacent}} to the burial field containing the dead of the Santiago campaign was chosen by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Herbert Allen for the reinterment. The remains of 166 dead were contained in the 151 caskets (as only partial remains were found in many cases). Either 10, 22 or 30 families (sources differ) asked that the remains {{of their loved ones}} be returned for private burial. But few remains were identifiable (among them the remains of Frederick C. Holzer). It is unclear <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the remains were identifiable, as some sources say only 10 and others say 24. Although these families were initially promised that they could take their dead home and bury them privately, the War Department reluctantly decided not to do so. All identifiable remains received a headstone with a name on it, while all other remains were marked [...] "Unknown". (Some sources claim that 191 bodies or portions of bodies were recovered, and 73 of these were identifiable. By this calculation, 166 were buried at Arlington National Cemetery on December 28, 1899, and 25 remained at Key West.) ...|$|E

30|$|This article studies {{minimum wage}} {{non-compliance}} in Honduras, a dual labor market with high wage floors that are weakly enforced. However, rather than <b>just</b> counting <b>how</b> <b>many</b> workers earn sub-minimum wages, it also estimates violation indices that measure compliance at the intensive margin. I first explore cross-sectional heterogeneity in violations using household survey data. Then, I quantify compliance adjustments to minimum wage hikes by comparing indices {{before and after}} a large unexpected increase. Results show substantial differences in non-compliance across industries, location, and coverage status. Violations worsen with rising minima, but less in in more compliant sectors.|$|R
