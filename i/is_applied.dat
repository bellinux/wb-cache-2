5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b> Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used in}} {{carborundum}} printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. Carborundum grit <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> in a {{paste to}} the surface of an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E
5|$|A {{solution}} of tin(II) chloride containing a little hydrochloric acid {{is used for}} the tin-plating of steel, in order to make tin cans. An electric potential <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> and tin metal is formed at the cathode via electrolysis.|$|E

5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b> Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The plate <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E

60|$|Observe {{also that}} the {{evolutionary}} method has invaded each of the concrete sciences in the exact order of their natural place {{in the hierarchy of}} knowledge. It had <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to astronomy by Kant and Laplace before it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to geology by Lyell; it had <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to geology by Lyell before it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to biology by Darwin; it had <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to biology (in part, at least) by Lamarck and the Darwins before it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to psychology by Spencer; and it is only {{at the very end of}} all that it has <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to sociology and the allied branches of thought by a hundred different earnest workers in contemporary Europe. Each stage helped on the next; each was dependent only on those that went naturally before it, and aided in turn the subsequent development of those that naturally came after it.|$|R
30|$|Each {{treatment}} plot included 10 trees (two rows of five trees) with {{a buffer}} of two rows between adjacent plots. Herbicides <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> {{to the inner}} 10 trees. For the Pinus radiata trial, all treatments, except treatments 8 and 9, <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> in mid-October 2011 or 2012. Treatments 8 and 9 <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> on 6 December 2011. The same methods {{were used for the}} Pseudotsuga menziesii trial, with the exception of treatments 10 and 11 which <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> in late July 2012. All treatments <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> manually using a Solo Knapsack sprayer calibrated to deliver 200  L ha− 1.|$|R
5|$|Because {{there are}} 26 letters (2×13) {{in the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> so the same action {{can be used for}} encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.|$|E
5|$|BitLocker {{is a full}} disk {{encryption}} feature {{included with}} Windows Vista and later. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. By default it uses the AES encryption algorithm in cipher block chaining (CBC) or XTS mode with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. CBC is not used over the whole disk; it <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to each individual sector.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to their}} ability to fix {{molecular}} nitrogen and therefore increase the soil fertility and stimulate plant growth, Azotobacter species are widely used in agriculture, particularly in nitrogen biofertilizers such as azotobacterin. They are also used in production of alginic acid, which <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> in medicine as an antacid, in the food industry as an additive to ice cream, puddings, and creams.|$|E
5|$|Proponents {{of the use}} of {{leverage}} argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.|$|E
5|$|Symbols {{are written}} in upright (Roman) type (m for metres, s for seconds), so as to {{differentiate}} from the italic type used for quantities (m for mass, s for displacement).
