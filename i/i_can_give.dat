500|$|With the team's {{probation}} over, Farmer and {{the other}} three seniors played in their first [...] and only [...] postseason games in the 199192 season. After an opening round win against Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament in Birmingham, Alabama, Kentucky won its third meeting of the season with LSU 8074 in the second round; the Tigers were without star center Shaquille O'Neal, who was suspended for fighting with Tennessee's Carlus Groves in his team's opening round victory. In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward Andre Perry, who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 8054 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Mashburn, who shot 26-for-31 in the Wildcats' three tournament games, said of his performance, [...] "At the beginning of the season, I told the four seniors 'this is the only thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> you.

500|$|A. I {{would like}} to say the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings. As Poliakov says, in Poliakov - Black or Red - <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the page number right away...I have it in my files somewhere...he reproduces forms. On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I want to say this here in this context as well, although I know that it is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E
500|$|Clay was not {{the only}} one who hoped to benefit from Harrison's election. Hordes of office {{applicants}} came to the White House, which was then open to all who wanted a meeting with the President. Most of Harrison's business during his month-long presidency involved extensive social obligations—an inevitable part of his high position and arrival in Washington—and receiving visitors at the White House. They awaited him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion. Harrison wrote in a letter dated March 10, [...] "I am so much harassed by the multitude that call upon me that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> no proper attention to any business of my own." [...] Nevertheless, Harrison sent a number of nominations for office to the Senate for confirmation during his month in office. The new 27th Congress had convened an extraordinary session for the purpose of confirming Harrison's cabinet and other important nominees, since a number of them arrived after Congress' March 15 adjournment; however, John Tyler would ultimately be forced to renominate many of Harrison's selections.|$|E

She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E

500|$|One {{year after}} the all-star {{recording}} of [...] "What More Can I Give", it was played {{for the first time}} on radio. WKTU-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, [...] "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called [...] "What More Can I Give", and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them think about what they can give." [...] It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of [...] "What More Can I Give".|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E
500|$|Her {{political}} mettle and ambitions for {{her husband}} were however to be more severely tested following the Liberal victory. Rosebery was, as expected, offered a position in Government by Gladstone. It had been rumoured that the position of Viceroy of Ireland or a cabinet place would be proffered, {{but it turned out}} to be the job of Under Secretary of the India Office. Rosebery immediately declined the post, giving as his reason that it would appear that he was being repaid for running Gladstone's campaign (as though the Viceregal position would not). When pressed further he cited ill health—he had been suffering from scarlet fever during the Midlothian campaign and now also appeared to be suffering a minor nervous breakdown. Political leaders urged Lady Rosebery to influence him, but she defended his decision, while stressing that his deterioration in health was only temporary. She had to be careful—if it appeared her husband had declined the offer on the grounds that it was too lowly, it would give substance to the claims being made that he was conceited and petulant. Whatever the truth, and it may be Rosebery's own explanation that he [...] "disliked hard work," [...] Lady Rosebery continued to solicit Gladstone for a job for Rosebery within the cabinet. In August 1880, when Gladstone told her firmly that [...] "There is nothing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> him," [...] she claimed she had not been seeking a cabinet post and Gladstone had misunderstood her. At the same time she was canny enough to mention that Sir William Harcourt and Sir Charles Dilke, both radicals opposed to Gladstone's policies, were [...] "visiting them" [...] and [...] "thoughtful." [...] Lady Rosebery also began to befriend those politicians such as Lord Northbrook who empathised with her husband, while others such as Lord Granville and Lord Hartington she identified as aloof. She dismissed Lord Spencer with [...] "I can never look on him as a great motive power, besides he does not mention Archie [...] to me." [...] This was the same Lord Spencer who had advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against visiting the homes of wealthy Jews.|$|E

Menken's demo version of the song is included on deluxe editions of the album. [...] "Evermore" [...] has garnered mostly positive reviews from both film and music critics, establishing itself as an audience favorite. Vulture.com's Sarah Caldwell commended the studio's [...] "audacious" [...] decision to insert a new musical number that immediately follows the film's most famous tune, its title song. Writing for Stuff.co.nz, James Croot appreciated [...] "Evermore" [...] for both [...] "enhanc the story" [...] and allowing the Beast to sing. Similarly, Katlin Risen, writing for The State Journal-Register, agreed that the song is [...] "a lovely addition to the story". Including [...] "Evermore" [...] among [...] "the new movie's highlights", the Christian Broadcasting Network reviewed it as [...] "a wonderful, heartbreaking ballad". In addition to Thompson's rendition of the title song, the Daily Bruins Matthew Fernandez highlighted the track as [...] "the only other song that matches {{the grandeur of the}} classic Disney works". Writing for the British Film Institute, Kate Stables agreed that [...] "Evermore" [...] remains [...] "the only standout among the film’s forgettable trio of new songs." [...] Lindsay Bahr of the Associated Press reviewed [...] "Evermore" [...] as [...] "a more fitting ballad for the Beast" [...] than [...] "If I Can't Love Her", while Her Campus' Justine Steiner described the ballad as [...] "infectious". Andrew Gaug of News-Press NOW called the musical number [...] "a welcome addition" [...] to the film. Xposés Marese O'Sullivan claims to have particularly [...] "adored" [...] the song. Cameron Meier of Orlando Weekly lauded [...] "Evermore" [...] as [...] "the dramatic highlight of" [...] the film, [...] "almost enticing me to arise and applaud", while Metros Sarah Deen dubbed it [...] "an instant classic".Critics agreed that Stevens' [...] "powerful" [...] performance of the song is a highlight of the film.

[...] Jason Fraley of WTOP agreed that Stevens' performance [...] "will give you chills", crowning [...] "Evermore" [...] the [...] "Best of" [...] Beauty and the Beasts original songs.

[...] According to The Toronto Stars Peter Howell, [...] "Evermore" [...] establishes Stevens among [...] "the [...] best singers", while La Presses Sonia Sarfati was moved by the actor's interpretation. Varsity contributor Robert Crawford appreciated Stevens for [...] "add a welcome, spine-tingling melancholy moment to an otherwise joyous score." [...] CIHR-FM's Shelby Knox concluded that, despite the actor's limited singing experience, Stevens [...] "shows a lot of promise", dubbing his song the film's [...] "stand out". Fred Hawson of ABS-CBN News recognized [...] "Evermore" [...] as a strong contender for an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination. The Hollywood Reporters Scott Feinberg agreed that [...] "Evermore" [...] is the [...] "strongest" [...] prospective Best Original Song nominee from the film, while Paul Sheehan of Golderby concurred that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will most likely favor [...] "Evermore" [...] over [...] "How Does a Moment Last Forever" [...] and [...] "Days in the Sun". Meanwhile, MTV included the song at number four on their ranking of [...] "All 14 Songs from Disney's Live-action Beauty and the Beast"; author Crystal Bell claims that she would have ranked [...] "Evermore" [...] higher if Stevens' voice hadn't been manipulated to sound deeper than it is. Bell went on to write that the song sounds like [...] "a B side off The Hunchback of Notre Dame", which she insists is [...] "the highest compliment <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> a song." ...|$|E
