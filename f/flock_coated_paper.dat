40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> {{printability}} for image quality on the high-fidelity digital printing was studied in this paper. Compared {{with the traditional}} printing technology, high-fidelity digital printing technology {{is more likely to}} expand the color gamut, maintain the original tone linear and produce vivid image. The performance of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> to a large extent determines the image quality. In order to get high-quality printed matters, the mechanism of the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> printability influencing on the performance on high-fidelity digital printing is need to be researched in-depth. The printability of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> was studied from several aspects in this paper, including the structural properties, roughness, optical properties, absorption etc, the relationships between these properties and printing color, dot reproduction performance were also studied. Based on the previous theoretical and practical studies, the printability evaluation system of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> on high-fidelity digital printing was established initially. On digital printing, accurate color management technology also affects the printing quality as the performance of <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> so the advanced color management technology was also used in the current study. The results showed that the pore structure and the absorbent of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> were the most important factors for affecting the printing quality, and the roughness and optical properties of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> also had a certain impact...|$|R

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of kelp coating on the physical properties of <b>coated</b> <b>papers.</b> It was found that kelp <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> showed significant difference on physical properties, compared with uncoated ones.

40|$|Drying occurs {{twice during}} <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> production: first, when drying the base paper, then when drying the sheet freshly coated with an aqueous {{suspension}} of pigment particles. The effects on <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both base <b>paper</b> and <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight <b>coated</b> (LWC) <b>paper.</b> A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the base paper with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried base <b>paper</b> was <b>coated</b> and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> than air-dried base paper. Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the coated sheet. The biggest effect on LWC <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive. Drying with superheated steam gave lower gloss and smoothness than drying in air. Print mottle was significantly improved with steam drying of the coated sheet. Superheated steam drying of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> has advantages only if used for the coated sheet not the base sheet...|$|R

40|$|Curtain coating is {{non-contact}} pre-metered coating process, {{which offers}} {{great potential for}} improved coverage at lower coat weights for the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> industry. Absence of shear and hydrostatic force leads to differences in coating-basesheet interactions and process dynamics currently experienced with other conventional coating processes. These differences may lead to surface characteristics of curtain <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> that {{are very different from}} those obtained by conventional coating methods. Due to these differences, printing attributes of curtain <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> are crucial to their acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the absence of shear, pigment alignment is not as strong as in other conventional coating processes. In addition, as there is little hydrostatic pressure, binder migration is minimal, so more binder is present at the surface. The increase in binder at the surface improves the interaction of the coating layer with the ink, resulting in a thicker layer of ink transfer to the base sheet in offset printing. In this study, the calendering response, printability and surface of curtain <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> were compared with blade <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> at equal <b>coat</b> weights and surface roughness.

40|$|Abstract. Coating pore {{structure}} of low gloss <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> based on different pigment blends was analyzed using mercury intrusion method in this paper. The {{results show that}} pore size of coating layer structure of low gloss <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> ranges from 20 nm- 500 nm, and the range from 500 nm- 5000 nm is mainly from base paper and interactions between coating color and base <b>paper.</b> Printability of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> can be well related with coating {{pore structure}}. Print gloss is strongly influenced by pore size and pore volume. Large pore diameters and small pore volume of coating layer structure can improve print gloss. Ink density increases with the increasing of pore diameter while the pore volume is kept constant. The increasing of pore volume of coat layer structure will improve capillary absorption and then improve ink absorption. The control of coating pore structure {{is very important for}} producing low gloss <b>coated</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|R

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of chitosan as a <b>paper</b> <b>coating</b> which were prepared by dissolution in acetic acid solution. The mechanical properties of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> were improved significantly compared with non-coated paper. The FT-IR spectra showed peak evolution at 1558 cm- 1 for <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> due {{to the existence of}} amine group. Since FT-IR spectra for the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> was almost identical to the chitosan spectrum, it is assumed that there is an obvious physical interaction rather than the chemical interaction. The SEM micrographs showed that some of the chitosan has occupied the pores and some of them adhered only on the surface. This {{may be due to the}} chemical similarities between cellulose and chitosan which enhanced the strength of fiber matrixes via hydrogen bonding. The antibacterial property of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> showed that chitosan in dried form has no significant effect but effective when applied as wet solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Having been coated, {{the surface}} {{unevenness}} and pores on paper {{were covered by}} a coating layer composed of fine particles and binders, which can absorb ink well, thereby a good uniformity and smoothness of paper could be obtained, consequently, the reproducing capability for printing dot and good whiteness, gloss and opacity can be improved. In theory, the ink rub resistance for <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> print is mainly affected by the ink absorbance property of paper, printing conditions, ink components, rub medium and so on. In this study, seven different kinds of <b>coated</b> <b>papers,</b> the viscosities of the inks were adjusted with a viscosity adjusting agent, and then the prints were prepared by proofing with the ink with different viscosities. After drying, the prints were used for rub testing. The impact of the basic properties of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> {{and the content of}} reducer in inks on rub resistance were discussed {{on the basis of a}} comparative analysis of the experimental data. Printing color density loss rate and print color difference were exploited in this paper to characterize the ink rub resistance for <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> prints. In this study, it was found that ink rub resistance was mainly influenced by ink absorbency and smoothness of the paper. Under the similar conditions, the color density of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> print decreases with the rub strength increasing, color difference increased gradually, but not linearly. With the increase of ink viscosity reducer content, printing density loss rates as well as color difference changed, but not be linearly...|$|R
