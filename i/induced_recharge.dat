Analyses of sinkhole distribution in Beacon Woods, Florida, preliminarily indicate their occurrence is {{an order of magnitude}} greater in urban versus undeveloped areas, suggesting the structures themselves are enhancing the collapse process. The most likely causes are <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> via at least one of two sources. First, runoff and drainage from roads, structures, and impoundments that is not adequately dispersed will promote sinkhole development. Second, leaking water, sewer, and septic systems beneath or adjacent to a structure will also promote collapse. The process of cover-collapse from <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> is well understood. However, building codes generally do not require drainage and structural engineering practices that would reduce <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> and thus reduce the risk of collapse. This paper proposes engineering practices that measurably restrict the accidental discharge of municipal water through leaking subgrade drainage systems or the deliberate discharge of stormwater runoff, induced shallow groundwater recharge from retention ponds and septic drainfields, or heavily-irrigated land use. We recommend these practices be incorporated into building codes and ordinances to reduce induced sinkhole development in areas prone to cover-collapse...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{demands for}} {{groundwater}} by agriculture, industries, and municipalities have {{raised concerns about}} the future availability of groundwater in Iowa. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature began funding a comprehensive Water Resources Management program, which was implemented by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. A key aspect {{of the program is}} to evaluate and quantify the groundwater resources across the state using computer simulation models. These models help answer questions such as: “How much water can be pumped from an aquifer over 10, 20, or 100 years?” or “Will my well go dry?” A groundwater study was initiated to understand the shallow groundwater resources in the Lower Raccoon River aquifer. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the aquifer for future water supply development under drought conditions. A groundwater flow model of the Lower Raccoon River aquifer was created using Visual MODFLOW 2011. 1. The model was used to generate source water capture zones, evaluate surface water and groundwater interaction, and estimate maximum sustainable pumping rates. Water level data during the summer of 2012 were used to help calibrate the model. Based on the mass balance calculations in the model, the percentage of water production supplied by the Raccoon River (from Dallas Center to West Des Moines) was 52 percent, and 29 percent was supplied by <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from the numerous sand and gravel quarries. The remaining 19 percent of the water production is supplied by precipitation recharge and groundwater inflow into the model area. The percentage of <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> varied from 0 percent at Van Meter to 89 percent at Des Moines Water Works radial wellfield. <b>Induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from the Raccoon River (from Dallas Center to West Des Moines) allows public wells to maintain water production during prolonged dry periods. Limitations in water production exist when streamflow along the Raccoon River drops below 17. 1 cubic feet per second (43. 4 cfs if the Fleur Drive infiltration gallery is included). Based on available pumping records, an average of 14. 6 billion gallons of water are pumped from the Lower Raccoon River aquifer each year. Additional water production is available from the aquifer, but limitations exist during extremely dry years. Additional pumping capacity ranges from 10 percent in the West Des Moines wellfield, to over 1, 000 percent at Adel. Potential well yields greater than 500 gallons per minute (gpm) are found near Adel, Van Meter, and West Des Moines. The highest potential well yields occur east of Adel, and are the result of the cobble and boulder zone found at the base of the aquifer, and the abundance of <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from the nearby sand and gravel quarries and the Raccoon River.

40|$|The Iowa Geological Survey (IGS) {{completed}} a drought assessment to evaluate {{current and future}} groundwater storage and availability for the City of Sioux Center’s (City) alluvial wellfield. The City had previously hired DGR Engineering to design two low-head dams along the west fork of the Floyd River. A calibrated groundwater flow model {{was developed by the}} IGS to provide the City with a quantitative evaluation of the additional groundwater storage potential of the low-head dams. Various other drought strategies to enhance both aquifer storage and induced (river) recharge were also valuated using the calibrated flow model. The groundwater flow model was used to estimate the percentage of water obtained from <b>induced</b> <b>recharge.</b> Based on model results, the current (no low-head dams) <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> on May 13, 2015, was 48 %, which corresponds to approximately 365 gallons per minute (gpm). This is an estimate based on Wells 5 through 13 pumping continuously, and Wells 1 through 4 pumping periodically. The proposed low-head dams increased <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> to 61 %, or 464 gpm. Adding a constructed wetland to the east of Wells 9 through 13 (in addition to the proposed lowhead dams) is shown to increase the <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> to 69 % or 525 gpm. The proposed low-head dams would raise the river stage approximately 2. 5 feet at the proposed southern dam (currently there is a temporary low head dam that raises the river stage 1. 5 feet), and approximately 4 feet at the proposed northern dam. Based on the calibrated groundwater flow model, the proposed low head dams would increase groundwater storage by 46 million gallons. Assuming this additional storage would benefit production Wells 4 through 13, and assuming a worst case drought (Floyd River would cease flowing), the additional groundwater storage would allow production Wells 4 through 13 to continue to operate for approximately 58 days with no streamflow in the river. If the former sand and gravel quarries located in the City Park are used for emergency sources of recharge, and pumped into the west branch of the Floyd River, an additional 10. 3 million gallons of water may be added to the groundwater storage. This would increase the days of operation of Wells 4 through 13 to 70 days with no streamflow river. Based on model results, a proposed constructed wetland (in addition to the proposed low-head dams) to the east of Wells 9 through 13 would increase the total groundwater storage to 74 million gallons. This would allow production Wells 4 through 13 to continue to operate under severe drought conditions (no streamflow on the west fork of the Floyd River) for approximately 93 days. Based on the groundwater flow results from the model, production Wells 11 and 13 would obtain most of their recharge from the river and from the constructed wetland. Currently, approximately 50 % of the recharge to Wells 11 and 13 comes from land used for growing corn. Adding the two proposed low-head dams and constructed wetland may result in improvements to groundwater quality. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Great rivers, like Po in the Padana plain, are a main {{water supply}} for {{municipal}} use; {{at the same}} time, however, surface waters are subjected to higher pollution risk, need expensive purification procedures and are exposed to recurrent episodes of drought in the season where higher is the demand for water supply. An interesting alternative resource may be identified in paleo-channels running near the river; such mainly sandy lithosomes are indirectly recharged by the big river and might become as well targets {{for the implementation of}} <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> project schemes. The paper deals with a sector of the “Po-shallow sandy aquifers complex”, located along the southern bank of the river across the boundaries of Lombardy and Emilia Romagna regions. The area is located 15 km {{to the west of the}} city of Ferrara, at the moment depending mainly on the Po river for its public water supply demand. In this area two different sandy aquifer occur, both in indirect recharge relationship with the Po: an upper unconfined Holocenic aquifer and a lower leaky confined Upper Pleistocenic aquifer, separated by a silty-clayey aquitard. Somewhere the two units amalgamate each other so originating a single unconfined high thickness aquifer; in this hydrogeological context it’s peculiar the presence of sand quarry lakes, so directly recharged by the Po. Water quality of this lakes is much better than that one of the Po itself due to the natural attenuation power of the porous medium. The paper shows the results of a groundwater heads and surface water stages continuous monitoring programme (active since July 2002), integrated by hydrochemical data, for studying the processes of pressure and mass transfert of this complex indirect recharge system, to evaluate the water budget of the Settepolesini lake and, trough a numerical modelling, the potential of stimulating <b>induced</b> <b>recharge...</b>|$|E

The first {{involves}} {{an analysis of the}} groundwater character- istics of the gravels. This includes an estimation of the permeability of the gravels (using single-well dilution methods) and an analysis of the recharge mechanisms operating in them. The latter is based upon observed relationships between groundwater fluctuations and hydrometeorological factors. Secondly, the hydrological effects of gravel extraction and dewatering are analysed. By monitoring groundwater levels, {{the nature and extent of}} the zone of drav/dcvm around the gravel pits is determined. <b>Induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from rivers and recirculation of water from surface ditches into the pits, as a result of dewatering, is identified. Estimates of the proportion of <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> in groundwater are then made using chemical evidence. A mathematical model of gravel pit dewatering is developed. The influence of hydraulic conductivity and the initial pumping rate in determining the effects of dewatering is established by a series of sensitivity analyses using this model. As a practical example, the model is used to predict the effects of dewatering a new site near Stanton Harcourt. The extent of the drawdown around each stage in its development is determined, and this is used to evaluate the effects on private sources and agriculture in the surrounding area. Thirdly, the effects of one type of rehabilitation project (i. e. lake formation) are investigated. A method for predicting the final lake level is explained. Deviation of the observed lake levels from those predicted is explained in terms of the sealing effect of fine sediment plus chemical and biological processes. The effects of lake formation on groundwater levels and flow are described, and the changes in water quality produced by the flow of groundwater through a lake are examined. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although Iowa is not {{facing an}} {{immediate}} water shortage, {{increased demand for}} groundwater by agriculture, industries, and municipalities has raised concerns {{for the future of}} the resource. To assist decision makers, an intensive one-year investigation was undertaken to provide a more quantitative assessment of the West Nishnabotna alluvial aquifer. The primary objective of this quantitative assessment was to develop a groundwater flow model to provide planning tools for future water resource development. The hydrologic characteristics of the West Nishnabotna aquifer were evaluated to provide input for model development. A total of 10 aquifer pump and recovery tests and 51 specific capacity tests were used to calculate the aquifer parameters. The hydraulic properties of the West Nishnabotna aquifer were shown to vary considerably both laterally and vertically. Hydraulic conductivity was found to range from 123 to 456 feet/day, with an arithmetic mean of 255 feet/day. Based on aquifer pump test data, the storage coefficient of the West Nishnabotna aquifer ranged from 0. 012 at Natural Milk Products (Kirkman Farms) near Kirkman to 0. 0001 in the Regional Water wellfield north of Avoca. Recharge to most of the West Nishnabotna aquifer ranged from 3. 2 to 5. 1 inches per year. In addition to the aquifer pump tests, a network of approximately 20 observation wells were used to evaluate groundwater levels. Included in these observation wells were ten wells in which time series data were collected. Hydrologic information was used to construct a numerical groundwater flow model of the West Nishnabotna aquifer, and consisted of three hydrogeologic layers. The model was created using Visual MODFLOW version 2009. 1. Hydrologic processes examined in the model include net recharge, hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, flow-through boundaries, no flow boundaries, well discharge, stream boundaries, and river boundaries. The modeling approach involved the following components: 1. Calibration of a steady-state model assuming no groundwater withdrawal using water level data from historic records. 2. Calibration of a transient model using monthly operating reports and water-use data from 2004 through 2010. Simulated water levels were compared to observed time-series water level measurements. 3. The calibrated models were used to estimate <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from the West Nishnabotna River into the alluvial aquifer. The potential impact to the river during droughts and low flow conditions was also evaluated. The results of this assessment suggest a strong interaction between the West Nishnabotna River and the alluvial aquifer adjacent to the river. This interaction provides security for the water users in the West Nishnabotna aquifer even during droughts and dry periods. The rate and amount of withdrawal the West Nishnabotna aquifer can sustain is limited. Depending on the future pumping rates and assuming an average <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> of at least 50 percent, the future availability of water could become an issue. Limits on future groundwater pumping are most critical in the Manning area in Carroll County, where current withdrawals from the West Nishnabotna aquifer average over 1. 2 million gallons per day (mgd), and <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> averages 67 percent. No historical or current streamgage readings are available immediately downstream of Manning and the West Central Iowa Rural Water Association. Therefore, low streamflow values in this area are unknown. This area is near the headwaters of the West Nishnabotna River, and very few tributaries contribute to the overall flow. A streamflow reading of 4 cubic feet per second (cfs) was measured at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) gage near Harlan in 1982, but the gage was decommissioned the following year. Streamflow values in the West Nishnabotna River south of Manning were likely much less than they were at Harlan that year. The relatively high water usage in the Manning area, the high percentage of <b>induced</b> <b>recharge,</b> and the potential for low streamflow values make this region extremely vulnerable to a severe drought. A contingency plan should be made by the City of Manning, Ag Processing, and West Central Iowa Rural Water Association that addresses a moderate to severe drought. [URL]...|$|E

In {{the context of this}} study, we model the production function of vertically integrated agricultural firms in terms of an input-oriented distance function with multiple inputs. Duality theory is employed in order to extract information regarding the in situ shadow price of groundwater. This shadow price is of vital importance to the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and EU groundwater Directive, because it allows per farm estimation of the value of groundwater. It also allows the calculation of the level of cost recovery when resource’s environmental and resource costs are also considered. In this context, groundwater dependent ecosystems are of great relevance. In our case study, flow both from groundwater and from the Vosvozis river discharges into Ismarida Lake, an extremely important ecosystem protected by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Furthermore, in the coastal part of the study area a system of coastal lagoons is formed, where surface, groundwater and seawater interact. All the area of Ismarida lake and the coastal lagoons forms an extremely important ecosystem. Groundwater level decline <b>induces</b> <b>recharge</b> from Vosvozis River and Ismarida lake, diminishing thus an important source {{for the life of the}} wetland ecosystem. Another threat due to groundwater level decline is the intrusion of seawater in the wetland area, causing thus a serious alteration in the initial character of this protected ecosystem. This study, apart from the estimation of the level of resource’s cost recovery, will offer the opportunity to compare individual farmer’s valuation of the marginal unit of groundwater in the aquifer with the socially optimal shadow price of in situ ground-water reported in the relevant literature. Conclusions will aim to provide policy recommendations for a water pricing that provides adequate incentive for users to use groundwater resource efficiently considering groundwater dependent ecosystems. ...|$|R

The suggested method of recharge is through natural infiltration {{through a series of}} wetlands in the back dune area. The proposed site was the Klipfontein Vlei which is located just north of the Bushmans River Mouth. Artificial recharge is defined as augmenting the natural movement of surface water into underground formations by some method of construction, the spreading of water, or by artificially changing natural conditions. A variety of methods have been developed, including water spreading, recharging through pits and wells, and pumping to <b>induce</b> <b>recharge</b> from surface water bodies. The choice of a specific method is controlled by local topography, geology and soil conditions, and the quantity of water to be recharged and ultimate water usage. In special circumstances, land value, water quality, and climate play an important role. Artificial recharge is not a foreign concept to South Africa and this project is to test its feasibility in a back dune wetland area. Augering done in the study area revealed the dominance of sandy loam in the upper layers of the pans, loamy sand in the middle levels and the presence of some sand lenses in the lower reaches. Particle size analysis done by sieving and hydrometer test, showed a dominant 3 f fraction. There was variation in modes in pan 1 from unimodal to bimodal to trimodal. Pan 2 showed no variation as all samples were unimodal and moderately well sorted. Infiltration tests were done by a double ring infiltrometer. These results showed that the infiltration rates of the pans became stable after 15 to 20 minutes, thus indicating that the soil had reached its saturation point. The resistivity surveys revealed a stepped water table. The inclination of the water is controlled by the predominately argillaceous horizons of the Bokkeveld Group.

40|$|Groundwater {{resources}} {{are an important}} supplier of fresh water to East Africa’s communities. Resource degradation, resulting from climate variability and population growth, places many livelihoods at risk of water shortages. Monitoring of regional groundwater behaviors and associated climate and anthropogenic controls remains a limited practice over the region, a hindrance to effective resource management. In this thesis, I apply remote sensing and land surface modeling approaches to increase the state of knowledge of groundwater behaviors and resource monitoring over East Africa. In Chapter 1, a methodology is developed aimed at improving the estimation of groundwater storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites over East Africa (EA), a region characterized by significant surface water variability. Results document strong correlation between GRACE groundwater estimates and in-situ groundwater observations (Spearman’s ρ = 0. 6), after systematic data processing that limits the effect of spatial leakage due to surface water bodies. Additional analysis, comparing groundwater storage behaviors with satellite precipitation, permits a regional view of groundwater characteristics as well as regional recharge behaviors, which can enhance effective resource management. In Chapter 2, a multi-objective calibration approach (using GRACE total water storage anomalies and streamflow) is applied to improve land surface model parameterization and simulation of baseflow and groundwater depth within the Community Land Model (CLM)). Model simulation of groundwater depth and baseflow is shown to significantly improve, formulating a basis for further hydrologic experiments, including anthropogenic impacts. In Chapter 3, I use the calibrated model to examine the hydrologic impacts of groundwater abstraction. Specifically, the CLM groundwater generation scheme is modified to include ‘human’ abstraction fluxes. Results show a decline in baseflow and groundwater depth with increased groundwater abstraction, while evaporation, especially during dry periods, increases. The results suggest that a deeper groundwater table reduces capillary influences, limiting the potential to affect soil moisture and Hortonian runoff, while causing <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from soil layers.

A., to investigate the natural attenuation of pharmaceutical residues and several other environmentally relevant contaminants systematically under natural conditions. Preliminary results of the studies in Germany and the United States revealed that several polar organic compounds, especially several pharmaceutically active compounds (PHACs), are relevant to drinking-water production at bank-filtration sites...|$|E
40|$|The Iowa Geological Survey {{completed}} a hydrogeologic {{evaluation of the}} water resources in the Ocheyedan River aquifer in Osceola, O’Brien, Clay and Dickinson counties in Iowa. The work was funded under the Water Plan Program of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the aquifer for future water supply development. Future work will include a calibrated groundwater flow model of the Osceola County Rural Water District (OCRWD) northern wellfield, which will be used to predict future well interference, available drawdown, optimal maximum pumping rates, and quantifying induced (river) recharge. Based on the groundwater elevation data, surface water flows toward OCRWD and Iowa Lakes Regional Water (ILRW) wellfields. Without this <b>induced</b> <b>recharge,</b> high capacity production wells and irrigation wells would not be able to sustain their pumping rates during prolonged droughts. Groundwater recharge sources are precipitation, <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from surface water, and seepage from glacial drift and terraces along the valley wall. A groundwater study conducted in 2011 calibrated an average annual groundwater recharge of approximately 8 inches within the alluvium near the ILRW wellfield in Clay County (Gannon, 2011). At an average groundwater recharge rate of 8 inches per year, approximately 13 billion gallons per year (bgy) of precipitation would recharge the aquifer. If we classify a severe drought as half the annual precipitation (Gannon, 2006), and we assume this corresponds to an estimated recharge of 4 inches per year (half the average recharge), approximately 6. 5 bgy of precipitation recharge enters the aquifer during a severe drought. Much of this recharge is removed from the aquifer through river baseflow and evapotranspiration. The actual rate of groundwater available for use would need to be quantified using hydrographs, analytical methods, and numerical modeling. Total current water usage for the study area, not including private wells, is estimated at 3. 1 billion gallons per year (8. 6 million gallons per day), with a peak usage of 16. 33 million gallons per day. Well interference likely occurs between the irrigation wells and the OCRWD and ILRW wells during peak summer-time usage. The application of a calibrated groundwater flow model will help evaluate the magnitude and significance of this well interference. The distribution of potential well yield was estimated by converting the transmissivity value to specific capacity, and multiplying this by one-half the saturated sand and gravel thickness. Potential well yields greater than 400 gallons per minute (gpm) are found near Spencer, ILRW, and OCRWD. There appears to be areas between the City of Everly and south of OCRWD, and near the upper Little Sioux River that have potential well yields less than 100 gpm. [URL]...|$|E
30|$|Based on the hydrogeological {{investigations}} in Seropan {{it is possible}} to distinguish three major types of flow which are related to a certain way of recharge. Throughout the whole year Seropan River is clearly dominated by the recharge from slow matrix flow indicating the existence of a large active storage component. The indicated large volume of this component is highly important for water management in Gunung Kidul, because it secures the perennial water flow of Seropan River and probably also of other underground rivers as indicated by the regional characterization. The relatively long residence time of matrix flow improves the retention of contaminants and, thus, the water quality at least during dry season when base flow is the sole flow component. During the rainy season strong rain events <b>induce</b> point <b>recharge</b> from surface water through fast conduit flow. In the case of Seropan River, concentrated infiltration occurs in close distance probably from more than one preferential infiltration site. As a consequence, the degree of mixing between surface water and base flow is very low. Considerable retention of particles or contaminants is, thus, not expectable leading to a poor water quality at least for some time during heavy rainfall events. This is of particular concern because water is currently pumped directly from the sump that is dammed by the artificial weir. Piston flow, as special case of matrix flow, is indicated to be the third important flow component and is preferentially induced by strong rainfall events.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the 1960 ’s {{the coastal}} aquifer {{overlying}} the irrigated plain of Korba El Mida (East coast of Cap-Bon) {{has been under}} intensive exploitation leading to groundwater degradation quality by seawater intrusion and irrigation return flow. Also, the main coastal sabkhas (wetlands) {{are no longer the}} natural outlets of the aquifer, due to a reversal of the hydraulic gradient jointly with groundwater depletion. Since 1962 geophysical surveys, use of environmental isotopes and tracers, and groundwater monitoring campaigns for sampling and level measurements of existing piezometers and surrounding wells, have been carried out in order to assess origins of salinity, extent and evolution along time. Values of Electric Conductivity may range between 0. 3 and 10. 6 dS/m in the surroundings of Korba and El Mida; most piezometers and some wells had essentially sodium-chloride facies but some wells present a calcium-sulfate facies. High nitrate concentrations (up to 300 mg/L), potassium and sulphate increase due to mineral fertilizers and manure application are observed in some areas of the aquifer, fact supported by the Cl-NO 3 diagrams. The high heterogeneity of the salinity distribution, due to geological and hydrodynamic conditions, generates complex groundwater mixing of different origins: seawater intrusion, irrigation return flow, natural recharge besides the existing <b>induced</b> aquifer <b>recharge</b> in the area. The spatial variability of concentrations in the Korba-El Mida aquifer reveals the complexity of the groundwater contamination by salinization and anthropogenic activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} eruption in 1996 of andesite from Karymsky volcano and of basalt {{from the}} Academy Nauk vent 6 km away appears {{to provide a}} case of mafic recharge of an andesite reservoir for which the time of recharge is exactly known and direct samples of the recharging magma are available.

Currently {{most of the}} {{municipal}} water supplies in the Piedmont are from surface water, although there is increasing interest in developing groundwater sources. The igneous and metamorphic rocks contain little primary porosity and very low primary permeability; flow occurs in fractures. High yield wells require fracture zones such as faults or lithologic contacts. While flow in these zones may be rapid, the volume of water stored in the fractures is limited. Recharge to the fracture zone is principally from the saprolite. High pumping rates can only be sustained by <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from surface water bodies or thick saturated saprolite.

40|$|Groundwater pumping causes {{depletion}} of groundwater storage. The rate of depletion incurred by any new well is gradually decreasing and eventually becomes zero {{in the long}} run, after <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> and reduction of natural discharge of groundwater combined (capture) have become large enough to balance the pumping rate completely. If aquifer-wide aggregated pumping rates are comparatively large, then such a new dynamic equilibrium may not be reached and groundwater storage may become exhausted. Decisions to pump groundwater are motivated by people’s need for domestic water and by expected benefits of using water {{for a variety of}} activities. But how much finally is abstracted from an aquifer (or is considered to be an optimal aggregate abstraction rate) depends {{on a wide range of}} other factors as well. Among these, the constraint imposed by the groundwater balance (preventing aquifer exhaustion) has received ample attention in the professional literature. However, other constraints or considerations related to changes in groundwater level due to pumping are observed as well and in many cases they even may dominate the decisions on pumping. This paper reviews such constraints or considerations, examines how they are or may be incorporated in the decision-making process, and evaluates to what extent the resulting pumping rates and patterns create conditions that comply with principles of sustainability. groundwater development; groundwater storage depletion; socio-economic impacts; environmental impacts; groundwater resources management; sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The {{water supply}} system Káraný (WSSK), which is using the water from Quaternary fluvial aquifer and <b>induced</b> <b>recharge</b> from Jizera River, is {{affected}} by increase of nitrate content in recent years. No tension lysimeters were emplaced into the soil at locality north of Sojovice and sampled roughly with monthly frequency. Samples were analyzed on isotopic content (2 H and 18 O of H 2 O) and chemistry. Volume of water collected in lysimeters was recalculated to mm/year. Infiltration tests demonstrated that infiltration rate at surface of agricultural land is low and therefore Horton surface flow is generated after heavy rains and during watering periods. Horton surface flow is disappearing into open desiccation cracks. This concentrated recharge may via preferential pathways transport nitrates via unsaturated zone. Using selected environmental tracers (Ca 2 + a SO 4 2 -) the portion of water from Jizera River in individual wells of WSSK was calculated. For Sojovice part of WSSK the water from Jizera River accounts for 71 - 80 % of pumped groundwater and for Skorkov part of WSSK this is only 38 - 41 %. The remaining part of water is either water from infiltration to Quaternary fluvial aquifer and/or water from Cretaceous Jizera Formation Aquifer.

40|$|Conjunctive use {{of surface}} and {{groundwater}} {{becomes one of}} important strategies of water supply management {{that should be considered}} to optimize the water resources development, management and conservation within a basin, especially in arid regions such as the southwestern United States. An underground storage of recoverable water system is certainly one of the tools to be used for that purpose. Several hydrologic aspects need to be carefully studied before implementing a program of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater: underground storage availability; production capacity of the aquifer in term of potential discharge; natural recharge of the aquifer; <b>induced</b> natural <b>recharge</b> of the aquifer; and potential for artificial recharge of the aquifer. In this paper, the authors presented the underground storage of recoverable water system as a framework that consists of subsystems: source of water, recharge venue or facilities, storage space, and recovery facilities depending on intended uses of water. All subsystems interact with each other and depend on each other. The sources of water include flood water and runoff. Excess surface water can be recharged by surface spreading, vadose zone wells, deep recharge wells or aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells. Storage capacities vary with hydrological properties of the geological formation and boundary conditions of the aquifer. Stored water can be recovered by production wells, an ASR well itself or simply by increasing baseflow of the neighboring streams. The stored water can be used for seasonal or long-term municipal and industrial supplies, supplemental agricultural applications or maintaining required environmental flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} canalization of the Doab, {{which was}} necessary {{to the development of}} irrigation agriculture <b>induced</b> added <b>recharge</b> to the ground-water system from the canal leakage. Disruption of the hydrologic balance of the regional flow system resulted in water-logging and soil salinization on a scale that threatens the entire economy of the region. The report establishes the cause-effect relationships involved and defines the functioning of the hydrologic system. Analog-simulation techniques for the analyses of ground-water systems in the Doab is developed. Analyses are made for (a) steady-state conditions that prevailed prior to the canal-irrigation period, and (b) non-steady state conditions for the canal-irrigation period from the year 1900 to 1960. The rise in ground-water levels, rate of infiltration from the main canals and their distributaries, net recharge rate to ground-water reservoir, and the effect of evapotranspiration on the rising groundwater levels are determined. Recharge to ground-water from the rivers Jhelum and Chenab and discharge through evapotranspiration are found to be the main sources for maintaining hydraulic dynamic equilibrium during the pre-irrigation period. Further analysis indicates that, during the canal-irrigation period, the infiltration from the main canals and their distributaries is the cause of rise in ground-water levels. The net infiltration rate is of the order of 1767 million gallons per day and is a function of canal size. Out of this, 867 million gallons per day is the loss due to evapotranspiration, showing its importance in the ground-water system of the area. Information resulting from this study provides a guide for more detailed study of the problem and establishes significant guidelines for future ground-water development in the Doab...|$|R
40|$|The aquifer test, {{involving}} a production well and several observation wells near a stream, {{is one of}} the effects of induced streambed infiltration on water levels in aquifers. In presently available analytical treatments of flow problems associated with <b>induced</b> infiltration, <b>recharge</b> by the influent seepage of surface water is commonly simulated by use of a hypothetical image well. The assumption is made that water levels in the aquifer will behave the same whether recharge occurs over an area or through an image well. Electric analog computers, in which the streambed is simulated as an area of recharge in accordance with natural conditions instead of as a recharging image well, were used to appraise the accuracy of estimated effects of induced infiltration on water levels based on the image well theory. Electric analog computers for two aquifer test sites for which field data are available were constructed. The selected aquifer tests involve the two extreme aquifer-stream situations, i. e. the case where the cone of depression spreads beneath and beyond the entire streambed and the case where the cone of depression spreads only part way beneath the streambed. The analog computers consist of analog models and excitation-response apparatus. The analog models are regular arrays of resistors and capacitors and are scaled-down versions of aquifer-stream situations. The excitation-response apparatus consists of a power supply, waveform generator, pulse generator and an oscilloscope. It is concluded that, during induced infiltration aquifer tests, the image-well theory closely describes drawdowns on the land sides of streams {{with a high degree of}} accuracy whether the cone of depression spreads beneath and beyond or only part way beneath the streambed. Drawdowns beneath or beyond the streambed and the streambed areas of infiltration based on the image-well theory are not those which are observed in the field. However, the streambed infiltration rates per foot of head loss based on hypothetical drawdowns beneath streambeds and streambed areas of infiltration computed with the image-well theory seem to be empirically correct.
