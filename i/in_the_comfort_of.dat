He also accumulated an extensive library, both in his St Petersburg palace and in his rural estate, Borjomi, where he liked to work undisturbed. His great wealth enabled him to have a number of research assistants, a luxury seldom available to most historians. His most valuable helper with his historical work was Constantine Brummer, his aide-de-camp since the earliest years of his military career who was his loyal friend until the end.|$|E
500|$|... "City of Angels" [...] is a synthrock {{song with}} {{influences}} and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and [...] "gently burbling" [...] synthesizers. It follows {{with the sounds}} of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, [...] "Lost in the City of Angels / Down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> strangers / I found myself in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming [...] "I am home". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited [...] "City of Angels" [...] as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a [...] "pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop".|$|E

2500|$|Agoraphobia is a {{condition}} where sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control. Triggers for this anxiety may include wide-open spaces, crowds (social anxiety), or traveling (even short distances). Agoraphobia is often, but not always, compounded by a fear of social embarrassment, as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public. Most {{of the time they}} avoid these areas and stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> their safe haven. This is also sometimes called [...] "social agoraphobia", which may be a subtype of social anxiety disorder.|$|E

The following year she starred opposite Kenneth Branagh and Colin Firth in A Month in the Country, directed by Pat O'Connor.

It was a wonder, indeed, that birds should draw near such scarecrow travellers. More like the Nōōmad of Jack-Alls they sat than honest Mulgars; some toasting the last paring of their beloved cheese to eat with their Nanoes, some with stones pounding Ummuz, some at their scratching and combing, {{and one or two}} worn out, bonily sprawling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> the sunbeams streaming upon them now from far across Arakkaboa.|$|E

When this duty was discharged, the old man and his unknown guest entered the house together; the frank and unpretending hospitality of a country like that they were in, rendering suspicion or hesitation qualities that were unknown to the reception of a man of white blood; more especially if he spoke the language of the island, which was then first sending out its swarms, to subdue and possess so large a portion of a continent that nearly divides the earth in moieties.|$|E

6000|$|Fourth. There {{flows from}} this fear of God great reverence of his majesty, in {{and under the}} use and {{enjoyment}} of God's holy ordinances. His ordinances are his courts and palaces, his walks and places, where he giveth his presence to those that wait upon him in them, in the fear of his name. And this {{is the meaning of}} that of the apostle: [...] "Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Ghost, were multiplied" [...] (Acts 9:31). [...] "And walking"--that word intendeth their use of the ordinances of God. They walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. This, in Old Testament language, is called, treading God's courts, and walking in his paths. This, saith the text, they did here, in the fear of God. That is, in a great reverence of that God whose ordinances they were. [...] "Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am the Lord" [...] (Lev 19:30, 26:2).|$|E

The first snow brought the suggestion of sleighing; but that cold weather about Christmas dispersed these gay thoughts, and restored my friend to virtue. Word came from the stable that Frank's legs were swelling from standing so long without going out, and my friend resolved to part with an animal for which he had no use. I do not praise him for this; it was no more than his duty; but I record his action in order to account for {{the fact that he is}} again without a horse, and now, with the opening of the fine weather, is beginning once more to think of buying one.|$|E

He spoke of an interesting man whom he had met at the mountain resort where he was staying; a Spanish-American, attached to one of the Legations at Washington, who had a scheme for Americanizing popular education in his own country. [...] "He has made a regular set at me," [...] Halleck wrote, [...] "and if I had not fooled away so much time already on law and on leather, I should like to fool away a little more on such a cause as this."

Some of them they shall kill and crucify, leaving a remnant alive in the world, namely, that they might breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. As he saith by the prophet Isaiah, [...] "He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit" [...] (Isa 27:6). And this after their deliverance from persecution: According as he saith again, [...] "The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah, shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant" [...] that is yet to replenish the earth with converts (37:32).

60|$|I went {{straight}} to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before going downstairs, I looked into several others. As she was nowhere about she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> that theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. I found her where I had found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with blank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, for {{it was the very}} first time I had allowed the little girl out of my sight without some special provision. Of course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for her without an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but when, ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall, it was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had altogether failed to trace her. For a minute there, apart from observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first given her.|$|E

In spite of its sadness, it was a beautiful week, full of poignant, unforgettable hours, when she and Walter had long walks and talks and silences together. He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding. It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him--the knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable, and gave her power to smile--and even to laugh a little. When Walter had gone she might indulge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> tears, but not while he was here.
