40|$|A {{rigorous}} {{mathematical model}} for direct propane fuel cells (DPFCs) was developed. Compared to previous models, it provides better {{values for the}} current density and the propane concentration {{at the exit from}} the anode. This is the first DPFC model to correctly account for proton transport based on the combination of the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> and the electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> The force per unit charge from the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> (concentration gradient) that pushes protons from the anode to the cathode is greater than that from the electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> that pushes them in the opposite direction. By including the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient,</b> we learn that the proton concentration gradient is really much different than that predicted using the previous models that neglected the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> Also inclusion of the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> made this model the first one having an overpotential gradient (calculated from the electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient)</b> with the correct slope. That is important because the overpotential is exponentially related to the reaction rate (current density). The model described here provides a relationship between the conditions inside the fuel cell (proton concentration, overpotential) and its performance as measured externally by current density and propane concentration...|$|R

This current is generated by global thunderstorm activity and is modulated by galactic cosmic rays and atmospheric aerosol. In fair weather conditions, this current cause a vertical atmospheric electric field, commonly measured as a <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> For circumstances other than fair weather conditions, the <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> varies, from small steady enhancements in fog to large fluctuations in thunderstorms.

40|$|It {{was found}} by early workers in {{atmospheric}} electricity that, during conditions of steady rain, when the <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> at the ground was negative the <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> {{at the top of}} a high mast was occasionally positive. This indicated the presence of negative space charge in the layer between the two measurements. To farther investigate this effect simultaneous recordings were taken of the <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> and the precipitation current at the top and bottom of the mast, 21 metres high, situated in a field adjacent to Durham Observatory. Large differences in the values of the precipitation currents at the two levels were found. Due to the concentration of the lines of force on the earthed mast, and so on the upper shielded collector, laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the charging effects caused when drops splash in a region of high <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> It was found that the differences between the currents could be accounted for by the splashing of drops on the edges of the upper collector. As there is no obvious way of correcting for this effect it would appear that the shielded rain collector of the design used in the present work is unsuitable for measuring the precipitation current in regions of high <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> and even in other regions, the recorded currents must be considered with caution. Also drops were found to release negative charge to the air in regions of aero <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> The actual reversal of sign of <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> between the top and bottom of the mast was only observed tor a number of very short periods, the longest being 4 ½ minutes, during low <b>potential</b> <b>gradients.</b> But on the majority of recordings the <b>potential</b> <b>gradients</b> did indicate the presence of excess of negative space charge in the layer below the top of the meat, although on occasions the space charge was positive. The space charge was of the same sign, and varied in the same sense, as the <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> recorded at the ground. Considering these points an attempt is made to explain the reversal effect in terms of layers of space charge between the cloud and the ground. The layer being due to the charge on the rain, the charge released when drops splash, and a separation or electrode effect due to the <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> of the cloud...|$|R

Teleosts had a range of about 500 µV potential around the gills, while elasmobrachs and crustaceans were 10 times weaker; but if a crustacean was wounded, its <b>DC</b> <b>potential</b> increased to 1 µV. A study by Peters and Bretschneider measured the bioelectric potential across catfish and found the strongest negative potential around the head and gills of the fish, measured 1 mm from the skin.

40|$|Abstract Background At {{least some}} {{clinical}} data suggests that, {{regardless of which}} major coronary artery is narrowed, the early ST segment body surface pattern {{is characterized by a}} minimum near precordial lead V 5 and a broad area of left precordial negative potentials. Some clinical data also suggests that late ST segment potentials can localize an ischemic heart region. Objective A computer model of a heart/torso system was implemented to study the relationship between transmembrane potentials throughout the heart and clinically observed body surface potential patterns during the early and late ST segments in ischemic patients. Methods Transmembrane potentials were selected to produce body surface potentials that matched the clinical data. Results The early ST segment pattern was matched by assigning: (i) an epicardial transmembrane <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> that is consistent with the normal activation/repolarization sequence, according to which the left lateral epicardium activates relatively late; (ii) an endocardial transmembrane potential distribution with the lowest transmembrane potentials in the ischemic region; and (iii) overall lower transmembrane potentials to the endocardium compared to the epicardium. Late ST segment potentials, which localized the area of the ischemic region, were generated by reducing the epicardial transmembrane <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> and increasing the endocardial transmembrane <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> Conclusion The non-localizing nature of early ST segment depression could be due to global epicardial and endocardial transmembrane <b>potential</b> <b>gradients</b> related to the activation/repolarization sequence, whereas the possibly localizing nature of late ST segment depression could be due to the relative removal of the epicardial gradient, and an increase of the transmembrane <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> across the endocardium. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} ion {{transport}} {{in the vicinity}} of a vibrating probe is developed. It is shown that the convection loops produced by the probe will not affect the electrical current density, assuming that the action of the probe does not affect the sources of the current in the biological system. However, the convection loops will significantly alter the ion concentration gradients in the unstirred layer near a tissue or cell surface. The concentration gradients within each convection loop will be reduced, while the concentration gradients between the loops and outside of the loops will be increased relative to the gradients existing without the probe. As a consequence, the electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradients</b> can be changed relative to the <b>potential</b> <b>gradients</b> existing {{in the absence of the}} convection caused by the probe. If the mobility of the ion species carrying the electrical current is greater than the average ion mobility in the medium, then a decrease in ion concentration gradient will be accompanied by an increase in electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient,</b> while an increase in concentration gradient will be accompanied by a decrease or even a reversal of electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient.</b> Thus, the electrical <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> measured by the probe will depend on the concentration gradient {{in the vicinity of}} the probe, which will depend in turn on the spatial relation of the convection loops to the probe. An example of the effect of the convection loops on ion concentration and electrical potential is obtained from the theory via a numerical computer calculation. Experimental tests of this theory are discussed...|$|R

A 10 -msec monophasic (eight dogs) or 5 / 5 -msec biphasic (seven dogs) truncated exponential shock 30 % above the defibrillation threshold voltage was given via electrodes on the left ventricular apex and right atrium to create the strong <b>potential</b> <b>gradient</b> field.
