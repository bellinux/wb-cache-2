40|$|International audienceThe {{electrochemical}} reaction {{mechanisms of}} FeP x (x = 1, 2, 4) as electrode materials in Li batteries {{were analyzed by}} 57 Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy, magnetic and NMR measurements. Depending on their stoichiometry, <b>iron</b> <b>phosphides</b> react with lithium along different pathways. FeP and FeP 2 are fully or partially converted to a composite electrode of Li 3 P and Fe. For both, the same intermediate phases, namely FeP and Li x FeP, were identified in cycling and FeP is partially regenerated on charge. Surprisingly, FeP 4 reacts with Li through an insertion type process previously identified for earlier transition metal phosphides (Ti, V, and Mn), and no conversion reaction to Li 3 P/Fe is observed.

40|$|Fe 3 P (synthetic schreibersite) is a <b>phosphide</b> {{occurring}} in <b>iron</b> alloys. Phosphorousis often considered an undesired impurity causing brittleness.

In terrestrial rock, we do not find Fe 3 P, although (Fe;Ni) 3 P (natural schreibersite) is found in nearly all iron-containing meteorites. In this project, we examine the unit cell parameters of Fe 3 P as function of pressure and derive the respective axial and bulk compressibilities. Both Vinet and Birch-Murnaghan formulations were used to relate pressure and unit cell volume, and a comparison of each prediction was made.

40|$|A {{series of}} hyperbranched poly(ferrocenylene) s {{containing}} elements (E) of groups 14 [E=Si (hb- 1), Ge (hb- 2) ] and 15 [E=P (hb- 3), Sb (hb- 4) ] are prepared in good isolation yields (up to 82 wt%) by the salt-eliminative polycoupling of dilithioferrocene with tri-(RECl 3) or tetrachlorides {{of the elements}} (ECl 4). While the polymers with no or small R groups are insoluble or partially soluble, those with long alkyl chains (R=CnH 2 n+ 1 with n ≥ 8) are completely soluble and film forming. The polymers exhibit solution properties characteristic of hyperbranched macromolecules: e. g. hb- 1 (18) shows a low intrinsic viscosity ([η]= 0. 02 dL/g) despite its high absolute molecular weight (Mw= 5 × 105). Spectroscopic analyses reveal that the polymers possess rigid skeleton structures with extended conjugations, with their absorption spectra tailing into the infrared region (> 700 nm). The polymers show good thermal stability with Td up to ~ 400 °C and can be graphitized into iron-containing ceramics when pyrolyzed at high temperatures, with char yields up to ~ 60 wt%. While calcinations of the Si-containing polymers (hb- 1) at 1000 °C under nitrogen give ceramics containing mostly α-Fe nanoparticles, those of Ge-(hb- 2) and Sb-containing polymers (hb- 4) are completely transformed into their iron-alloys.

40|$|International audienceUnusual {{silicate}} {{glasses were}} found in northern Chile {{in one of the}} driest place on earth, the Atacama Desert. The scoria-type melted rocks are littered on the ground at several localities distributed along a longitudinal band of about 50 km. The silicate glasses have a stable natural remanent magnetization carried by fine-grained magnetite and acquired during cooling. At one locality, fine-grained overbank sediments were heated to form a 10 to 20 cm-thick layer of brick-type samples. Magnetic experiments on oriented samples demonstrate that the baked clays record a thermoremanent magnetization acquired in situ above 600 °C down to more than 10 cm depth and cooled under a normal polarity geomagnetic field with a paleointensity of 40 µT. In some samples of the silicate glass, large grains of iron sulphides (troilite) are found in the glass matrix with numerous droplets of native iron, iron sulphides and <b>iron</b> <b>phosphides</b> indicating high temperature and strong redox conditions during melting. The paleomagnetic record of the baked clays and the unusual mineralogy of the silicate glasses indicate a formation mainly by in situ high temperature radiation. Paleomagnetic experiments and chemical analyses indicate that the silicate glasses are not fulgurite type rocks due to lightning events, nor volcanic glasses or even metallurgical slags related to mining activity. The existence of a well-developped baked clay layer indicates that the silicate glasses are not impact-related ejectas. The field, paleomagnetic and mineralogical observations support evidence for a thermal event likely related to a major airburst. The youngest calibrated 14 C age on a charcoal sample closely associated with the glass indicates that the thermal event occurred around 12 to 13 ka BP. The good conservation of the surface effects of this thermal event in the Atacama Desert could provide a good opportunity to further estimate the threats posed by large asteroid airbursts...|$|R
