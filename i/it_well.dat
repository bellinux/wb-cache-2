5|$|Carter gave 90 {{pages of}} the {{screenplay}} to Fox who received <b>it</b> <b>well.</b> While not officially greenlighted, he got a budget from Fox and began to make plans as to when and {{where it would be}} filmed. Carter then enlisted Daniel Sackheim as a producer on the film. Sackheim had previously produced the pilot episode of The X-Files and directed several episodes in the first two seasons. The X-Files marked his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter's choice for director was Rob Bowman, who had been the series' executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing <b>it</b> <b>well</b> in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now {{at its lowest}} point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever {{and others on the}} ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew <b>it</b> <b>well,</b> recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E
5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told <b>it</b> <b>well</b> but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E
5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, {{and if he}} {{had been}} secretly Catholic, he had hidden <b>it</b> <b>well.</b> It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E

5|$|The book {{became a}} bestseller and was well {{received}} by {{graduates of the}} est training.

Responses to the writing were mixed; while some reviewers found <b>it</b> <b>well</b> written and entertaining, others felt the tone was too slick, promotional, or hagiographic.|$|E

5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making <b>it</b> <b>well</b> suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served <b>it</b> <b>well</b> in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Lamont's {{childhood}} was divided between Glasgow and her mother's family home on Tiree, {{where she and}} her brother David spent their summer holidays. She attended Woodside Secondary School, having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education. Like her parents, she was a Gaelic speaker, but she did not believe she spoke <b>it</b> <b>well</b> enough, and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German. It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics, once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically-themed short story. The tale, whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen, won Lamont third prize. She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA. Joining the Labour Party in 1975, she was active in the Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran, and was also involved with the women's movement. She trained as a teacher for a year at Jordanhill College, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy, Isle of Bute, as a teacher in 1979. She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at Castlemilk High School, also in Glasgow, from 1990 to 1999. Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school truancy.|$|E

5|$|St Briavels Castle was {{constructed}} sometime between 1075 and 1129 by royal mandate, although the precise date is uncertain. Walter de Gloucester, the Sheriff of Gloucester {{and his son}} Miles de Gloucester made St Briavels Castle the administrative centre of the Forest of Dean. The location of the castle placed <b>it</b> <b>well</b> behind the English border, in an area with little Welsh presence before the invasion, and it therefore {{appears to have been}} established for the purposes of royal governance, rather than to protect the Welsh Marches to its west. Equivalents elsewhere in the south-west include Restormel Castle and Lydford Castle in Devon and Cornwall, both regional royal administrative centres. One alternative view, however, sees St Briavels as intended to protect the Severn estuary to the south, along with the royal castles of Bristol and Gloucester. This early castle was of motte and bailey design, the keep probably of wood.|$|E
5|$|The {{finished}} castle {{was initially}} equipped with 28 brass and iron artillery guns and a garrison of 28 men, commanded by a captain. It {{may have seen}} service in 1545 when a French fleet attacked the coast, but its operational value was short lived. The Camber and the surrounding harbours began to silt up, becoming unusable by shipping, and the coastline receded away from the fort, eventually placing <b>it</b> <b>well</b> in-land. Furthermore, the fort had been superseded by newer European military designs even before it had been completed, and peace with France later in the century removed much of the requirement for the fort. The castle still remained operational up until 1637, when it was closed by King Charles I. With the outbreak of civil war in 1642, much of the fortification was dismantled by Parliamentary forces to prevent it {{being used by the}} Royalists.|$|E
