25|$|The {{octagonal}} {{brick and}} terracotta chimney {{of the engine}} house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> house itself. It replaced the original pumping house which is now The Pump House public house. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and originally contained two steam engine powered pumps. These were replaced in 1907 by the current electrically powered machines from Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley (the currently installed electric motors were manufactured by JH Holmes & Co, Hebburn-upon-Tyne and so date at least from 1928). It powered the docks hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks.|$|E

They allow to take into consideration the most significant from the viewpoint of ensuring high technical-economic indicators of hydraulic efficiency criteria – minimum mass (weight), their volume and losses of power. On the basis of these mathematical models the problem of multicriterial constrained optimization of the constructive sizes of turning <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines</b> are subject to complex constructive, strength and deformation limits. It allows you to de-velop the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines</b> in an optimized design which is required for the purpose of designing a comprehensive measure takes into account efficiency criteria. The multicriterial optimization problem is universal in nature, so when designing a turning <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines</b> allows for one-, two - and three-criteria optimization without making any changes in the solution algorithm. This is a significant advantage for the development of universal software for the automation of design of mobile transport-technological machines...|$|R

25|$|In 1873 {{an organ}} was bought {{for the church}} {{at a cost of}} £100. It was first used on Palm Sunday. It was {{replaced}} in 1903 with one designed by George Benson of Manchester. This organ had great and swell manuals, pedals and two arrays of stops. It was installed by Robert Jackson, the organist of St Peter's Church in Oldham. The bellows were initially powered by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> working from mains water pressure (with the exhaust water being used by the nearby Neville Mill) but an electric blower was installed in 1923. The value of the Benson organ was estimated in 1965 to be £3,000. It was left to be broken up on the closure of the Westwood church building.|$|E

500|$|In 2007 a £350 {{million project}} was {{announced}} to develop 2,000 new homes and commercial {{properties in the}} waterfront area. The proposed development included the West Pond reclaimed land {{to the west of}} the number one dock, the South Quay, East Quay and Arno Quay. A £230 million version of the plan was approved in 2011, which included a new road linking the town centre to Barry Island, a school, hotel, restaurants, supermarket and public spaces. The first of two new medical centres had been built by 2008, south of the Barry-Cardiff railway line and opposite Thompson Street and to complement this, by December 2009 a new pedestrian footbridge had been opened, spanning the railway line and linking Thompson Street with the medical centre and Morrisons, other retail outlets and new Waterfront housing. In 2010, work had started on the construction of a new medical centre and pharmacy to become known as Westquay Medical Centre and a new pedestrian ramped access was being cast. The new surgery was opened at the end of October 2010. Like the, by then, Entrepreneurial Centre, already established alongside, the building stood on the site of the former Barry Railway Company's loco works and carriage sheds and on a level above the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> house. By February 2012, work had started on clearing the site opposite the old <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> house in preparation for building a new hotel and inn and by June 2014, was open to the public as the Premier Inn and Brewers Fayre pub and carvery. [...] Further drastic change came by April 2015 when a new ASDA superstore with card-only fuelling facility was opened and this occupied most of land previously bearing the Powell Duffryn oil tank farm and former multiple railway sidings used latterly for storage of withdrawn steam locomotives held by Dai Woodham. The extant structure of the ‘listed’ <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> house opposite the Premier Inn, partly renovated prior to 2012, was involved in further internal renovation and facial improvements and car parking facilities were being prepared in August 2015. Later, its tapered square chimney was fitted with black vertical lettering on two faces. One facet shows PUMPHOUSE, and one shows TY PWMP, both being backlit during darkness, but initially, the necessary circumflex above the letter Y in the Welsh language, has not been fitted. An Espresso bar had been opened within the main building and the complementary car park, by December 2015.|$|E

While a regular gear is optimized to transmit torque to another engaged member with minimum noise and wear and with maximum efficiency, a non-circular gear's main objective might be ratio variations, axle displacement oscillations and more. Common applications include textile machines, potentiometers, CVTs (continuously variable transmissions), window shade panel drives, mechanical presses and high torque <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before {{the mine}} was {{connected}} to the National Grid in 1938, all operations which were not done by hand (or by horse) depended ultimately on water power. In many cases this was used directly, to power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines,</b> water wheels or water turbines. In other cases it was used to run an air compressor to power the rock drills, or small winding engines, and from 1890 it was used to generate electricity.|$|R

500|$|The initial plans {{allowed for}} loading coal onto vessels from eleven {{high-level}} coal tips and four cranes {{on the north}} side of the dock, from five low-level tips on the Mole and from one tip at the west end of the dock. There was space for additional tips on the Mole, the south side of the dock and the basin. Hydraulic pressure was used to operate all the machinery, supplied by engine houses of which there were three [...] [...] An engineers' report of 1901 contained the following extract: The tips have lifts of 37, 42, and 45 feet, and are each capable of lifting 20 tons. All tips are provided with two weigh-bridges, one on the full and the other on the empty roads. The machinery at the docks is worked by hydraulic power obtained at three engine-houses, which contain nine pairs of compound, horizontal, surface-condensing engines, with cylinders of 16 inches and 28 inches diameter and 24 inches stroke, indicating 250 H.P. per pair. Steam is supplied at 80 lbs. per square inch by twenty-five Lancashire boilers, 28 feet long by 7 feet diameter. The pressure-pumps are of the differential-ram principle, and maintain a pressure in the mains of 750 lbs. per square inch. The whole of the docks, coal-tips, sidings, etc., are lighted by electricity. Battery Hill pumphouse at Barry Island was demolished after 1945 but the main part of the Bendricks building (referred to as 'Sully <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> house' in R.A.COOKE'S section 44b GWR track diagrams) lived on until just after the Millennium and ironically, with the nationalisation of the former 'big four' railway groups to become British Railways (BR) in 1947, the Barry Railway initials survive on one of the gables at Barry Island railway station and the initials BR ...|$|E
