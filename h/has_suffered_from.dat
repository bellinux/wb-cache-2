5|$|Altar 10 is {{carved with}} a captive {{tied to a}} scaffold. It is in the {{northern}} enclosure of Group Q, a twin-pyramid complex and <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> erosion.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Bolt {{reveals that}} he <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> scoliosis, a {{condition}} that has curved his spine {{to the right and}} has made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 100 years {{since it was}} opened the bridge <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> {{corrosion}} and {{was in need of}} urgent repair. The rehabilitation works are co-financed by the French Development Agency (AFD) and by the Government of Senegal. The total cost of the works was estimated to be US$27 million, of which US$17 million is from AFD and US$10 million is from the government.|$|E
50|$|He had {{a severe}} {{heart attack in}} 1951. Additionally, {{in his later years}} he was alleged to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> strokes, {{resulting}} in further mental impairment. Some have speculated that he may <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> dementia in his last days.|$|R
50|$|Butts {{was found}} dead by her sister in her Washington, D.C. home on May 25, 2016. According to a {{statement}} from her family she <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> a brief illness. Bruni wrote that she <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> acute leukemia and had not felt ill until just beforehand.|$|R
50|$|Greene <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> manic {{depression}} (bipolar disorder).|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> pollution, but several {{stretches}} run through parks and reserves that sustain {{a range of}} wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote {{a memoir}} {{entitled}} West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life. The book has had tremendous critical acclaim {{and became an}} instant New York Times bestseller. During an interview on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, West revealed that as a child he {{was the victim of}} physical abuse from his father and <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> depression ever since.|$|E
5|$|Johnson offers over 40 extracurricular {{clubs and}} {{organizations}} including an Air Force Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFJROTC) unit, {{one of only}} three in the state. The school was a founding member and currently competes in the Saint Paul City Conference. The school's hockey team has had success, winning four state titles, but in the last decade <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> low participation.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established {{the foundations of}} the English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> {{negative}} {{rates of}} natural increase and {{has relied on}} immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%.|$|E
5|$|Lismore, {{like other}} Hebridean islands, <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> {{depopulation}} since the 19th century, {{in large part}} due to the Clearances. In 1798 there were 900 people living on the island and 1399 by 1841. Over the next 40 years the population more than halved to 621. By 1961 there were only 155 residents, and {{by the time of the}} 1991 census there were just 140. There are various examples of abandoned townships, such as Coille nam Bard on the east coast. In the 2001 census, the population had risen slightly to 146, over 45% of whom were over 60 years old, making it the Scottish island with the oldest population.|$|E

5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Robson <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> various {{injuries}} {{which have}} caused a prolonged absence from the WTA tour. After losing {{in the first round}} of the 2013 HP Open on 7 October 2013, she has played just 33 matches: two in 2014, 11 in 2015 and 20 in 2016, winning just eight of them. She dropped out of the world rankings in early 2015, returning at 906 in July 2015, and on 18 September 2017 is ranked at 247. She has a career-high doubles ranking of No. 82 (July 2013).|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> serious {{morale and}} {{disciplinary}} problems since its establishment. These {{problems have been}} driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E

5|$|While the National Parks Act and the 1988 {{amendment}} emphasize ecological integrity, {{in practice}} Banff <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> inconsistent {{application of the}} policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.|$|E
5|$|The Spokane {{metropolitan}} area consists of Spokane County. As of the 2013 census estimates, the Spokane {{metropolitan area}} had {{a population of}} 535,724. Directly east of Spokane County is the Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Kootenai County, Idaho, anchored {{by the city of}} Coeur d'Alene. The urban areas of the two MSAs largely follow the path of Interstate 90 between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene. The Spokane area <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> suburbanization and urban sprawl in past decades, despite Washington's use of urban growth boundaries; the city ranks low among major Northwest cities in population density and smart growth. The Spokane and Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) are now included in a single Combined Statistical Area (CSA) by the Office of Management and Budget. The Spokaneâ€“Coeur d'Alene CSA had around 698,170residents in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The altarpiece was {{commissioned}} in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, {{and his wife}} Guigone de Salins, who is buried {{in front of the}} altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in the hospice today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It <b>has</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.|$|E
