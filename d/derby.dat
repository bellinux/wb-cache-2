5|$|Destruction <b>Derby</b> is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} developed by Reflections Interactive {{and published by}} Psygnosis. Based on the sport of demolition <b>derby,</b> the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small {{to increase the number}} of wrecks. Versions of Destruction <b>Derby</b> were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, Destruction <b>Derby</b> 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found Destruction <b>Derby</b> enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It doesn't work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game save file issues. The game started the Destruction <b>Derby</b> franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, Destruction <b>Derby</b> 2.|$|E

5|$|Destruction <b>Derby</b> 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction <b>Derby.</b> Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction <b>Derby,</b> based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E

The paper presents apparatus to avoid the overlap and jam of wear debris on the basic of the result of dynamics analysis.

5|$|Destruction <b>Derby</b> is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition <b>derby.</b> The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction <b>Derby,</b> Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction <b>Derby,</b> the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
