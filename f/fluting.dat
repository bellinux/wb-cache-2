5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified <b>fluting</b> song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more <b>fluting.</b> The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is a {{loud and}} vocal species, {{and makes a}} variety of calls. Its main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long <b>fluting</b> whistle to summon their young.|$|E
5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted <b>fluting</b> {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to making a}} balalaika and a guitar whilst still at school, his dissatisfaction with the intonation of his <b>flute</b> led him to start altering {{the position of the}} tone holes of his <b>flute</b> when he was 18 years old. He invented the tuning patch, and then built his own <b>flute</b> at 20. He has been working to improve the scale of the <b>flute</b> ever since, and his continued work, in collaboration with other British flautists and makers, has helped to improve the intonation of the modern <b>flute.</b> There are many makers who have used the William Bennett scales : Altus <b>Flute,</b> Jupiter <b>Flute,</b> Jack Moore <b>Flute,</b> Almeida <b>Flute,</b> Tom Green <b>Flute,</b> Miguel Arista <b>Flute,</b> Juan Arista <b>Flute,</b> Emmanuel <b>Flute,</b> Emerson <b>Flute,</b> Yamaha (Student model) <b>Flute,</b> Jonathan Landell <b>Flute,</b> Tom Lacy <b>Flute,</b> Andrew Oxley <b>Flute,</b> Webb & Wessel <b>Flute</b> and recently Eloy <b>Flute,</b> Gemeinhart <b>Flute</b> and Burkart <b>Flute.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the demise}} of the Renaissance <b>flute</b> consorts, the use of this treble <b>flute</b> in G seems to have all but disappeared. Only in the <b>flute</b> bands of Northern Ireland and Scotland that have {{converted}} from the traditional [...] "simple system" [...] <b>flutes</b> to Boehm system silver <b>flutes,</b> do we see extensive use of the treble <b>flutes</b> in G.

25|$|Above the doorways are {{classical}} Ionic order columns that ostensibly {{hold up the}} frieze and pediment. Uncommon for Ionic order columns is {{the lack}} of <b>fluting,</b> which is usually used to draw the eye upward, increasing the grandeur of the facade. The numerous projections and recessions on the façade attribute to the planar quality of the building, while also creating interesting shading and lighting patterns on the stone and within the building.|$|E
25|$|The Corinthian Order was {{initially}} used internally, {{as at the}} Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae (c.450-425 BC). In 334 BC it appeared as an external feature on the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, and then on a huge scale at the Temple of Zeus Olympia in Athens, (174 BC - AD 132). It was popularised by the Romans, who added a number of refinements and decorative details. During the Hellenistic period, Corinthian columns were sometimes built without <b>fluting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{at around}} 1500 armour, {{including}} helmets, became more immediately influenced by fashion, especially in civilian clothing. As a result close helmets {{came in a}} huge variety of forms. The earliest close helmets resembled contemporary armets. In Italy, England and France in the period 1510-25 helmets were rounded with visors of the 'sparrow's beak' form, whereas in Germany, the fluted 'Maximillian' style of armour produced distinctive types of helmet. The skulls of these helmets were globular with a low crest, many were decorated with <b>fluting</b> but some were plain. Two types of visor were produced, the Nuremberg form which had a 'bellows' shape, and the Augsburg form which was more projecting and is commonly called a 'monkey face'.|$|E

25|$|The most {{impressive}} {{hall in the}} complex is the Apadana hall, occupying an area of about 109 square meters with 36 columns each more than 19 m tall. Each column is fluted, with a square base (except a few in the porticoes), and a composite capital supporting {{the roof of the}} complex. The structure was originally closed off from the elements by mud-brick walls over 5 meters thick and over 20 meters. The columns were unique in that each had a composite capital often depicting addorsed bulls or animals. Those columns in the porticoes not only would possess a circular base, but would also have an ornate capital {{after the end of the}} <b>fluting,</b> only to be curtailed by detailed addorsed bulls, supporting the roof.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{had a great}} {{passion for}} armour, not only as {{equipment}} for battle or tournaments, but as an art form. The style of armour that became popular {{during the second half}} of his reign featured elaborate <b>fluting</b> and metalworking, and became known as Maximilian armour. It emphasized the details in the shaping of the metal itself, rather than the etched or gilded designs popular in the Milanese style. Maximilian also gave a bizarre jousting helmet as a gift to King Henry VIII – the helmet's visor featured a human face, with eyes, nose and a grinning mouth, and was modelled after the appearance of Maximilian himself. It also sported a pair of curled ram's horns, brass spectacles, and even etched beard stubble.|$|E
25|$|Riis was in much demand as a carpenter, a {{major reason}} being the low prices he charged. However, his {{employers}} exploited his efficiency and low prices, and Riis returned to New York City. He was most successful as a salesman, particularly of flatirons and <b>fluting</b> irons, becoming promoted to sales representative of them for Illinois. However, in Chicago he was cheated of both his money and his stock, and {{had to return to}} an earlier base in Pittsburgh. There he found that his subordinates he had left to sell in Pennsylvania had cheated him in the same manner. He again had little money, and while bedridden with a fever learned from a letter that Elisabeth, the former object of his affection, was engaged to a cavalry officer. Riis then returned to New York by selling flatirons along the way.|$|E

25|$|The male's song {{consists}} of short pleasant warbling strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles. The individual phrases may go like tu-tu-krr-pree-pree or trr-turit trr-turit.... To announce {{that it has}} become aware of someone straying into its territory – be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal – it gives long shrill raspy whistles like trrii(u) or (t')kwiiet. To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like trüü(t). These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as chlie(p), gihrrr, kwä or wuut. These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship. The song becomes softer and more warbling as the male shows the female around his territory, and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing <b>fluting</b> tli-tli, prrr trills and kwiw...püh calls.|$|E
25|$|The {{skull of}} Euoplocephalus can be {{distinguished}} from most other ankylosaurids by several anatomical details, including: the pattern of bony sculpturing in the region {{in front of the}} eyes; the form of the palpebral bones (small bones over the eyes), which may have served as bony eyelids; the shallowness of the nasal vestibule at the entrance of the nasal cavity; the medial curve of the tooth rows in the upper jaw; and the teeth, which are relatively small, lacking true cingula, and having variable <b>fluting</b> of the denticles. However, these traits are shared with a number of closely related forms, some of which in the past have been included in the genus. Combining such forms, Walter Coombs and Teresa Maryańska in 1990 stated that Euoplocephalus could be distinguished based on four traits. The premaxillae, the front snout bones, are not covered by dermal ossifications. The external bony nostrils are slit-like, face to the front and are each divided by a vertical bone sheet or septum. The beak has a width equal to or greater than the distance between the rear maxillary, upper cheek, teeth rows. The foot has three digits, metatarsals with toes.|$|E
25|$|However, most First Class {{rooms were}} left intact, {{save for the}} Salon Riviera and Salon Fontainebleau. The former was {{transformed}} into the Club International (dubbed Club-I by Norway aficionados), where every element of the original décor was removed. The square columns were made round with vertical aluminium <b>fluting,</b> the walls were repainted in a cream with baby-blue in the ceiling and wall niches, and all the original artwork and furniture was removed. In the corner niches oversized, crystal encrusted Neptune statues were placed, and similar crystal garlanded busts sat on brackets on the forward bulkhead. Lounge seating, sofas and rattan chairs were placed amongst potted ferns, giving the room an overall Miami art-deco feel. Only the railings and bronze, star-shaped light fixtures were original to the room. The latter space was gutted and remade into Checkers Cabaret; a small show lounge with abstract chrome palm trees around the columns, red lacquered wall panels, and a black-and-white checker board dance floor, again evoking a 1920s jazz club. The First Class Library remained untouched, and still used for the same purpose, while the Salon Debussy {{was turned into a}} shop, though its bronze décor and distinctive ceiling remained intact. To either side of these rooms ran the original First Class promenade decks, which were now turned into main circulation halls along the ship's principal public deck; the starboard dubbed Fifth Avenue and the port as Champs-Élysées, complete with columnar advertising posts similar to those found in Paris.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Budd and the Burlington {{capitalized}} on the Zephyrs success. However, most passenger trains needed larger capacity.

However, Burlington {{was determined to be}} the leader, and ordered its large [...] "E" [...] series passenger diesels to also be equipped with matching stainless-steel <b>fluting.</b> Many of the Burlington's long distance named passenger trains began operating under the Zephyr banner, including the Nebraska Zephyr, Twin Cities Zephyr, and perhaps the most famous of the namesake, the California Zephyr.|$|E

500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a <b>fluting</b> pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E
