40|$|Abstract—While {{previous}} {{interference rejection}} techniques {{suitable for the}} widely spread GSM/EDGE standard either require multiple antennas or are highly complex, this paper investigates {{the performance of a}} low-complexity single antenna interference rejection technique suitable for implementation in today’s <b>GSM</b> <b>terminals.</b> The study is performed both on the link level in different scenarios and on the system level with fully dynamic radio network simulations. The link level simulations show significant gains. For example, with a single co-channel interferer, the gain over a conventional receiver is up to 10 dB. On the system level it is shown that the introduction of the proposed interference rejection method in all terminals gives a large increase in downlink speech capacity in a tightly planned GSM network. The strong but sporadic interference in such a network is an ideal environment for efficient interference rejection...|$|R

40|$|Private {{communications}} inside large vehicles such as ships may {{be effectively}} provided using standard cellular systems. In this {{paper we propose}} a new solution based on software-defined radio with electromagnetic sensing support. Software-defined radio allows low-cost developments and, potentially, added-value services not available in commercial cellular networks. The platform of reference, OpenBTS, only supports single-channel cells. Our proposal, however, has the ability of changing BTS channel frequency without disrupting ongoing communications. This ability should be mandatory in vehicular environments, where neighbouring cell configurations may change rapidly, so a moving cell must be reconfigured in real-time to avoid interferences. Full details about frequency occupancy sensing and the channel reselection procedure are provided in this paper. Moreover, a procedure for fast terminal detection is proposed. This may be decisive in emergency situations, e. g., if someone falls overboard. Different tests confirm the feasibility of our proposal and its compatibility with commercial <b>GSM</b> <b>terminals...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{solution}} called dynamic spectrum refarming (DSR) for deploying LTE small cells using the same spectrum as existing GSM networks. The basic idea of DSR is that LTE small cells are deployed in the GSM spectrum but suppress transmission of all signals including the reference signals in some specific physical resource blocks corresponding to a portion of the GSM carriers to ensure full GSM coverage. Our study shows that the proposed solution can provide LTE mobile terminals with high speed data services when they are in the coverage of the LTE small cells while minimally affecting the service provided to <b>GSM</b> <b>terminals</b> located within the LTE small cell coverage area. Thus, the proposal allows the normal operation of the existing GSM networks even with LTE small cells deployed in that spectrum. Though the focus of this paper is about GSM spectrum refarming, an analogous approach can be applied to reuse code division multiple access (CDMA) spectrum for LTE small cells.

40|$|A {{common problem}} in <b>GSM</b> <b>terminals</b> is an interfering signal nicknamed the “Bumblebee”. This {{interference}} {{is generated by}} the switching nature of TDMA cellular telephony, the radio circuits are switched on and off with the radio access rate. In GSM, this frequency is approximately 217 Hz, This frequency and its harmonics get into the analog microphone signal, and produce a very annoying periodic noise in the uplink speech. This thesis contains a study of four differerent software solutions, to suppress this interference. These four different methods are denoted, Notch filter, Matched filter, Correlators and Interpolation in frequency. It is shown that the best result is achieved with the Correlatars. Since the frequency comlponents of the Bumblebee are well known, {{it is possible to}} estimate the phase and the amplitude of these with Correlators. This is done by correlating the microphone signal with sinusoids having the same frequencies as the Bumblebee, hence the name Correlators. By generating sinusoids with these phase and amplitude estimates, and then subtracting them from the microphone signal, the Bumblebee is suppressed. Since it is subtracted in the time domain it is also possible to consider a recurring pause in the interference caused by the so called idle frame in the transmission.

Using a solution where the communication with the PLC is done with a wireless interface would mean that the user interact with a system from a wider area. The solution should have the same functionality as today with the extension that the PLC should be able to contact the user if something is wrong in the installation.
