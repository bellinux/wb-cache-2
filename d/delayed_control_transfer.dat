The resource management functionality and application programmer interfaces of an operating system may be delegated to other system components, but the kernel must manage <b>control</b> <b>transfer.</b> The current trend towards increased modularity in operating systems only increases the importance of <b>control</b> <b>transfer.</b> My thesis is that a programming language abstraction, continuations, can be adapted for use in operating system kernels to achieve increased flexibility and performance for <b>control</b> <b>transfer.</b> The flexibility that continuations provide allows the kernel designer when necessary to choose implementation performance over convenience, without affecting {{the design of the}} rest of the kernel.

40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceBoth dynamic binary {{translation}} {{systems and}} optimization systems store the translated or optimized code {{in the software}} maintained code cache for reuse. The performance of the code cache is crucial. Translated code is usually organized as code blocks in the code cache and each code block <b>transfer</b> <b>control</b> {{to the next one}} through a <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instruction. As the target address of a <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instruction {{is in the form of}} its source program counter, the conventional code cache system has to check the address mapping table for the translated target address to find the required target code block, which will cause considerable performance degradation. <b>Control</b> <b>transfer</b> instructions can be divided into two categories as direct <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instructions and indirect <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instructions. For indirect <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instructions, the target address is hold in the register or memory element whose content can be changed during the execution of the program. It is difficult to chain the indirect <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instructions with a fixed translated target address through pure software approaches. A novel indirect <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> chaining approach is proposed in this paper. The principle of the technique is to insert custom chaining instructions into the translated code block while translating the indirect <b>control</b> <b>transfer</b> instructions and execute those chaining instructions to implement dynamical chaining. Some special hardware and software assists are proposed in this paper. Evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted on a code cache simulator.

40|$|Many packet {{scheduling}} mechanisms {{have been}} proposed to provide rate and <b>delay</b> <b>control</b> to flows.

This paper presents a scheduling mechanism for <b>delay</b> <b>control</b> that does not require per-flow state in interior network nodes (a. k. a. corestateless networks). In our mechanism, the packet delay is un-coupled from the momentary congestion status of the node (i. e. the delay no longer depends {{on the length of}} the queue at packet arrival but rather on whether there are packets with more stringent delay requirements) and the granularity in delay differentiation becomes irrespective of the number and size of buffers. It is also shown that end-toend per-flow <b>delay</b> <b>control</b> can be achieved through ensuring local delay management...|$|R
