5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, harmonica and mandolin. The sparsely <b>instrumented</b> acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors {{to doubt the}} wisdom of releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E
5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus <b>instrumented</b> artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine <b>instrumented</b> free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown {{to a maximum}} speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally crashing into the water.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} was 6.4 on {{the moment}} magnitude scale, {{with a maximum}} perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. However, most of the intensity measurements were consistent with an overall maximum intensity of VII (Very strong), and only the damage to a single structure, the Imperial County Services building in El Centro, was judged to be of intensity IX. Several comprehensive studies on the total structural failure of this building were conducted {{with a focus on}} how the building responded to the earthquake's vibration. It {{was one of the first}} heavily <b>instrumented</b> office buildings to be severely damaged by seismic forces.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, Allingham, by then an Air Mechanic First Class, {{was posted}} to the Western Front to join No. 12 Squadron RNAS.

When Allingham arrived at Petite-Synthe, both the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the RNAS {{were involved in the}} Ypres offensive. Allingham also <b>instrumented</b> the very first reconnaissance aircraft camera during the First World War. On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France where he remained {{for the rest of the}} war, on aircraft repair and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea.|$|E
500|$|An ancient Hindu system {{named the}} Natya Shastra, {{written by the}} sage Bharata Muni and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides <b>instruments</b> into four main {{classification}} groups: <b>instruments</b> where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion <b>instruments</b> with skin heads; <b>instruments</b> where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and [...] "solid", or non-skin, percussion <b>instruments.</b> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by Johannes de Muris, who used the terms tensibilia (stringed <b>instruments),</b> inflatibilia (wind <b>instruments),</b> and percussibilia (all percussion <b>instruments).</b> In 1880, Victor-Charles Mahillon adapted the Natya Shastra and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: chordophones (stringed <b>instruments),</b> membranophones (skin-head percussion <b>instruments),</b> aerophones (wind <b>instruments),</b> and autophones (non-skin percussion <b>instruments).</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers <b>instrumented</b> and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E
5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich. Peronist governors, legislators, and union leaders {{met at the}} Quinta de Olivos, amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint the populist Daniel Carbonetto as minister of economy. They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies <b>instrumented</b> so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center {{acquired}} an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights {{in support of}} short programs, chase on X-15 missions and lifting body flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were <b>instrumented</b> to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{compelling}} seismogram from the 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident {{the need for}} more data for earthquake engineering applications. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had <b>instrumented</b> more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully <b>instrumented</b> government building that was shaken to the point of failure.|$|E
