After the Revolution, the new federal government owned all the public land except that within the 13 original colonies and a few non-original states. The land owned by the government was called The Public Domain. The Land Act of 1785 gave land warrants to the soldiers to fulfill the promise. The Act also allowed the Treasury Department to sell land in auctions to the highest bidders. A new surveying system was created. The first auction was held in D.C., but the land sold was in Ohio.

The White Paper recites in chronological order for the repeatedly made surveys and registrations of the gypsies made by the authorities during the 1900 ´s. My analysis will apply the theories of Michel Foucault being about biopower/biopolitics and the method for ideological analysis by Sven-Eric Liedman. I have shown how the Swedish <b>Governement</b> instituted a number of excluding measures on the gypsies. The <b>Governement</b> defined the gypsies, as a deviant and lower class race, entirely separate from the pure Swedish race. I have shown the Governement´s interest in spreading “antiziganism” to other citizens and its willingness to eliminate the gypsies by forced sterilisation and forced fostering of their children. “Swedish” standards were set by the <b>Governement</b> and, through these standards the police found substantial grounds to keep records of particular individual gypsies and to share this information between and outside authorities. I have in my analysis defined and shown that the Governement´s ideology was nationalism, regardless of party in governmental power.
