50|$|According to the International Miniature Cattle Breeders Society of Registry (who do not {{recognize}} Miniature Texas Longhorns) miniature cattle should not exceed the height of 42 inches measured at <b>the</b> hip, or <b>hook</b> <b>bone.</b> Cattle between <b>the</b> sizes of 42 to 48 inches should be considered mid-sized miniatures. However, since Texas Longhorns are a large breed {{in general and the}} miniatures are still a new concept, it is believed that the height limits should reflect that. Miniature Texas Longhorns should stay under the height of 45 inches when measured at <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>bone</b> (hip). Their horns should be longitudinal with a forward and upward sweep and the total horn measurement should be longer than the height of the animal.|$|R
40|$|Lameness is a {{major issue}} in dairy cattle and its early and {{automated}} detection offers animal welfare benefits together with potentially high commercial savings for farmers. Current advancements in automated detection have not achieved a sensitive measure for classifying early lameness; it remains to be a key challenge to be solved. The state-of-the-art also lacks behind on other aspects e. g. robust feature detection from a cow's body and the identification of the lame leg/side. This multidisciplinary research addresses the above issues by proposing an overhead, non-intrusive and covert 3 -Dimensional (3 D) video setup. This facilitates an automated process in order to record freely walking Holstein dairy cows at a commercial farm scale, in an unconstrained environment. The 3 D data of the cow's body have been used to automatically track key regions such as <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>bones</b> and <b>the</b> spine using a curvedness feature descriptor which operates at a high detection accuracy (100...|$|R
40|$|Body {{condition}} scoring is {{a common}} tool to assess the subcutaneous fat reserves of dairy cows. Because of its subjectivity, which causes limits in repeatability, it is often discussed controversially. Aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the impact of considering the cows overall appearance on the scoring process and on the validity of the results. Therefore, two different methods to reveal body condition scores (BCS), ‘independent BCS' (iBCS) and ‘dependent BCS' (dBCS), were used to assess 1111 Swiss Brown Cattle. The iBCS and the dBCS systems were both working with the same flowchart with a decision tree structure for visual and palpatory assessment using a scale from 2 to 5 with increment units of 0. 25. The iBCS was created strictly complying with the defined frames of the decision tree structure. The system was chosen due to its formularized approach to reduce the influence of subjective impressions. By contrast, the dBCS system, which was in line with common practice, had a more open approach, where - besides the decision tree - the overall impression of the cow's physical appearance was taken into account for generating the final score. Ultrasound measurement of the back fat thickness (BFT) was applied as a validation method. The dBCS {{turned out to be the}} better predictor of BFT, explaining 67. 3 % of the variance. The iBCS was only able to explain 47. 3 % of the BFT variance. Within the whole data set, only 31. 3 % of the animals received identical dBCS and iBCS. The pin bone region caused the most deviations between dBCS and iBCS, but also assessing the pelvis line, <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>bones</b> and <b>the</b> ligaments led to divergences in around 20 % of the scored animals. The study showed that during the assessment of body condition a strict adherence to a decision tree is a possible source of inexact classifications. Some body regions, especially the pin bones, proved to be particularly challenging for scoring due to difficulties in assessing them. All the more, the inclusion of the overall appearance of the cow into the assessment process counteracted these errors and led to a fair predictability of BFT with the flowchart-based BCS. This might be particularly important, if different cattle types and breeds are assesse...|$|R

The {{variations of}} the muscles, especially accessory muscles may simulate soft tissue tumors and can result in nerve compressions. During a routine dissection of the anterior region of the forearm and hand, an unusual muscle was observed {{on the left side}} of a 65 -year-old male cadaver. The anomalous muscle belly arose from the medial epicondyle approxiamately 1 cm posterolateral to origin of normal flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (FCU), and from proximal part of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. It inserted to the triquetral, hamate bones and flexor retinaculum. Passive traction on the tendon of accessory muscle resulted in flexion of radiocarpal junction.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hook</b> {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> It is <b>the</b> point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened.
