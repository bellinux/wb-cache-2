40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{interest}} in characterizing the complex microbial communities in the <b>poultry</b> <b>gut,</b> and in understanding the effects of these dynamic communities on poultry performance, disease status, animal welfare, and microbes with human health significance. Investigations characterizing the poultry enteric virome have identified novel poultry viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems have yet to be fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the <b>poultry</b> <b>gut</b> influences gut development, immune status, and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation was undertaken to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-contact intestinal microbiome with the altered microbiome following contact with poultry raised in the field. Analysis of the intestinal virome from contact birds ("sentinels") placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not present in pre-contact birds or present in proportionally lower numbers. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in the post-contact birds, notably by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well-characterized and have historically been implicated in poultry enteric disease; members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have only relatively recently been described in the <b>poultry</b> and avian <b>gut,</b> and their roles in the recognized disease syndromes and in poultry performance in general have not been determined.

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni, a major enteric {{pathogen}} and a natural resident in the <b>poultry</b> <b>gut,</b> causes gastrointestinal illness followed by severe post-infection complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, reactive arthritis, myocarditis, and ulcerative colitis in humans. Risk assessment studies have projected a 30 -fold reduction in human campylobacteriosis cases {{with only a}} 100 -fold {{reduction in the number}} of C. jejuni colonizing the <b>poultry</b> <b>gut.</b> Current commercial <b>poultry</b> production practices involve use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP); modulation of gut microbiota with AGPs for food safety and enhanced performance in poultry can be justified until acquisition of antibiotic resistance in zoonoses through inter-bacterial transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a complex microbial community is considered. As an alternative, natural phenolics extracted from by-products of berry juice industry, with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antioxidant and vasodilatory activities, demonstrate promising prospects. In this study, we adopted mass-spectrometry, microbiological, phylogenetic, and metagenomic approaches to evaluate bioactive phenolic extracts (BPE) from blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pomaces as AGP alternative. We detected that major phenolics in BPE included, but were not limited to, apigenin, catechol, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, coumarin, ellagic acid, eugenols, flavan, gallic acid, gingerol, glucosides, glucuronides, myricetin, phenols, quercetin, quinones, rhamnosides, stilbenol, tannins, triamcinolone, and xanthine. BPE reduced C. jejuni growth and motility in vitro, resulting in lower adherence and invasiveness to chicken fibroblast cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of BPE significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in chick macrophage cell line ex vivo. Furthermore, BPE reduced the colonization of C. jejuni in broiler cecum by 1 to 5 logs while increasing broiler weight by 6 % compared to 9. 5 % with commercial AGPs. Metagenomic analysis of broiler gut indicated that BPE caused an AGP-like pattern in bacterial communities with a comparative increase of Firmicutes and a concomitant reduction of Bacteroidetes in broiler ceca. AGP supplementation clearly caused phage induction and a richer resistome profile in the cecal microbiome compared to BPE. Functional characterization of cecal microbiomes revealed a significant variation in the abundance of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. Our findings established a baseline upon which mechanisms of plant based antimicrobial performance-enhancers in regulation of animal growth can be investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Antibiotic growth {{promoters}} enhance growth performance and stabilize an animal’s health status (Gustafsonand Bowen, 1997). Since the ban in 2006 of antibiotic {{growth promoters}} in the European Union, {{the search for}} suitable natural alternative to antibiotic growth promoters with similar beneficial effects has been intensified. Among possible alternatives are phytogenic feed additives (PFA) which may positively affect poultry health and productivity. Many non-therapeutic substitutes (prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics), especially plants extracts {{from a wide variety}} of herbs, spices and derivatives, have already been used as a feed additive in poultry. Recent studies on these compounds have shown some positive effects (antimicrobial, antioxidant and regulator of the <b>gut</b> flora) in <b>poultry</b> production.

40|$|A chicken growth {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if litter type influenced gut microbiota and performance in broilers. Seven bedding materials were investigated and included soft and hardwood sawdust, softwood shavings, shredded paper, chopped straw, rice hulls, and reused softwood shavings. Microbial profiling was done to investigate changes in cecal bacterial communities associated with litter material and age. Cecal microbiota were investigated at 14 and 28 d of age (n = 12 birds/litter material). At both ages, the cecal microbiota of chickens raised on reused litter was significantly (P 0. 05) differences were observed in feed conversion ratio among birds raised on any of the 7 different litter materials at either 14 or 28 d of age. The type of litter material can influence colonization and development of cecal microbiota in chickens. Litter-induced changes in the gut microbiota may be partially responsible for some of the significant differences observed in early rates of growth; therefore, litter choice may have an important role in <b>poultry</b> <b>gut</b> health particularly in the absence of in-feed antibiotics.

Gut microbial communities from the duodena, jejuna, ilea, and ceca of 48 birds fed either a barley control diet or barley diet supplemented with exogenous enzymes for degrading nonstarch polysaccharide were characterized by using multivariate statistical methods. Analysis of samples showed that gut microbial communities varied significantly among gut sections, except between the duodenum and jejunum. Significant diet-associated differences in gut microbial communities were detected within the ileum and cecum only. The dissimilarity in bacterial community composition between diets was 73 and 66 % within the ileum and cecum, respectively. Operational taxonomic units, representing bacterial species or taxonomically related groups, contributing to diet-associated differences were identified. Several bacterial species contributed to differences between diet-related gut microbial community composition, with no individual bacterial species contributing more than 1 to 5 % of the total. Using canonical analysis of principal coordinates biplots, we correlated differences in gut microbial community composition within the ileum and cecum to improved performance, as measured by apparent metabolizable energy.

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is {{the leading}} food-borne {{poisoning}} in industrialized countries. While the bacteria causes disease in humans, it merely colonizes the <b>gut</b> in <b>poultry</b> or pigs, where seems to establish a commensal relationship. Until now, {{few studies have been}} conducted to elucidate the relationship between C. jejuni and its different hosts. In this work, a comparative proteomics approach was used to identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the divergent outcome following C. jejuni infection in human and porcine host. Human (INT- 407) and porcine (IPEC- 1) intestinal cell lines were infected by C. jejuni for 3 h (T 3 h) and 24 h (T 24 h). C. jejuni infection prompted an intense inflammatory response at T 3 h in human intestinal cells, mainly characterized by expression of proteins involved in cell spreading, cell migration and promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Proteomic analysis evidenced significantly regulated biofunctions in human cells related with engulfment and endocytosis, and supported by canonical pathways associated to infection such as caveolar- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling. In porcine IPEC- 1 cells, inflammatory response as well as signaling pathways that control cellular functions such as cell migration, endocytosis and cell cycle progression resulted downregulated. These differences in the host response to infection were supported by the different pattern of adhesion and invasion proteins expressed by C. jejuni in human and porcine cells. No marked differences in expression of virulence factors involved in adaptive response and iron acquisition functions were observed. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} suggest that both host and pathogen factors are responsible for commensal or infectious character of C. jejuni in different hosts.

Optimum temperature studies ranged from 30 to 70  °C. It was observed that, the optimum temperature for maximum PYT activity is 50  °C (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). On considering the activity at 50  °C to be 100 %, we observe that at 35  °C, the activity reduces to 30 % of maximum activity and at 60  °C to 60 % of maximum activity. Temperature stability studies were then carried out, which showed 100 % stability in 1  h from 30 to 50  °C (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1) while 20 % activity was reduced at 60  °C, 50 % at 65  °C and 100 % at 70  °C.

Four independent experiments were completed with different inflammation treatment groups; serum FITC-d and/or retention of FITC-d in GI tract was/were determined. In experiment 1 (n= 10 birds/treatment; broilers; processed at 14 d), groups included control (CON), Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS; drinking water at 0. 75 %) and feed restriction (FRS; 24 h before processing). Experiment 2 (n= 14 birds/treatment; leghorns; processed at 7 d) included CON, DSS, FRS, and rye based diet (RBD). In experiments 3 and 4 (n= 15 birds/treatment; broilers; processed at 7 d), groups were CON, DSS, high fat diet (HFD), FRS, and RBD. In all experiments, FRS and RBD treatments showed significantly higher serum FITC-d levels compared to the respective CON. This indicates that FRS and RBD results in disruption of the intact barrier of the GIT, resulting in increased gut permeability. DSS and HFD groups showed elevation of serum FITC-d levels although the magnitude of difference from respective CON were inconsistent between experiments.
