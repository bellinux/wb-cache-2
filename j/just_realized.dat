25|$|Some comic books, {{especially}} superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the {{exclamation point}} {{instead of the}} period, which means the character has <b>just</b> <b>realized</b> something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or {{they do not know}} what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Griffith played Taylor as a heavy-handed country bumpkin, {{grinning}} {{from ear}} to ear and speaking in a hesitant, frantic manner. [...] The style recalled that used in the delivery of his popular [...] monologues such as [...] "What It Was, Was Football". [...] He gradually abandoned the [...] "rustic Taylor" [...] and developed a serious and thoughtful characterization. [...] Producer Aaron Ruben recalled: He was being that marvelously funny character from No Time for Sergeants, Will Stockdale ... One day he said, [...] "My God, I <b>just</b> <b>realized</b> that I'm the straight man. I'm playing straight to all these kooks around me." [...] He didn't like himself ... and in the next season he changed, becoming this Lincolnesque character.|$|E
500|$|The film {{starts out}} in live action, {{introducing}} the protagonist Michael Corleone, a 22-year-old virgin (inaccurately {{referred to as}} 24 in the movie's trailer) playing pinball in New York City. The scene then transitions into animation. New York has a diseased, rotten, tough, and violent atmosphere. Michael's Italian father, Angelo [...] "Angie" [...] Corleone, is a struggling mafioso who frequently cheats on Michael's Jewish mother, Ida. The couple constantly bicker and try to kill each other. Michael ambles through a catalog of freaks, greasers, and dopers. Unemployed, he dabbles with cartoons, artistically feeding off the grubbiness of his environment. He regularly hangs out at a local bar where he gets free drinks from the female black bartender, Carole, in exchange for sketches of the somewhat annoying Shorty, Carole's violent, legless bouncer devotee. One of the regular customers at the bar named Snowflake, a nymphomaniac transvestite, gets beaten up by a tough drunk hard-hat who has only <b>just</b> <b>realized</b> that Snowflake is a man in drag and not a beautiful woman. Snowflake loves it, but the drunk causes property damage. Shorty throws the drunk out and the bar's white manager abusively confronts Carole over this. Fed up with her manager, Carole quits.|$|E

500|$|In December 2015, astronomers at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) {{detected}} a brief series of 350GHz pulses that they concluded must either be {{a series of}} independent sources, or a single, fast moving source. Deciding that the latter was the most likely, they calculated based on its speed that, were it bound to the Sun, the object, which they named [...] "Gna" [...] after a fast-moving messenger goddess in Norse mythology, would be about 12–25 AU distant and have a dwarf planet-sized diameter of 220 to 880km. However, {{if it were a}} rogue planet not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and as far away as 4000 AU, it could be much larger. The paper was never formally accepted, and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed. Scientists' reactions to the notice were largely sceptical; Mike Brown commented that, [...] "If it is true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer solar system object in its tiny, tiny, tiny, field of view, that would suggest that there are something like 200,000 Earth-sized planets in the outer solar system ... Even better, I <b>just</b> <b>realized</b> that this many Earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the entire solar system and we would all die." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Predić, the {{painting}} shows four intoxicated youths {{who have been}} drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge {{down the middle of}} the dirt road, keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The gajda (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up against his shoulder. The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has <b>just</b> <b>realized</b> that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son. She begins to shout at him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads Szeszfőzde ("distillery" [...] in Hungarian). Predić's initials in Cyrillic, У.П., can be found in the bottom-right corner.|$|E
500|$|Although {{having written}} about eight songs while on tour in 2005, Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy {{decided to write}} new music because they wanted the album to be [...] "...quite new, to be quite {{different}} sounding from everything we've ever done before." [...] Despite having recorded their second album in {{a short amount of}} time, Kapranos stressed that the band wanted to take their time. He voices, [...] "This time we wanted to spend more time developing, and also, I suppose, allowing songs and sounds to evolve more before we ended up writing an album, and absorbing more music and ideas and, I suppose, life itself. And when I say life, I mean life off the road, because I wouldn't classify life on the road as real life." [...] Franz Ferdinand began working on Tonight in early 2007. Franz Ferdinand was supposed to record the album with producer Brian Higgins, yet in March 2008, the two entities parted ways. The drummer, Paul Thomson, says [...] "We wrote with Higgins for a while and initially we thought we'd work more with him but it didn't really work out. We <b>just</b> <b>realized</b> that we're not really a pop group." [...] However, they also commented they have not given up on the pop concept. The songs on the album were written and recorded at the old town hall of Govan, Scotland as well as Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona. The band first moved into Govan's old town hall following a year of touring in support of their second studio album and mostly used it for storing and rehearsing.|$|E

[...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [...] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews.
