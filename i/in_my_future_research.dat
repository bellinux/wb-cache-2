40|$|Background: The multi-billion dollar {{leadership}} development industry relies on practitioner approaches that in mainstream prescribe the content view of leadership pipeline development – recruiting in traits and attributes, and training up skills and behaviours. This {{approach is not}} delivering the expected results. However, a reliable evidence-based process approach to leader development has not yet emerged. Purpose: This study addresses the insufficiency of the current theory and evidence relating the mechanisms of development of senior leader expertise. Methodology: The study relies on the systematic review method (Tranfield, Denyer & Smart, 2003) to qualitatively analyse the literature on leader expertise {{and the role of}} identity in leader development from constructive-developmental perspective. Findings: A review of literature on leader expertise explored the specifics of the research gap in the understanding of the logic, the factors and the process behind the development of senior leader expertise. Although recent theories of leader expertise indeed proposed that leader identity provides a crucial knowledge structure around which leader expertise evolves, as well as an impetus for leader expertise development, virtually no research exists to back up this idea. However, research associated with the constructive-developmental theory, an adult development perspective largely unrelated to the leader expertise enquiry, provides some evidence of the association between identity and developmental outcomes that may be used as the first pass at validating the identity propositions of the leader expertise theorists. This review of leader expertise and identity from constructive-developmental perspective helped me formulate a framework for analysis of leader expertise from identity perspective. This framework may be used <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>future</b> PhD <b>research</b> {{as a starting point for}} modelling of identity processes in the development of senior leader expertise...|$|R

The machine learning attack is to generalize from collections of instances of similar problems. A class of such problems that is especially challenging involves complex connected systems. These networks underpin our lifestyle: transportation, distribution and communication. A continuum of fascinating problems involving modeling, prediction and decision making naturally emerges when one studies their behavior. Can we predict road traffic patterns?

The {{aim of this study}} was to work collaboratively with a social studies teacher to develop our understanding and practice of teaching social issues and drama method in the social studies classroom. To conduct this study, I worked collaboratively with one social studies teacher in a private school of Karachi, Pakistan. In this study, students of grade 7 were my secondary participants. The action research began by understanding! exploring the existing perceptions and practices of teaching of social issues and drama in the social studies classroom. Subsequently, an action research plan was prepared to facilitate our understanding and practice of teaching social issues and drama in the social studies classroom. The data was collected using classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, reflective journals and video recording. The data analysis was an ongoing process, whereby after each action, data was reflected and analyzed upon for further action. The findings of the study show that my co-teacher and I developed our understanding on teaching social issue and drama method. The process enabled us to realize the importance of peer teaching and learning and reflective practice in adult education. The findings revealed that while working on drama strategy to learn social issues students developed their investigating skills by gathering data, critical thinking skills by exploration of their respective issue and finding out appropriate ways to resolve the problem, reading and writing skills while writing scripts and social skills while working in groups. Therefore, it is recommended drama can also be used as an assessment tool in social studies education. Future researcher can study this approach to teach social issues with experimental research methodology. The study concludes by presenting key learning experience of teaching social issues through drama method as well as it will help me <b>in</b> conducting <b>my</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> social studies education...|$|R

The information devices of tomorrow {{are going to}} be used in constantly changing contexts and they {{are going to be}} designed to enable a mass market for mobile communication. In the software industry the "time to market" factor, which sets firm deadlines for developers, is also important. In such a landscape of complexities is it very important to have design methods that afford the work in an effective way without giving up the impact of potential user. This thesis is the outcome of twenty weeks? research in the field of mobile computational artefacts in relation to developing design methods that will help designers focus on real world use situations. I will examine the opportunity to use the Personas concept [Cooper, A. 1999] in relation to ethnography as a method to afford the design process. I point at how long term work with background field studies in various ways can afford the design process in specific projects and how the traditionally usability work mostly built up around scenario based tests can be helped of the same. I will base my analyses on empirical data from my research site, Symbian. The primary method <b>in</b> <b>my</b> research is participation and observations in the daily work within a design team consisting of eight people.

40|$|In this research, waste textile {{materials}} like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and cotton were compression molded into composites. The main {{idea was to}} use waste textiles to develop composites like PET and cotton. PET acts as matrix and cotton as reinforcement because PET is thermoplastic whereas cotton is non thermoplastic. Approximately about 21 million tons of textile solid waste is being disposed into landfills annually, leading to vast environmental properties and waste of valuable raw materials. By using waste PET and cotton textiles there are technical as well as environmental viabilities. However, implementing them into fabricating composites is not widely conducted. Compression molding is a feasible approach to use waste PET and cotton textiles into fabricating composites that have good potential for industrial applications. In this research, investigating the effects of plasticizers and alkalis on decreasing the processing temperatures of composites was studied so that the cotton is protected during compression molding. In the following paper, it is shown how plasticizers can be effectively used to decrease the melting temperature of PET. The influences of chemicals on the melting temperature of PET and the mechanical properties of the composites are investigated. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>future</b> <b>research,</b> the feasibility of compression molding PET and cotton fabrics into composites with other chemicals will be studied.

40|$|Drama is a pleasurable {{activity}} {{for most of}} the students, whereas in science education, inquiry promotes students’ critical thinking skills. When these two activities combine together, students are able to learn scientific concepts with fun. The {{purpose of this study was}} to promote class VII students’ learning by using inquiry based teaching through drama in science classroom. Furthermore, successes and challenges faced during this study were examined. For this study, the qualitative paradigm was used and particularly action research method was applied and two cycles were carried out. The research participants were a science teacher, an Academic Coordinator, grade VII students and myself. In this study, guided inquiry was used and an inquiry question was posed by the teacher-researcher. The data was generated through reflective journal, observation, field notes, interviews and video recording. The findings of the study show that through different sources, the students gathered information, wrote scripts and performed drama. The study’s findings reveal that by using these two methods in science classroom, the students develop their investigating skills by gathering data; critical thinking skill by exploration and creativity, reading and writing skills while writing scripts, and social skills through group work. The data also reveals that students get an understanding of a variety of science concepts by exploration. Moreover, the element of fun from drama made students motivated and connected with the task. Therefore, it is recommended that science teachers could bring a variety of activities to promote students’ learning. Science teachers can evolve scientific inquiry with drama, games and simulations, so that students can learn scientific concepts with fun. In addition, this study will pave the way for science teachers to promote action research in their classroom by using innovative ideas through planning, observing, implementing and reflecting cycles.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I expand {{upon our}} knowledge {{in regards to}} the utility of population genetic approaches to be used {{for the study of the}} evolution of introduced biological control agents and their target pests. If biological control methods are to provide sustainable pest management services then more long-term studies will be necessary, and these studies should also include the use of population genetic approaches. For existing biological control programs, post-release population genetic studies could be initiated using museum voucher specimens for baseline data. In Chapter 2, I explored what factors influence our ability to extract usable genomic material from dried museum specimens, and whether we could use non-destructive techniques for parasitic hymenoptera. I found that the age of the specimen was the most important determinant for the amplification of PCR products, with nuclear loci having a higher probability of amplification from older specimens than mitochondrial loci. With these sequence results I was able to differentiate voucher specimens of different strains of the biological control agent Trioxys pallidus and I was able to confirm the identification of an unknown parasitoid reared from the invasive light brown apple moth. For population genetic surveys to be conducted more frequently in biological control programs, some of the barriers to developing molecular markers that are variable enough for these types of surveys need to be overcome. One barrier is the time required to develop polymorphic microsatellite markers. Therefore, in Chapter 3, I developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline that searches through next-generation sequence (NGS) data and uses the raw sequencing reads to identify polymorphic loci. Using this approach I was able to rapidly develop microsatellite markers for two of my study species (T. pallidus and Chromaphis juglandicola). For both species more than 60 % of the target markers amplified and were found to be polymorphic, compared to previous approaches where the success rates were much lower (published studies often show rates between 1 and 20 %). I then examined evolutionary factors that may affect the sustainability of two classical biological control programs; 1) the biological control of walnut aphids, and 2) the biological control of invasive knotweeds. The walnut aphid biological control program is a textbook successful biological control program, but has shown recent evidence of localized breakdowns, whereas the biological control program for invasive knotweeds is currently under review in the United States and Canada. In Chapter 4, I explored whether hybridization between introduced “strains” of T. pallidus is responsible for recent breakdowns in this control program. In that study I found low levels of hybridization – thus it is unlikely hybridization is playing an important role in these breakdowns – as well as evidence that two of the strains may actually be cryptic species; one being a specialist and another being a generalist. In Chapter 5, I explored whether the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution might help explain these localized breakdowns. In that chapter I found evidence for a geographic mosaic in the walnut aphid biological control program, and commented on how components of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution can help us predict what systems we might expect localized breakdowns to occur in. In Chapter 6, I explored whether endosymbionts might play a role in shaping the host-associations of two strains of the candidate biological control agent for invasive knotweeds. I found that while strains of the psyllid Aphalara itadori showed no barriers to hybridization of their nuclear genomes, there were curious patterns of horizontal transmission of their primary endosymbiont. I also found that one haplotype of the secondary endosymbiont Sodalis sp. dramatically changed in frequency during the hybrid crosses reared on giant knotweed. When compared with previous studies of this species, the results I observe suggest that endosymbionts may play an important role in the differing fitness levels of these two strains. In conclusion, population genetic approaches provide valuable tools for the study of post-release dynamics in biological control settings. While biological control programs promise to be useful study systems for evolutionary interactions, post-release studies will allow for that promise to come to fruition. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> endeavors I would like to continue to monitor the effects of hybridization and the frequency of geographic mosaics of coevolution in biological control settings. In addition, I would like to conduct post-release population genetic studies of both previous successful introductions and programs that resulted in failures. I believe these post-release studies will allow us to better determine what evolutionary factors affect the sustainability of biological control services and will allow for better management practices...|$|E

40|$|The {{significant}} influence that practice learning plays within undergraduate nurse education cannot be overstated. By practice learning, I mean work-based learning {{immersed in the}} activities of nursing practice, typically involving learning undertaken in placements at hospitals and other clinical worksites. Practice learning is intended to achieve standards defined by professional regulatory bodies, and aims to enhance learners' capability and employability. Learning here refers to processes through which student nurses develop capabilities to practice effectively, critically, confidently and professionally in health care settings. Practice is a key concept in this thesis, much contested in debates about professional learning in practice which I will examine in detail in chapter 2. In terms of current policy regarding practice learning, I would, however, suggest that what we have at the moment is an inherited legacy which to date has not been robustly scrutinised. Based on my experiences as a nursing educator I came to believe that it was timely for a re-examination of policies, practices and philosophies underpinning the duration and structure of the current practice learning model. Taken together, the above experiences led me to focus this thesis on the following research question: How might practice learning experiences be better designed to promote nursing capability? This thesis brings together six published papers reporting studies that I conducted to explore this question, as well as chapters explaining the background literature, theory and methodology guiding these studies. My overarching aim is to contribute to the improved practice learning experiences of undergraduate student nurses, retaining them on programmes and easing their transition into the role of newly qualified practitioners (NQP). Chapter 1 charts the history of nursing educational developments. The aim is to demonstrate the influence of government and professional policy over nursing’s development from an apprentice-style model to the current-day academic model. In charting these developments alongside reviewing the contemporary research literature, what is obvious is that the issues of support, retention, models of practice learning and curricula to prepare nurses are perennial challenges. However, as a practice-based discipline, the focus of preparation has always remained grounded in practice. Chapter 2 sets forth the theoretical constructs of this thesis. During the course of conducting the studies reported in the publications of this thesis, I became frustrated with the relative lack of emphasis on contemporary learning theory in nursing education, and the paucity of supporting evidence for the ‘reflective’ theory that seems to be dominant in nursing. The discussion presented in this chapter aims to provide an overview of the major traditions of constructivism and reflective practice, as well as their historical theoretical foundations, which have been widely adopted in nurse education. I discuss the strengths and limitations of these theories as they apply to undergraduate nurses’ practice learning and capability development. These are then contrasted via the means of a critical discussion with more novel alternative models. These include situated learning theory and legitimate peripheral participation, and practice-based learning theory as advocated by contemporary writers such as Schatzki (2002). These theories changed my thinking about practice learning and informed my efforts to develop a more cogent understanding of learning through, for and at work for undergraduate nurse education. In setting out Chapter 3, I am presenting a brief overview of these publications for a nursing education audience. Firstly, I have included information that is generally considered important to this audience, such as details about the journal’s standing and article citations, the databases searched, and the percentage of my own contributions. Secondly, I report the studies from an evidence-based perspective of prediction and control aligned with the contexts of the commissioning process and the conduct of each project. By this I mean that I treat the findings in these papers as valid and credible within the stated limitations Chapter 4 presents the six publications in their entirety for the reader Chapter 5 explains the research methodology adopted in the papers presented for this thesis, and offers my critical reflections on these methodologies. I outline the philosophy that underpins the approach taken with the research studies, discussing the interpretive stance that was taken to research and the consequent choice of qualitative approaches. The chapter also discusses the strengths and limitations of the methods employed in each of my papers along with the means used to analyse the data, and the ethical considerations that an interpretive researcher must consider. In retrospect, given where my theoretical orientation has moved (as explained in chapter 2), I now look rather more critically on the premises of these studies, their categories of definition, multiple causes and uncertainties at play. In my reflections on the research approach, I explain some of these issues. In concluding this thesis, Chapter 6 details my recommendations and some future implications for policy and practice. It also explains my plans for carrying forward different methodological and theoretical approaches <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> work examining nurses' practice learning...|$|E
40|$|In my dissertation, I use {{experimental}} methods {{to study the}} otherwise unobservable labor market interactions, social norms and peer-effects in non-cognitive skills acquisition. In my first Chapter, I use {{experimental methods}} to better understand behavioral roots of corruption. Corruption is endemic to most developing countries. Most of the recent research in economics has focused on documenting the existence of corruption, measuring its economic impact and designing effective mechanisms to reduce incentives for bureaucrats to engage in corruption. Anecdotal evidence often suggests that improving the internal workings of bureaucracies is insufficient, unless corrupt officials are permanently replaced. It might {{be the case that}} people with a lower personal cost of engaging in unethical behavior choose to become bureaucrats because they are relatively more efficient at corruption. As a result, we might find a higher number of dishonest people opting for public sector jobs. If this were the case, corruption might be hard to fight, since corrupt institutions will attract more corrupt employees. In my dissertation I explore this self-selection of more corruptible individuals into public sector. Using a laboratory experiment, I answer {{the question of whether or}} not labor market sorting in the preference between public and private sector can be explained in part by propensity to engage in unethical behavior. It is hard to get observational individual-level data on corruption because it is secretive in nature. Testing my self-selection hypothesis is particularly challenging because propensity to engage in unethical behavior is typically not measured in observational or survey data. Moreover, data on bureaucrats and politicians before they joined the civil service or became public officials is typically not available. Also, economic policies that are often designed to attract a better pool of bureaucrats, include increasing wages. It is difficult to separate selection based on propensity to engage in unethical behavior from the selection effects of increased monetary incentives. Therefore, I choose experimental methods to study my research question. In Chapter 1, I provide experimental evidence of the sorting effect into the public and private sector. I conducted this experiment (from hereby called Experiment 1) at one of the largest public universities and a premier management institute in India. From these two institutes, I recruited a cross-section of students. I created a firm-like environment in the laboratory and divided subjects randomly into "workers 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 and "supervisors. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Subjects played a game that measured the propensity of supervisors to engage in unethical behavior. I then linked the propensity to engage in unethical behavior to future career choice. Related deception experiments in economics and psychology suggest that not all people engage in dishonest behavior. Therefore, I treat the willingness to engage in unethical behavior as an agent 2 ̆ 7 s preference characteristic. The findings of this study suggest that both public sector and private sector aspirants are equally likely to cheat. In fact, 64 percent of the private sector aspirants and 70 percent of the public sector aspirants cheat. While there is no statistical difference in the proportion of cheaters in the two sectors, the amount of cheating in the two sectors is significantly different. Public sector aspirants cheat 51. 5 percent more than private sector aspirants. Since the choice of sector comes from a survey question and is not measured through the experimental design and I also treat subjects 2 ̆ 7 propensity to engage in unethical behavior as a preference characteristic, these experimental data provide evidence of sorting based on propensity to engage in unethical behavior. While in Chapter 1 I address individual unethical behavior, in Chapter 2, I study group behavior, specifically social norms regarding bribe-giving and bribe-taking in India, using a novel experimental method introduced by Krupka and Weber (2008). Economists have emphasized the strong effect of social norms and legal enforcement on corruption. However, social norms are difficult to measure. Social scientists commonly use surveys to measure norms. There are pros and cons to using a survey. First, surveys are non-incentive compatible. Second, because corruption is a sensitive issue, the norms measured by a survey might be biased and not reflect participants 2 ̆ 7 truthful response. For Chapter 2, I used a unique experimental method to measure the social norms regarding bribe-giving and bribe-taking in India for a common corrupt situation (i. e., obtaining a driver 2 ̆ 7 s license in India). The subjects of this experiment were the "workers 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 who participated in Experiment 1. After Experiment 1, the workers were asked to elicit the social norms regarding bribe-giving and bribe-taking in India. In this norm experiment, we asked subjects to provide social acceptability ratings for five situations related to bribe-taking and bribe-giving encountered by a driver 2 ̆ 7 s license applicant in India. Subjects were provided with incentives to match their rating with the ratings of others. The subjects were required to think how others would respond, and not about their own preferences. This followed a coordination game related to the "shared understanding 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 of social norms. Situation 1 depicts a driver 2 ̆ 7 s license applicant who fails the driving test and the public official who asks him to pay a bribe to obtain the license. The subjects rated the actions of the officer asking for a bribe and also the conditional actions of the citizen accepting or rejecting the officer 2 ̆ 7 s bribe request. There were four actions: low, medium, and high bribe amounts and honest action of the officer. Situation 2 is framed from the perspective of the applicant. The driver 2 ̆ 7 s license applicant fails the driving test and offers a bribe to the public official to obtain the license. Situation 3 describes the exact situation the subjects encountered in Experiment 1. Here I obtained appropriateness ratings of the actions that the subjects encountered in Experiment 1. Situations 4 and 5 are similar to Situations 1 and 2 with one exception. To set reference points for the subjects, I provided the additional information that most officers at the drivers 2 ̆ 7 license office ask for a side payment if the applicant fails the driving test. This is the first experimental study that quantifies the social norms regarding bribe-giving and bribe-taking in India for a common corrupt situation. I found that social acceptability ratings are malleable to the amounts of bribes. Subjects are not able to coordinate on the socially acceptability ratings for lower amount of bribes. However, the higher bribe amounts are rated as socially inappropriate by the majority. In the socially acceptable treatment i. e. Situations 4 and 5, the social acceptability ratings of bribe giving and bribe taking were lower than in Situations 1 and 2. I found that bribe giving is more socially unacceptable than bribe taking in Situations 4 and 5. However, this difference is not significant in Situations 1 and 2. I also addressed a methodological concern arising from the experimental method used to measure the social norms regarding corruption for a particular situation (i. e., obtaining a driver 2 ̆ 7 s license in India). The participants of the norm experiment were the "workers 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 in Experiment 1. They participated in the unethical behavior experiment before eliciting the social norms. One criticism of this subject pool is that their views might have been biased. To address this concern, we conducted the norm experiment on a separate pool whose only role was to elicit the social norms. There was no difference in the description of vignettes and experimental procedures between the two subject pools. I found no difference in the norms elicitation between the two subject pools. For Chapters 1 and 2, I conducted my own experiments in India. For Chapter 3, I used the experimental data of Leider et al. (2009) to study the effects of social networks on non-cognitive skills, particularly self-confidence regarding one 2 ̆ 7 s ability. Recent research in psychology and economics has emphasized the importance of non-cognitive skills on labor market outcomes. We used economic experiments to measure participants 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about their expected relative performance in a real-effort task using an incentive-compatible mechanism for belief elicitation. We then combined these self-confidence measures with a unique dataset on the social network of the participants to investigate whether there are peer effects in confidence. We found that more confident participants tend to have more confident friends. Peer effects might be an important transmission mechanism for acquisition of self-confidence. We then divided our subjects into years at college and explored whether our finding was due to selection (confident participants choose confident friends) or social interaction (one 2 ̆ 7 s confidence is influenced by friends 2 ̆ 7 confidence). We found that the results are significant for seniors and juniors. However, to separate the treatment effect from the selection effect, we need to carefully design a longitudinal study where we follow a cohort of students through years at college. Therefore, this cross-sectional experimental data provide preliminary evidence of the treatment effect in peer effects. My dissertation research contributes to the literature in labor economics and experimental economics. To summarize, in the first chapter, I highlight the evidence of sorting based on propensity to engage in unethical behavior by public and private sector aspirants. The second chapter highlights the importance of social norms in corruption. In the third chapter, I study peer effects in non-cognitive skills. The findings of my first chapter provide evidence of self-selection into the public vs. private sector based on propensity to engage in unethical behavior. A caveat of this study is that the subjects were university students who were yet to join the public or private sector. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>future</b> <b>research,</b> I want to track the subjects and collect data on their real-life career choices. Findings of my second chapter suggest that when corruption is prominent, government policy should be targeted toward changing the social norms around corruption. Stronger legal enforcement of rules can help change the perception of corruption. My experimental design is not sufficient to separate the exact channel which leads to a higher mean rating for the social acceptability of bribe-giving and bribe-taking under socially acceptable treatment. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>future</b> <b>research,</b> I want to separate the effects of these channels. The findings of the third chapter provide evidence of peer effects in acquiring non-cognitive skills. I am now conducting a longitudinal experiment at the Indian Institute of Management, where I am following a cohort of management students for two years. This experiment will help us segregate the selection and treatment effect of peer effects not only in non-cognitive skills but also in other-regarding preferences and competitive preferences...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was a quasi-experimental case study involving {{the teaching of}} division to low attaining Grade 5 learners using variation theory. This area of study interested me because as a primary school mathematics teacher I found that many of my Grade 5, 6 and 7 learners struggled to understand the concepts of division and successfully solve division problems. I hoped that through this research I {{would be able to}} identify the key areas of difficulty and find ways to assist learners in overcoming these difficulties and prevent them from occurring in future teaching and learning. My research involved the entire Grade 5 group of learners at the school where I was teaching. However, the intervention was conducted with a small sample of six Grade 5 learners that were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> class {{at the time of the}} research. This {{research was}} planned and conducted within the theoretical framework of variation theory. Variation theory is based on the premise that “we learn from discerning variation, and what varies in our experiences influences what we learn” (Rowland, 2008, p. 153). Accordingly the focus of all teaching, within the intervention, including all materials and examples was on highlighting variation to promote teaching and learning. My research involved a pre-test that was conducted with all Grade 5 learners, an intervention which involved six low attaining learners, an immediate post-test that was only conducted with the intervention group, and a delayed post-test that was again conducted with the whole grade. The pre-test was used to establish common errors across the entire grade and answer the first research question of “What are the specific features that learners struggle to understand within the concepts and procedures associated with division at a Grade 5 level?”. I identified a range of errors across the grade and within the intervention group. All errors corresponded to those highlighted in the literature on division. The second research question was “How can variation theory be used to devise an intervention to improve learners’ understanding of the concepts and procedures of division?”. My research and intervention was based on my application of the principles of variation theory to key division concepts and procedures. Results suggested that I was able to highlight the variation between quotitive and partitive problems quite well. For example, I feel that by the end of the intervention learners were able to differentiate between quotitive and partitive problems, and for the most part solve them appropriately. However, I believe that I was unable to successfully highlight the variation in problems involving zero. This was illustrated when 7 learners were unable to work confidently with and solve problems involving zero. My recommendations include suggestions as to how this area of teaching could be improved <b>in</b> <b>future.</b> <b>My</b> final <b>research</b> question, “What are the effects of the intervention on learner performance in this area?” required me to reflect on the intervention and evaluate its overall success. The results suggested that overall the intervention had allowed the six learners to close the ‘gap’ to a small degree between themselves and their peers. This was confirmed by the post-test results where all learners improved on their pre-test results by on average, 13...|$|R

40|$|<b>My</b> {{research}} <b>in</b> {{computer architecture}} focuses on interconnection networks for scalable multi-core and distributed processor microarchitectures. Computer architecture bridges {{the gap between}} application and device technology. Application workloads have never been more compute intensive, meanwhile device constraints of power, heat, and reliability have recently forced the computer industry to shift focus from single processor core performance to instantiating multiple processor cores on each chip. As computer architecture enters the era of multi-core, intra-core communication becomes critical to achieve continued increasing system performance. As a graduate student I led the design, implementation and verification for the second level cache and inter-processor network-on-chip (NOC) on the TRIPS processor prototype [2].
