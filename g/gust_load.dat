If gust encoun-ters (as required by Certification Specification 25) are sizing conditions of parts of the airframe, this can be achieved (for example) by an active <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> alleviation system that reduces the <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> level down {{to the level of}} the next design condition, which might be the design loads from maneuver conditions. In order to design an efficient <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> alleviation system that respects the actuation constraints of the control surfaces, uses preview information on the incoming gust shape from a Light Detection And Ranging gust sensor and takes gust propagation delays into account, we apply model predictive control to an aeroservoelastic aircraft model...|$|E

Piezoelectric materials have been extensively used for active vibration control of engineering structures. In this paper, piezoelectric materials further attempt {{to suppress the}} vibration of the aeroelastic wing caused by gust. The motion equation of the flexible wing with piezoelectric patches is obtained by Hamilton’s principle with the modal approach, and then numerical gust responses are analyzed, based on which a <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> alleviation (GLA) control system is proposed. The <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> alleviation system employs classic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers which treat piezoelectric patches as control actuators and acceleration as the feedback signal. By a numerical method, the control mechanism that piezoelectric actuators {{can be used to}} alleviate gust-response loads is also analyzed qualitatively. Furthermore, through low-speed wind tunnel tests, the effectiveness of the <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> alleviation active control technology is validated. The test results agree well with the numerical results. Test results show that at a certain frequency range, the control scheme can effectively alleviate the z and x wingtip accelerations and the root bending moment of the wing to a certain extent.

Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the beneficial effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the quasi “Global Hawk” airfoil using arrays of jets during the gust process. Based on unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, the grid-velocity method is introduced to simulate the gust influence, and dynamic response in vertical gust flow perturbation is investigated for the airfoil as well. An unsteady surface transpiration boundary condition is enforced over a user specified portion of the airfoil's surface to emulate the time dependent velocity boundary conditions. Firstly, after applying this method to simulate typical NACA 0006 airfoil gust response to a step change in the angle of attack, it shows that the indicial responses of the airfoil make good agreement with the exact theoretical values and the calculated values in references. Furthermore, gust response characteristic for the quasi “Global Hawk” airfoil is analyzed. Five kinds of flow control techniques are introduced as steady blowing, steady suction, unsteady blowing, unsteady suction and synthetic jets. The physical analysis of the influence on the effects of <b>gust</b> <b>load</b> alleviation is proposed to provide some guidelines for practice.

Typically, the unsteady aerodynamics for <b>gust</b> <b>loads</b> are computed by the Doublet Lattice Method. However, this method {{does not account}} for effects, which are important from a flight dynamics and manoeuvre loads perspective. E. g., the roll-yaw coupling, also responsible for the flight mechanical eigenmodes like the dutch roll mode, are unaccounted for by the DLM. Since, the dutch roll mode might also be excited by lateral gusts, this might have an influence on the loads response. In this paper, the unsteady aerodynamics are computed by a 3 D panel method, capable of capturing the flight dynamics accurately and provide complex Aerodynamics Influence Coefficients for <b>gust</b> <b>loads</b> analysis as a function of reduced frequency similar to the DLM.
