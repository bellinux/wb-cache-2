50|$|The thrower's <b>gripper</b> <b>shoe</b> (with the non-slippery sole) is {{positioned}} {{against one of}} the hacks; for a right-handed curler the right foot is placed against the left hack and vice versa for a left-hander. The thrower, now in the hack, lines the body up with shoulders square to the skip's broom at the far end for line.|$|E
40|$|Damage by {{excessive}} vibration is serious engineering problem in TBM boring process. Dynamic characteristic analysis {{is essential for}} TBM antivibration design. According to TBM horizontal support structure, a dynamic coupling nonlinear model is established, with consideration of time-varying impact load and multicomponent complex relationship from cutter to <b>gripper</b> <b>shoe.</b> A set of field vibration tests is set up to accurately collect data under extreme work conditions; then, field data is collected from Liaoning northwest engineering. Field data is applied to validate simulation model to make sure time-varying damping stiffness, support cylinder stiffness, and the TBM machine stiffness distribution are reasonable. Simulation indicates the weakest part of TBM in axial and torsional DOF is the cylinder hinge and the connection shaft between motor and pinion, and the horizontal and vertical weak parts are bull gear. It also shows that, in normal excavation conditions, the acceleration amplitude of the cutterhead in three directions ranges from 1. 5 [*]g to 2 [*]g. These results provide theoretical basis for the antivibration design and structural optimization of TBM...|$|E
50|$|Open-type TBMs have no shield, {{leaving the}} area behind the cutter head open for rock support. To advance, the machine uses a gripper system that pushes against the tunnel walls. Not all {{machines}} can be continuously steered while <b>gripper</b> <b>shoes</b> push on the walls, {{as with a}} Wirth machine, which only steers while ungripped. The machine will then push forward off the grippers gaining thrust. At {{the end of a}} stroke, the rear legs of the machine are lowered, the grippers and propel cylinders are retracted. The retraction of the propel cylinders repositions the gripper assembly for the next boring cycle. The grippers are extended, the rear legs lifted, and boring resumes. The open-type, or Main Beam, TBM does not install concrete segments behind with other machines. Instead, the rock is held up using ground support methods such as ring beams, rock bolts, shotcrete, steel straps, ring steel and wire mesh.|$|R
5000|$|The slider is {{designed}} to slide and typically has a Teflon sole. It is worn by the thrower during delivery from the hack and by sweepers or the skip to glide down the ice when sweeping or otherwise traveling down the sheet quickly. Stainless steel was once common for slider soles, and [...] "red brick" [...] sliders with lateral blocks of PVC on the sole are also available. Most shoes have a full-sole sliding surface, but some shoes have a sliding surface covering only {{the outline of the}} shoe and other enhancements with the full-sole slider. Some shoes have small disc sliders covering the front and heel portions or only the front portion of the foot, which allow more flexibility in the sliding foot for curlers playing with tuck deliveries. When a player is not throwing, the player's slider shoe can be temporarily rendered non-slippery by using a slip-on <b>gripper.</b> Ordinary athletic <b>shoes</b> may be converted to sliders by using a step-on or slip-on Teflon slider or by applying electrical or gaffer tape directly to the sole or over a piece of cardboard. This arrangement often suits casual or beginning players.|$|R
