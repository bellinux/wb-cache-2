An analytic {{solution of the}} Biot–Savart law, {{which is used to}} calculate magnetic fields created by toroidal plasma current, is presented. Results of calculations are compared with the experimental data obtained in no-plasma shots with a toroidal current-carrying coil positioned inside the vessel to simulate the plasma movements. The results show a good linear behavior of plasma position measurements. An array of Mirnov coils employed for measurement of plasma position, too.

Measurements results of visible line emissions of O II, C III <b>impurities</b> and Hα <b>radiation</b> with and without RHF (L= 2) show that the addition of a relatively small amount of resonant magnetic helical field (L= 2 & L= 3) could be effective for improving the quality of the discharge by reducing of light <b>impurities</b> <b>radiation.</b> The effect of RHF in plasma displacement measurement shown an increase in flux value about % 5 for L= 2, L= 3 separately and about % 10 for L= 2 & 3 when apply together.

It is demonstrated that the current convective instability can be triggered in detached inner divertor plasma for the condition when outer divertor is still attached.

We have calculated the radiated power loss using a collisional radiative model for Be, B, C, Ne and Ar using a multiple configuration interaction model which includes density dependent effects, {{as well as a}} very detailed treatment of the energy levels and meta-stable levels. The "collisional radiative" effects are very important for Be at temperatures below 10 eV. The same effects are present for higher Z impurities, but not as strongly. For some of the lower Z elements, the new rates are about a factor of two lower than those from a widely used, simpler average-ion package (ADPAK) developed for high Z ions and for higher temperatures. Following the approach of Lengyel for the case where electron heat conduction is the dominant mechanism for heat transport along field lines, our analysis indicates that significant enhancements of the radiation losses above collisional radiative model rates due to such effects as rapid recycling and charge exchange recombination will be necessary for <b>impurity</b> <b>radiation</b> to reduce the peak heat loads on divertor plates for high heat flux experiments such as ITER.

The results of these experiments and calculations are the result of a complex interplay of many processes. In order to identify the key features of these experiments and calculations and the relative role of the primary atomic processes, simple quasi-analytic models and the latest atomic physics rate coefficients and cross sections have been used to assess the relative roles of central radiation losses through bremsstrahlung, <b>impurity</b> <b>radiation</b> losses from the plasma edge, charge exchange and hydrogen radiation losses from the scrape-off layer and divertor plasma and <b>impurity</b> <b>radiation</b> losses from the divertor plasma.

Such events occur only when the ground is snow covered, due to the impacts of snow on the stability and depth of the boundary layer and ultraviolet actinic flux at the surface. Recycling of reactive nitrogen from the photolysis of snow nitrate has been observed in polar and mid-latitude snow, but snow-sourced reactive nitrogen fluxes in mid-latitude regions have not yet been quantified in the field.
