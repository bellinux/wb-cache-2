5|$|Circulatory system: The osmotic {{pressure}} of the <b>hemolymph</b> of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95mOsm. That is much lower value than in marine snails in the subfamily Neritinae. The {{osmotic pressure}} and the composiotion of ionts of the <b>hemolymph</b> of the subfamily Neritininae (where does the Theodoxus belong to) {{is similar to the}} <b>hemolymph</b> of the land snail family Helicinidae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hemolymph</b> usually lacks any {{respiratory}} pigment, although {{members of}} the families Arcidae and Limidae are known to possess haemoglobin dissolved directly into the serum. In the carnivorous genus Poromya, the <b>hemolymph</b> has red amoebocytes containing a haemoglobin pigment.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in <b>hemolymph.</b> The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps <b>hemolymph</b> into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} <b>hemolymph</b> rather than blood. As in other insects, a {{segmented}} tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel. It has paired inlets or ostia at intervals down its length, and circulates the <b>hemolymph</b> from the main cavity of the haemocoel and out through the anterior cavity in the head.|$|E
5|$|The green huntsman spider {{is green}} {{due to the}} {{presence}} of bilin pigments in the spider's <b>hemolymph</b> (circulatory system fluids) and tissue fluids. It hunts insects in green vegetation, where it is well camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, <b>hemolymph</b> can flow into the wings.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some <b>hemolymph</b> before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|The insect {{circulatory system}} {{utilizes}} <b>hemolymph,</b> a tissue analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of the insect body, while remaining in direct contact with the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open circulatory system of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s <b>hemolymph</b> when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using <b>hemolymph</b> waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the known}} species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from a single record from a single host. Over 94% of species are {{associated}} with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can {{be considered to be}} specific parasites of birds. The fleas on birds are thought to have originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the <b>hemolymph</b> (bloodlike body fluid) of ticks.|$|E
5|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on {{honey bees}} by consuming their <b>hemolymph.</b> Varroa mites parasitize {{all types of}} honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on all types of honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the <b>hemolymph,</b> arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex {{share similar}} {{behaviours}} with other Myrmeciinae relatives. Prionomyrmex may have foraged {{on the ground}} or onto trees and low vegetation, feeding on nectar and arthropods. Nothomyrmecia workers, however, drink <b>hemolymph</b> from the insects they capture, and the larvae are carnivorous. It is not known if the ants were active during the day or night, but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers very cold nights. Both ants have large compound eyes, relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes. Due to their primitive and simplified social life, workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones, suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers. Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female stylopid parasites. Predators are unknown for both ants.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with <b>hemolymph</b> and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemolymph</b> fills {{all of the}} {{interior}} hemocoel {{of the body and}} surrounds all cells. <b>Hemolymph</b> is composed of water, inorganic salts (mostly sodium, chlorine, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic compounds (mostly carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The primary oxygen transporter molecule is hemocyanin.|$|E
25|$|There are {{free-floating}} cells, the hemocytes, {{within the}} <b>hemolymph.</b> They {{play a role}} in the arthropod immune system.|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature that}} sets S.coleoptrata {{apart from other}} centipedes is that their <b>hemolymph</b> was found to contain {{proteins}} for transporting oxygen.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} other complex life forms, blood and lymph {{circulate}} {{in two different}} systems, the circulatory system and lymphatic system, which are enclosed by systems of capillaries, veins, arteries, and nodes. This {{is known as a}} closed circulatory system. Insects, however, have an open circulatory system in which blood and lymph circulate unenclosed, and mix to form a substance called <b>hemolymph.</b> All organs of the insect are bathed in <b>hemolymph,</b> which provides oxygen and nutrients to all of the insect's organs.|$|E
25|$|Like other insect species, beetles have <b>hemolymph</b> {{instead of}} blood. The open circulatory {{system of the}} beetle is driven by a tube-like heart {{attached}} to the top inside of the thorax.|$|E
25|$|The {{successive}} woundings each require {{energy to}} heal, leaving less energy available for other activities. Also, the wounds provide a possible point of infection which {{can reduce the}} female's lifespan. Once in the <b>hemolymph,</b> the sperm and ejaculatory fluids may act as antigens, triggering an immune reaction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hemolymph</b> toxins {{originate}} from autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the <b>hemolymph</b> toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E
25|$|In the circulatory system, <b>hemolymph,</b> or insect blood, {{is used to}} {{circulate}} heat in a form of thermoregulation, where muscles contraction produces heat, which is transferred {{to the rest of}} the body when conditions are unfavorable. In lepidopteran species, <b>hemolymph</b> is circulated through the veins in the wings by some form of pulsating organ, either by the heart or by the intake of air into the trachea. Air is taken in through spiracles along the sides of the abdomen and thorax supplying the trachea with oxygen as it goes through the lepidopteran's respiratory system. There are three different tracheae supplying oxygen diffusing oxygen throughout the species body: The dorsal, ventral, and visceral. The dorsal tracheae supply oxygen to the dorsal musculature and vessels, while the ventral tracheae supply the ventral musculature and nerve cord, and the visceral tracheae supply the guts, fat bodies, and gonads.|$|E
25|$|In reflex bleeding, insects dispel their blood, <b>hemolymph,</b> or {{a mixture}} of exocrine {{secretions}} and blood as a defensive maneuver. As previously mentioned, the discharged blood may contain toxins produced within the insect source or externally from plants that the insect consumed. Reflexive bleeding occurs in specific parts of the body; for example, the beetle families Coccinellidae (ladybugs) and Meloidae bleed from the knee joints.|$|E
25|$|Nectar is {{collected}} by foraging worker bees {{as a source}} of water and carbohydrates in the form of sucrose. The dominant monosaccharides in honey bee diets are fructose and glucose but the most common circulating sugar in <b>hemolymph</b> is trehalose which is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules. Adult worker honey bees require 4mg of utilizable sugars per day and larvae require about 59.4mg of carbohydrates for proper development.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate and the cuticle may be thicker and more heavily sclerotized. Within each of the major veins is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, <b>hemolymph</b> can flow into the wings. Also, the wing lumen, being {{an extension of the}} hemocoel, contains the tracheae, nerves, and <b>hemolymph.</b> As the wing develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed over most of their area, forming the wing membrane. The remaining areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Hairs of two types may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
25|$|Most arachnids lack {{extensor}} {{muscles in}} the distal joints of their appendages. Spiders and whipscorpions extend their limbs hydraulically using the pressure of their <b>hemolymph.</b> Solifuges and some harvestmen extend their knees {{by the use of}} highly elastic thickenings in the joint cuticle. Scorpions, pseudoscorpions and some harvestmen have evolved muscles that extend two leg joints (the femur-patella and patella-tibia joints) at once. The equivalent joints of the pedipalps of scorpions though, are extended by elastic recoil.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} O. noveboracense to {{transmit}} microorganisms {{has also been}} researched. In one study {{it was confirmed that}} medically true bacteria were found in the midgut, hindgut, and associated <b>hemolymph.</b> Even though these bacteria were isolated, it is only hypothesized that they may serve as a reservoir host. Further research could determine whether O. noveboracense is able to actually transmit the bacteria present. More succession studies may be able to narrow the time frame at which this beetle is attracted to carrion.|$|E
25|$|In invertebrates, pattern {{recognition}} proteins (PRPs) trigger proteolytic cascades that degrade proteins and control {{many of the}} mechanisms of the innate immune system of invertebrates—including <b>hemolymph</b> coagulation and melanization. Proteolytic cascades are important components of the invertebrate immune system because they are turned on more rapidly than other innate immune reactions {{because they do not}} rely on gene changes. Proteolytic cascades have been found to function the same in both vertebrate and invertebrates, even though different proteins are used throughout the cascades.|$|E
25|$|Less {{is known}} about {{secondary}} endosymbionts. The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is known to contain at least three secondary endosymbionts, Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella insecticola, and Serratia symbiotica. H. defensa aids in defending the insect from parasitoids. Sodalis glossinidius is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and <b>hemolymph.</b> Phylogenetic studies have not indicated a correlation between evolution of Sodalis and tsetse. Unlike tsetse's P-symbiont Wigglesworthia, though, Sodalis has been cultured in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{classify}} insect endosymbionts in {{two broad}} categories, 'Primary' and 'Secondary'. Primary endosymbionts (sometimes {{referred to as}} P-endosymbionts) {{have been associated with}} their insect hosts for many millions of years (from 10 to several hundred million years in some cases). They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the <b>hemolymph</b> of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.|$|E
25|$|The mesospermalege is a sac {{attached}} to the inner abdomen, under the ectospermalege. Sperm is injected through the male's penis into the mesospermalege. In some species, the ectospermalege directly connects to the ovaries – thus, sperm and ejaculate never enters the <b>hemolymph</b> and thus never trigger an immune reaction. (The exact characteristics of the spermalege vary widely across different species of bed bugs.) The spermalege are generally found only in females. However, males in the Afrocimex genus possess an ectospermalege. Sperm remains in the spermalege for approximately four hours; after two days, none remains.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs using {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide via their cells. Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced; it has no closed vessels (i.e., no veins or arteries), consisting of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically, and in doing so helps circulate the <b>hemolymph</b> inside the body cavity.|$|E
25|$|Fungi {{that attack}} aphids include Neozygites fresenii, Entomophthora, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, and entomopathogenic fungi such as Lecanicillium lecanii. Aphids brush against the {{microscopic}} spores. These spores {{stick to the}} aphid, germinate, and penetrate the aphid's skin. The fungus grows in the aphid <b>hemolymph</b> (i.e., the counterpart of blood for aphids). After about 3nbsp&days, the aphid dies and the fungus releases more spores into the air. Infected aphids are covered with a woolly mass that progressively grows thicker until the aphid is obscured. Often, the visible fungus is {{not the type of}} fungus that killed the aphid, but a secondary fungus.|$|E
25|$|Insects, like {{nearly every}} other {{organism}} on Earth, {{are subject to}} infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. These encounters can either kill the insect or greatly weaken it. Insects protect themselves against these detrimental microorganisms in two ways. Firstly, the body-enveloping chitin cuticle, {{in conjunction with the}} tracheal system and the gut lining, serve as major physical barriers to entry. Secondly, <b>hemolymph</b> itself {{plays a key role in}} repairing external wounds as well as destroying foreign organisms within the body cavity. Interestingly, insects, along with having passive immunity, also show evidence of acquired immunity.|$|E
25|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using <b>hemolymph</b> waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
