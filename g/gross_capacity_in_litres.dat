40|$|Objective: To examine {{associations}} over longitudinal measurements between neuromusculoskeletal {{function and}} <b>gross</b> motor <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> {{children and youth}} with cerebral palsy (CP). Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: Rehabilitation departments of university medical centers and rehabilitations centers. Participants: A sample (N= 327) consisting of 148 children (aged 5 - 9 y) and 179 youth (aged 11 - 20 y) with CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System level I (n= 180), level II (n= 44), level III (n= 36), level IV (n= 34), and level V (n= 33). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: <b>Gross</b> motor <b>capacity</b> was assessed with the Gross Motor Function Measure- 66 {{over a period of}} 2 to 4 years in different age cohorts. Neuromusculoskeletal function included selective motor control (SMC), muscle strength, spasticity, and range of motion (ROM) of the lower extremities. Results: Multilevel analyses showed that SMC was significantly associated with <b>gross</b> motor <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> children and youth with CP, showing higher values and a more favorable course of <b>gross</b> motor <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> those with better SMC. Strength was only associated with <b>gross</b> motor <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> youth. Reduced ROM of hip (children) and knee extension (youth) and spasticity of the hip adductors (youth) were additionally-but more weakly-associated with lower values and a less favorable course of <b>gross</b> motor <b>capacity.</b> Conclusions: Results indicate that children and youth with more severely impaired SMC and youth with reduced muscle strength have a less favorable course of <b>gross</b> motor <b>capacity,</b> while spasticity and reduced ROM are less determinative...|$|R

The {{race was}} held on 1 October 1972 at the Mount Panorama Circuit just outside Bathurst in New South Wales, Australia. Cars competed in four classes defined by Capacity Price Units, where the engine <b>capacity,</b> expressed <b>in</b> <b>litres</b> (to three decimal places), was multiplied by the purchase price in Australian dollars {{to arrive at a}} CP value for each vehicle. It was the 13th running of the Bathurst 500 race and the last to be held over the original distance of 500 miles. It was also the last to allow drivers to compete for the full distance without a relief driver. The race was the third round of the 1972 Australian Manufacturers' Championship.|$|R
5000|$|Rihand dam is a {{concrete}} gravity dam with {{a length of}} 934.21 m. The maximum height of the dam is 91.44 m and was constructed during period 1954-62.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this studywas to {{investigate}} disease specific and respiratory function measures that may influence physical activity levels and exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> people with Huntington’s disease. Relevance: Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition resulting in motor, cognitive and behavioural dysfunction. As with Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis,physiotherapy management focuses on maintaining functional ability as long as possible. Ability to function and participate in activities of daily life will depend upon the pathophysiology of the condition as well as respiratory function. There is limited evidence concerning factors that influence physical activity levels and exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> people with HD. The {{results of this study}} will enable physiotherapists to use an evidence-based approach to the assessment and management of patients’ problems. Participants: Eighteen (7 female; mean (SD) age 51. 2 (13. 6) patients with HD were selected from a HD research and management clinic. Inclusion criteria were: symptomatic of HD;able to walk with or without assistance. Methods: A cross-sectional observational method was used. Descriptive data collected were: age; total functional capacity (TFC) from standardised questionnaire. Dependant variables measured were: physical activity level (MET-minutes/week) from International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form; exercise capacity (meters) measured by six minute walk test (6 MWT). Independent variables measured were: Forced Vital <b>Capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>litres</b> (FVC), a global measure of respiratory function measured following American Thoracic Society Guidelines; Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale-Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS), a disease specific measure of motor function. Analysis: Data were analysed using Pearson’s correlations and where appropriate stepwise linear regression. Results: Descriptive data of all variables are as follows: mean (SD) TFC was 4. 35 (2. 4) (available range 0 – 14, higher scores indicate greater functional level); IPAQ median 328 MET-minutes/week (low activity level); 6 MWT mean (SD) was 191. 95 meters (105. 78); UHDRS-TMS mean (SD) 61. 73 (12. 02) (available range 0 – 120, higher scores indicating decreased motor function); FVC mean (SD) 2. 19 L (1. 00). FVC correlated with 6 MWTand IPAQ (r = 0. 44, 0. 61 respectively); UHDRS correlated negatively with 6 MWT and IPAQ (r =− 0. 63, r =− 0. 42 respectively). Linear regression results: UHDRS-TMS predicted 6 MWT (R 2 = 0. 40, 6 MWT= 536. 1 – 5. 6 (UHDRS-TMS), FVC was excluded; FVC predicted IPAQ (R 2 = 0. 37, IPAQ=− 135. 2 + 225. 6 (FVC), UHDRS-TMS was excluded. Conclusions: In patients with HD, 6 MWT is more influenced by UHDRS-TMS than respiratory function, however respiratory function predicted self-reported physical activity level. Slow gait due to motor function impairment may curtail 6 MWTcompletion, while respiratory function may limit daily activities. Based on this study, it appears that the ability to function and participate in activities is multifactorial which requires consideration for physiotherapy management of people with neurodegenerative conditions. The results of this study are limited to patients who reported low activity levels and lowTFC scores; but are part of a larger study which will increase the power of the study. Implications: Ability to function and participate in activities is dependent on underlying disease process and respiratory function, and both elements should be considered when assessing and developing management strategies for people with neurodegenerative conditions...|$|R
