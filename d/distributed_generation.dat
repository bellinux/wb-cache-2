5|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>generation</b> from {{renewable}} resources is increasing {{as a consequence}} of the increased awareness of climate change. The electronic interfaces required to connect renewable generation units with the utility system can include additional functions, such as the active filtering to enhance the power quality.|$|E
5|$|National grids {{are usually}} {{tailored}} towards {{the operation of}} centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is commercially viable. This applies to <b>distributed</b> <b>generation</b> as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more <b>distributed</b> <b>generation,</b> or rooftop solar.|$|E

With the growing popularity of the <b>Distributed</b> <b>Generations</b> in the recent world it is required to determine the optimal location and size of the <b>Distributed</b> <b>generations</b> along with the reduction of the loss, improvement of Voltage Profile and reliability at lowest cost. For this different types of optimization techniques are used such as Firefly Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, BFO, PSO, Artificial Bee Colony, Clonal Selection Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization etc. This population based optimization techniques are more flexible and fast optimization methods...|$|R

30|$|Microgrid {{technology}} {{has provided a}} new technical approach for the large-scale integration of renewable energy and <b>distributed</b> <b>generations,</b> as well as technical support for the grid-connected operation of <b>distributed</b> <b>generations</b> {{to meet the requirements}} of smart grid. However, power quality problem is a prominent challenge for microgrid. On one hand, {{there are a variety of}} <b>distributed</b> <b>generations</b> and nonlinear fluctuating loads in microgrid. Especially the output power of wind turbines and photovoltaic cells has the trait of fluctuation, randomness and intermittent. This may lead to the unbalanced power between microsources and loads. On the other hand, the extensive use of power electronic devices such as grid-connected inverters, solid state switches and electric vehicle charging devices deteriorates the power quality indices. The research on power quality in microgrid has important theoretical and practical significance.|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{power plant}} (VPP) is an {{aggregation}} of multiple <b>distributed</b> <b>generations,</b> energy storage, and controllable loads. Affected by natural conditions, the uncontrollable <b>distributed</b> <b>generations</b> within VPP, such as wind and photovoltaic generations, are extremely random and relative. Considering the randomness and its correlation of uncontrollable <b>distributed</b> <b>generations,</b> this paper constructs the chance constraints stochastic optimal dispatch of VPP including stochastic variables and its random correlation. The probability distributions of independent wind and photovoltaic generations are described by empirical distribution functions, and their joint probability density model is established by Frank-copula function. And then, sample average approximation (SAA) {{is applied to}} convert the chance constrained stochastic optimization model into a deterministic optimization model. Simulation cases are calculated based on the AIMMS. Simulation results of this paper mathematic model are compared {{with the results of}} deterministic optimization model without stochastic variables and stochastic optimization considering stochastic variables but not random correlation. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how SAA sampling frequency and the confidence level influence the results of stochastic optimization. The numerical example results show the effectiveness of the stochastic optimal dispatch of VPP considering the randomness and its correlations of <b>distributed</b> <b>generations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Large {{amount of}} such {{renewable}} energy generations as wind/photovoltaic generations {{directly connected to}} grid acting as <b>distributed</b> <b>generations</b> will cause control, protection, security, and safety problems. Microgrid, which has advantages in usage and control of <b>distributed</b> <b>generations,</b> is a promising approach to coordinate the conflict between <b>distributed</b> <b>generations</b> and the grid. Regarded as mobile power storages, batteries of electric vehicles can depress the fluctuation of power through the {{point of common coupling}} of microgrid. This paper presents a control strategy for microgrid containing renewable energy generations and electric vehicles. The control strategy uses current control for renewable energy generations under parallel-to-grid mode, and uses master-slave control under islanding mode. Simulations and laboratory experiments prove that the control strategy works well for microgrid containing renewable energy generations and electric vehicles and provides maximum power output of renewable energy and a stable and sustainable running under islanding mode...|$|R

25|$|Distributed {{generation}}—sometimes {{known as}} 'dispersed' or 'embedded' generation {{when referring to}} small-scale wind generation—generally describes only renewable electricity sources with capacities less than 10 MW. Technologies often associated with <b>distributed</b> <b>generation</b> include cogeneration—also known as {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) generation—as well as micro-turbines, fuel cells, and gas generators used for on-site or emergency backup power.|$|E
25|$|Renewables {{can also}} be {{considered}} distributed technologies, depending on their application. Typically, community wind farms, solar photovoltaic arrays, geothermal installations, and biomass-fuelled power facilities are typically sufficiently limited in their generation capacity that they qualify as distributed energy sources. Conversely, large hydropower plants and offshore wind parks, with substantial production capacities of 50–100 MW or more which feed into high-voltage transmission grids, cannot be considered <b>distributed</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{hydrogen}} {{station is}} a storage or filling station for hydrogen, usually located along a road or hydrogen highway, {{or at home}} {{as part of the}} <b>distributed</b> <b>generation</b> resources concept. The stations are usually intended to power hydrogen vehicles, but {{can also be used to}} power small devices. Vehicles use hydrogen as fuel in one of several ways, including fuel cells and mixed fuels like HCNG. The hydrogen fuel dispensers dispense the fuel by the kilogram.|$|E
25|$|Electricity {{supplies}} can {{be classified}} as either distributed or centralized in nature. Whereas conventional, centralized generation involves few generation facilities connected via high-voltage transmission lines spanning long distances, <b>distributed</b> <b>generation</b> facilities are located close to the load—or in technical speak, on the customer side of the meter—although not necessarily restricted to local uses. In this scheme, distributed energy sources are more numerous and sufficiently smaller than central generating plants so as to allow interconnection at nearly any point in the electricity system.|$|E
25|$|Cogeneration can {{be applied}} to any fuel which is combusted for energy. Fossil fuels, biomass and biogas can all be used in CHP plants. Transporting heat over long {{distances}} is impractical, so cogeneration plants are usually small and located close to the energy load. Hence, cogeneration is inherently linked to <b>distributed</b> <b>generation.</b> The urban location of CHP plants makes them very compatible with clean-burning fuels such as natural gas. The health concerns associated with other fossil fuels (see coal above) make them less suitable for areas with high population densities.|$|E

25|$|No vendor {{has made}} money selling power reactors. This is the {{greatest}} failure of any enterprise in the industrial history of the world. We don’t mean that as a criticism of nuclear power’s practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, <b>distributed</b> <b>generation</b> (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{cumulative}} PV {{capacity in the}} U.S., there has been growth in the <b>distributed</b> <b>generation</b> segment, which are all grid-connected PV installations in the residential and non-residential markets. Non-residential market includes installations on commercial, government, school and non-profit organization properties. Between 2000 and 2013 there had been 2,261 MW of residential solar and 4,051 MW non-residential solar installed. In 2013, there were 1,913 MW installed for these markets; the top 5 states were California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Arizona. The residential market had 60% annual growth in 2013. The growth contributing factors were new marketing strategies to partner with retailers to reach more customers, and new financial models including the securitization of residential solar assets. Non-residential PV had a slight growth of 4% in 2013 as the market was recovering from the oversupply in 2012. The future growth will likely come from New York, Arizona, and Colorado.|$|E

As of the end of 2016, the U.S. had 40 gigawatts (GW) of installed photovoltaic capacity, having almost doubled in capacity from the previous year. In the twelve months through August 2017, utility scale solar power generated 49.0 terawatt-hours (TWh), 1.22% of total U.S. electricity. During the same time period total solar generation, including estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation, was 72.1 TWh, 1.80% of total U.S. electricity. In terms of total installed capacity, by year end 2015 the U.S. ranked 4th in the world behind China, Germany, and Japan. In 2016, 39% of all new electricity generation capacity in the country came from solar, more than any other source and ahead of natural gas (29%).
