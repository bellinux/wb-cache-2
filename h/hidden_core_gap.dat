40|$|PSR B 1821 - 24 is {{a solitary}} {{millisecond}} pulsar (MSP) which radiates multi-wavelength pulsed photons. It has complex radio, X-ray and γ-ray pulse profiles with distinct peak phase-separations that challenge the traditional caustic emission models. Using the single-pole annular gap model with suitable magnetic inclination angle (α= 40 ^∘) and viewing angle (ζ= 75 ^∘), {{we managed to}} reproduce its pulse profiles of three wavebands. It is found that the middle radio peak is originated from the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region at high altitudes, {{and the other two}} radio peaks are originated from the annular gap region at relatively low altitudes. Two peaks of both X-ray and γ-ray wavebands are fundamentally originated from annular gap region, while the γ-ray emission generated from the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region contributes somewhat to the first γ-ray peak. Precisely reproducing the multi-wavelength pulse profiles of PSR B 1821 - 24 enables us to understand emission regions of distinct wavebands and justify pulsar emission models.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the three-dimensional (3 D) annular gap model with reasonable parameters (the magnetic inclination angle α = 45 deg and the view angle ζ = 63 deg), we first use the latest hight energy data to self-consistently calculate radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV (MAGIC and VERITAS) light curves, phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra for the Crab pulsar. It is found that the acceleration electric field and potential in the annular <b>gap</b> and <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> are huge enough in the several tens of neutron star radii. The pulsed emission of radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV are mainly generated from the emission of primary particles or secondary particles with different emission mechanisms in the nearly similar region of the annular gap located in the only one magnetic pole, which leads to the nearly "phase-aligned" multi-wavelength light curves. The emission of peak 1 (P 1) and peak 2 (P 2) is originated from the annular gap region near the null charge surface, while the emission of bridge is mainly originated from the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region. The phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra of the Crab pulsar from soft X-ray to TeV band are produced by four components: synchrotron radiation from CR-induced and ICS-induced pairs dominates the X-ray band to soft gamma-ray band (100 eV to 10 MeV); curvature radiation and synchrotron radiation from the primary particles mainly contribute to gamma-ray band (10 MeV to ∼ 20 GeV); ICS from the pairs significantly contributes to the TeV gamma-ray band (∼ 20 GeV to 400 GeV). The multi-wavelength pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar has been well modeled with the annular <b>gap</b> and <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> model.

40|$|The Vela pulsar {{represents}} a distinct group of γ-ray pulsars. Fermi γ-ray observations reveal {{that it has}} two sharp peaks (P 1 and P 2) in the light curve with a phase separation of 0. 42 and a third peak (P 3) in the bridge. The location and intensity of P 3 are energy-dependent. We use the 3 D magnetospheric model for the annular <b>gap</b> and <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> to simulate the γ-ray light curves, phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra. We found that the acceleration electric field along a field line in the annular gap region decreases with heights. The emission at high energy GeV band is originated from the curvature radiation of accelerated primary particles, while the synchrotron radiation from secondary particles have some contributions to low energy γ-ray band (0. 1 - 0. 3 GeV). The γ-ray light curve peaks P 1 and P 2 are generated in the annular gap region near the altitude of null charge surface, whereas P 3 and the bridge emission is generated in the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region. The intensity and location of P 3 at different energy bands depend on the emission altitudes. The radio emission from the Vela pulsar should be generated in a high-altitude narrow regions of the annular gap, {{which leads to a}} radio phase lag of 0. 13 prior to the first γ-ray peak.

In spite of a mid-latitudinal palaeolatitude (c. 40 a S) the sequence, deposited between the early Paleocene and Middle Eocene, contains all planktic foraminiferal Zones PIc through PIO of the current global scheme for tropical locations, except for Subzone P 4 b.

40|$|A new {{drifting}} pulsar, PSR J 0815 + 09, {{was discovered}} in the Arecibo driftscan searches (McLaughlin et al. 2004). An intriguing feature of this source is that within the four pulse components in the integrated pulse profile, the subpulse drifting direction in the two leading components is opposite from that in the two trailing components. In view that the leading theoretical model (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975) for pulsar sub-pulse drifting can only interpret one-direction sub-pulse drifting, the observed bi-drifting phenomenon from PSR J 0815 + 09 poses a great challenge to the pulsar theory. The inner annular gap (IAG), {{a new type of}} inner particle accelerator, was recently proposed to explain both γ-ray and radio emission from pulsars (Qiao et al. 2004). Here we show that the coexistence of the IAG and the conventional inner <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> (ICG) offers a natural interpretation to the bi-drifting phenomenon.

40|$|Overhead {{high voltage}} power line (HVPL) online {{monitoring}} equipment is playing an increasingly important role in smart grids, but the power supply is an obstacle to such systems’ stable and safe operation, so in this work a hybrid wireless power supply system, integrated with inductive energy harvesting and wireless power transmitting, is proposed. The energy harvesting device extracts energy from the HVPL and transfers that from the power line to monitoring equipment on transmission towers by transmitting and receiving coils, which are in a magnetically coupled resonant configuration. In this paper, the optimization design of online energy harvesting devices is analyzed emphatically by taking both HVPL insulation distance and wireless power supply efficiency into account. It is found that essential parameters contributing to more extracted energy include large core inner radius, core radial thickness, core height and small <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> within the threshold constraints. In addition, there is an optimal secondary coil turn that can maximize extracted energy when other parameters remain fixed.

The main goal of our {{project is to}} investigate the amount of convective core overshoot necessary to reproduce the CMDs of relatively metal-poor, intermediate age stellar populations, to check whether the extrapolation that is usually made from solar metallicity is valid.

Our method involved the comparison of the observed CMDs with synthetic CMDs computed using various values of the overshoot parameter and binary fraction. We conclude that a moderate amount of overshoot and some fraction of binary stars are essential for reproducing the observed shapes around the turnoff in the CMD’s of all three clusters: unresolved binary stars fill in the expected <b>core</b> contraction <b>gap,</b> and make a unique sequence near the gap, which cannot be reproduced by single stars alone, even with a larger amount of overshoot.

The three basic styles of patient acceptance are random, selective, and universal. Reduced public access to care results from the practice of random and selective acceptance. Only universal acceptance creates a potential pathway for improved access to care. The notion of Universal Patient Acceptance (UPA) is discussed here as one kind of applied ethical tool or clinical practice that allows for the ethic of acceptance to be more effectively pursued in daily practice. We suggest that health providers falsely surmise that they already understand and practice Universal Patient Acceptance. That myth and per-spective are partly what keeps Acceptance hidden as an ethic and overlooked as a potential way to foster dialogue and indirectly promote better access to care. Without Universal Patient Acceptance, dental and health providers will continue to silently engage in practice patterns that adversely affect public access to care.
