Two new methods are presented for the determination of paleoeurrent directions from the more common ex-posure types [...] namely, the use <b>of</b> three-dimensional <b>exposures</b> <b>of</b> oblique cuts through individual trough limbs, and two-dimensional <b>exposures</b> <b>of</b> sets of trough cross-strata. Three-dimensional <b>exposures</b> <b>of</b> trough limbs can be measured and treated statistically on a stereographic plot to determine the average trough-axis orientation. In two-dimensional <b>exposures,</b> characteristic asymmetry <b>of</b> the basal scour surface and truncation of foreset laminae can aid in estimation, within about 25 °, of paleocun'ent direction...|$|R
5|$|Boron nitride nanomesh is a nanostructured {{two-dimensional}} material.

5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. <b>Exposure</b> <b>of</b> the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E

5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success.

Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard. There are several exclusive species in the national park, including , Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula.

5|$|Once in space, sudden <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> {{unprotected}} {{humans to}} very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} is the <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> whiter subsurface layers by impacts; {{another is that}} the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
