5|$|The rebels, {{heading for}} Warminster <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Trowbridge, but royalist forces {{cut off the}} route and Monmouth turned back towards Somerset through Shepton Mallet, {{arriving}} in Wells on 1 July. The soldiers damaged the Bishop's Palace and west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the roof to make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, {{and for a time}} stabling their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E

5|$|Resistance {{against the}} Spanish continued, and hostile Ch'ol killed several newly baptised Christian Indians. In early March 1696 {{such was the}} success of the friars that captain Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians decided to try to reach Lake Petén Itzá. They headed eastwards towards the Pasión River with 150 heavily armed {{soldiers}} plus native guides, travelling in five large canoes. They <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the savannah to the southeast of the lake before turning back for unknown reasons. Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Lympne was {{the start}} and finish for several record attempts. Wing Commander E. R. Manning left for India in a Westland Widgeon in 1923, but only <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Baghdad. In 1930 the Fokker F VIIA (G-EBTS) The Spider flown by Charles Douglas Barnard and R F Little, with Mary Russell, Duchess of Bedford as passenger, left Lympne for Maitland Airport, Cape Town, which was reached in a record 100 hours. In 1931 C.W.A. Scott set a UK-Australia record in a DH.60 (G-ABHY). On the return he landed at Lympne in the {{aircraft}} which had been re-registered VH-UQA. Also in 1931 Glen Kitson and Owen Cathcart-Jones left Lympne bound for Cape Town in a Lockheed DL-1 Vega Special. Cape Town was reached in 6 days, 10 hours. On 31 October C. Arthur Butler flew from Lympne to Darwin in a Comper Swift (G-ABRE), beating C.W.A. Scott's record by 102 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Texas A got {{the ball}} to start the game and marched down the field on an 8-play, 75-yard drive that culminated {{in the first of}} Manziel's two rushing touchdowns, the first of which went for 23 yards. Oklahoma took over at their own 25 yardline after a touchback on the kickoff. Jones was 6/8 for 43 yards passing on the drive. The Sooners <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> second and goal at the one yardline prior to two failed plays and a false start penalty that set up a 23-yard field goal to make the score 7–3 Texas A The drive totaled 16 plays and 69 yards in 5:43.

5|$|The German advance never {{recovered}} from its initial delay, and Kampfgruppe Peiper only <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Stoumont, where the remaining vehicles {{ran out of}} fuel and came under heavy attack from American aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Having advanced less than half-way to the River Meuse, {{they were forced to}} abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town, including six Tiger II tanks. The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (including 30 Tiger IIs), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through the brush at night, trying to get back to their own line.|$|E
5|$|The advance {{began at}} 5:00 am on 25 August {{under the cover}} of fog. Despite German {{artillery}} fire on the front lines, this caused relatively few casualties amongst the New Zealanders. In the south, the 1st Infantry Brigade's 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions skirted the southern side of Bapaume, taking fire from machine-gun posts {{on the outskirts of the}} town. They <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the Albert Road but the 63rd Division's advance was slowed by strong defence at the village of Thilloy, to the southeast of Bapaume. By the end of the day, this left the two New Zealand battalions exposed on both flanks. The New Zealanders dug in and conducted fighting patrols for the rest of the day. From several German prisoners it was determined that the 220th Prussian and 7th Bavarian Divisions were defending Bapaume.|$|E
5|$|The first Jesuit {{reduction}} in the Chiquitania was the mission of San Francisco Xavier, founded in 1691 by the Jesuit priest Fr. José de Arce. In September 1691, de Arce and Br. Antonio de Rivas intended to meet seven other Jesuits at the Paraguay River to establish a connection between Paraguay and Chiquitos. However, {{the beginning of the}} rainy season brought bad weather, and Arce and his companion only <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the first native village. The local Piñoca tribe, who were suffering from a plague, begged Arce and Rivas to stay and promised to build a house and a church for the Jesuits, which were finished by the end of year. The mission was later moved a number of times until 1708 when it was established in its present location.|$|E

5|$|The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments {{posted on}} the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, {{captured}} the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward {{a gap in the}} Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers {{in this part of the}} line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him if he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was part}} of 1st Parachute Brigade, which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General F.A.M. Browning. In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid, and <b>got</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being good weather {{on the day of the}} raid. In midSeptember, as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that an American airborne unit, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was to be used during the invasion, Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included. He argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by crossposting personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November 1942.|$|E
