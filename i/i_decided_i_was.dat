500|$|Koufax tried {{one more}} year of {{baseball}} and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years. Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E
500|$|The {{second of}} four daughters of a well-to-do dental surgeon and a housewife, Neila Balendra {{was born in}} 1938 in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). She began dancing {{at the age of}} five, and trained in the {{classical}} Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri at the Shanti Kumar School of Dance and the Kalaya School of Dance in Colombo. In 1954, she won the gold medal at the All-Ceylon Dance Festival and was selected to perform for Elizabeth II when the Queen visited Sri Lanka in April 1954 during her tour of the Commonwealth after acceding to the throne. Neila has said: [...] "That was the day <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to devote my life to dance. My father wanted me to become a dental surgeon, but I refused".|$|E
500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I know a way. I {{can depend}} on Marcus Glennie. I may tell him {{the whole truth and}} the {{identity}} of our man, or I may not. I must think about that. But, whatever <b>I</b> <b>decide,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> can induce Glennie to take our fugitive home in the Telemachus and land him safely somewhere in Ireland, where he will have to lose himself for awhile. Perhaps for Glennie's sake it will be safer not to disclose Dick's identity. Then if there should be trouble later, Glennie, having known nothing of the real facts, will not <b>be</b> held responsible. <b>I</b> will talk to him to-night." ...|$|R
60|$|There was one slight, desperate chance, {{and that}} <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> must take--it <b>was</b> for Dejah Thoris, and no man has lived {{who would not}} risk a {{thousand}} deaths for such as she.|$|R
60|$|One day it {{occurred}} to me that it had been many years since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through Europe on foot. After much thought, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I determined to do it. This was in March, 1878.|$|R
2500|$|She {{received}} {{a degree from}} Yale University in French, graduating cum laude [...] and then decided {{to pursue a career}} in singing. [...] Anderson studied voice under Robert Leonard in New York City. [...] She had numerous auditions but no engagements at first. [...] She has said that she continued her pursuit as a challenge, giving herself a deadline of two years (after which she would, if unsuccessful, enter law school). [...] "No one wanted to know my name. I was down to my last $50. That's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be a singer if it killed me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{became friends}} with Lu Xun, with whom he shared many {{progressive}} views. Ji Gongquan told his son Ji Chaozhu that he then calculated that [...] "if I were to join the 'Preserve the Empire Party' I might lose face. If I were to join the Revolutionary Party I might lose my head. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wisest to keep both." [...] He became education commissioner in the 1920s for the new Shanxi provincial government of Yan Xishan, {{but when he was}} ordered to open fire on student demonstrators, he resigned and moved his family from the capital back to Fenyang.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat by the}} lake-side in a {{place where}} the rushes went down into the water, and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples. If I could have done so with any remains of self-esteem, I would now have fled from my foolhardy enterprise. But (call it courage or cowardice, and I believe it was both the one and the other) <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ventured out beyond the {{possibility}} of a retreat. I had outfaced these men, I would continue to outface them; come what might, I would stand by the word spoken.|$|E
5000|$|In this segment, young Afghan {{schoolchildren}} {{discuss the}} Twin Towers' collapse. Makhmalbaf has said, [...] "When {{they asked me}} to talk about 11 September, I thought the whole world had representation except for Afghanistan, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> their representative and tell it from their point of view. I didn't want to make it too judgmental. I wanted it to be innocent, {{through the eyes of the}} children." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{where has}} my story got to? My uncle, <b>I</b> say, <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> shown London, and out we three went {{as soon as}} my aunt had got her hat on, to catch all that was left of the day.|$|R
5000|$|He matriculated at Harvard University in 1965, {{intending}} to be a math major, but {{he switched to}} biochemistry because it combined his interests in chemistry, math, and biology. [...] He spent the summer after his junior year working in the laboratory of Klaus Weber at Harvard, but [...] "It was so disheartening to completely fail that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> shouldn’t <b>be</b> in biology." [...] As a result, in his senior year, he completed his major and took courses in law, theater, and Russian literature.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned against}} the rail {{in the lee of}} the wheel-house, and stared up at the lofty spars and myriad ropes that I could guess were there. No, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not keen on the voyage. The whole {{atmosphere}} of it was wrong. There were the cold hours I had waited on the pier-ends. There was Miss West coming along. There was the crew of broken men and lunatics. I wondered if the wounded Greek in the 'midship house still gibbered, and if Mr. Pike had yet sewed him up; and I was quite sure I would not care to witness such a transaction in surgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "We met, as you know, on {{the canal}} path that beastly afternoon," [...] he began. [...] "I was jolly well ashamed of myself for having {{made love to}} Beatrice, {{and all the rest}} of it, and you were mad with rage. We had a sort of tussle and you threw me into the canal. It was a nasty dark spot just {{underneath}} the bridge. I expect I was stunned for a moment, but it was only for a moment. I came to long before I choked, and when I remembered your grip upon my throat, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> safer where I was. I could swim like a duck, you know, and though it was filthy water I took a long dive. When I came up again--gad, what disgusting water it was!--you were tearing off like a creature possessed. That's the true history of our little fracas." ...|$|E
5000|$|Corman said [...] "for {{ten years}} as an {{independent}} I could get financing for $100-$200-$300,000 pictures. Everything had been interesting, artistically satisfying, economically satisfying. But <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going nowhere and wanted to move directly into the business. So I accepted a contract with Columbia." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} was settled for me, for before <b>I</b> could <b>decide,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hauled into the rapid. No doubt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a more than}} half-willing captive. Anyhow, willing or not willing, down I went. Ah! what a moment of ease and relief from exertion <b>was</b> that when <b>I</b> went a little deeper than the waist, and found myself borne pleasantly along on tip-toe, as light {{as one of those}} beautiful balls with which juveniles--in these highly favoured days--are wont to sport in the fields! ...|$|R
60|$|It was on {{this part}} of the drive that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{learning}} real mountain-driving. To confess the truth, for delicious titillation of one's nerve, I have since driven over no mountain road that was worse, or better, rather, than that piece.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Gauthier {{was born}} in Montreal as [...] "son of a leading Alzheimer's researcher". He has said that [...] "at first, all <b>I</b> wanted <b>was</b> to be a hockey player... a goalie to be exact. But then, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> nine years old, I saw the musical Cats in Toronto and that’s when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> wanted to <b>be</b> a dancer." ...|$|R

5000|$|Senior's work often {{addresses}} {{questions of}} Caribbean identity {{in terms of}} gender and ethnicity. She has said: [...] "I've {{had to deal with}} race because of who I am and how I look. In that process, I've had to determine who I am. I do not think you can {{be all things to all}} people. As part of that process, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Jamaican. I represent many different races and I'm not rejecting any of them to please anybody. I'm just who I am and you have to accept me or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Here Comes the Sun" [...] {{was written}} {{at the time}} when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: 'Sign this' and 'sign that.' Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever, by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton's house. The relief of not having to go see all those dopey {{accountants}} was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric's acoustic guitars and wrote [...] "Here Comes the Sun".|$|E
5000|$|Kurt Vanderhoof {{criticized the}} failed reunion for the album, [...] "'Masterpeace', which I {{like to call}} 'Disasterpeace'. The {{whole thing was a}} great idea, but when we tried to put together, it just didn't work. We got forced into doing some stuff, and, I swear, when we played Wacken with David Wayne, the whole thing fell apart with having all the {{original}} members. They literally forced us into doing that, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> telling the management and record company, 'Look, this is a bad, bad idea.' We played, and we sucked — <b>I</b> mean, it <b>was</b> horrible. <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> like, 'Fuck you. I told you, and I warned you that this is bad.'" [...] When asked about the reunion, he explains, [...] "Well, David Wayne couldn't sing anymore — he was fucked up on drugs; prescription drugs, because that's 'different.' It was fun to play with John Marshall, but Kirk couldn't do it because of his health, and that's when I had to cut ties with Kirk. He didn't play, and he barely played on the record, and it took forever to get that done. It just didn't work. It was a horrible feeling. We did a tour and it was awful. We're still recovering from that now." [...] He then adds, [...] "Literally, 'Masterpeace', that era <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> never, never doing that again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reflecting on his life's work, Greeley {{told the}} Chicago Tribune in 1992, [...] "I'm a priest, pure and simple.... The other things I do — sociological research, my {{newspaper}} columns, the novels <b>I</b> write — <b>are</b> just {{my way of}} being a priest. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> wanted to <b>be</b> one when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a kid growing up}} on the West Side.

6000|$|... "That is the {{question}} before us which we have not settled yet. Before <b>I</b> <b>decide,</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>be</b> in possession of the facts--down to the smallest detail of what took place between you and Miss Silvester at the inn. There {{is only one way}} of getting at those facts. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to examine you as if I had you before me in the witness-box in court." ...|$|R

5000|$|Keystone Habits: A {{keystone}} habit is {{an individual}} pattern that is unintentionally capable of triggering other habits {{in the lives of}} people. Duhigg wrote about the company Alcoa, and how the new CEO Paul O'Neil, was able to rise the company's market capitalization by 27 billion by attacking safety in the work environment. O'Neil said, [...] "I knew I had to transform Alcoa, ... but you can't order people to change, that's not how the brain works. So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to start by focusing on one thing. If I could start disrupting the habits around one thing, it would spread throughout the entire company." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sawyer {{lost his}} right eye in a 1967 {{automobile}} accident. He said the following about his life {{around the time of}} his accident: [...] "I must have played all the clubs from Houston to Charleston until <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going insane from too much beans and music, and I gave it up. I saw a John Wayne movie and proceeded to Portland, Oregon, to be a logger complete with plaid shirt, caulk boots, and pike pole. On the way my car slipped on the road and the accident left me with the eye patch I now wear. When I recovered I ran straight back to the beans and music and vowed, 'here I'll stay'." ...|$|E
5000|$|No {{repair or}} upgrade {{work can be}} {{embarked}} upon until 1:30am each night, which is when the MBTA stops running trains. [...] Matisse himself had to personally repair the sculpture whenever it broke, {{and he was not}} able to find any organization or corporation that was willing to take over the upkeep of the Band. Because of this, Matisse eventually abandoned the work after roughly 20 years of maintenance. He later stated, “I just kept it going, and then at one point <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just going to have to let it go out on its own... Sort of like one’s kids. The time comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost, mamselle, but not quite. It <b>was</b> this way: <b>I</b> knew if I {{permitted}} her {{to follow}} me she would finally succeed in her quest, for she and the dear children have six eyes among them, while I have but two; so I reposed within an ash-barrel until they had passed on, and then I followed them, keeping well out of their sight. In that way I managed to escape. But it proved a hard task, for my Clarette is very persistent, {{as you may have}} noticed. So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> more safe upon the ship than upon the shore. She is not likely to seek me here, and in any event she floats better than she swims." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ihnat became {{hooked on}} acting {{when he played}} a child role in an amateur theatre near Lynden. He said, [...] "I knew {{this was the only}} thing I wanted to do with my life." [...] He also said [...] "I think wanting to act started when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about 14 as an escape valve to my environment. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> raised on a farm and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> wanted to <b>be</b> {{everything}} in life.

5000|$|Tyler Foster of DVD Talk {{called the}} episode a [...] "highlight" [...] of the Fionna & Cake DVD. Specifically, he praised the song [...] "I'm Just Your Problem", calling it both a [...] "fan favorite" [...] and [...] "significant as the moment <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a fan". Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com enjoyed {{the way the}} episode [...] "alluded to perhaps, more than platonic {{feelings}} between" [...] Princess Bubblegum and Marceline, {{as well as the}} fact that [...] "What Was Missing" [...] was underlined by potential lesbian [...] "subtext". The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that [...] "emotional complexity" [...] lies [...] "beneath Adventure Times weirdness".|$|E
5000|$|Zepp {{graduated}} from the University of Michigan {{in the spring of}} 1968 with a master's degree in marketing. [...] After receiving his degree, Zepp sought to pursue his dream of playing Major League Baseball, but most clubs were not interested in a 22-year-old rookie. Zepp noted, [...] "I finally went begging for a chance to play. When <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in good enough shape, I went to some of the old scouts who had seen me play. I felt I wouldn't embarrass any team that signed me and this was important. Minnesota Twins' scout Frank Franchi convinced the club to give Zepp a chance, and he was signed by the Twins as an amateur free agent.|$|E

5000|$|Of the book's origins, Murray has said, I got {{interested}} in IQ {{and its relationship to}} social problems. And by 1989, <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going {{to write a book about}} it, but then Dick Herrnstein, a professor at Harvard who had written on IQ in the past had an article in the Atlantic Monthly which led me to think, [...] "Ah, Herrnstein is already doing this."
