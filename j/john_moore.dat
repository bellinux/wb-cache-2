5|$|After {{some time}} Alder {{developed}} {{interest in his}} original family in Virginia. A companion, <b>John</b> <b>Moore,</b> learned that Alder had been taken prisoner near Greenbrier, and traveled to Wythe County to search for Alder's family.

50|$|<b>John</b> <b>Moores</b> Jr., CBE, DL, (22 November 1928 - 22 May 2012) was {{the eldest}} son of {{businessman}} Sir <b>John</b> <b>Moores</b> CBE who founded the Littlewoods company. He became Executive Director and Deputy Chairman of the family firm in 1968. <b>John</b> <b>Moores</b> also served as 2nd Chancellor of Liverpool <b>John</b> <b>Moores</b> University from 1994, after previously serving as the university's First Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Board of Governors from 1992.|$|R

5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as Minister for Defence following the 1998 federal election, <b>John</b> <b>Moore</b> {{decided that the}} only way to solve the various problems of the Collins class was for an independent report to be prepared on them. He appointed Malcolm McIntosh, chief executive of the CSIRO and an unofficial advisor to Moore, and John Prescott, a former BHP director, to investigate the project, uncover the problems with the submarines, and suggest ways of solving them.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 the 49th was {{assigned}} to the Helder Expedition against the Batavian Republic (now known as the Netherlands), to be led by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General <b>John</b> <b>Moore.</b> Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. Finally on 2 October the 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Stovin {{served with}} the 28th during {{garrison}} duties in Ireland, and in the brief German expedition of 1805, before seeing service at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807.

5|$|The first {{witnesses}} for the Claimant included former {{officers and}} men from Roger Tichborne's regiment, {{all of whom}} declared their belief that he was genuine. Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was <b>John</b> <b>Moore,</b> Roger's valet in South America. He testified that the Claimant had remembered many small details of their months together, including clothing worn {{and the name of}} a pet dog the pair had adopted. Roger's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company.|$|E
5|$|The main {{campus of}} the college was {{originally}} in Madison, New Jersey. Reverend Bernard J. McQuaid served as the first college president (1856–1857, 1859–1868) and directed a staff of four diocesan clergy including Reverend Alfred Young, vice-president; Reverend Daniel Fisher (the second college president, 1857–1859) and five lay instructors. Initially, Seton Hall had only five students– Leo G. Thebaud, Louis and Alfred Boisaubin, Peter Meehan and <b>John</b> <b>Moore.</b> By {{the end of the}} first year, the student body had grown more than tenfold to 60. The college moved to its current location in 1860.|$|E
5|$|He {{originally}} {{joined the}} army as an ensign in the 52nd Foot in 1800, and saw active service the same year in Spain. He later acquired a captaincy in the 28th Foot in 1803; he saw service in Germany and at the Battle of Copenhagen with the 28th, and then served on the staff under Sir <b>John</b> <b>Moore</b> until the Battle of Corunna. He was later an aide to General Alexander Mackenzie-Fraser, then to General Thomas Picton, and a divisional adjutant through the later stages of the Peninsular War. In 1814–15 {{he served in the}} War of 1812, as a staff officer with the expedition sent to New Orleans, and had he not been detained by prosecuting at a court-martial, he would have served at the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, the {{retreating}} Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community {{in what is}} now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin <b>John</b> <b>Moore</b> was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one side or the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for {{the port}} of Pennsylvania, <b>John</b> <b>Moore,</b> wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, {{two years before the}} formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.|$|E
5|$|When {{the head}} of the British forces in the Peninsula, Sir <b>John</b> <b>Moore,</b> was killed in the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, the British Army having been driven from the Peninsula in disarray, Wellesley sent the Secretary of War a memo insisting that a British force of no less than 30,000 British troops should be sent to defend and rebuild Portugal's {{military}} strength. His proposal was approved and he re-embarked to Lisbon on 14 April 1809, having been appointed to head of all British forces in Portugal on the 6 April– a motion supported by the government and King George III, as Wellesley did not hold seniority.|$|E

5|$|Both battalions of the 52nd {{experienced}} active service {{throughout the}} Napoleonic Wars, their paths occasionally overlapping. In 1806–7 the 1st battalion {{was stationed in}} Sicily, where they helped train local soldiers; later, they accompanied Moore to Sweden. In August 1806, the 2nd battalion accompanied the expedition to Copenhagen, {{taking part in the}} 1807 assault against Copenhagen, which was led by General Wellesley. The 2/52nd landed in Portugal in August 1808 and, with the 2/43rd, were positioned in the village of Vimeiro to provide cover for the army landings at the nearby Maceira Bay. Three companies of the 2/52nd were posted with the advance guard, and were the first to encounter the enemy during the Battle of Vimeiro. Following the battle the British commander Wellesley was superseded in turn by two superiors, Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple respectively, who signed the Convention of Sintra. The three commanders were recalled to England to explain their actions, and the command of the British troops devolved on Sir <b>John</b> <b>Moore,</b> the 52nd's colonel.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 1853 La Pauline reached Valparaíso, where letters {{informed}} Roger {{that his}} father had succeeded to the baronetcy, Sir Edward having died in May. In all, Roger spent 10 months in South America, accompanied in the first stages by a family servant, <b>John</b> <b>Moore.</b> In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla, which lies on the route between Valparaíso and Santiago. Moore, who had fallen ill, was paid off in Santiago, while Roger travelled to Peru, where he took a long hunting trip. By the end of 1853 he was back in Valparaíso, and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes. At the end of January, he reached Buenos Aires, where he wrote to his aunt, Lady Doughty, indicating that he was heading for Brazil, then Jamaica and finally Mexico. The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro, in April 1854, awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica. Although he lacked a passport he secured a berth on a ship, the Bella, which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April.|$|E
