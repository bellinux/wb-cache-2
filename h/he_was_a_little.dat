25|$|Since {{the start}} of his MMA career, people had been advising Bisping that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too small for light heavyweight and would do better at middleweight. With the support of UFC {{president}} Dana White, Bisping then decided to drop down a weight division, following his loss to Evans. On 19 April 2008 at UFC 83, Bisping made his middleweight debut against Charles McCarthy. Bisping won by TKO, as McCarthy was unable to continue after the first round due to a forearm injury he sustained after receiving an unanswered series of knees and uppercuts from Bisping.|$|E

25|$|He was {{introduced}} to amateur sumo when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy. Through his judo coach Riho Rannikmaa, and an official from the Kagoshima Prefecture Sumo Association, Kazuo Kurazono, encouraged him to join the professional sport. Due to the restrictions on foreigners entering sumo, the only stable with a place available was Mihogaseki. He was given the shikona or fighting name of Baruto, {{a reference to the}} Japanese name of the Baltic sea, and made his professional debut in May 2004. He moved very quickly up the rankings, reaching the jūryō division after only 8 tournaments (tied for the third-fastest rise to sekitori status since 1958 when the current six-tournament-a-year format was adopted) and compiling a record of 41–8 on the way.|$|E
25|$|HenryVIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, {{had first}} {{been married to}} Henry's elder brother Arthur when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died {{just a few months}} later. Henry later used this to justify the {{annulment}} of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. When Mary's sister Anne later became Henry's wife, this same canon law might also support that a similar affinity had been created between Henry and Anne due to his earlier liaison with Mary. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Dave Golder {{gave the}} episode {{five out of}} five stars, praising it for being [...] "superbly paced, the changes in tone happening gradually and organically". He also commended the directing and sound effects. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of A-, praising the scary atmosphere {{and the development of}} the Weeping Angels. He commented that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "fuzzy" [...] on the Doctor and River Song's relationship, but he expected that he was supposed to be.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the fifth}} season and Castiel's more {{frequent}} interactions with humans, Collins commented, [...] "Obviously the big joke is that he doesn't understand human beings and how they behave. And there is something inherently funny in that, especially if he's the straight man." [...] The actor noted <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hesitant at making the character into [...] "the funny guy", and was apprehensive about some moments in the early episodes of the season. However, he believes the writers have found [...] "the line", allowing for the jokes to be [...] "more subtle" [...] and [...] "a little more believable".|$|E

[...] Progressing to the high school level in 1973, he focused on football, and officiated games in the Tucson area until 1985.

Andranik and Nevarte moved to the United States and settled in Fresno, California in 1922. In his 1936 short story, Antranik of Armenia, Armenian-American writer William Saroyan described Andranik's arrival. He wrote, [...] "It looked as if all Armenians of California were at the Southern Pacific depot at the day he arrived." [...] He said Andranik [...] "was a man of about fifty in a neat Armenians suit of clothes. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under six feet tall, very solid and very strong.

500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director {{was the man who}} had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E
500|$|While playing junior hockey, Hextall's coaches {{advised him}} that he would not reach the NHL if he {{continued}} to move the puck. Not everyone agreed; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described feeling as if [...] "he had just witnessed Superman flying out of a phone booth" [...] when he saw Hextall's puckhandling ability in a minor league game. Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower, when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon, remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals, and doubted if he would reach the NHL; Hextall retained a tendency to let in occasional weak goals throughout his career. Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth, when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater's stick, rather than the heftier goaltender's stick. Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall, saying [...] "I love {{the fact that he was}} playing the puck. He was one of the first goalies that came out and played the puck. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rough for my liking, but it was entertaining. The playing of the puck was the big thing." [...] Hextall's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen: when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him, relieving some of the pressure on his team. He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame's Legends of Hockey website as being [...] "perhaps the game's most mobile goalie of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

When interviewed for the British television program, Mondo Macabro, actress Kazuko Shirakawa observed that it may have been Kumashiro's poor physical condition which helped him to portray the fragility of human existence. The Japanese film critic and filmmaker Chiseko Tanaka summarized his career with, [...] "Kumashiro was not a great poet like Mizoguchi, Immamura and Oshima. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> poet, but he was unique.
