40|$|The FSAI is {{responsible}} for the enforcement of food law in Ireland which is achieved through service contracts with official agencies. To ensure a high level of consumer protection, the FSAI audits the work of the official agencies each year and may also carry out focused audits of food businesses. The consumption of certain foods or food ingredients can result in responses by the human body that are termed food allergies or food intolerances {{depending on the type of}} reaction. Of the many food ingredients known to cause food allergies or intolerances, only 14 must be declared on packaging according to EU food law. However, the presence of these food allergens must be declared only when they have been used intentionally as ingredients but not when they are present as low level contaminants. In addition, certain derivatives of a number of food allergens are exempt from mandatory allergen labelling because the protein components known to elicit the allergic response have been removed during processing. The FSAI operates an early warning system whereby people with a food allergy or intolerance who are registered with the FSAI are notified by SMS text messaging of any food incidents as they arise that may potentially affect their allergy. In recent years, the number of food allergen alerts has been increasing. In 2011, the FSAI in conjunction with its official agencies, issued 20 such alerts and dealt with 44 food incidents related to food allergens. The FSAI has been reviewing the whole area of food allergies and intolerances with a view to strengthening the safeguards for those people who live with these conditions. The FSAI is examining its own role and that of the official agencies in the sampling and analysis of foods and their labels. In addition, the FSAI has requested that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides information and guidance on the prevalence of food allergies in the EU as well as any scientific developments that would assist the overall work of risk assessors and risk managers. It was against this backdrop that the FSAI decided to conduct an audit to assess how a selection of Irish food businesses manage and control food allergens. The audit was part of the planned programme of targeted audits undertaken by the FSAI in 2011 and involved 12 unannounced site visits to different types of manufacturing establishments including bakeries, chocolate manufacturers, convenience foods and snack producers, as well as meat and <b>fish</b> <b>establishments.</b> This summary report brings together the findings from the individual site inspections from which overall conclusions can be drawn and recommendations for improvement proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} cured <b>fish</b> <b>establishments</b> in 5 {{countries}} of South East Asia, revealed that cured fish is a nutritionally and economically important commodity {{in the region}} and that insect infestation, in particular blowfly infestation during processing and dermestid beetle infestation during storage, are major causes of losses in cured fish. Many processors have responded by illegally applying household and agricultural insecticides to their fish. Field investigations in Indonesia and Thailand, identified Chrysomya megacephala (Fab.) as the most widespread cause of infestation during processing. Lucilia caprina (Wied.) was also a common cause of infestation. Dermestes maculatus (Degeer), D. carnivorus (Fab.), D. ater (Degeer) and Piophila casei (L.), were the most common causes of infestation during storage. These species were able to tolerate the relatively high salt concentrations of the processed fish. Field infestation reduction trials, demonstrated that salting the fish for an extended period failed to provide protection against insect infestation. Guarding the salting tank with a closely fitting lid, prevented blowfly infestation during salting. Flyscreens were found to reduce blowfly infestation during drying, but the design used, presented practical difficulties and was not acceptable to the processor. The pyrethroid insecticide Fastac (alphacypermethrin), prevented blowfly infestation during processing at concentrations as low as 0. 00. 3 % and had a marked repellent effect against blowflies at a concentration of 0. 001 %. Fastac, applied at a concentration of 0. 006 %, protected fish against dermestid beetle infestation and damage. Fastac residues in fish treated with a 0. 006 % dip decreased to less than 2 rag/kg after drying and 1 week's storage. The pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin, prevented insect infestation during processing and storage, when applied as a 0. 003 % dip before drying. The FAO/WHO approved insecticide piriraiphos-methyl, reduced blowfly infestation and prevented damage during processing and reduced dermestid beetle infestation during storage, when applied as a 0. 03 % dip before drying. This treatment resulted in residues, after processing, that were within the FAO/WHO maximum residue limit of 10 mg/kg. Spray applications of pirimiphos-methyl, at dosages of 5 - 20 mg/kg and deltaraethrin, at dosages of 1 - 3 mg/kg, were effective in reducing dermestid beetle infestation of smoked fish during storage. Laboratory investigations demonstrated that C. megacephala produced similar numbers of male and female offspring {{and that there was no}} difference between the mortalities of the 2 sexes. Female flies greatly outnumbered male flies at the processing site. Mean lifespans of C. megacephala cage populations ranged from 47 - 54 days and the maximum survival time ranged from 80 - 98 days. C. megacephala eggs matured within 3 weeks of adult emergence and the mean egg count for the adult female flies was 221. The presence of C. megacephala eggs on fish, stimulated oviposition by C. megacephala and freshly laid eggs were found to have a higher stimulatory effect than eggs which had been previously boiled. Fish being salted exerted a marked, differential attractive effect on gravid, female flies. When presented with fish of a range of salt concentrations, C. megacephala preferentially oviposited on the fish with the lowest salt concentration. In the absence of choice, C. megacephala readily oviposited on fish with relatively high salt contents of 30 - 40 % (dwb). A feeding medium salt content of 33. 8 % was necessary to significantly reduce larval growth rate and salt contents in excess of 39. 5 % were necessary to obtain high larval mortalities. Salt contents of up to 39. 5 % had no effect on pupal mortality...|$|E
