5|$|In the {{township}} of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona), {{the widow of}} Jaume Figueras commissioned Gaudí to renovate the Torre Bellesguard (1900–1909), former summer palace of King Martin I the Humane. Gaudí designed it in a neo-Gothic style, respecting the former building as much as possible, and tried as always to integrate the architecture into the natural surroundings. This influenced his choice of local slate for the construction. The building's ground-plan measures 15 x 15 meters, with the corners oriented to the four cardinal points. Constructed in stone and brick, it is taller than it is wide, with a spire topped with the four-armed cross, the Catalan flag and the royal crown. The <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic, with a gable roof.|$|E

Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys. Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits. During visits, staff make regular checks on the prisoners and their families.|$|E
5|$|Nothing survives of the {{original}} buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle {{was built in the}} artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern of decorative gables. The gate <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> Perpendicular portal and canted Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and panelling interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.|$|E
5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E

St Peter and St Paul's church is a Grade II building, and the Manor Farmhouse in Shalden Lane is a Grade II* building.

5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} a house of rest for the monks of St Augustine's Abbey, which became Bristol Cathedral.

The original house was demolished and rebuilt in the Regency period by Philip John Miles and became {{the seat of the}} Miles baronets. The mansion housed a collection of over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters. In 1917 it was sold to Dr Harold Nelson Burden, for use as a hospital for the mentally challenged which continued until the 1980s. The estate now offers office accommodation, conference and meeting rooms, and the <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> licence as a venue for civil wedding services.|$|E
