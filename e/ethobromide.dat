40|$|Azido {{procainamide}} methoiodide (APM), a photolabile {{derivative of}} the transport model compound procainamide <b>ethobromide</b> (PAEB), shows a close resemblance to PAEB from a physicochemical point of view. Like PAEB it is effectively {{taken up by}} the liver and excreted into bile. Kinetics of the uptake of APM in isolated hepatocytes revealed that in addition to a non-saturable process, two saturable uptake systems are involved (K(m 1) = 3 -mu-M, V(max 1)) = 80 pmol/min/ 10 (6) cells, K(m 2) = 100 -mu-M, V(max 2) = 130 pmol/min x 10 (6) cells). The uptake rate of APM was inhibited markedly in the presence of other organic cations. Organic anions and uncharged compounds generally had no inhibitory effect on the APM uptake. These results support the theory that there is a separate hepatic uptake system for organic cations like APM. Photoaffinity labeling of intact hepatocytes as well as plasma membrane sub-fractions enriched with sinusoidal domains disclosed two major binding polypeptides with apparent M(r) of 48, 000 and 72, 000. Such labeling patterns were not observed in membranes from hepatoma cells that are deficient in organic solute uptake. Differential photoaffinity labeling with other cationic compounds such as tributylmethyl ammonium and d-tubocurarine reduced the incorporation of AMP in these polypeptides. The 48 - and 72 -kDa proteins might be involved in carrier-mediated transport of type I organic cations at the hepatic uptake level...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of hepatic organic cation transport {{were examined in}} isolated rat hepatocytes, using the model compound [methyl-H- 3]tributylmethylammonium (TBuMA). [H- 3]TBuMA is shown to be taken up into rat hepatocytes by two carrier-mediated systems {{in addition to a}} nonsaturable process. The transport mechanisms for TBuMA share common features with both the type I and type II carrier systems reported for exogenous organic cations such as procainamide <b>ethobromide</b> and vecuronium, respectively. Only slight effects were seen in the presence of relatively high concentrations of endogeneous organic cations such as thiamine, choline and N 1 -methyl nicotinamide. The total uptake of [H- 3]TBuMA was neither influenced by an electronegative membrane potential and variations in external and internal pH, nor by the absence of Na+, K+ or Cl- in the incubation medium. The presence of the inorganic anion I- stimulated the uptake of [H- 3]TBuMA. An improved presentation or binding to the carrier may be involved because symport with the anion could not be demonstrated. Lowering of the temperature produced a significant reduction in the uptake velocity of [H- 3]TBuMA, whereas metabolic inhibitors such as valinomycin and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorphenylhydrazone reduced the uptake rate by 80 and 90 %, respectively, which was correlated with the extent of ATP depletion. It is concluded that the monovalent cationic drug TBuMA can be considered as a mixed type I/type II compound that exhibits an electroneutral and anion-sensitive uptake mechanism, depending on metabolic energy. The uptake mechanism is dissimilar from Na+-dependent and H+-dependent transport systems that have been described for endogeneous cations, such as thiamine, choline and N 1 -methylnicotinamide...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of drug {{transport}} in {{the liver}} have been investigated predominantly in rodents. Most of the in vitro drug research {{in the liver}} is performed in liver preparations of animals. The results of such experiments frequently are discussed in relation to anticipated metabolic profiles in man, but these extrapolations are often inappropriate because of large interspecies differences in drug metabolism. In the present study, the mechanisms and specificity of the uptake of the organic cation rocuronium and the cardiac glycoside digoxin were investigated in human hepatocytes and were compared with results obtained in rat hepatocytes. The extraction ratio for the intact liver was calculated from the measured uptake rates of the compounds in the human cells in vitro and compared with published in vivo data. The initial hepatic extraction ratio, calculated from the in vitro uptake data for digoxin and rocuronium, very well reflected the initial extraction ratio for distribution in the liver in vivo in man. Uptake of 100 mu M rocuronium was inhibited by 40 mu M K-strophantoside (80 % inhibition), and although not significantly, by 160 mu M procainamide <b>ethobromide,</b> whereas no inhibitory effect {{was found in the}} presence of 160 mu M taurocholic acid. In a previous study in rat hepatocytes, marked inhibition of digoxin uptake by quinine and only minimal inhibition by the diastereomer quinidine was demonstrated, showing clear stereoselectivity in transport inhibition. Unexpectedly. the uptake of digoxin in human hepatocytes was not inhibited significantly by quinidine or quinine, which indicates clear species differences. This is the first study to investigate the uptake mechanisms of organic cations and cardiac glycosides in human hepatocytes in some detail. The results show that uptake characteristics of drugs found in rats can not be extrapolated directly to humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol on the hepatic uptake of various {{cationic}} drugs was studied in isolated perfused rat livers, isolated rat hepatocytes and isolated rat liver mitochondria. In isolated rat hepatocytes and in isolated perfused rat livers, the uptake {{of the model}} organic cation tri-n-butylmethylammonium {{was found to be}} markedly stimulated by ethanol in a concentration-dependent fashion. The uptake of tri-n-butylmethylammonium at 1 mu M was increased to 120 % and 137 % at 0. 5 % (v/v, (= 87 mM)) and 1 % (v/v, (= 174 mM)) ethanol, respectively. At 25 mu M, tri-n-butylmethylammonium uptake was increased to 124 % and 152 % at 0. 5 % (v/v) and 1 % (v/v) of ethanol, respectively. The uptake of the organic cations azidoprocainamide methoiodide, vecuronium, ORG 9426 and ORG 6368, the anionic compound taurocholate and the uncharged compound ouabain was not markedly increased at these ethanol concentrations. The mechanism of action of ethanol on the uptake of tri-n-butylmethylammonium was further studied. Competitive inhibitors for the type I organic cation uptake system, procainamide <b>ethobromide</b> and verapamil, almost completely blocked uptake of tri-n-butylmethylammonium (1 mu M) in the presence of 1 % (v/v) ethanol, indicating that carrier-mediated uptake is still involved and that additional passive diffusion is unlikely. Neither the plasma membrane potential nor the accumulation of the cation in mitochondria was altered after ethanol treatment, suggesting that potential driving forces for uptake and sequestration were not affected. Apart from ethanol, methanol (1 %, v/v), propanol (1 %, v/v) and dimethyl sulfoxide (1 %, v/v) also stimulated the uptake of tri-n-butylmethylammonium (at 1 mu M) in isolated rat hepatocytes to 117 %, 124 % and 122 % respectively. The results of our study indicate that ethanol selectively stimulates the uptake of the aliphatic organic cation tri-n-butylmethylammonium rather than through generally alterated hepatobiliary transport processes.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} of multiplicity in carrier-mediated uptake mechanisms for organic cations in the liver and to study the possible relation with bile acid and cardiac glycoside uptake mechanisms, mutual interaction during uptake of various radiolabeled quaternary amines has been studied in isolated rat hepatocytes. Inhibition patterns at low concentrations (1 muM) of the presumed type I monovalent organic cation tri-n-butylmethylammonium were markedly different from those at relatively high concentrations (25 muM). Both the cardiac glycoside K-strophantoside and the bile acid taurocholate clearly reduced the uptake rate of tri-n-butylmethylammonium at 25 muM whereas these agents completely failed to reduce the uptake at low concentrations of the cation. Subsequently, inhibition of uptake of some multivalent amphipathic organic cations (muscle relaxants) for the type II uptake system was investigated. It {{was found that the}} uptake of these muscle relaxants both at tracer concentrations (25 muM of the muscle relaxants, Procainamide <b>ethobromide,</b> a typical type I organic cation, did not affect the uptake either at the low or high concentration range of the muscle relaxants. It is concluded that for each of the type I-like compounds and type II-like compounds tested at least two systems are involved in uptake into hepatocytes: tri-n-butylmethylammonium in a concentration range less-than-or-equal-to 1 muM is mainly taken up by the type I uptake system and at concentrations greater-than-or-equal-to 25 muM also by system(s) that can be inhibited by taurocholate and K-strophantoside. Bulky amphipathic organic (type II) cations at concentrations 25 muM these compounds are predominantly accommodated by an uptake system that possibly mediates uptake of both cardiac glycosides and bile acids. This concept was supported by the observation that both type II organic cations and bile salts can inhibit ouabain uptake, while type II organic cations as well as the cardiac glycosides reduce taurocholate uptake rate. The present data support the idea that the liver seems to be equipped with a ''multispecific'' uptake system that transports hydrophobic compounds irrespective of charge, including some type I and type II organic cations at relatively high substrate concentrations...|$|E
