40|$|Predicting {{radioactive}} {{fission product}} (FP) {{behaviors in the}} reactor coolant system and the containment of {{a nuclear power plant}} (NPP) {{is one of the major}} concerns in the field of reactor safety, since the amount of radioactive FP released into the environment during the postulated accident sequences is one of the major regulatory issues. Radioactive FPs circulating in the primary coolant loop and released into the containment are basically in the form of gas or aerosol. In this study, a multi-component and multi-sectional analysis module for <b>aerosol</b> <b>fission</b> products has been developed based on the MAEROS model [1, 2], and the aerosol transport model has been developed and verified against an analytic solution. The deposition of aerosol FPs to the surrounding structural surfaces is modeled with recent research achievements. The developed aerosol analysis model has been successfully validated against the STORM SR- 11 experimental data [3], which is International Standard Problem No. 40. Future studies include the development of the resuspension, growth, and chemical reaction models of <b>aerosol</b> <b>fission</b> products...|$|R

This discussion principally focuses on the melting and liquefaction of core materials at different temperatures, materials oxidation and relocation, hydrogen generation behaviour, and the release and transport of <b>fission</b> products and <b>aerosols.</b> A comparison of fission product release results from annealing and in-reactor experiments is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} work has verified the prediction that marine aerosols {{could have an}} exterior film of amphiphiles; palmitic, stearic and oleic acids were predominant. Thermodynamic analysis has revealed that such aerosols are energetically capable of asymmetric division. In a prebiotic terrestrial environment, one of the products of such <b>aerosol</b> <b>fission</b> would have been bacterially sized (microns), the other would have been virally sized (tens of nanometers). Plausible avenues for chemical differentiation between the two particles are discussed, and the probabilities for the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry updated {{in light of recent}} palaeo fossil studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{fraction}} of the fission product inventory which might be released into {{the atmosphere of the}} HIFAR reactor containment building (RCB) during a postulated loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) has been evaluated as a function of time for each classification of airborne radioactivity. This appraisal will be used as the source term for a computer program which uses realistic attenuation of the <b>fission</b> product <b>aerosol</b> in a single compartment model with a defined leakrate to predict possible radioactive releases into the environment in a hypothetical bounding case reactor accident which is rather more severe in all major aspects than any single LOCA. Also given are the parameters governing the attenuation of the aerosol and vapours in the atmosphere of the RCB so that their behaviour may be accurately modelled. The source terms for several other types of accident involving the meltdown of fuel elements have also been considered but in less detail than the LOCA case. In some of the cases the fission products are released directly to atmosphere so there is no attenuation of the release by deposition within the RCB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For the {{analysis}} of the release of <b>fission</b> product <b>aerosols</b> from reactor cor- in a severe accident, it is necessary to understand the process of homogeneous nucleation of droplets from a supersaturated vapour, including the dependence on system pressure, which can vary greatly {{depending on the type of}} accident. A model of the effect of carrier gas on the nucleation process is presented, based on the changes to the energy distribution of nucleating vapour molecule clusters induced by~callisions with carrier gas molecules. The rate of nucleation is altered since the cluster decay rate is strongly energy dependent. The approach is compared with previous treatments of the problem, illustrating the impottance of using an equilibrium cluster energy distribution which goes beyond a Gaussian approximation. and clarifying previous confusion between cluster temperature and cluster energy in the literature. Calculations of nucleation rates are performed for n-nonane in argon and water vapour in air, and show that an analytic approximation gives a reasonable approximation to numerical results. However, the resulting pressure depen-dence of the nucleation rate is weaker than has been observed experimentally suggesting that additional mechanisms operate. 1...|$|R
40|$|During {{a severe}} nuclear reactor {{accident}} involving core melt down conditions, the deposition of <b>fission</b> product <b>aerosols</b> inside the reactor coolant system affects the final source term {{available to the}} containment and subsequently to the environment. Towards quantifying the aerosol deposition under varying flow conditions and thermal gradients, as may be encountered in the heat transport systems, experiments were performed to investigate the dry deposition behavior of metal oxide aerosols in a 3. 6 m long stainless steel piping test assembly. This assembly consisted of divergent and convergent sections, horizontal and vertical sections and right angle bends. Tin oxide aerosols, generated by a plasma torch aerosol generator, were transported into the test assembly using argon carrier gas. Temperature sensors coupled to data loggers were used to record the pipe inner wall and carrier gas temperatures. The experimental deposition results {{were found to be}} within 8 % of those estimated by the SOPHAEROS module of the accident analysis code ASTEC (Accident Source Term Evaluation Code). Code results for experimental input parameters showed that for sections at higher temperature gradients the dominant deposition mechanism was thermophoresis, while in sections for low thermal gradients, gravitational settling dominated. The micrographs obtained using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that the deposited Tin oxide particles were mostly spherical and bimodal in nature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that plasma torch generated aerosols exhibit tetragonal SnO and SnO 2 phases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|During a {{hypothetical}} nuclear reactor accident with core damage the fission products {{released from the}} degrading fuel bundles often pass through aqueous beds before entering the containment, mitigating in part the source term. Several computer codes {{have been developed for}} predicting the <b>fission</b> product and <b>aerosols</b> removal in pool scrubbing scenarios. In addition to particle removal, these codes simulate the retention of some volatile iodine compounds. Nonetheless, experimental data on the matter are rather scarce and further validation remains to be done. In this work a review of volatile iodine removal models included in SPARC and BUSCA codes is presented. Besides, the results and discussions of a validation of both codes against the available experimental data are summarized. SPARC and BUSCA codes modell the diffusion of iodine towards the bubble interface by using the film penetration theory, which assumes a double layer gas-liquid at the interface. However there are some differences between the two models, mainly related to the boundary conditions in the aqueous volume for the diffusion of molecular iodine. In SPARC, a set of fast reactions in the liquid phase control both the molecular iodine concentration in the pool and the partitio...|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} of neutrinoless double-electron capture would prove the Majorana character of neutrinos. Transitions with an energy degeneracy {{of the initial}} and final state show a resonant enhancement of the decay rate and would be important for neutrino physics experiments. In order to identify such transitions, precise Q-value measurements with Penning-trap mass spectrometers play a key role. In this thesis, the resonance condition of neutrinoless double-electron capture in 106 Cd, 108 Cd, and 184 Os was investigated by Q-value measurements with the Penning-trap mass spectrometer TRIGA-TRAP. In addition, the Q value of the double-beta decay in 110 Pd was measured. A high-voltage platform and an on-line ion source for the ionization of shortlived neutron-rich fission products for the TRIGA-SPEC experiment located at the research reactor TRIGA Mainz has been commissioned and tested. The aim {{is to provide a}} radioactive ion beam for high-precision mass spectrometry and collinear laser spectroscopy. For the extraction from the TRIGA reactor, the fission products are attached to aerosol particles and transported with a gas-jet system to the on-line ion source. This ion source has to cope with a high gas load and has to destroy the bond between <b>fission</b> product and <b>aerosol</b> particle. It was investigated, whether an 2. 45 GHz ECR ion source is suited for this task...|$|R
40|$|Main goals, work in progress, {{significant}} results to this date, future plans) Turbulence plays {{a central role}} in many particle/fluid processes in the environment and industry: in powder production, combustion, formation and growth of PM 10 (Particulate Matter < 10 µm) particulates in the atmosphere, etc. In nuclear safety, many severe accident scenarios lead to the presence of <b>fission</b> products in <b>aerosol</b> form in the closed containment atmosphere. How turbulence affects particle deposition is a key issue to know because particle depletion process limits the release of radioactivity to the environment if the containment is breached. In addition to theoretical predictions, there is experimental evidence that turbulence de-mixes particles, leading to greater particle concentrations inside boundary layers, and enabling enhanced particle deposition. Among others, our own ARTIST data has shown an intensification of particles deposition on horizontal surface under high turbulence levels. The enhanced depletion mechanisms leading to this effect are yet to be fully understood. In particular, the coupling between the gas fluctuations and aerosol motion requires careful investigations to determine the controlling mechanisms responsible for enhanced aerosol depletion. Presently, the most rigorous method for the treatment of particle-turbulence interactions is the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) which fully resolves all the important turbulent scales. This method is currently used in a PSIlaunched PhD (2006 - 2009). However, DNS has two important limitations: first, it is, for the foreseeable future, onl...|$|R

""A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. "Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Sudarshan K. Loyalka. Includes vita. One of the unresolved technical issues associated with the high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is the production of carbonaceous dust (e. g. by abrasion, corrosion, radiation damage, gas-to-particle conversion) and the subsequent transport of sorbed <b>fission</b> products via <b>aerosol</b> transport. Diffusion charging and/or self-charging of these aerosols is likely to occur which will affect how the aerosol evolves in time and ultimately deposits on surfaces. At present, nuclear reactor safety codes, such as MELCOR, do not account for these electrostatic effects and there is currently no consensus on their importance. Further experimentation and modeling of these effects are therefore important and ongoing to resolve these issues. The purpose {{of this research is}} to experimentally investigate the coagulation of charged aerosols closely associated with HTGRs by measuring the evolution of size and charge distributions over time and to compare the experimental results with available numerical models. Measurements have been completed for both silver and carbon ultrafine aerosols using a tandem differential mobility analyzer and an open flow coagulation chamber with a residence time of nearly 400 seconds. Results for both aerosols indicate that coagulation occurs faster than predicted by the model, at times differing by an order of magnitude. Overall, the apparatus developed here will support future coagulation studies of charged ultrafine aerosols at the Nuclear Science and Engineering Institute by providing data for validation of computer codes and guiding model development.

40|$|International audienceIn nuclear safety, some severe {{accident}} scenarios {{lead to the}} presence of <b>fission</b> products in <b>aerosol</b> form in the closed containment atmosphere. It is important to understand the particle depletion process to estimate the risk of a release of radioactivity to the environment should a containment break occur. As a model for the containment, we use the three-dimensional differentially heated cavity problem. The differentially heated cavity is a cubical box with a hot wall and a cold wall on vertical opposite sides. On the other walls of the cube we have adiabatic boundary conditions. For the velocity field the no-slip boundary condition is applied. The flow of the air in the cavity is described by the Boussinesq equations. The method used to simulate the turbulent flow is the large eddy simulation (LES) where the dynamics of the large eddies is resolved by the computational grid and the small eddies are modelled by the introduction of subgrid scale quantities using a filter function. Particle trajectories are computed using the Lagrangian particle tracking method, including the relevant forces (drag, gravity, thermophoresis). Four different sets with each set containing one million particles and diameters of 10 μm, 15 μm, 25 μm and 35 μm are simulated. Simulation results for the flow field and particle sizes from 15 μm to 35 μm are compared to previous results from direct numerical simulation (DNS). The integration time of the LES is three times longer and the smallest particles have been simulated only in the LES. Particle statistics in the LES and the DNS were similar and the settling rates were practically identical. It was found that for this type of flow no model was necessary for the influence of the unresolved flow scales on the particle motions. This {{can be explained by the}} dominant nature of gravity settling compared to turbophoresis which is negligible for the particle sizes of the present study...|$|R
40|$|This multinational, {{multi-phase}} {{spent fuel}} sabotage test program is quantifying the aerosol particles produced when {{the products of}} a high energy density device (HEDD) interact with and explosively particulate test rodlets that contain pellets of either surrogate materials or actual spent fuel. This program provides source-term data {{that are relevant to}} plausible sabotage scenarios in relation to spent fuel transport and storage casks and associated risk assessments. We present details and significant results obtained from this program from 2001 through 2007. Measured aerosol results include: respirable fractions produced; amounts, nuclide content, and produced particle size distributions and morphology; measurements of volatile fission product species enhanced sorption [...] enrichment factors onto respirable particles; and, status on determination of the spent fuel ratio, SFR, needed for scaling studies. Emphasis is provided on recent Phase 3 tests using depleted uranium oxide pellets plus non-radioactive fission product dopants in surrogate spent fuel test rodlets, plus the latest surrogate cerium oxide results and aerosol laboratory supporting calibration work. The DUO{sub 2 }, CeO{sub 2 }, plus <b>fission</b> product dopant <b>aerosol</b> particle results are compared with available historical data. We also provide a status review on continuing preparations for the final Phase 4 in this program, tests using individual short rodlets containing actual spent fuel from U. S. PWR reactors, with both high- and lower-burnup fuel. The source-term data, aerosol results, and program design have been tailored to support and guide follow-on computer modeling of aerosol dispersal hazards and radiological consequence assessments. This spent fuel sabotage, aerosol test program was performed primarily at Sandia National Laboratories, with support provided by both the U. S. Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This program has significant input from, and is cooperatively supported and coordinated by both the U.

40|$|MATERIAUX:SURFACES+FMOIn {{the context}} of {{hydrogen}} risk mitigation in nuclear power plants (NPPs), experimental studies of a possible poisoning of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARS) by fission products (FPs) and aerosols released during a core meltdown accident were mainly conducted in the past with non-radioactive fission product surrogates (e. g., in the H 2 PAR facility at Cadarache, France). The decision was taken in 1997 to complete these studies by a test in the Phebus facility, a research nuclear reactor also at Cadarache: {{it was a rare}} opportunity to expose catalyst samples to an atmosphere as representative as possible of a core meltdown accident, containing gaseous <b>fission</b> products and <b>aerosols</b> released during the degradation of an actual irradiated nuclear fuel bundle. Before testing in Phebus during the FPT 3 experiment, reference and qualification tests were performed in the H 2 PAR facility using the same samples the so-called "coupons" and coupons holder to check that the apparatus was functional and correctly designed for avoiding to tamper with the thermal-hydraulics and chemical conditions in the Phebus containment. The correct operation of catalysts was checked by measuring the surface temperature increase of the coupons due to the exothermic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. After the Phebus FPT 3 test (November 2004), REKO- 1 tests were initiated at Julich, Germany, to confirm the discrepancy in coupons temperature observed in Phebus FFT 3 and H 2 PAR PHEB- 03 tests, and to study the operation behaviour of PARs. Besides, before REKO- 1 tests, a first interpretation of H 2 PAR and Phebus experiments was led to the conclusion that their difference during the operation was due to the different experimental conditions. Samples of catalysts (IRSN/IRCELYON coupon) similar to those used in Phebus and H 2 PAR facilities were exposed in REKO- 1 facility to an atmosphere {{similar to that of the}} Phebus model containment. During the REKO- 1 experiments, the temperatures of the coupon surface, together with the oxygen and hydrogen recombination kinetics, were measured as a function of the oxygen fraction in the feed. In these conditions, the inlet oxygen fraction was shown to be the main parameter affecting the recombination rate. The presence of steam was also taken into account during the IRSN/IRCELYON coupon operation in REKO- 1. Finally, the PAR surface temperatures during the REKO- 1 tests (both optical and thermocouple measurements) are compared with those obtained during the FPT 3 and PHEB- 03 tests. Then, the experimental observations (from the Phebus FFT 3, H 2 PAR PHEB 03 and REKO- 1 tests) were corroborated by numerical calculations using the SPARK code developed at IRSN for catalytic reactors and recombiners applications. Despite the loss of performance experienced by the coupons in the FPT 3 test, as compared with the PHEB- 03 test, this study does not challenge the qualification of PARs for risk mitigation in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) NPPs, and suggests that they could still be efficient in the rich burn conditions of partially inerted (oxygen depleted) Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) containments.
