Remarkably, this single-molecule magnet exhibits non-collinear magnetism, in which the atomic spin moments of the four Fe atoms point in opposite directions along two nearly perpendicular axes. Theoretical computations showed that approximately two magnetic electrons are localized on each Fe atom, with the other atoms being nearly nonmagnetic, and the spin–orbit-coupling potential energy surface has three local <b>energy</b> <b>minima</b> with a magnetic anisotropy barrier just below 3 meV.|$|E

30|$|The {{interaction}} energy calculated could {{be related to}} the effect of ionic strength on the bacterial BTCs, which were shown in Fig.  4. The peak attenuation of bacterial BTCs in the stage 1 can be explained by bacterial attachment onto the primary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> developed in the high range (200  mM) of ionic strength. Since sufficiently high concentration of bacteria was supplied, a large amount of cells is attached in the sand surface. Identical BTCs observed in the stage 2 {{can be explained by the}} fact that the range of ionic strength in pore water is too high to experience energy barrier or secondary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum.</b> In this range, the attached bacteria are not detached. In the stage 3, the tailings of the BTCs of Exp. C 2 and C 3 appeared. This is attributed to the development of the secondary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum.</b> In this condition, some part of the bacteria attached by the primary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> was detached and thus contributes to the reversible attachment. In the stage 4, detachment vanishes as the secondary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> disappears and accordingly almost no difference in the BTCs was found.|$|R

Also, monosaccharides have clear conformational preferences (saturated rings are typically found in chair conformations), but errors introduced during model building and/or refinement (wrong linkage chirality or distance, or wrong choice of model - see [...] for recommendations on carbohydrate model building and refinement and for reviews on general errors in carbohydrate structures) can bring their atomic models out of their <b>energy</b> <b>minima.</b> Around 20% of the deposited carbohydrate structures are in unjustified <b>energy</b> <b>minima.</b>|$|E

In addition, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) also confirm that the decrease of nanopore diameter was resulted from the {{migration of}} the nanopore edge material, instead of caused by nanopore surface contamination [9].

The lifetime condition distinguishes true, chemically distinct intermediates from vibrational states or such transition states which, by definition have lifetimes close to that of molecular vibration, and thus, intermediates correspond to potential <b>energy</b> <b>minima</b> of depth greater than available thermal energy arising from temperature, (RT, where R is gas constant and T is temperature).|$|E

Developing sound predictive capabilities and establishing effective methodologies for remediation relies heavily on our ability to understand the pertinent physical and chemical mechanisms. Traditionally, colloid transport through saturated media {{has been described by}} classical colloid filtration theory (CFT), which predicts an exponential decrease in colloid concentration with travel distance. Furthermore, colloid stability as determined by Derjaguin-Landau-Veney-Overbeek (DLVO) theory predicts permanent attachment of unstable particles in a primary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum.</b> However, recent studies show significant deviations from these traditional theories. Deposition in the secondary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> has been suggested as a mechanism by which observed deviations can occur. This work investigates the existence of the secondary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> as predicted by DLVO theory using direct force measurements obtained by Atomic Forces Microscopy. Interaction energy as a function of separation distance between a colloid and a quartz surface in electrolyte solutions of varying ionic strength are obtained. Preliminary force measurements show promise and necessary modifications to the current experimental methodology have been identified. Stringent surface cleaning procedures and the use of high-purity water for all injectant solutions is necessary for the most accurate and precise measurements. Comparisons between direct physical measurements by Atomic Forces Microscopy with theoretical calculations and existing experimental findings will allow the evaluation of the existence or absence of a secondary <b>energy</b> <b>minimum...</b>|$|R

With this geometric model, we construct potential energy curves {{as a function}} of particle orientation relative to the surface, and identify the potential <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> for particles of various shapes ranging from symmetric (sphere) to asymmetric (oval-shaped). The calculated difference between particle centroid position and potential <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> location is used to define an offset, which is useful for comparison with experimental particle trajectories. For asymmetric particles the potential <b>energy</b> <b>minimum</b> location is decoupled {{from the center of the}} particle long-axis. Based on these observations, we construct a Brownian motion model of a rigid rotor with one end fixed to the planar surface. In the case of asymmetric particles, the resulting stochastic trajectories exhibit passive circular Brownian motion, thus providing one possible microscopic mechanism for the stochastic dynamics of fluorescence upconversion nanoparticles near a surface previously reported by us.
