5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge <b>is</b> <b>restored,</b> and by clearing an episode, the gauge <b>is</b> <b>restored</b> completely.|$|E

5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup <b>is</b> <b>restored</b> {{to freedom}} and {{returned}} to his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton.

Commander Tucker, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed and several MACOs beam aboard the ship, only to find it deserted and without life support. Tucker and Reed become {{stranded}} when the vessel warps away, and make their way to an empty bridge.

5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality <b>is</b> <b>restored.</b>|$|E
5|$|The major {{character}} is Arthur Farnham, a wealthy Civil War veteran, likely based on Hay. Farnham, who inherited money, is without much influence in municipal politics, as his ticket is defeated in elections, {{symbolic of the}} decreasing influence of America's old-money patricians. The villain is Andrew Jackson Offitt (true name Ananias Offitt), who leads the Bread-winners, a labor organization that begins a violent general strike. Peace <b>is</b> <b>restored</b> {{by a group of}} veterans led by Farnham, and, at the end, he appears likely to marry Alice Belding, a woman of his own class.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) <b>is</b> <b>restored</b> when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} divided into two parts: the first part is a remake of , while the second is an {{original}} story acting as a sequel to the first game.

With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money.
