5|$|The {{video was}} shot on 16 December 2009, in London, England. The video begins with footage from The X Factor and then {{transitions}} to a close-up shot of McElderry {{in the main}} setting, a flooded cityscape — the scene was shot in a flooded set with a cityscape backdrop. McElderry is clothed by a grey vest and a grey shirt, as <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> setting and performs. Throughout the entire video, scenes alternate between the flooded cityscape setting and recycled footage from The X Factor, which are {{in black and white}} until it shows him in the live shows in colour. The video concludes with McElderry being informed he won the competition, hugging his peers.|$|E
25|$|Tong Chi-On – On is a 30-year-old man who {{strives to}} do his best for the Tong family. He has a helpful {{attitude}} toward {{his friends and family}} and keeps the smiles on everybody’s faces. Although his manner is regarded as loving and caring, he is gullible in his relationships and trusts in people too easily often leading to disastrous results. His greatest desire is to find his real family as he is an adopted son of the Tong family and not of true blood, it turns out he is really Gai's son with a third woman. His love interest is Sheung Joi Sum and although she doesn't love him, he still cares for her. He is a comic character in the beginning but by the end he matures greatly. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place of Hau after her death and is also straightforward in his acts, rejecting Kam's return to the family (much to the dismay of his father).|$|E
2500|$|Refusing {{to believe}} that the play is real in the wake of this discovery, Arthur tries to get Random House to call off the project, but they refuse: {{forensic}} and historical evidence has all but confirmed the play's veracity, and they claim that the ambiguous [...] "clues" [...] on this index card prove nothing against the word of numerous Shakespeare experts. He continues to argue with his publishers and Dana – who insists that the play is real – and is ultimately threatened with breach of contract if <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of the play's publication. Ultimately, Dana (having found out about Petra's affair with Arthur) confronts him and demands that he allow the play to be published, and instructs him to write an Introduction – [...] "the truth… for once in [...] life" [...] – and [...] "be judged for what [...] did." ...|$|E

6000|$|They {{set down}} the bier there, gladly. They strip away the coffin's gay upper garment; they leave but the under-dress of black box, painted to that favor with pitch. They shove it into the grave-digger's arms, where <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trench, in the soft earth, rich with bones. He lets it slide swiftly to the ground--thump! Ecco fatto! ...|$|E
60|$|Enter Musicians, who {{are dressed}} {{as in the}} earlier play. They have the same musical instruments, which can either be already upon the stage or be brought in by the First Musician before <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre with the cloth between his hands, or by a player when the cloth is unfolded.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} carriage, {{which he}} holds wide open, and through a mist of tears which he no longer tries to {{suppress}} he sees Elsa standing there, quite still--a small image of beauty and of sorrow. The sun glints upon her hair, it shines and sparkles like living gold; her hands are clasped tightly together, and with her full, many-hued petticoats round her slim waist and tiny red-shod feet {{she looks like a}} flower.|$|E
60|$|As a poet <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front rank {{of those}} who have yet {{appeared}} in America. As a critic he was generous and just; as a humorist he used his shafts of ridicule only to wound wrong; as a statesman and diplomat he was actuated by broad, far-seeing views; as a man he was a type to be upheld and followed. America has just cause to reverence his memory; and the whole English-speaking world, without geographical distinction, claims him as its own.|$|E

60|$|Leaving the chapel, {{descending}} to {{the passage}} so frequently alluded to, and crossing the yard before noticed as being allotted to prisoners of a more respectable description than the generality of men confined here, the visitor arrives at a thick iron gate of great size and strength. Having been admitted through it by the turnkey on duty, he turns sharp round to the left, and pauses before another gate; and, having passed this last barrier, <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most terrible part of this gloomy building—the condemned ward.|$|E
6000|$|But in Vivenza {{there were}} certain blusterers, who often thus prated: [...] "The Hump-back's hour is come; at last the old {{teamster}} will be gored by the nations he's yoked; his game is done,--let him show his hand and throw up his scepter; he cumbers Mardi,--let him be cut down and burned; <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of his betters,--let him sheer to one side; he has shut up many eyes, and now himself grows blind; he hath committed horrible atrocities during his long career, the old sinner! --now, let him quickly say his prayers and be beheaded." ...|$|E
60|$|To the civilised poet, {{the fancy}} becomes a {{beautiful}} simile; to a savage poet, {{it would have}} become a material and a very formidable fact. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley, {{and looks up at}} the boulder on the far-off fells. He is puzzled by it. He fears it. At last he makes up his mind. It is alive. As the shadows move over it, he sees it move. May it not sleep there all day, and prowl for prey all night? He had been always afraid of going up those fells; now he will never go. There is a monster there.|$|E

60|$|The word 'just,' therefore, in {{this place}} in special, respecteth a man that is just, or that so esteems himself by the law, and is here {{considered}} in a double capacity; first, what he is before men; secondly, what he is before God. (1.) As he stands before men, he is just by the law; as Paul before his conversion (Phil 3:4). (2.) As <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sight of God; so, without the faith of Christ, he cannot be just, as is evident; for 'the just shall live,' not by his justice or righteousness by the law.|$|E
60|$|Stone {{will take}} the Duke capitally; and I will answer for his being got into doing it very well. Looking down the {{perspective}} of a few winter evenings here, I am confident about him. Forster will be thoroughly sound and real. Lemon is so surprisingly sensible and trustworthy on the stage, that I don't think any actor could touch his part as he will; and I hope you will have opportunities of testing the accuracy of this prediction. Egg ought to do the Author to absolute perfection. As to Jerrold--there <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play! I would propose Leech (well made up) for Easy. He is a good name, and I see nothing else for him.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} Eliphalet's arrival,--a picture which has {{much that is}} {{interesting}} in it. Behold the friendless boy <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prow of the great steamboat 'Louisiana' of a scorching summer morning, and looks with something of a nameless disquiet on the chocolate waters of the Mississippi. There have been other sights, since passing Louisville, which might have disgusted a Massachusetts lad more. A certain deck on the 'Paducah', which took him as far as Cairo, was devoted to cattle--black cattle. Eliphalet possessed a fortunate temperament. The deck was dark, {{and the smell of}} the wretches confined there was worse than it should have been. And the incessant weeping of some of the women was annoying, inasmuch as it drowned many of the profane communications of the overseer who was showing Eliphalet the sights. Then a fine-linened planter from down river had come in during the conversation, and paying no attention to the overseer's salute cursed them all into silence, and left.|$|E
