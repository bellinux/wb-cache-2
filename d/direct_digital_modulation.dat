40|$|Traveling {{wave tube}} (TWT) technology, first {{described}} by Rudolf Kompfner {{in the early}} 1940 s, has been {{a key component of}} space missions from the earliest communication satellites in the 1960 s to the Cassini probe today. TWTs are essentially signal amplifiers that have the special capability of operating at microwave frequencies. The microwave frequency range, which spans from approximately 500 MHz to 300 GHz, is shared by many technologies including cellular phones, satellite television, space communication, and radar. TWT devices are superior in reliability, weight, and efficiency to solid-state amplifiers at the high power and frequency levels required for most space missions. TWTs have three main components -an electron gun, slow wave structure, and collector. The electron gun generates an electron beam that moves {{along the length of the}} tube axis, inside of the slow wave circuit. At the same time, the inputted signal is slowed by its travel through the coils of the helical slow wave circuit. The interaction of the electron beam and this slowed signal produces a transfer of kinetic energy to the signal, and in turn, amplification. At the end of its travel, the spent electron beam moves into the collector where its remaining energy is dissipated as heat or harnessed for reuse. TWTs can easily produce gains in the tens of decibels, numbers that are suitable for space missions. To date, however, TWTs have typically operated at fixed levels of gain. This gain is determined by various, unchanging, physical factors of the tube. Traditionally, to achieve varying gain, an input signal s amplitude has had to first be modulated by a separate device before being fed into the TWT. This is not always desirable, as significant distortion can occur in certain situations. My mentor, Mr. Dale Force, has proposed an innovative solution to this problem called <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>modulation.</b> The testing and implementation of this solution is the focus of my summer internship. The <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>modulation</b> of a TWT removes the need for a separate amplitude modulation device. Instead, different levels of gain are achieved by varying the electron beam current. The lower the current, the less kinetic energy is available to be transferred to the signal. To vary the current, a grid is placed in-between the electron gun and the slow wave circuit. By changing the voltage across the grid, the electron beam current can be controlled. Grid technology has mostly been used in pulse applications such as radar, where only two voltage states are necessary. For <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>modulation,</b> however, a continuous range of voltages is required...|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} a tremendous growth in wireless communications. Consumer demands for battery-operated mobile devices with versatile, high data-rate communication capabilities {{that are of}} low cost, small form-factor and long operating cycle have motivated the research on fully-integrated, back-off-efficient and coexistence-friendly wireless transceivers in CMOS VLSI technology. However, the full integration of an efficient CMOS power amplifier (PA) into such a transceiver is still among the most difficult challenges towards a true System-On-Chip (SOC) solution. This thesis investigates the PA efficiency enhancement techniques for a complete power transmitter system that is fully-integrated and coexistable. Direct digitally modulated transmitter architecture {{has been identified as}} one of the most promising solutions to the above challenges. Within such a transmitter, the PA efficiency is able to back off from a high peak efficiency at least with class-B characteristic; meanwhile, the transmit linearity can be more easily improved by digital predistortion due to the <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>modulation</b> scheme. To validate such a promising architecture, we have built a fully-integrated CMOS digital power transmitter for the IEEE 802. 11 g 54 Mbps application. System-level considerations and design choices are presented with an aim for low out-of-band noise and good transmit linearity. As the core of the transmitter, the RF switching PA is designed for high efficiency with minimum number of on-chip passives that only exercise an accurate control over fundamental and second-harmonic terminations. The class-B efficiency back-off characteristic is further improved by a dynamic impedance modulator which boosts the PA drain impedance at a low instantaneous envelope level. Open-loop phase interpolator based topology is used for the polar phase modulator, which achieves wideband phase modulation with competitive power consumption. Digital baseband filtering is fully optimized at both the algorithm and the hardware level, which offers larger than 60 dB attenuation on the close-in spectral images with reduced filter complexity. The prototype has been implemented in a 65 nm bulk CMOS technology and has demonstrated a combination of good output power, overall efficiency and spectral purity with a very high level of system integration...|$|E
40|$|Todays {{electronic}} communication possibilities and applications are endless. However, only 150 {{years ago the}} concept of the telephone was unknown. The history of {{electronic communication}} begins with the telegraph and {{a couple of years later}} the telephone in the 19 th century. At the end of the same century, the foundations of wireless electronic communication were established. In the beginning, these electronic systems were bulky an impractical due to the large components like vacuum tube amplifiers. Thanks to the invention of the transistor and the integrated microprocessor, these communication systems could be miniaturized and integrated into portable systems that we all use today like smartphones, laptops and tablets. History has also learned us that the demand for data rate over wireless channels rapidly increases, from several kilobits per second in the early nineties to hundreds of megabits for todays high speed wireless links. But even these high speed links cannot support the applications of the (near) future like wireless uncompressed (Ultra) high-definition video streaming or gigabit wireless LAN, for which data rates in the order of 10 gigabit per second and even higher are required. Therefore, new solutions have to be developed to support these high data rate links, both today and in the future. One of the most promising solutions is to shift the wireless carrier frequency from the currently used microwave bands (e. g. 2. 4 GHz, 5 GHz) towards themillimeter wave frequency spectrum (60 GHz, 85 GHz, 94 GHz, 120 GHz) where high modulation bandwidths are available which can support gigabit per second wireless data streaming. This work focuses on the development of circuit and system design techniques for millimeter wave wireless communication systems above 90 GHz and fabricated in nanometer scale CMOS technologies. The scaling of CMOS technologies over the past decades has lead to transistors with gate lengths in the nanometer scale range. Thanks to this scaling, the speed of the MOS transistors has also increased towards a maximum frequency of oscillation above 300 GHz for the latest technology nodes. So CMOS has become a millimeter wave technology, but with the great advantages of the high integration capabilities. Although the speed of the CMOS transistors has increased, the target operation frequency of the circuits in this work (above 90 GHz) is still close to the technologys maximum frequency of oscillation. So coping with a low power gain is one of the major design challenges in CMOS at millimeter wave frequencies. Also, the transistors tend to show inherent potential unstable behavior, which makes multistage amplifier and system design a real challenge. Furthermore, the metal stack of CMOS technologies is not optimized for the design of high frequency passives, which will result in a decreased performance of traditional matching circuit topologies. At system level, problems like the implementation of the millimeter-wave chip interface and bandwidth and linearity requirements of the ADCs, DACs and up- and downconversion circuits emerge. To solve the above mentioned problems, six different chips are designed in which circuit and system level solutions are proposed and implemented. Three different multistage differential W-band amplifiers are designed in which capacitive neutralization is extensively applied to improve the gain and stability properties of the transistors. The adoption of transformers and differential slow-wave transmission lines in the impedance matching networks resulted in small chip footprints, while improving the performance of the amplifiers even more. High gains ranging from 11 dB up to 18 dB and high output powers up to 8 dBm were measured which confirms the efficiency of the adopted circuit design techniques. A combination of two stability analysis techniques is also proposed to accurately predict the common mode and differential mode stability behavior of multistage amplifiers. On the one hand, pole-zero stability analysis, which is excellent to predict the frequencies of possible oscillations and their dependency of one single design parameter is used. On the other hand, K-factor and stability circle based analysis is adopted to get better insight in the load and source impedances causing possible unstable behavior. Combining both techniques has lead to a robust stability analysis technique which not only makes it possible to identify the cause of the oscillation and its frequency, but also gives better insight in possible stabilization solutions. <b>Direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes were applied in three different F-band and D-band transmitters which has lead to new digital modulation system topologies. These direct carrier modulator topologies have resulted in a relaxation of the requirements of the upconverter and made it possible to omit the wideband, high speed digital-to-analog converters. Also the design complexity of these systems could be considerably reduced. An F-band ASK transmitter supporting data rates up to 5 Gb/s and a 120 GHz 10 Gb/s PSK transmitter were designed, implemented and successfully measured. A fully integrated 120 GHz Star-QAM transmitter, which combines both modulation techniques of the previously mentioned transmitters, capable of supporting a 10 Gb/s wireless data link was also successfully measured. The integration of a frequency generator, modulator, power amplifier, baseband circuits and bondwire antenna has lead to a fully integrated solution which solves the problem of millimeter wave interfacing an hereby closes the gap between a laboratory chip solution an a real-life application. status: publishe...|$|E
