However, the role of coronary spasm as an initial presentation in ACS is difficult to demonstrate.

Ergonovine maleate was administered intravenously (50 μg at 5 minute intervals up to total cumulative dosage 350 μg) with continuous echocardiographic monitoring.

Various ECG parameters were then measured twice. The mean L-thyroxine treatment duration was 22 ± 2. 7 months.

40|$|Summary: The {{kinetics}} of myoglobin release after acute {{myocardial infarction}} were studied. Various algorithms for calculation of infarct size, based on immunonephelometric determination of myoglobin and cumulative myoglobin release into the circulation were compared. The cumulative myoglobin release and maximal serum myoglobin concentration were compared with various measures of infarct size: cumulative release of creatine kinase, electrocardiographic changes, and left ventricular ejection fraction. After {{acute myocardial infarction}}, time to peak for myoglobin in serum was correlated with time to peak for creatine kinase (r = 0. 645). On average, the myoglobin concentration peaked 8. 8 h earlier than creatine kinase activity. The rate of elimination of myoglobin showed a large variation (0. 041 — 0. 628 h" 1) and was not correlated with the elimination rate of creatine kinase. The elimination rate of myoglobin after acute myocardial infarction was shown {{to depend on the}} patient's age and infarct size. The elimination constant of myoglobin is preferably estimated on an individual basis in large and complicated infarctions. Cumulative myoglobin release correlated with algorithms based on the cumulative release of creatine kinase (r = 0. 622) and its isoenzyme MB (r = 0. 660), {{and to a lesser extent}} with the residual left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0. 513) and the sum of ST-segment deviations on electrocardiography (r = 0. 469).

An adrenal tumor was excised laparoscopically and histologically shown to be a pheochromocytoma.

40|$|The haemodynamic {{response}} to myocardial ischaemia {{in patients with}} variant angina during ambulatory activity is unknown. Ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring with a transducer tipped catheter and simultaneous frequency modulated electrocardiograms {{was used to assess}} changes in left ventricular function in five male patients (mean age 51. 8 years) during variant angina; four patients had coronary artery stenosis and one had normal coronary arteries. Two hundred and seventy hours of ambulatory recordings were analysed. Twenty episodes (12 painful, 8 silent) of ST segment change greater than 1 mm occurred. Episodes tended to occur more frequently in the early morning hours. Six episodes of painful ST elevation were associated with a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. In the remaining episodes ST segment elevation was of shorter duration and there was no rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. Pain was usually a late feature. Silent ST segment elevation occurred at rest and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increased in all but one episode. Silent exertional ST segment depression was associated with a greater increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure than that seen during ST segment elevation. ST segment depression preceded or followed ST segment elevation in two episodes. The onset of ST segment elevation nearly always preceded the onset of a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. Ergometrine maleate provocation produced a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure in three patients.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Atualmente existe uma tendência mundial para a realização de cirurgias através de incisões mínimas, denominadas minimamente invasivas, tornando o ato operatório cada vez menos agressivo. A introdução desta nova técnica possibilita a dissecção da artéria torácica interna esquerda (ATIE) e sua anastomose com a artéria {{interventricular}} anterior (AIA), através de uma minitoracotomia esquerda. MÉTODOS: De maio/ 96 a outubro/ 97, 11 portadores de insuficiência coronária, com lesão única e proximal da AIA, foram submetidos a revascularização do miocárdio (RM). A abordagem cirúrgica consistiu de uma toracotomia ântero-lateral esquerda, de aproximadamente 10 cm, através do 4 º espaço intercostal esquerdo, e nos últimos 6 casos com ressecção de parte da cartilagem da 4 ª e 5 ª costelas, dissecção da ATIE, abertura e reparo do pericárdio adjacente à AIA. Todos pacientes receberam ponte única para AIA com enxerto da ATIE, sem auxílio de circulação extracorpórea (CEC). RESULTADOS: A idade variou de 46 a 76 (média = 58, 55) anos, sendo 10 (90, 90 %) pacientes do sexo masculino e 1 (9, 09 %) feminino. O tempo de permanência hospitalar variou de 4 a 8 (média de 5, 2) dias. Nenhum paciente apresentou alteração eletrocardiográfica no pós-operatório imediato. Um paciente apresentou no controle, trombose no 1 / 3 distal da ATIE com comprometimento importante de fluxo e, outro, estenose ao nível da anastomose, sendo ambos submetidos a angioplastia com sucesso. Não houve mortalidade no grupo estudado. CONCLUSÃO: A ausência de mortalidade, sugere que a cirurgia de RM através de cirurgia minimamente invasiva, em grupos selecionados, é uma excelente alternativa de revascularização da AIA. PURPOSE: There is, today, {{a global}} tendency towards a surgical approach privileging very small incisions, the so-called minimally invasive intervention, {{which results in}} a less aggressive action. The introduction of this new technique {{makes it possible to}} dissect the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) and to perform in the anastomosis with the anterior interventricular artery (AIA) through a left minithoracotomy. METHODS: From May of 1996 to october of 1997, 11 patients with ischemic heart disease and a single proximal lesion of the AIA were submitted to a myocardial revascularization (MR). The surgical approach consisted of a left anterolateral thoracotomy through the 4 th left intercostal space, of approximatly 10 cm, and in the last 6 cases, resection of part of the cartilage of the 4 th and 5 th ribs, dissection of the LITA, as well as opening and repair of the pericardium adjacent to the AIA was done. All patients received a single bypass to the AIA with a graft of the LITA, without extracorporeal circulation. RESULTS: The patients' age varied between 46 and 76 years (mean = 58, 55). Ten patients (90, 90 %) were males and 1 (9, 09 %) was a female. Hospital stay ranged from 4 to 8 days, with the average of 5, 2 days.
