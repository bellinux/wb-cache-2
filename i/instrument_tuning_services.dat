50|$|L'envol d'Icare (The Flight of Icarus) is a score written (but never performed) as {{a ballet}} by the Ukrainian {{composer}} Igor Markevitch in 1932-33.

50|$|Pairs of {{conventional}} <b>instruments</b> <b>tuned</b> a quarter tone apart {{can be used}} to play some quarter tone music. Indeed, quarter-tone pianos have been built, which consist essentially of two pianos stacked one above the other in a single case, one tuned a quarter tone higher than the other.|$|R
50|$|The solo viola part {{is written}} in D major instead of E flat major, and the <b>instrument</b> <b>tuned</b> a semitone sharper (scordatura technique), to give a more {{brilliant}} tone. This technique is uncommon when performed on the modern viola and is used mostly in performance on original instruments.|$|R

2500|$|Later, {{professional}} suites {{of instruments}} for the worldwide standard seismographic network had {{one set of}} <b>instruments</b> <b>tuned</b> to oscillate at fifteen seconds, and the other at ninety seconds, each set measuring in three directions.

50|$|Recordings and {{performances}} of sub-contrabass string instruments are rare; over 10 ft tall, the triple contrabass viol must be {{played with the}} performer on an elevated platform. It was originally a three-stringed baroque <b>instrument</b> <b>tuned</b> C0-G0-C1 or C0-G0-D1 with the lower C coming in at 16.35 Hz. This {{is equivalent to the}} C two octaves below the cello's lowest C.|$|R
5000|$|Modern incarnations of {{the tenor}} violin are the viola profonda and the violotta (both {{held at the}} shoulder). In the modern new violin family or violin octet, the tenor violin exists as an <b>instrument</b> <b>tuned</b> an octave below the violin and {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} a [...] cello. The baritone violin in the same is an enlarged version of the cello.|$|R

50|$|Although both <b>instruments</b> are <b>tuned</b> {{normally}} to a diatonic scale, on slower pieces, accidentals can {{be created}} by sharping individual notes. This is accomplished by pushing and tensioning {{the section of the}} string behind the bridge with one finger while playing the string normally. This is similar to a technique used in Japanese koto playing. For faster chromatic pieces a pedal called a pitch shifter {{can be used to make}} the instrument fully chromatic. The pedal can be set to momentarily jump shift the entire <b>instrument's</b> <b>tuning</b> one-half step up or down, or it can be set on continuous pitch shift change which enables playing the instrument in dobro, slide guitar, or pedal steel guitar styles.|$|R
25|$|In {{about the}} year 1500 many Iberian lutenists adopted vihuela de mano, a viol-shaped <b>instrument</b> <b>tuned</b> like the lute, but both {{instruments}} continued in coexistence. This instrument also {{found its way to}} parts of Italy that were under Spanish domination (especially Sicily and the papal states under the Borgia pope Alexander VI who brought many Catalan musicians to Italy), where it was known as the viola da mano.|$|R
50|$|This simple tune {{is often}} used in old-time music circles to teach young folks {{how to play the}} fiddle, banjo, {{mountain}} dulcimer and/or guitar. The following is the basic tune with the lyrics of the chorus. These tabs assume the player has a diatonically fretted <b>instrument</b> <b>tuned</b> to one of the 1-5-8 open tunings like G-D-G or D-A-D, such as one might find on a mountain dulcimer or a stick dulcimer.|$|R
5000|$|Strumbola tuning is not {{conducive to}} single string soloing, as the {{intervals}} are so close together as to allow scarcely more than an octave to work with. The Strumbola concept {{is defined by the}} <b>instrument's</b> <b>tuning,</b> not by the physical design or shape of the body. Accordingly, many fretted instruments can be [...] "Strumbola-ized" [...] by stringing and tuning them to create multiple courses tuned to a diminished chord.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{majority}} of rebetiko songs have been accompanied by instruments capable of playing chords according to the Western harmonic system, and have thereby been harmonized in a manner which corresponds neither with conventional European harmony, nor with Ottoman art music, which is a monophonic form normally not harmonized. Furthermore, rebetika {{has come to be}} played on <b>instruments</b> <b>tuned</b> in equal temperament, in direct conflict with the more complex pitch divisions of the makam system.|$|R
