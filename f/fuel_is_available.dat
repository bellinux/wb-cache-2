5|$|Speeders have a boost meter, {{showing how}} much <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> for the onboard speed boost. Although the boost {{provides}} greater speeds and acceleration {{than the standard}} throttle, it also increases the speeder's heat levels. Designated booster load zones along the track replenish the meter, and a super boost power-up is available which doubles the potency of the boost.|$|E
5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around â‚¬6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E

Little <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.|$|E
