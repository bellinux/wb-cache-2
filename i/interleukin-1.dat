5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as <b>interleukin-1</b> and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, <b>interleukin-1</b> and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol can {{weaken the}} {{activity}} of the immune system. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the interleukin-2 producer T-cells unresponsive to <b>interleukin-1</b> (IL-1), and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor (IL-2). Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on <b>interleukin-1.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When {{activated}} macrophages {{start to}} secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), {{as well as}} IL-1; both {{increase the amount of}} cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. [...] Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of <b>interleukin-1's</b> synergism with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells' effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF [...] affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Interleukin-1</b> {{receptor}} antagonist protein (IRAP) blocks IL-1 from binding to {{tissues and}} inhibits the damaging consequences of IL-1.|$|E
25|$|Interleukins {{are another}} {{potential}} family of scar-inducing cellular messengers. Particularly, <b>interleukin-1,</b> a protein produced by mononuclear phagocytes, helps {{to initiate the}} inflammatory response in astrocytes, leading to reactive astrogliosis {{and the formation of}} the glial scar.|$|E
25|$|Omega-3 {{fatty acids}} have a dose-dependent effect in {{slightly}} reducing cortisol release influenced by mental stress, suppressing {{the synthesis of}} <b>interleukin-1</b> and -6 and enhancing the synthesis of interleukin-2; the former promotes higher CRH release. Omega-6 fatty acids, though, have an inverse effect on interleukin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{which include}} <b>interleukin-1</b> (IL-1), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interferon-gamma (IFN-Gamma) and tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth {{as well as}} neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as macrophages, as well as glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research {{for the treatment of}} anxiety-related disorders.|$|E
25|$|Several {{genes are}} also {{associated}} with intervertebral disc degeneration. Probable candidate genes like type I collagen (sp1 site), type IX collagen, vitamin D receptor, aggrecan, asporin, MMP3, <b>interleukin-1</b> and interleukin-6 polymorphisms have been implicated in disc degeneration. Mutation in genes coding for proteins involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix, such as MMP2 and THBS2, has been demonstrated to contribute to lumbar disc herniation.|$|E
25|$|Increased microglial {{activation}} following Japanese Encephalitis infection {{has been}} found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and have a critical role in host defense against invading microorganisms. Activated microglia secrete cytokines, such as <b>interleukin-1</b> (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are secreted by activated microglia.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the field}} of OA gene therapy, {{researches}} has more focused on gene transfer as a delivery system for therapeutic gene products, rather counteracting genetic abnormalities or polymorphisms. Genes, which contribute to protect and restore the matrix of articular cartilage, are attracting the most attention. These Genes are listed in Table 1. Among all candidates listed below, proteins that block the actions of <b>interleukin-1</b> (IL-1) or that promote the synthesis of cartilage matrix molecules have received the most experimental scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} lichen planus is unknown, {{but it is}} not {{contagious}} and does not involve any known pathogen. It is thought to be a T cell mediated autoimmune reaction (where the body's immune system targets its own tissues). This autoimmune process triggers apoptosis of the epithelial cells. Several cytokines are involved in lichen planus, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, <b>interleukin-1</b> alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8. This autoimmune, T cell mediated, process is thought to be in response to some antigenic change in the oral mucosa, but a specific antigen has not been identified.|$|E
25|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of type I diabetes, elevated anti-sulfatide antibodies in serum arise. Such anti-sulfatide antibodies prevent insulin secretion and exocytosis. However, {{research has shown that}} when non-obese diabetic mice are treated with sulfatide, it reduces the possible occurrence of diabetes from 85% in control animals to 35% in experimental animals. Sulfatide is also commonly known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. As a result of these anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the blockage of L-selectin, sulfatide has been shown to prevent type I diabetes and inhibit insulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Sulfatide also prevents apoptosis in insulin secreting cells by preventing the effects of <b>interleukin-1</b> beta (lL-1β), interferon beta 1b (lFN-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that promote apoptosis.|$|E
500|$|DNA {{released}} from dying cells {{acts as an}} inflammatory stimulus in psoriasis and stimulates the receptors on certain dendritic cells, which in turn produce the cytokine interferon-α. [...] In response to these chemical messages from dendritic cells and T cells, keratinocytes also secrete cytokines such as <b>interleukin-1,</b> interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, which signal downstream inflammatory cells to arrive and stimulate additional inflammation.|$|E
500|$|This type of {{phagocyte}} {{does not}} have granules but contains many lysosomes. Macrophages are found throughout the body in almost all tissues and organs (e.g., microglial cells {{in the brain and}} [...] alveolar macrophages in the lungs), where they silently lie in wait. A macrophage's location can determine its size and appearance. Macrophages [...] cause inflammation through the production of <b>interleukin-1,</b> interleukin-6, and TNF-alpha. Macrophages are usually only found in tissue and are rarely seen in blood circulation. The life-span of tissue macrophages has been estimated to range from four to fifteen days.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the negative consequences of}} sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines <b>interleukin-1,</b> interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). [...] In {{addition to}} these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.|$|E
2500|$|Researches {{suggest that}} among all {{potential}} mediators, a protein called <b>Interleukin-1</b> {{is by far}} the most potent cause of the pain, joint inflammation and loss of cartilage associated with osteoarthritis. [...] A therapeutic gene used to treat the arthritic joins produces a second protein, which naturally counteracts the effect of <b>interleukin-1.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Interleukin 1 {{receptor}} antagonist (IL-1Ra), {{the natural}} agonist of IL-1, is a protein that binds non-productively {{to the cell}} surface of <b>interleukin-1</b> receptor, therefore blocks the activities of IL-1 by preventing it from sending a signal to IL-1 receptor.|$|E
2500|$|TNF {{was thought}} to be {{produced}} primarily by macrophages, [...] but it is produced also by a broad variety of cell types including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, adipose tissue, fibroblasts, and neurons. Large amounts of TNF are released in response to lipopolysaccharide, other bacterial products, and <b>Interleukin-1</b> (IL-1). In the skin, mast cells appear to be the predominant source of pre-formed TNF, which can be released upon inflammatory stimulus (e.g., LPS).|$|E
2500|$|When fine {{particles}} of crystalline silica dust are {{deposited in the}} lungs, macrophages that ingest the dust particles will set off an inflammation response by releasing tumor necrosis factors, <b>interleukin-1,</b> leukotriene B4 and other cytokines. [...] In turn, these stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate and produce collagen around the silica particle, thus resulting in fibrosis {{and the formation of}} the nodular lesions. [...] The inflammatory effects of crystalline silica are apparently mediated by the NALP3 inflammasome.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in his {{undergraduate}} days, Wood {{had developed}} {{an interest in}} the role of leukocytes that continued through his career. [...] Wood was an early participant in the Army Epidemiological Board. [...] He was part of a group that published an early paper on penicillin in 1943. [...] He worked on the mechanism of recovery from pneumonia and was noted for early work on surface phagocytosis, research into the pathogenesis of fever, and endogenous pyrogen (now known as <b>interleukin-1).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The biologically active IL-17 {{interacts with}} type I cell surface {{receptor}} IL-17R. In turn, {{there are at}} least three variants of IL-17R referred to as IL17RA, IL17RB, and IL17RC. After binding to the receptor, IL-17 activates several signalling cascades that, in turn, lead to the induction of chemokines. Acting as chemoattractants, these chemokines recruit the immune cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation. Typically, the signaling events mentioned above follow an invasion of the body by pathogens. Promoting the inflammation, IL-17 acts in concert with tumor necrosis factor and <b>interleukin-1</b> [...] Moreover, an activation of IL-17 signalling often observed in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune disorders, such as psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|Canakinumab (INN, {{trade name}} Ilaris, {{previously}} ACZ885) {{is a human}} monoclonal antibody targeted at <b>interleukin-1</b> beta. It has no cross-reactivity {{with other members of}} the <b>interleukin-1</b> family, including <b>interleukin-1</b> alpha.|$|E
50|$|Among other proteins, β trefoil fold {{is found}} in Kunitz inhibitors of several plants such as soybean, Erythrina caffra and wheat; in members of the {{interleukin}} 1 cytokine family (<b>interleukin-1</b> alpha, <b>interleukin-1</b> beta and <b>interleukin-1</b> receptor antagonist); and in fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} an {{autocrine}} agent is the cytokine <b>interleukin-1</b> in monocytes. When <b>interleukin-1</b> is produced in response to external stimuli, it can bind to cell-surface receptors on the same cell that produced it.|$|E
50|$|Macrophages {{are also}} {{involved}} in the secretion factors that promote nerve regeneration. Macrophages secrete not only <b>interleukin-1,</b> a cytokine that induces expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in Schwann cells but also an <b>interleukin-1</b> receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Expression of IL-1ra in mice with transected sciatic nerves via implantation of a tube releasing IL-1ra showed the regrowth of fewer myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Macrophage secretion of <b>interleukin-1</b> is involved in stimulation of nerve regeneration.|$|E
