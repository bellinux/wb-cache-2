500|$|The {{first single}} from Matthew West's new album, [...] "My Own Little World" [...] was {{released}} on August 23, 2010. The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E
500|$|Oppong's {{performances}} {{helped him}} get an NCAA scholarship into Eastern Kentucky. Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Delightful," [...] she murmured, {{buttoning}} her glove. [...] "Then {{you shall}} {{take me for}} a drive to Fifth Avenue, or to see somebody's tomb, and my woman shall make some real Russian tea for us in my sitting-room. Really, I think I'm doing very well for the <b>first</b> <b>day.</b> <b>Is</b> the spell beginning to work?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I knew. And it was {{as though}} I had known from the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> looked across the lawn at the high window.|$|R
60|$|At least, so {{it seemed}} to me, the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and {{so it seemed}} to me, the last <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> ever walked onto a set {{was my first}} day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E
500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{remember}} that my prejudice against him was confirmed, on the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> passed my hand over his face to compare it with his brother's." ...|$|R
60|$|In these <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> {{saw nothing}} {{of any one}} but Felipe, unless the {{portrait}} is to be counted; and since the lad was plainly of weak mind, and had moments of passion, it may be wondered that I bore his dangerous neighbourhood with equanimity. As a matter of fact, it was for some time irksome; but it happened before long that I obtained over him so complete a mastery as set my disquietude at rest.|$|R

500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff {{that was out of}} tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] The <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play. I froze three times. He's my all-time idol!".|$|E
500|$|Ruth was {{sometimes}} allowed to rejoin his family, or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with {{work in the}} community, {{but he was always}} returned to St. Mary's. He [...] was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long hits while playing street ball; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a catcher even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played third base and shortstop, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia. A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, [...] "I think I was born as a hitter the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> ever saw him hit a baseball." [...] The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer Robert W. Creamer commented on the closeness between the two: ...|$|E
2500|$|He is also, {{alongside}} Brendan Nelson, {{one of two}} federal Liberal leaders {{never to}} lead the party into an election. On opposition leadership, he said in 2008 that: [...] "The moment when I wanted to [...] was just about the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> started in the job. There was many a time {{from the first day}} onwards when I thought to myself, How the hell can I get out of this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I fear that I {{have done much}} to injure you. From the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> knew you,--do you remember, {{when we were talking}} here, in this very room, about the {{beginning}} of the Reform Bill;--from that <b>day</b> <b>I</b> wished that you should come among us and be one of us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Guillermin was {{not very}} nice to me," [...] said Lois Chiles, who had a small role in the film. [...] "On my very <b>first</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> {{questioned}} a direction I didn't understand, he stood there swearing at me. It was awful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{amounts to}} more than that. I had an intuition that I should marry you from the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> saw you, and yet {{it did not seem}} probable. But deep down in my soul I knew that I should marry you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding his nickname, Hatton said, [...] "I've {{always been}} a fan of Tommy Hearns, and {{everybody}} associates that that's where I got it from, but everybody's a Tommy Hearns fan. I got the nickname the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> walked in the gym. I was 10 years old and put a pair of gloves on and started walloping the bag, and my amateur coach said, [...] "Look at him, look how evil he is. He's a little Hitman." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "So Ben went to work", added Hayward. Hayward was {{to receive}} 10% of Hecht’s fees as his commission. [...] "He {{was a hell}} of a fast writer – {{sometimes}} too fast. I didn't even know how fast he could go... At the end of the <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> went back to Ben’s house. There he was, typing away... I said, 'Ben – please slow down.' Over the next few days, 'while watching the accumulated pages of Hecht’s script growing higher and higher, 'I couldn't slow the guy down!', sighed Hayward, who only made his commission for each day Hecht worked.|$|E
2500|$|Lyman later recalled: [...] "From the <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> {{just loved}} the game, {{and we had}} some pretty good teams, too." [...] The 1921 Nebraska team {{compiled}} a 7–1 record, lost a close game against Knute Rockne's Notre Dame team, outscored opponents by a combined total of 283 to 17, and won the Missouri Valley Conference championship. [...] The 1922 Nebraska yearbook noted the following about Lyman: [...] "Lyman was, without doubt, our fastest lineman. Roy is a big man, weighing 200 pounds, and could get down under punts almost {{as quickly as the}} ends. Roy proved to be a ground gainer on tackle-around plays before the season was over." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{she spoke}} Terran! He moved a little toward her, {{around the side}} of the pool. [...] "I hope you don't mind my bothering you. I won't be on the {{asteroid}} very long. This is my <b>first</b> <b>day</b> here. <b>I</b> just arrived from Terra." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{to find that it}} was you," [...] he said. [...] "I have already met your sister, Mr. McIntyre, on the very <b>first</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> came here. We took shelter in a shed from a snowstorm, and had quite a pleasant little chat." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a February 1993 interview, guitarist David Gilmour {{described}} Thomas' role on The Dark Side of the Moon as {{a referee}} for arguments {{between himself and}} bassist Roger Waters, stating that they [...] "argued {{so much that it}} was suggested we get a third opinion. We were going to leave Chris to mix it on his own, with Alan Parsons engineering. And of course on the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> found out that Roger sneaked in there. So the second day I sneaked in there. And from then on, we both sat right at Chris's shoulder, interfering. But luckily, Chris was more sympathetic to my point of view than he was to Roger's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Bill Wilson {{later said}} in an address about Shoemaker at the St Louis AA {{convention}} in 1955 alongside Father Ed. [...] "It is through Sam, that most of our principles have come, that is {{he has been the}} connecting link for them, it is what Ebby learned from Sam and what Ebby told me that makes up the linkage between Sam the man of religion, and ourselves. How well I remember that <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> caught sight of Sam, it was a Sunday service in his church. I was still rather gun-shy and diffident about churches. I can still see him standing there before the lectern, and Sam's utter honesty, his tremendous forthrightness, his almost terrible sincerity struck me deep. I shall never forget it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theisen-Eaton {{competed for}} Canada in the {{heptathlon}} at the 2016 Summer Olympics. After {{the first day}} she trailed in sixth place, despite going into the Olympics with the world leading score. During the second day she performed well in the long-jump and javelin events, getting near personal bests which put her into the third-place position going into the final event, the 800 metres. She would finish third in her heat and win the bronze medal scoring 6653 behind winner and upstart Nafissatou Thiam, with Jessica Ennis-Hill finishing second. She said of day two that [...] "I'm happy with today, really happy with today. I never would have guessed after that kind of <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> would {{end up with a}} medal and actually [...] score wasn't half bad either." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{rested on}} my laurels. (I was quivering still {{from head to}} foot.) 'No, thank you, Maharajah,' as unconcernedly as I could; 'I've had quite enough sport for my <b>first</b> <b>day's</b> tiger-hunting. <b>I</b> think I'll go back now, and write a {{newspaper}} account of this little adventure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the course}} of my <b>first</b> <b>day's</b> trudge, <b>I</b> shot a wild turkey, and slung it on my back for provisions. The forest was open and clear from underwood. I saw deer in abundance, but always running, running. It seemed to me as if these animals never stood still.|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Hanks landed one of {{the lead}} roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC television pilot of Bosom Buddies. [...] He and Peter Scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show Make Me Laugh. After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. Bosom Buddies ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> saw him on the set," [...] co-producer Ian Praiser told Rolling Stone, [...] "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years." [...] However, although Praiser knew it, {{he was not able}} to convince Hanks. [...] "The television show had come out of nowhere," [...] Hanks' best friend Tom Lizzio told Rolling Stone.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{current and}} former congressional {{employees}} recalled Foley approaching young male pages at parties, going back many years, and say that warnings about him were commonly passed around. Generally speaking, he was [...] "known to be extraordinarily friendly {{in a way that}} made some [...] uncomfortable." [...] According to Mark Beck-Heyman, who served as a Republican page in summer 1995, [...] "Almost the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> got there I was warned. It was no secret that Foley had a special interest in male pages." [...] He alleged that many people on Capitol Hill, including Republican staffers, [...] "have known for over 11 years about what was going on and chose to do nothing." [...] Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on MSNBC that [...] "I‘ve had people now on staff that used to be pages, and it was widely known to watch out for him, that he liked boys ... so pages were warned to watch out for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the films}} {{were being made}} as the novels were being published, the filmmakers {{had no idea of}} the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his {{relationship}} with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, [...] "The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'" [...] Kloves also said, [...] "I don't know what compelled me to say this , but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me." ...|$|E

500|$|Around 5 July 1941, Nebe {{consolidated}} Einsatzgruppe B near Minsk, {{establishing a}} headquarters and remaining {{there for two}} months. The killing activities progressed apace. In a 13 July Operational Situation Report, Nebe stated that 1,050 Jews {{had been killed in}} Minsk, and that in Vilna, the liquidation of the Jews was underway, and that five hundred Jews were shot daily. In the same report Nebe remarked that: [...] "only 96 Jews were executed in Grodno and Lida during the <b>first</b> <b>days.</b> <b>I</b> gave orders to intensify these activities". He also reported that the killings were being brought into smooth running order and that the shootings were carried out [...] "at an increasing rate". The report also announced that in Minsk Einsatzgruppe was now killing non-Jews.|$|R
