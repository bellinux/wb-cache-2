Theoretical concepts linked with these questions are introduced in the first part - the theory of europeanization, open method of coordination, theory of benchmarking (especially focused on the public sector) and politics of indicators as a critical eye in this field. In the second part, the historical development of the <b>European</b> <b>education</b> policy is described and the growth of its importance during the last 20 years. Three iniciatives of the <b>European</b> <b>education</b> policy are identified in which the indicators and benchmarking methods are used. The last part aims to study mutual relations among indicators (for which the benchmarks are set) through the use of the correlation matrix (Pearson's correlation) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} impact of {{both internal and external}} institutions on the development of <b>European</b> Union (EU) <b>education</b> policy and the extent of this impact, through the examination of the historic development of <b>European</b> <b>education.</b> In particular, the research attempts to assess the varying degree of influence of, on the one hand, EU institutions such as the European Commission and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and, on the other, external institutions such as the OECD and UNESCO. Due to the exploratory nature of this research, a qualitative approach was considered to be the most appropriate, with a focus on mobility policy as a case study through which to explore the influence of these institutions. As a shared policy focus of these institutions, mobility policy lends itself more readily to exploratory analysis, allowing for a more focused examination of {{the manner in which the}} four institutions have impacted on development of <b>European</b> <b>education</b> policy. The empirical data was generated by means of seven semi-structured interviews. The findings of the research tend to suggest a leading role for the European Commission in the development of <b>European</b> <b>education.</b> Moreover, they reveal the catalytic impact of the ECJ during the 1980 s. In addition to that, the findings also reveal the, albeit relatively minor, important influence of external institutions in the historical development of <b>European</b> <b>education.</b> More significantly, the findings indicate the growing importance of external institutions, mainly the OECD, in the more recent policy developments in the field of <b>European</b> <b>education</b> The analysis presented in the research has implications not only for studies of European policy making, but also has relevance for broader political science discussions regarding the varying roles of globalisation and institutions in shaping regional public policy...|$|R

30|$|However, {{every attempt}} to define or set out this idea should be obliged to base itself on the {{educational}} heritage (acquis communautaire) acquired by both organisations over {{more than half a}} century of cooperation.

It is not possible to conceive any type of <b>European</b> <b>education</b> policy (complementary or convergent) without the idea of the EDE as a key core question. Therefore, to satisfy the objective of integrating it into policies and into national education systems a reforming process (firstly circumstantial, then structural) should be initiated.|$|R

Bologna process aims to set up <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> Area {{and one of the}} most important goals of this process is to make <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> competitive, transparent, diversified and leader in the world by having high quality higher education which produce sustainable socio-economic developments in the area and in the world. It is certain that developing a good working Quality Assurance system in the <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> Area will make <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> more competitive and strong in the world because Quality Assurance provides and guarantees high quality in teaching & learning, research etc. and it also leads to increase of student mobility by mutual degrees recognition and comparability thus it is obvious that Quality Assurance in the <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> is a must and it should not be performed just as a mandatory technical work to comply with the resolutions of the Area. This study first of all will look into the {{concepts of}} quality and quality assurance then it will provide necessary and deeper understanding and information on quality assurance in <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> Area and will talk about how to develop quality assurance system and effects of quality assurance on <b>European</b> Higher <b>Education</b> Area...|$|R
