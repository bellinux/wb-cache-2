5|$|Ratatouille was {{originally}} {{going to be}} released in 2006, however, in December 2004, the date was changed to 2007. This <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> Disney/Pixar changed the release date of Cars, from November 2005 to June 2006, thus pushing Ratatouille to 2007.|$|E
5|$|If {{you talk}} to people who perform a Burrakatha, you will see a huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{returns to}} Washington and is congratulated by Mulder {{for being the}} first person to make a second X-File appearance. Ed was brought to a burn center in Philadelphia where the ergot {{chemicals}} were found in his blood; it was also in Scully's blood, but not enough to cause hallucinations. Mulder wonders if this all <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> of their earlier argument, to which Scully replies that not everything is about him.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, {{with the most}} vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations. The Egyptian public and media focused attention on the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing, especially as the initial confrontation between the victim and perpetrator had <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> she wore an Islamic headscarf. In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident. Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, diplomats and legal experts.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} {{remainder}} of Theobald's life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese, as well as attending the royal court when Henry was in England. In January 1155 Theobald helped to secure the Chancellorship for his protégé, Thomas Becket, an action that Barlow speculates <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> Theobald hoped to secure more influence with the king through Becket. If this was his hope, Barlow notes {{that it did not}} materialise. Although the king and the archbishop occasionally clashed when their interests conflicted, both appear to have wished to minimise the disputes and were willing to compromise to secure good relations. As an example, when Pope Adrian IV died in September 1159, two rival claimants for the papal throne emerged. King Henry, following the custom of his grandfather Henry I, forbade the bishops from recognising either claimant. Eventually, after Henry weighed the political factors, he recognised Pope Alexander III, and it was only then that Theobald also recognised Alexander as pope.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these, come (which {{may or may}} not be an auxiliary) may be used to indicate speaker indignation, such as in Don't come acting like you don't know what happened and you started the whole thing ('Don't try to act as if you don't know what <b>happened,</b> <b>because</b> you started the whole thing').|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is simple}} to define genetic {{distance}} {{as a measure}} of genetic divergence, there are several different statistical measures that have been proposed. This has <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> different authors considered different evolutionary models. The most commonly used are Nei's genetic distance, Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards measure, and Reynolds, Weir and Cockerham's genetic distance, listed below.|$|E
25|$|While Budyko's model {{showed that}} this ice-albedo {{stability}} could happen, {{he concluded that}} it had in fact never <b>happened,</b> <b>because</b> his model offered no way to escape from such a feedback loop. In 1971, Aron Faegre, an American physicist, showed that a similar energy-balance model predicted three stable global climates, {{one of which was}} snowball earth.|$|E
25|$|In 1862 Rocket was {{donated to}} the Patent Office Museum in London (now the Science Museum) by the Thompsons of Milton Hall, near Brampton. It was meant {{to take part in}} the Great British Empire Exhibition of 1851 at Crystal Palace but this never <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> the {{preparation}} of the locomotive for the event took too long.|$|E

25|$|In around 2006, {{two teams}} {{attempted}} to extract DNA from a tooth discovered in 2003, but both teams were unsuccessful. It {{has been suggested}} that this <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> the dentine was targeted; new research suggests that the cementum has higher concentrations of DNA. Moreover, the heat generated by the high speed of the drill bit may have denatured the DNA.|$|E
25|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} God saw that {{everything}} miraculously came together for Abraham's servant. A daughter of kings, Rebekah, who {{in all her}} life had never gone forth to draw water, went out to draw water at that hour. And the girl, {{who did not know}} who Abraham's servant was, accepted his proposal to be married to Isaac. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that this <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> she had been destined for him from birth.|$|E
25|$|The First Surreys {{were warned}} {{to prepare for}} a move to the Italian Front, but this never <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> of {{shortage}} of railway rolling stock. Instead, the battalion spent a period holding a quiet sector of the line, and then took part in 47th Division's ceremonial entry into the liberated city of Lille on 28 October. After a halt on the Scheldt, the battalion had advanced past the evacuated city of Tournai when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November.|$|E

25|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{configuration}} was to free up space for the heavy main armament, a 37mm (1.46in) Oldsmobile T9 cannon firing {{through the center of}} the propeller hub for optimum accuracy and stability when firing. This <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> H.M. Poyer, designer for project leader Robert Woods, was impressed by the power of this weapon and pressed for its incorporation. This was unusual, because fighter design had previously been driven by the intended engine, not the weapon system. Although devastating when it worked, the T9 had very limited ammunition, a low rate of fire, and was prone to jamming.|$|E
25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe did {{end up with}} an {{air force}} {{consisting}} mainly of relatively short-range aircraft, {{but this does not}} prove that the German air force was solely interested in ’tactical’ bombing. It <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany's position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the need to make a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes {{in the early stages of}} a likely future war.|$|E
50|$|Many {{accidental}} introductions <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> {{the eggs}} of most Helicidae are {{laid in the}} soil, and they may thus easily travel unnoticed along with landscaping plants.|$|R

30|$|There is {{also some}} work on test code best practices. In his book, Meszaros [23] enumerates a few code smells. As an example, he {{mentions}} a pattern called Obscure Test, {{which is a}} test difficult to understand at a glance. The Hard-To-Test Code, which is a code difficult to test, according to him, may <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> of a highly coupled code. He mentions that a possible {{solution to this problem}} is to make use of stubs or mock objects. He also proposes the Test Code Duplication pattern, which is the same test code repeated many times. Meszaros says it can <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> of clone code reuse but, as we discussed, it can also <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> of a bad abstraction in the production code. We reemphasize that there is a strong connection between the quality of the test code {{and the quality of the}} production code being tested.|$|R
25|$|The Motor City Mechanics of the UHL got a major boost {{during their}} first year in {{existence}} when the lockout officially started. The team signed Detroit Red Wings players Chris Chelios, Derian Hatcher, and Kris Draper. This <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> Derian Hatcher knew the team was playing at Great Lakes Sports City Superior Arena where he often played growing up. Because of visa problems Kris Draper never played a game for the Mechanics. Later on they also signed Bryan Smolinski and Sean Avery {{and were able to}} roll four NHL players on their opponents. All of the players had some experience or connection to the area.|$|E
25|$|Had the 1984 ALCS {{between the}} Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals gone the full five games (the {{last year that}} the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series), Game 5 on Sunday October 7, {{would have been a}} 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being in prime time. This would have <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was {{scheduled}} for that night. In return, ABC was going to broadcast the debates instead of a baseball game in prime time. Al Trautwig interviewed the Detroit Tigers from their clubhouse following their pennant clinching victory in Game 3.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Gacy and an {{employee}} of PDM Contractors traveled to Florida to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night the two were alone in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room. As a result, this youth refused {{to stay in the}} same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, this employee drove to Gacy's house as he was in his yard and beat him. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the youth from further attacking Gacy and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack <b>happened</b> <b>because</b> he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality work.|$|E
