60|$|The {{consequence}} {{of all this}} is, that except now and then by chance, {{the form of a}} complete leaf is never seen; but a marvellous and quaint confusion, very definite, indeed, in its evidence of direction of growth, and unity of action, but wholly indefinable and inextricable, part by part, by any amount of patience. You cannot possibly work it out <b>in</b> <b>fac</b> simile, though you took a twelvemonth's time to a tree; and you must therefore try to discover some mode of execution which will more or less imitate, by its own variety and mystery, the variety and mystery of Nature, without absolute delineation of detail.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} global field-aligned current (FAC) {{topology}} {{associated with a}} clear substorm on the 16 February 2010. We show that for this particular substorm {{there is a clear}} and localised reduction <b>in</b> the <b>FACs</b> observed by AMPERE at least 6 minutes prior to auroral onset. A new auroral arc forms in the region of reduced FAC and on closed field lines which subsequently brightens and expands poleward, signifying the start of the substorm expansion phase. We argue that the change <b>in</b> <b>FACs</b> observed prior to onset {{is the result of a}} change in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling in a region local to the subsequent auroral onset. Such a change implies an important role for M-I coupling in destabilising the near-Earth tail during magnetospheric substorms and perhaps more importantly in selecting the location in the ionosphere where auroral onset begins...|$|R

50|$|Wards 6 and 7, {{constructed}} , {{are single}} storey timber framed buildings elevated on concrete stumps and beams with a fibro cement roof and walls lined <b>in</b> <b>FAC</b> board.

Self-contained ablutions located in an annexe at the eastern end of each building have been altered. The buildings are highset at their eastern end and the subfloor area has been enclosed with fibrous cement sheeting. Ward 6 is presently used for storage of bulk medical stores and Ward 7 has been recently refurbished as offices for its present tenants, Home and Community Care (HACC). The interiors have been lined, some partitions installed and the building has been painted internally and externally.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{her acting}} debut in 2004, Fazura hosted a {{television}} show which broadcast {{by one of the}} largest broadcasting network channels in Malaysia, RTM2, called Teens World. She kept getting offers to make a film, and decided to accept one of the offers. At 21, Fazura made her film debut in the 2004 film Bicara Hati which she played the leading female role of Noraini. Already earned a rave reviews from the film, she was nominated and won the Most Promising Actress award at the 17th Malaysian Film Festival ceremony. During an interview, she said she was not expected to win at all by stating, [...] "I'm still in a daze. I never thought that I would win" [...] and added, [...] "Throughout the night (before the winner was announced), friends were teasing me continuously about winning the award but I never took them seriously. <b>In</b> <b>fac,</b> I brushed it off as absurd. Look at the other contenders: Fasha Sandha is a very good actress and Betty Banafe has more experience in acting." [...] Due to her convincing performance of portraying Noraini in Bicara Hati, Datin Rosnani Jamil had recommended Fazura to fellow film producer, Habsah Hassan, who was then looking for an actress for her upcoming film. Being impresses enough with Fazura, Habsah Hassan immediately offered the leading female role to her. Before the initial release of the Bicara Hati film, she was already went shooting her second major film with and starring opposite to another newcomer, Jehan Miskin. Fazura also co-hosting a 2004 TV show called Olay Total White Aspirasiku with Linda Onn. In 2005, the film Qaisy and Laila which follows a Malaysian relief team that was sent to help refugees in war-torn of Afghanistan was released on 30 June 2005. In the same year, Fazura was again landed a role in Senario XX film and the lead role in Gol & Gincu film. In the comedy film Senario XX, she played the character named Siti, a simple rural province girl in which she stated, [...] "Siti’s character will be a bit different compared to my two previous roles" [...] and [...] "when the character Siti in the comedy Senario XX was offered to me, I said ‘yes’ immediately. On top of it, I’d always wanted to work with abang Aziz (M. Osman)". In the Gol & Gincu film, Fazura played Putri, a bubbly-energetic girl who was suddenly being dumped by her boyfriend Eddy (Ashraf Sinclair) for Sasha (Sazzy Falak) that then decides to try and win over Eddy's heart by starting her own futsal team. The film was released on 11 August 2005 and has been the one of the successful film of Fazura to date and was the big winner at the 19th Malaysian Film Festival as it took home the Best Film award. 2005 also marked the first time Fazura landed the main role on a television series, Inspirion. Co-starring opposite Eizlan Yusof, the series directed by Rashid Sibir was broadcast on TV3. In 2006, Gol & Gincu went from a huge successful film onto a commercial TV series, Gol & Gincu The Series which premiered on 4 June 2006 in which Fazura reprised her role as Putri. The TV series marking Fazura second appearances in television series.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solutions {{are dependent on}} the levels of free available chlorine (FAC). Mixing these solutions with irrigants can result in significant reductions <b>in</b> <b>FAC.</b> Although the effect of some irrigants on FAC is known, the effect of other commonly used irrigants is not. Thus, the therapeutic ramifications of the concurrent use of these on the efficiency of NaOCl solutions is not known. Methods Aliquots of 5. 2 % (w/v) NaOCl solutions were admixed in proportions of 90 : 10, 80 : 20, and 50 : 50 with the following irrigants: octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT); SmearOFF (Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI), 17 % EDTA; and 0. 2 %, 2 %, and 5 % chlorhexidine (CHX) solutions. Changes <b>in</b> <b>FAC</b> were measured by iodometric titration. Statistical differences between means were determined using a post hoc Tukey analysis test after an analysis of variance. Results OCT appeared not to affect FAC and was significantly different than all other irrigants, except for 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 mixtures of low concentration (0. 2 %) CHX. CHX solutions showed a marked concentration- and mixture proportion–dependent detrimental effect on FAC. The reduction of FAC between different concentrations of CHX was statistically significant in 80 : 20 and 50 : 50 proportions, with 50 : 50 mixtures of 5 % CHX having the greatest influence. Mixtures containing even small proportions of SmearOFF or EDTA exhibited significant losses <b>in</b> <b>FAC.</b> Conclusions OCT has little effect on FAC {{and can be used}} concurrently with NaOCl solutions. Higher concentrations of CHX significantly affect FAC. Their combined use with NaOCl solutions should be avoided. EDTA and SmearOFF should not be mixed with NaOCl solutions...|$|E

30|$|From the results, it is {{observed}} that Ca(OH) 2 content is found to decrease with increase in replacement of LP and RHA. However the weight of CSH is found to increase up to 10 % and beyond 10 %, there is a decrease in trend observed. The reduction in Ca(OH) 2 in blended cement concrete indicates its consumption due to the pozzolanic reaction (Kathirvel et al. 2013). This is the main advantage of using blended cement, which leads to the densification of the microstructure. The reduction of Ca(OH) 2 content is higher in blended cement concrete than <b>in</b> <b>FAC,</b> indicating more pozzolanic reaction due to the presence of LP.|$|E
