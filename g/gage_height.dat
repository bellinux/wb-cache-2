5000|$|Streamflow is {{measured}} as {{an amount of}} water passing through a specific point over time. The units used in the United States are cubic feet per second, while in majority of other countries cubic meters per second are utilized. One cubic foot is equal to 0.028 cubic meters.

A stream gauge provides continuous flow over time at one location for water resource and environmental management or other purposes. Streamflow values are better indicators than <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> of conditions along the whole river. Measurements of streamflow are made about every six weeks by United States Geological Survey (USGS) personnel.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possibility of a generic rating curve with a small number of adjustable parameters for the restricted class of bedrock step-pool rivers. The motivation for this study arose from Utah Valley University’s long-term program of groundwater development in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which requires hydrographs for bedrock step-pool rivers near remote mountain villages. Based upon personal communications from USGS state hydrologists and Google Earth satellite images and aerial photos, 71 USGS active or historic gaging sites were identified as bedrock step-pool rivers, involving 403 rating numbers and 13, 409 <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> vs. discharge measurements. For comparison, 71 gaging sites were chosen randomly, involving 268 rating numbers and 7617 <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> vs. discharge measurements. As the distributions of gage heights and discharges were a good fit to a lognormal distribution, the data were normalized by computing the Z-scores of the logarithms of discharge and <b>gage</b> <b>height,</b> in which the average and standard deviation were computed separately for each rating number. The linear relationships between Z-scores of <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> (y-axis) and discharge (x-axis) were surprisingly similar for bedrock step-pool and random rivers.

40|$|Description: Natural streams are {{characterized}} by variation in cross-section geometry, bed-slope, bed roughness, hydraulic slope, etc., along their channels resulting from several interacting features of the riverine system including the effects of discharge changes, geologic context, sediment load, etc. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of river flow dynamics requires sufficient knowledge of hydraulics and these geophysical variables. Average flow condition theory expressed as "At-A-Station" hydraulic geometry (AHG) relations are site-specific power-functions, relating the mean stream channel forms (i. e. water depth, top-width, flow velocity, and flow area) to discharge.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of transpiration {{is required to}} estimate the various components of evaporation losses during sprinkler irrigation. Among the methods, sap flow measurements have widely used for direct measurements of transpiration rate in plant. To evaluate the applicability of this method to field experiments involving canopy wetting (by sprinkler irrigation), stem flow measurements were compared with transpiration values estimated from successive mass measurements of small potted plants using pre-calibrated mini-lysimeters in a glasshouse at the University of Southern Queensland, during the period August–October 2010.

We investigate the effect of geometrical parameters, such as <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> and root radius, on the stress and strain distribution and concentration. The analyses show that the stresses and strains are reasonably uniform on a typical gage mid-section, and their average values reflect accurately the prescribed material model. We derive accurate correlations between the averaged von Mises stress and strain and the applied experimental load and displacement. These relations depend on the specimen geometry and the material proper-ties. Numerical results are compared to experimental data, and an excellent agreement is observed.

40|$|The flow {{fields and}} the tracer {{concentrations}} of turbulent jets discharged vertically into standing water wave environments are studied theoretically and experimentally. The governing equations of the jet-wave interacting flow have been derived based on the Navies-Stokes equations and the technique of dimensional and scale analysis. An integral momentum equation along the jet axis is obtained. An expression for the variation of the axial velocity along the jet axis is developed in the jet dominated flow field. Experiments are performed in a water tank equipped with a jet generation mechanism and a surface standing wave generator. The wave displacements are measured by a capacitance wave <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> The technique of laser-induced fluorescence is used to visualize the flow patterns. A laser Doppler velocimetry system is {{used to measure the}} flow field. The velocity signal is synchronized with the signal from the wave <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> The signals are processed by time and phase averaging techniques for the investigations of the mean flow field and turbulence structures. Verification of experimental results for standing waves and for pure jets, respectively, shows that the generated waves are nearly perfect standing waves and the behaviors of the pure jets are consistent with previous researches. Visualization of the flow pattern and measurement of longitudinal velocity along the jet axis at the node of waves indicates that there are three flow regions, namely, the Jet Dominated Near Field (JDNF), Jet Dominated Far Field (JDFF) and Wave Dominated Far Field (WDFF). The distinction among these fields depends strongly to the relative importance of the wave motion and the jet initial velocity. The mean flow characteristics of JDFF are studied to determine its range and the variation of its longitudinal velocity along jet axis. The coefficient of velocity decay shows a nearly constant trend when the ratio between the jet initial velocity and wave-induced velocity at the exit of the jet nozzle, w 0 /û 0, is sufficiently large. The behaviors of the interacting flow in JDFF for large w 0 /û 0 are studied in detail. The results of the flow characteristics and tracer concentration under node and antinode of wave reveal that imposition of the surface water waves is to deform the axial symmetric circular cross-section for pure jet into an elliptical cross-section for a jet with wave. The results also show that the effect of wave oscillations can enhance greatly the spreading of jet mixing, turbulent intensity and Reynolds stresses. The enhancement caused by horizontal oscillations at node is larger than that caused by vertical oscillations at antinode. Modifications of wave-induced velocity, turbulent intensity and Reynolds stresses by the discharging of jet flow are also investigated and reported...|$|R

The experiments were {{performed in a}} water tank equipped with a jet generating mechanism and a surface wave generator. The jets were driven by a constant head mechanism whereby the ejected water was pre-heated {{to a series of}} temperature differences from the ambient temperature of the tank water. The temperature profiles at various distances from the jet nozzle were measured by a thermistor scanned through the jet cross-section. Surface water waves were generated by a plunger-type wave maker. For this experiment, standing waves were produced at different frequencies to form nodes and antinodes above the jet. The wave amplitudes were measured by a capacitance wave <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> Using potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) as a dye tracer, the response of the buoyants jets to the wave motions was then monitored by video recording and analyzing systems. The jet diffusion angles measured from the jet axis to the tracer outline were determined from visualization to quantify the level of dilution. The present results indicated that a) the far field cross-sectional temperature distributions for the buoyant jet are Gaussian, b) the surface water waves have very strong diluting effects on the jet mixing, c) the jet mixing is enhanced by a stretching/compression mechanism for vertical oscillations (antinode) and by a deflection/looping mechanism for horizontal oscillations (node), and d) the degree of jet mixing depends strongly on the competing process of buoyant force and wave action which is qualified by a wave Richardson number...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the qualification {{of the light}} weight Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablators (PICA) as the forebody heatshield for the Stardust Discovery Class Mission. The Stardust spacecraft will be launched in early 1999 and fly by Comet Wild- 2 to collect cometary and interstellar dust and return them back to earth in the Sample Return Capsule (SRC). This earth re-entry will be the fastest to date, at 12. 6 km/s, and therefore requires a heatshield that can withstand very high heating rates and stagnation pressures, {{as well as provide}} the necessary insulation to the vehicle structure. The PICA material was developed as part of the Lightweight Ceramic Ablators program at NASA Ames Research Center, and was baselined as the forebody heatshield because of its low density and superior ablation and thermal performance at severe aerothermodynamic conditions. Under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program with NASA Ames, Fiber Materials, Inc. developed a process to manufacture a single-piece PICA heatshield for the forebody of the SRC, along with witness material for the fabrication of the test models. The test models were fabricated and instrumented by the staff of Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, Colorado. Full body preliminary aerothermal CFD calculations were performed at NASA Ames to determine the heating and stagnation pressure conditions. The Heat shield sizing was also performed at NASA Ames by using a new material response code that accounts for the highly porous characteristics of the PICA material. The ablation and thermal performance of PICA was qualified in the NASA Ames Interaction Heating Arc Jet Facility. A total of 24 models and four test conditions were used to qualify PICA at the predicted peak heat flux, heat load, shear, and stagnation pressure conditions.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the RIFLS Riverways Project and the Jones River Watershed Association, we {{monitored}} stream gages at the Jones River (at Lake Street) and at Howard Brook (at Route 27). In addition, we collected data from an observer at Pine Brook, and we recorded gage levels from the USGS gaging station located at the junction of the Jones River and Elm Street. In addition, we recorded precipitation using the school 2 ̆ 7 s weather station. Finally, we measured stream flow by doing transects at fixed points along the Jones River and at Howard Brook. We recorded the gage levels for those days, combined our data with that of the RIFLS team, and constructed rating curves for the Jones River and for Howard Brook. We concluded that precipitation, as anticipated, increased stream flow, but that the increases were not equivalent for all locations. Also, we noted a few instances when increases in stream <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> were independent of precipitation events. We recommend continuation of this project into the low flow months and a more detailed study of watershed inputs and outputs...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar a exigÃncia de proteÃna digestÃvel para alevinos de pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus). Foram avaliadas quatro raÃÃes com nÃveis crescentes de proteÃna digestÃvel (18, 22, 26 e 30 %), Ã base de produtos de origem vegetal. Os alevinos foram alojados em hapas de 50 L, que estavam dentro de tanques de 1000 L, em estufa. Diariamente, verificou-se a temperatura e o oxigÃnio dissolvido e, semanalmente, e o pH. Os alevinos foram alimentados trÃs vezes ao dia (7 h: 30, 12 h: 30 e 17 h: 30), e ao final da Ãltima alimentaÃÃo foi realizada retirada de fezes e restos de alimentos, com {{posterior}} reposiÃÃo da Ãgua do sistema, e posterior pesagem dos potes de raÃÃo para aferir o consumo. O delineamento experimental foi de blocos ao acaso, com seis tanques de 1000 L (repetiÃÃes), com quatro hapas de 50 L dentro destes tanques com tratamentos (18, 22, 26 e 30 % de proteÃna digestÃvel). Cada hapa acomodou 10 alevinos. Os alevinos de pacu foram previamente pesados em lotes de 10 na Ãgua (9, 49 g Â 0, 04 g de peso mÃdio por peixe) apresentando comprimento total de 8, 025 cm, comprimento padrÃo de 6, 28 c, altura de 3, 005 cm e largura de 0, 56 cm. As medidas foram obtidas por intermÃdio de uma mÃdia feita apÃs a biometria inicial. Ao final do experimento, foi observado um efeito quadrÃtico (p< 0, 01) para o peso final mÃdio, comprimento padrÃo, comprimento total, altura e largura. Para os parÃmetros de desempenho zootÃcnico avaliou-se a conversÃo alimentar aparente e sobrevivÃncia, sendo que para estes parÃmetros o que teve significÃncia foram o de conversÃo alimentar aparente, que apresentou efeito quadrÃtico (p< 0, 05). ApÃs o tÃrmino do perÃodo experimental, os alevinos foram abatidos e suas carcaÃas submetidas Ãs anÃlises laboratoriais, tais como: proteÃna bruta, extrato etÃreo, umidade e cinzas. ApÃs a obtenÃÃo dos resultados, os mesmos foram submetidos Ã regressÃo linear simples, sendo significativo linearmente para extrato etÃreo e umidade. ApÃs todas as anÃlises, concluiu-se que hÃ um ponto mÃximo de absorÃÃo de proteÃna digestÃvel para um maior peso final mÃdio, que Ã de 24, 65 %, e que o nÃvel de proteÃna digestÃvel que mais obteve resultado para os parÃmetros avaliados foi de 26 % de proteÃna digestÃvelThe {{objective of}} this study was to. Four diets with increasing levels of digestible protein (18, 22, 26 and 30 %) based on products of plant origin were evaluated. The fry were housed in 50 L hapas which were inside 1000 L tanks in the greenhouse. The temperature and, dissolved oxygen were daily verified and pH was weekly verified. The fry were fed three times a day (7 : 30 a. m., 12 : 30 p. m. and 5 : 30 p. m) after the last feeding and removal of food debris feces was performed with subsequent replacement of the water system, and after weighing the pots ration to measure consumption. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six tanks 1000 L (repetitions) with four 50 L hapas tanks within these treatments (18, 22, 26 and 30 % of digestible protein). Each hapa settled 10 fingerlings. The fry pacu that were previously weighed batch of water 10 (9. 49 g Â 0. 04 g average weight per fish), the overall length of 8. 025 cm, 6. 28 cm <b>gage</b> length, <b>height</b> and width of 3. 005 cm and 0. 56 cm. The measurements were obtained by averaging done after the initial biometrics. At the end of the experiment, a quadratic effect (p< 0. 01) for the average final weight, standard length, total length, height and width was observed. For vestments of zootechnical performance the feed conversion ratio and survival were evaluated, and for these parameters were those who had the significance of apparent feed conversion showed a quadratic effect (p< 0. 05). After expiration of the trial period the fry were slaughtered and their carcasses submitted to laboratory analyzes which were: crude protein, ether extract, moisture and ash. After that the results were submitted to the same simple linear regression, the mean linearly for fat and moisture. After all the analysis it was concluded that there is a point of maximum absorption of digestible protein to a higher average final weight which is 24. 65 %, and that the level of digestible protein obtained results for most parameters evaluated was 26 % of digestible protei...|$|R
