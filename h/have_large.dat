5|$|Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey which {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds <b>have</b> <b>large</b> powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight. Fourteen species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Adult males <b>have</b> <b>large</b> cheek flaps to {{show their}} {{dominance}} to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are supported by the musculature of the face. Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
5|$|Mantises <b>have</b> <b>large,</b> {{triangular}} {{heads with}} a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, {{and a pair}} of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike other birds, {{which can only}} go upwards. Nuthatches <b>have</b> <b>large</b> heads, short tails and powerful bills and feet.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that <b>have</b> <b>large</b> amounts of coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show {{a preference for}} riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae either <b>have</b> <b>large</b> yolks or {{are capable}} of feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to <b>have</b> <b>large</b> amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
