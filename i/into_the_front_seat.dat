2500|$|Edward Kienholz died {{suddenly}} in Idaho on June 10, 1994, {{from a heart}} attack after hiking in the mountains near their home. He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, [...] "is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti beside him and the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife. To the whine of bagpipes, the Packard, steered by his widow Nancy Reddin Kienholz, rolled like a funeral barge into the big hole." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fielding nodded, {{and stepped}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> The girl {{was already in}} the tonneau. The man slipped in his clutch, and they glided round the broad, {{circular}} sweep in front of the entrance. Just as they started the wagonette drew up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you; {{thank you}} a {{thousand}} times, young lady," [...] said he, climbing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] "I'm {{stopping at the}} hotel," [...] he explained, as the car again started, [...] "for rest and quiet, because of my nervous condition. My doctor said I would suffer a nervous breakdown if I did not seek rest and quiet in the seclusion of some country village. So I came here, and--it's secluded; it really is." ...|$|E
50|$|There are {{dual-stage}} {{frontal impact}} airbags, torso side-impact airbags built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> and curtain airbags for side-impact protection for {{front and rear}} passengers.|$|R
25|$|A {{driver airbag}} was {{standard}} equipment on all V70 models, {{depending on the}} market a passenger airbag was either standard equipment or a no cost option. Seatbelt pretensioners for both driver and passenger were always part of the standard equipment. SIPS was standard on all V70 models. The system is supplemented by standard side airbags incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 141 special [...] "50th Jubilee" [...] 928 S {{models were}} {{available}} outside the U.S. and Canada {{to celebrate the}} company's 50-year existence as a car manufacturer. This model is also {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Ferry Porsche Edition" [...] because his signature was embroidered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats.</b> It was painted meteor metallic and fitted with flat disc wheels, wine red leather and special striped fabric seat centers. Similar 911 and 924 specials were also made for world markets.|$|R
60|$|All {{had walked}} toward the automobile, which Mr. Porter had been running. The girls got in the tonneau and Dave climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> beside his uncle. Just as {{they were about to}} start, Nat Poole walked past, {{suit-case}} in hand, and tipped his hat politely. Both girls smiled and bowed and Mr. Porter nodded. Then the touring-car rolled off {{in the direction of the}} big Wadsworth mansion, where, as I have before stated, the Porters resided with the jeweler's family and old Caspar Potts.|$|E
60|$|So I {{enjoyed the}} finish alone. It {{was a dead}} heat, and they licked each other's jaws in amity till Harvey, one imploring eye on me, leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> and Malachi backed his appeal. It was theft, but I took him, and we talked {{all the way home}} of r-rats and r-rabbits and bones and baths and the other basic facts of life. That evening after dinner they slept before the fire, with their warm chins across the hollows of my ankles--to each chin an ankle--till I kicked them upstairs to bed.|$|E
60|$|I {{had a dog}} in Oakland. His {{name was}} Glen. His father was Brown, a wolf-dog that had been brought down from Alaska, {{and his mother was}} a half-wild {{mountain}} shepherd dog. Neither father nor mother had had any experience with automobiles. Glen came from the country, a half-grown puppy, to live in Oakland. Immediately he became infatuated with an automobile. He reached the culmination of happiness when he was permitted to sit up in the front seat alongside the chauffeur. He would spend a whole day at a time on an automobile debauch, even going without food. Often the machine started directly from inside the barn, dashed out the driveway without stopping, and was gone. Glen got left behind several times. The custom was established that whoever was taking the machine out should toot the horn before starting. Glen learned the signal. No matter where he was or what he was doing, when that horn tooted he was off for the barn and up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 14 February 2006, Youmaran {{was spotted}} by police {{at a house}} in Woodcroft, Sydney which police had staked out. Youmaran got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{passenger}} <b>seat</b> of a green Mercedes at about 6:15pm. Police tailed the Mercedes at speeds of up to 200 km/h across the M2 and M7 motorways, but the pursuit was called off due to safety concerns.|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} and {{photogenic}} tornado of the outbreak {{was the one}} that occurred at Van Wert, Ohio. Van Wert has been hit before. The last time they were severely hit was during the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak. That tornado was an F4. During this tornado (which in this case was also an F4), a theater was destroyed at around 3:30 P.M. The walls and roof were damaged or destroyed by the tornado and three cars were thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> which minutes earlier had been completely filled with people. This was the farthest north and east tornado that has occurred that late in the year. Notably, no one was killed at the packed theater because the manager received warning via Van Wert County Emergency Director Rick McCoy and evacuated everyone to the back theater. The lead time of this tornado was approximately 28 minutes. A tornado warning went out for Van Wert County at 3:02 P.M. This tornado outbreak was particularly noted because of the massive lead times on all the tornadoes, but there was a slight dispute because the northern tornadoes (such as Van Wert) occurred in severe thunderstorm watch boxes.|$|R
50|$|On January 14, 2016, Fleming rescued a {{woman from}} a three-car {{accident}} in which a big rig made an immediate turn and caused cars to pile up behind it. Darius pulled over and noticed that the cars were smoking, and he subsequently broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> passenger <b>seat</b> {{of one of the}} cars and saved a woman's life. He played in the Patriots' 2015-16 NFL playoffs Divisional Playoff Game versus the Kansas City Chiefs on January 16, just two days after the rescue with 22 stitches in his leg. It wasn't until about a week later that news about the wreck was made public.|$|R
50|$|When French {{looked at}} the map Bernardo {{attacked}} from behind, brandishing a knife and forcing her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of their car. From the back seat, Homolka controlled the girl by pulling her hair.|$|E
50|$|When {{they drove}} near moshav Gefen, two Palestinian gunmen pulled up {{alongside}} in a Mitsubishi van and fired 20 bullets <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the Ungar's moving car. Both Yaron and Efrat were killed but Yishai survived.|$|E
5000|$|A blue collar-worker, {{accused in}} the beating death of his wife, contends {{that his wife had}} been {{involved}} in a car accident, and the force from a bowling ball carried in the car, claimed to have been throw <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the car and {{into the back of the}} woman's head upon impact, was to blame.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{companies}} offer {{the option of}} a [...] "transfer seat", in which <b>the</b> <b>front</b> driver's or passenger's seat moves on a track back to the wheelchair's position allowing the wheelchair user to transfer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> OEM <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and then move <b>the</b> seat back <b>into</b> its original position. The conversion is very simple and does not carry the complicated engineering and electronics typically found in a side-entry conversion. As a result, they are very well suited for commercial and heavy-cycle applications (i.e.-taxi, non-emergency ambulance, paratransit, assisted living, and dial-a-ride) and geographic areas prone to vehicle corrosion from salt and chloride usage on highways in winter seasons.|$|R
5000|$|The Dodge Charger Daytona's {{interior}} on the Road & Track featured unique black performance Nappa {{leather and}} suede heated and ventilated seats with Daytona Blue stitching and piping. Similarly, the Daytona on the R/T offered the same appearance in a custom sport cloth seat. [...] "DAYTONA" [...] was embroidered in blue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> backs. Unique dark brushed aluminum trim surrounded the 8.4-inch Uconnect Touch screen and gauges {{on the instrument}} panel, {{as well as the}} trim around the shifter and cup holders on the center console. Finishing touches included a Mopar bright pedal kit, a 552-watt 10-speaker Beats Audio System, and a special numbered [...] "DAYTONA" [...] badge on the instrument panel that featured the build number of that specific Dodge Charger Daytona model.|$|R
6000|$|He {{appeared}} {{to feel the}} force of this rebuke, surely deserved by a man on whom the humiliation of seeing the main ornaments of his hearth betray the ascendency of that character had never yet been laid. He flushed and was silent; his companions got <b>into</b> their vehicle, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of which was adorned with a large parcel. Mr. Ruck gave the parcel a poke with his umbrella and turned {{to me with a}} grimly penitent smile. “After all, for the ladies, that’s the principal interest.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Anthony Kiedis swims in the San Francisco Bay, {{surrounded}} by sharks and women; he then surfs on a shark's back and suddenly jumps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of a convertible car and drives off. Flea runs through Sequoia National Park, saving a bear from a hunter, riding a mining cart, and escaping many lumberjacks {{as they are}} cutting down all the trees.|$|E
5000|$|Phil quickly {{realizes that}} his brother is the homicidal Santa {{announced}} on the news and proceeds to choke him unconscious. He loads him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the van, whereupon Harry comes to, coldcocks him, and again drives off. During his escape, the oncoming mob forces him and his van off a bridge; in Harry's mind, the van is shown to fly off into safety as a voice-over reads the end of [...] "The Night Before Christmas".|$|E
50|$|Things become {{complicated}} {{when two}} incompetent crooks, Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney, break in {{and hold the}} two hostage. Eventually, Josie seduces one of the crooks and convinces him to take her with them after robbing the store. While the criminals are loading stolen merchandise into their car, Josie jumps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and drives away, leaving the two men stranded in the parking lot. Meanwhile, in the building, Jim loads up a shotgun found in the head custodian's locker and tricks Nestor and Gil by luring them {{to the back of}} the store and holding them at gunpoint.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Mr. Ruck {{appeared}} {{to feel the}} force of this observation, which, in the consciousness {{of a man who}} had never been [...] "mean," [...] could hardly fail to strike a responsive chord. He coloured a little, and he was silent; his companions got <b>into</b> their vehicle, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of which was adorned with a large parcel. Mr. Ruck gave the parcel a little poke with his umbrella, and then, turning to me with a rather grimly penitential smile, [...] "After all," [...] he said, [...] "for the ladies that's the principal interest." ...|$|R
5000|$|Slow {{are known}} for a {{controversial}} incident which both marred the Expo 86 festivities and effectively ended the band's career. While performing their typical performance at the event's Festival of Independent Recording Artists, which included Anselmi pitching two two-by-fours <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> rows' empty <b>seats</b> {{at the side of}} the stage, Anselmi stripped off his shirt and jeans and performed in a pair of boxers, occasionally [...] "poking through" [...] <b>the</b> <b>front</b> as he adjusted his underwear; at the end of the set, Hamm dropped his shorts to his knees and, with arms raised in triumph, said goodbye to the audience while naked from the waist down. In response Expo officials cut the power to the pavilion, ending the entire event.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{is known}} in Alberta for the tragic {{abduction}} and murder {{of one of its}} residents, 15-year-old Kelly Cook, in 1981. The Grade 10 student regularly babysat for townsfolk, and on the morning of April 22, 1981, she {{received a phone call from}} a man who identified himself as Bill Christensen. He asked her to babysit for him that evening. Although she did not know the caller, she agreed, as 'Christensen' was a common surname in the area and crime was virtually unknown in the village, with residents routinely leaving their doors unlocked. The caller arranged to pick Kelly up that evening and drive her to his residence. At 8:30 that evening, a car pulled up in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> house where she lived with her parents and siblings. The driver did not leave his car, and Kelly walked out of her house and climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> automobile's <b>front</b> passenger <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> car then immediately drove off. A few hours later, her anxious parents, concerned that Kelly had not called or returned home, called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A massive local search was launched but yielded almost no clues. Two months after her abduction, on June 28, her badly decomposed body was discovered in Chin Lakes, southeast of her hometown of Standard. The case caught the public's attention like few other murder cases because it was so unusual, with the killer actually picking up his victim at her house while her mother watched through the window. Despite the publicity generated by this murder case, and a $100,000 reward offered by the Village of Standard for information leading to the arrest of Kelly's killer, the case currently remains unsolved.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{presented}} by the prosecution included a video of Ross Harris returning to the SUV at midday to put some lightbulbs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> In the video, {{it does not appear}} that Ross Harris looks into the vehicle, but police investigators contended that the stench of death had filled the car and that Ross Harris must have noticed it, either at that point or when he drove the car away {{at the end of the}} day. On cross-examination, the officers admitted that they had not ever mentioned the stench until over a year after Cooper's death, and other witnesses at the scene said they did not notice a smell.|$|E
50|$|The {{kids are}} soon chased off the lot by the owner, and Wally offers {{to take the}} gang to his house so they can play undisturbed. They cajole Barclay into driving back slowly with Algebra being led behind the car on a rope. They attract a fairly large crowd when Algebra, hearing the ringing of a stop sign at a busy intersection, sits down and refuses to get up. This leads to Barclay getting in an {{argument}} with a traffic cop, until Spanky offers a solution. The children are then seen crammed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> while Algebra sits {{in the back of}} the car.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Jordan's father (Frank Aletter) has {{sex with}} her new {{stepmother}} while the chauffeur Chauncey (Ray Walston) listens in. Not long afterwards, Miss Dutchbok, who has mistaken Chauncey for Mr. Leigh-Jenson (Jordan's father), has sex {{with him in the}} back of Leigh-Jenson's car. Bubba and Betsy, looking to have another tryst, climb <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and turn on the loudspeakers, ensuring that the chauffeur and Ms. Dutchbook's indiscretion are known by everyone present at the program. Upon realizing what Bubba has done, Miss Dutchbok lunges at him, eventually resulting in the car going into the pool. Afterwards, Bubba begins hitting on Jordan, eventually leading to Jordan paying him a midnight visit; when Betsy catches them together, she is apoplectic. The film ends with graduation day, where the graduating girls moon the camera.|$|E
50|$|At 05:15:19, {{the gang}} {{finished}} loading the loot into the orange van and {{jumped in the}} back. X jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and they drove out the gate with 21 seconds to spare (according to their countdown watch), but alfa-south had already reached Løvstræde and 0-11 was getting in position {{around the corner to}} the left. At 05:15, one of the policemen from alfa-south fired twice at the orange van. One bullet hit a storefront, while the other bullet went through the back window, barely missed the gang members in the back, ricocheted off the side and lodged itself into the drivers seat cushion about an inch short of Carsten Nielsen's back. The orange van turned sharp right down Købmagergade and stopped abruptly. X jumped out and fired the shotgun {{in the general direction of}} 0-11.|$|E
50|$|At about 01:30 {{hours on}} 25 April 1978, {{the three men}} left the coffee shop and Ching Boon went home to change and collect the {{traveling}} bag. Dressed in a red T-shirt, he tucked the icepick into his dark blue pants. Chin Hock {{was dressed in a}} white long sleeved top and dark blue pants, while Hwee Kuan was in beige long sleeve top and blue jeans. The three men waited along Kallang Bahru near Block 66 for a taxi. Soon, a Yellow Top taxi stopped for them, driven by Chew Theng Hin, aged 60. Ching Boon got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and instructed the driver to go to the PRU Base. Hwee Kuan sat behind the driver, and Chin Hock behind Ching Boon. The taxi proceeded via Bendemeer Road, Whompoa East, Serangoon Road and Upper Aljunied Road. Chew was instructed to stop the taxi near the rear gate of the PRU base at a dark and secluded stretch of the road.|$|E
50|$|Soft tops with glass, {{plastic or}} {{flexible}} vinyl windows are used. The common off-road soft top types are: full soft top (covers the interior, doors, and includes windows), halftops (cover the space above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> doors with windows, backdrop behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> and stretch over the rear seats and cargo area), bikini tops (cover the roof area above {{the interior and}} cargo compartment, or just the space above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats).</b>|$|R
50|$|In the two {{passenger}} mode, {{the seats}} are separated from the doors and from each other much like <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats.</b> In three passenger mode, the back seat looks like a regular one piece <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> can be pushed fully backwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Uncle John, [...] "I'll bunk on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> to-night. I'm short, you see, {{and will}} just about curl {{up in the}} space. I believe snakes do not climb up wheels. Make my bed on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> Wampus." ...|$|R
