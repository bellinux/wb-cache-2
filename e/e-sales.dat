40|$|The resource-based view (RBV) ascribes {{superior}} firm {{performance to}} firm resources and capabilities. In recent years, much {{debate about the}} value of e-business has been raised because of the costly investments required. Although studies have found positive relationships between e-business and firm performance, {{there is a need to}} further investigate into these topics. Since innovation has become a key factor for increasing the competitiveness of firms and e-business has been proposed as complement to innovation, this paper analyses, based on the RBV perspective, whether companies with high level of Internet resources and with high e-innovation are more effective electronically. The methodology involved a large sample firms and data collected by the European e-Business Market Watch, an established e-business observatory sponsored by the European Commission. Results indicated that differences of <b>e-sales</b> effectiveness of firms with high and low Internet resources were not statistically significant, while on the contrary firms with a high level of e-innovation outperformed on <b>e-sales</b> effectiveness.

40|$|Users of <b>E-Sales</b> {{platforms}} typically {{face the}} problem of choosing the most suitable product or service from large and potentially complex assortments. Whereas {{the problem of}} finding and presenting suitable items fulfilling the user’s requirements can be tackled by providing additional support {{in the form of}} recommender- and configuration systems, the control of psychological side e↵ects resulting from irrationalities of human decision making has been widely ignored so far. Decoy e↵ects are one family of biases which {{have been shown to be}} relevant in this context. The asymmetric dominance e↵ect and the compromise e↵ect have been shown to be among the most stable decoy e↵ects and therefore also carry big potential for biasing online decision taking. This paper presents two user studies investigating the impacts of the asymmetric dominance and compromise e↵ect in the financial services domain. While the first study uses synthesized items for triggering a decoy e↵ect, the second study uses real products found on konsument. at, which is an Austrian consumer advisory site.

40|$|Abstract – There {{has been}} an {{extensive}} theoretical literature during the last 20 years supporting that {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) have a huge potential to drive significant innovations in firms ’ processes, products and services, which can result in big performance improvements. However, limited empirical investigation of this innovation potential of ICT has been conducted. This paper presents an empirical investigation of the impact of two widely used types of information systems (IS) (internal and <b>e-sales</b> ones), and also of four important ‘traditional ’ innovation determinants (demand expectation, price and non-price competition, market concentration) for comparison purposes, on innovation in Greek firms. It has been concluded that in the ‘innovation averse ’ Greek national context both these IS types have a strong positive impact on innovation, whilst this does not hold for any of the examined ‘traditional ’ innovation determinants...|$|E

To analyze the data, a comparison analysis and descriptive statistical methods were used. The change in VAT rate would cause a decrease in VAT revenue up to 1. 6 billion CZK per year, but it would also bring positive effects, especially in the business development of the suppliers of labor intensive services.

40|$|Whilst China is {{the largest}} single world economy, {{e-commerce}} has been relatively slow to develop, especially within consumer markets. In more advanced e-economies such as the USA the switch between traditional retail sales and <b>e-sales</b> is growing {{all the time and}} is predicted to be as high as 10 %. If {{only a small percentage of}} retail sales in China were switched to e-commerce, the potential market in China is immense. In addition, in terms of international competitiveness, the risks of not participating in what is such an increasing important global arena are also high. Therefore, the development of a long term and sustainable e-commerce environment is of great importance to China's economy. Whilst there are many practical reasons why e-commerce development has been slow, this study examines the barriers from a consumer's perspectives using empirical data collected from Chinese consumers via the internet...|$|E

This study reports on antecedent drivers of small business {{adoption of}} Internet technologies. A behavioral model of innovation acceptance was developed with its foundation on previous literature on technology acceptance and innovation adoption research focused on small businesses. The model posits relationships of relative advantage of using IT, compatibility, ease of use, computer selfefficacy, financial slack of the firm, innovativeness of the firm, image of IT, and competitive pressure against the adoption behavior of four different Internet technologies [...] email, business homepage, <b>e-sales</b> and e-procurement. The results confirm the strong association of these antecedents with the adoption behavior and reveal different patterns of adoption behavior across different technologies. Different compositions of these antecedents provide insights on theoretical development of Internet technology acceptance model. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that innovation is {{of critical importance}} for the competitiveness and growth of firms, sectors and countries, so understanding its determinants is a critical research question. Beyond the ‘traditional ’ innovation determinants identified by previous relevant research, there has been extensive theoretical literature on the potential of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) to drive innovation; however limited empirical investigation of it has been conducted. This paper presents an empirical investigation of the impact of three different ICT (internal information systems (IS), <b>e-sales</b> and e-procurements), and also- for comparison purposes – of four important ‘traditional ’ innovation determinants (demand expectation, price and non-price competition, market concentration), on the innovation performance of Greek firms. It is based on firm-level data collected through a survey of 271 Greek firms. The results show that in the Greek ‘innovation averse ’ national context (characterised by low level of innovation and uncertainly avoidance culture), though none of the examined ‘traditional ’ innovation determinants has an impact on product and process innovation of firms, the internal IS have a strong positive impact on both product and proces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-The {{competition}} in the Croatian retailing business is on its peak, but is vague when {{it is going to}} settle. This situation is a great field for new market opportunities and finding new niches might be of a crucial importance. Leaders and followers switched their places, as well as the CEOs and marketing policies. Although the fight with the prices is still very important, its detrimental effect on the profits attracts retailers to differentiate their products by several means, one of which may be the e-retailing. Even though it accounts for a certain share of the sales in the World, it is yet to be set in Croatia. The speed of the implementation of broadband connections and new companies on the communications market decreased the price and increased the accessibility of the Internet. It is now on the retailing companies to recognize this opportunity and occupy this newly created area of business. The comparison between 18 greatest retailers in Croatia and in the World, using the previously devised Web-metric and methods, brought the following conclusions: Only one company offers a possibility of e-purchase, and many have only the basic information on their web site. However there is some connection between the size of a company and its web site development level. Companies should invest their web sites and develop an <b>e-sales</b> point, including online shops, Web site maintenance, Web design, and user-friendliness, {{as well as in the}} measurement of the e-activities.

40|$|The luxury retail {{industry}} of China {{is still in}} its infancy, and its real market potential is not yet known. For Western labels, it is important {{to gain a better understanding}} of how special the concept of “luxury ” is in China, and of what it takes to build lasting brand loyalty and offer continuous customer attention there. This analysis focuses on exploration of a positioning strategy for the Coach brand and suggests marketing approaches likely to enhance it, based upon close examination of recent trends in Chinese consumer markets and distinguishing characteristics of local buying behavior. Many luxury brands are hastening to redesign their survival strategies under the pressure of global financial turmoil. This rather erratic process marks a radical departure from the approach taken by the luxury industry in the past. Major brands are quickly shifting direction, looking eastward of their former “major markets ” and “target clients. ” Now they must learn how to cater to a generation of much younger but affluent customers in Asia, combat wide-spread piracy, compete within numerous distribution channels and face various pricing challenges simultaneously, and adjust more smoothly to the virtual markets, yet manage to retain an image of exclusiveness and superiority. In terms of daily operations, that means placing serious emphasis on <b>e-sales</b> and digital promotion, using social networks and blogs, and mastering new communication technology—life-streaming via Facebook, 3 D formats, and holograms—in addition to delivering the traditional impeccable service, maintaining an immaculate image, and creating impressive window displays. Since the about 2003, when the Chinese consumer became wealthier and experienced a remarkable surge in buying power, Western luxury brands have been actively penetrating China’s retail market, wit...|$|E

The main goal of e-marketplaces in their formation phase from the end of 1995 to 1998 was to bring different trading partners together. However, the requirements on e-marketplaces already increased within this phase. Companies demand additional features for lowering costs and for automation and optimization of their business processes. According to this, the ostensible task for e-marketplaces in the second phase from 1998 to 2001 was to offer more value adding services through intensively support the value chain such as with offering services for initiation, fulfillment, and completion of trading transactions including shipment, payment and logistic services. Nevertheless, today's e-marketplaces lack of fully automated business processes and still require a significant manual effort by human users. The mobile agent technology might take e-commerce trading to the next phase. Mobile agents are intelligent, independent, and pro active electronic representatives of businesses such as buyers, suppliers, customers, or even whole companies which can relieve marketplace participants from lots of routine works. The mobile agent technology can be a suitable approach for resolving the given problems. On the one hand intelligent stationary agents add automated trading capabilities and intelligent negotiation models for example for auctions, request for quotes, and request for proposals and on the other hand mobile agents can easily offer connections to mobile devices such as personal digital assistants or mobile phones. Besides, mobile agents add even more business opportunities because they can represent a company on different marketplaces everywhere in the world at the same time without human involvement. This can lead to a new quality of saving costs while expanding business activities. The following document describes the requirements for a new approach of an e-marketplace called InterMarket, which integrates the mobile agent technology. A feasibility study, made for two existing software applications, the mobile-agent system Tracy and the e-commerce platform Enfinity, investigates the ability to combine both solutions to form the new agent-based e-marketplace. In conclusion, recommendations are made for not yet fulfilled features to reach the identified requirements. Finally, a general architecture should be the foundation for further refinement and for a possible research project...|$|E
