5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts when he went out on his own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't live long enough to find <b>himself</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Fourth Test, the Australians {{had five}} tour matches {{before the final}} Test. They {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings, before having a washout against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. This {{was followed by a}} two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Toshack also recovered to play against Lancashire, but injured <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> and was ruled out of the remainder of the tour.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Uman (15 July – 8 August 1941) Strachwitz {{received}} {{a head injury}} on 29 July and was hit again by shrapnel in the arm the next day.

5|$|Houston offered Bowie a {{commission}} {{as an officer}} on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining {{that he wanted to}} be in the midst of the fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> in the Grass Fight on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187men to cut grass for his horses. As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried valuable cargo. The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes of reaching the safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.|$|E
5|$|Symes {{was injured}} during {{pre-season}} but made his second Bournemouth debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2010–11 season against Charlton Athletic as a half-time substitute. Bournemouth lost the game 1–0 but played against ten-men for the last half-hour after defender José Semedo was sent off for a bad tackle on Symes. He was again a substitute for his side's League Cup match before he made his first start the following weekend as Bournemouth defeated Peterborough United 5–1 and a week later he grabbed his first Bournemouth goal with a penalty in a 3–0 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, Symes soon suffered a shoulder injury, which required specialist treatment and kept him out for nearly a month. With Bournemouth's form pushing them towards the top of the league, Symes admitted he would have to prove <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> to manager Eddie Howe. Bournemouth, however, suffered a number of injuries to strikers, and they risked bringing Symes back early. He was brought on as a half-time substitute against Carlisle United and helped lead his side to a 2–0 victory by scoring the second goal. He instantly won a place in Bournemouth's starting team and followed up his goal-scoring performance by netting twice against Exeter City to put Bournemouth second in the table. He soon spent another six weeks on the sidelines because of a shoulder injury before returning in November. His injury problems continued during the winter and he struggled to gain a run of games in the team meaning he did not score again until February at which point he scored in three successive matches.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{secretly}} {{played a}} game for Rothwell Town in 1988, he played amateur football {{for the first time}} since childhood with pub side New Wheel in 2000, and broke his nose in a game for the club. He gained his A-licence, which allowed him to coach in the professional game, and he took up coaching at Ossett Town. He and John Beresford then set up an unsuccessful wooden flooring company called 'Major Oaks'. The pair then developed a football training product called 'BallMax', Alex Ferguson used it in the Manchester United Academy, but this business also went nowhere. Billy Jennings then took the pair on as football agents at Premier Management International for a twelve-month period. Northampton Town manager Martin Wilkinson then took Swan on as a coach, but soon after Colin Calderwood took over as manager in 2003 Swan found <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> out of work. Swan instead found success in the building trade, constructing a house in his expansive back garden. He also found work as an 'expert witness' for Hull City's games at BBC Radio Humberside in 2003. The next year he also began working as a pundit for the Hull Daily Mail, and did occasional work for BBC Look North.|$|E

25|$|After {{more than}} three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and {{announce}} the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets Obadiah, the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets when Ahab and Jezebel had been killing them. Elijah sends Obadiah back to Ahab to announce his return to Israel.|$|E

When attempting to rejuvenate <b>himself</b> <b>again,</b> Apocalypse is nearly killed by Stryfe {{who had arrived}} in the past to take revenge on Apocalypse. After a battle on the Moon with his former servants, the Dark Riders (who had joined Stryfe), Apocalypse is left for dead by Archangel.|$|E

25|$|Like Amos, Hosea {{elevated}} {{the religion of}} Israel to the altitude of ethical monotheism, being the first to emphasize the moral side of God's nature. Israel's faithlessness, which resisted all warnings, compelled Him to punish the people because of His own holiness. Hosea considers infidelity as the chief sin, of which Israel, the adulterous wife, has been guilty against her loving husband, God. Against this he sets the unquenchable love of God, who, {{in spite of this}} infidelity, does not cast Israel away forever, but will take His people unto <b>Himself</b> <b>again</b> after the judgment.|$|E
25|$|Louis-Joseph Papineau, {{along with}} John Molson Jr., {{the son of}} John Molson, and Horatio Gates, served as the first Vice-Presidents of the Montreal Mechanics' Institute. He participated in the {{creation}} of the Parti rouge. He was defeated in 1851, but elected in a by-election in 1852. He did not present <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> in the elections of 1854. He retired from public life and reappeared only once to hold a conference at the Institut canadien de Montréal in December 1867. He died at his manor in Montebello, Quebec near the modern Château Montebello on September 23, 1871.|$|E
25|$|Faced with {{competition}} {{for a first}} team place by Juan Pablo Ángel and Peter Crouch, Dublin spent several weeks on loan at First Division Millwall. In his time there, he scored two goals, against Stockport County, and Grimsby Town in five league matches to help them into the play-offs where despite Dublin's goal in {{the first leg of}} the semi final, Millwall lost to Birmingham City 2–1 on aggregate. Returning to Villa, he found <b>himself</b> <b>again</b> a first choice striker, partnering Darius Vassell up front. Dublin was sent off at Villa Park for a headbutt on Robbie Savage in the Birmingham derby match, which ended 2–0 to Birmingham City.|$|E

With the total on 28, and both batsmen with two fours to their name, Denesh Ramdin threw up the ball after an appeal off Cook, who scurried for a single in the confusion. Cook was awarded a run, though as the ball hadn't hit bat and he wasn't caught behind, it was eventually a bye. Then, Ramdin let slip a sitter through his legs which went on to hit his helmet, boosting the English with a mandatory five penalty runs before the second day's play ended.|$|E
25|$|Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to {{personally}} collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him without his knowledge. Lucifer easily overpowers Gabriel, burns Gabriel's wings and banishes Mammon. In return for his help, Lucifer grants Constantine any wish. Constantine asks that Isabel {{be released to}} Heaven. Lucifer complies, but then realizes that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence. By selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer heals Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer, hoping he will eventually make a mistake and damn <b>himself</b> <b>again.</b> Angela and Constantine depart, leaving the now human Gabriel. Sometime later, Constantine, now {{making an effort to}} quit smoking, entrusts the Spear to Angela and visits Chas' grave, where Chas appears in an angelic form and flies away.|$|E
25|$|In October 1452, Ömer and {{his brother}} {{accompanied}} Turahan in another expedition against the Morea, {{which was designed to}} prevent the Despotate from assisting in the forthcoming Ottoman attack on the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. After the Turks breached the rebuilt Hexamilion, the Byzantines put up little resistance, and Turahan's troops plundered their way from Corinthia to Messenia. Ahmed however was captured in an ambush at Dervenakia and imprisoned in Mistra. The Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453 had great repercussions in the Morea. The two despots continued their rivalry and were unpopular among their own subjects. A rebellion broke out against them in autumn, supported both by the local Albanian immigrants and the native Greeks, and spread quickly. As the Sultan's vassals, the despots called upon Turahan for aid, and he dispatched Ömer in December. Ömer achieved a few successes, but departed after securing the release of his brother from captivity. The revolt did not subside, and in 1454 Turahan <b>himself,</b> <b>again</b> accompanied by his sons, was forced to intervene and quell the revolt.|$|E
