This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how much <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E

Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the right to take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E

25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E

In a 1930s argument with black student Pierre Kalmek, Bolshevik politician Dmitry Manuilsky emphasized that in America [...] "whites have the privilege to lynch Negroes, but Negroes {{do not have the}} privilege to lynch whites."

500|$|Drummer Mullen said of {{the song}} in 1983:"We're into the {{politics}} of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to put up with}} this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers– proof enough of their usefulness to society. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to be 'supercrips' {{in order to be}} valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E

500|$|Grey is {{the protagonist}} and {{focal point of}} the series. She has been called [...] "intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, oftentimes outspoken, easily distracted, and indecisive" [...] by Grey's Anatomy executives. Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex." [...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we <b>do,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs.

500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to go there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. I think it was just so implausible and just an image that Black folks don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane! It's going brilliantlyshe's a wonderful woman, she's really smart, she's really strong, a real team player. She's a great addition." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to look at that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness ("Why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to wait until tonight?", [...] ", I'm married"), women responded with shock and disgust ("You've got to be kidding", [...] "What is wrong with you?
