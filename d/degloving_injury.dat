50|$|Though African spiny mice {{originated}} in the deserts of Africa, they are frequently kept as exotic pets {{in other parts of}} the world, particularly Western nations such as the United States. In the pet trade, they are most commonly referred to as Egyptian spiny mice or, more simply, spiny mice. Though these animals are similar to pet mice and rats, the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate. Therefore, the spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a <b>degloving</b> <b>injury.</b> Their diet is also rather hard to maintain because their bodies have odd reactions to certain foods.|$|E

Serena later backed down when Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) wanted to bring a patient, with a <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> to her leg, up to Keller. Chrissie told Serena {{about the history of}} the patient and gave her photographs of her injury. Russell stated that Serena could not resist the chance to operate as the area of surgery was her speciality. However, Serena wanted to perform the operation on AAU and asked Chrissie to join her in surgery, as she was impressed by her. Serena also wanted Chrissie to move to Keller and be close by her side, as she realised Chrissie had no problems standing up to authority figures. Serena was later reunited with Imelda Cousins (Tessa Peake-Jones) when she was appointed acting CEO of the hospital. Serena and Imelda previously worked together, but Serena does not immediately recall Imelda, as the last time they met Imelda was overweight. Peake-Jones commented [...] "It takes a little while for Serena to realise their shared memories!" ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReconstruction of {{bilateral}} soft tissue defects {{in hand and}} distal third of the forearm, is a challenge for any reconstructive surgeon. When there is circumferential skin loss affecting the whole hand and fingers as in major <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries,</b> the extent of tissue required for reconstruction narrows down the choice of flaps. When the injury affects both hands {{the magnitude of the}} problem becomes compounded. There is no report in the literature of free skin flaps to cover circumferential <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> in both hands. We are presenting the technical considerations and outcome of pedicled abdominal flaps used for immediate coverage of circumferential <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> of both hands...|$|R
50|$|<b>Degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> {{invariably}} require major surgical interventions.

Post-operative physiotherapy is of particular importance for <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> involving the hand.|$|R
40|$|Originally {{described}} in 1853 by Dr. Morel-Lavellee, closed internal <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> represent an important, althoughuncommon, source of morbidity in trauma patients. These injuries are typically {{the result of}} a shearing or crushing force thattraumatically separates the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the underlying fat. This results in disruption of perforatingblood vessels and lymphatics, leading to hematoma/seroma formation. We describe two cases in which industrial crushinjuries resulted in lumbar transverse process fracture. Both patients developed closed <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> of the flank. Tothe author’s knowledge, this is the first case series describing the occurrence of closed internal <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> of theflank with transverse process fractures. We advise that a high level of suspicion for these lesions to occur with transversespinal fractures should be maintained, as they may arise several years after initial injury...|$|R
5000|$|This {{internal}} {{dialogue is}} mixed with descriptions of Jessie's more and more desperate attempts {{to get out of}} the handcuffs, first by trying to break the headboard she was cuffed to then by trying to slip off the bed and pushing the bed to the bureau where the keys were placed. Finally, she does escape after one of the voices in her head tells her that if she stays another night, The Space Cowboy, who she dreamed of as a manifestation of Death, will more than likely take a part of her to add to its trophy [...] "fishing creel" [...] filled with jewelry and human bones, killing her in the process. Jessie escapes the handcuffs by slicing her wrist open all the way around on a broken glass and giving herself a <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> in order to lubricate her skin enough for the cuffs, which were made for men and not women and thus almost loose enough for her to slip out normally, to slide off her right hand. She is then able to move behind the bed, push it over to the bureau and use one of the keys to unlock her left handcuff. However, she has lost a lot of blood and passes out shortly after. When she awakens, it is now nighttime, and the Space Cowboy has made his way back into the house. Jessie confronts him and throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along, then turns and runs out of the house. She is able to make it into her car and finally escape the house, but is terrified to discover the Space Cowboy sitting in the backseat of the car. Jessie crashes out of fear and is knocked unconscious, and it is later revealed that she only imagined the Space Cowboy in the backseat.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Two {{different}} rat {{models for}} <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> were {{described in the}} literature. Our aim {{in this study is}} to compare these rat models to determine which one is more reliable and reproducible. Methods: We surgically induced <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> on tails and left hindlimbs of Wistar albino rats (n =  8), and sutured the avulsed tissues back in their original positions after a waiting period. We observed the changes in the avulsed flaps every other day for 10 days. At the end of follow-up period we evaluated the lesions in avulsed flaps by macroscopic measurement of necrosis and histological ulcer scoring using the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) Scale. Results: The average length of necrosis in avulsed tail flaps was 28. 42  ±  3. 04  mm, whereas there was no necrosis in avulsed hindlimb flaps (p <  0. 05). The average ulcer score of the lesions in tail and left hindlimb were 3. 42  ±  0. 78, and 1. 28  ±  0. 48, respectively (p <  0. 05). Despite the lack of visible necrosis TUNEL staining revealed an increased amount of apoptotic cells in avulsed hindlimb flaps. Literature review revealed a significant variability in previous studies in terms of the amount of necrosis observed in tail <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> model. Conclusion: Tail <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> model proved to be a more reliable animal model for degloving injuries. However, standardization of the magnitude of degloving force is required to decrease the variability of necrosis observed in the literature...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{summarize}} {{the characteristics of}} total hand <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> and investigate the curative effect of microsurgery. MethodsA total of 46 patients with total hand <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> were enrolled in this study. The injury classification and treatment methods were as follows: Type I (11 cases), treated by replantation of the gloved skin; Type II (6 cases), treated by reconstruction using thumb wrap-around flap and second toe; Type III (4 cases), treated by reconstruction using bilateral second toe with dorsal foot flap; Type IV (9 cases), treated by replantation in situ or reconstruction; Type V (16 cases), treated by replantation or abdominal flap reconstruction. ResultsOf the patients who received Type I treatment, five completely survived, whereas eight had finger necrosis. In Type II, both the reconstructed fingers and hand flaps survived. For four patients who received Type III treatment, eight reconstructed fingers survived. In Type IV, two patients with reconstructed fingers survived, whereas the six with replantation in situ had necrosis of the partial palmar or hand dorsum skin. In Type V, nine patients with reconstructed fingers survived, and five cases with abdominal skin flap reconstruction and one case with anterolateral femoral flap survived. The restoration of hand appearance and function was the best in patients who received replantation. For reconstruction cases, however, the hand function was recovered to the basic self-care level. In cases with abdominal flap reconstruction, the hand function showed poor recovery. ConclusionTotal hand <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> can be classified into different types according to the injury degree.

40|$|In the {{postoperative}} {{treatment of}} hand surgery, {{it is important}} to start exercise therapy as early as possible. In conventional negative pressure wound therapy, the fingers are immobilized by the film dressing covering the wound and hand, thereby preventing sufficient rehabilitation. Here, we devised a bag-type negative pressure wound therapy that makes it possible to start finger exercises almost immediately, and we applied it to 4 patients:one each with hand burns, symmetrical peripheral gangrene, a crush injury accompanied by extensive skin defects and a fingertip <b>degloving</b> <b>injury.</b> The duration of the bag-type negative pressure wound therapy ranged from three to eight weeks, and good granulation was achieved, so that a skin graft was not required. In addition, particularly {{in the case of the}} fingertip <b>degloving</b> <b>injury,</b> good nail regeneration was achieved. Except for the case of symmetrical peripheral gangrene, a good range of joint motion with a percent total active motion (%TAM) of 94. 7 % or more was achieved.

We report a case of marginal artery rupture with coronary sinus rupture after a CS lead extraction. A 71 -year-old male was admitted for extraction of a 6 -year-old implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead due to fracture from insulation break. During the lead extraction, blood pressure fell precipitously and echocardiographic findings were consistent with pericardial effusion. After unsuccessful pericardiocentesis, open chest sternotomy and evacuation of hematoma was performed. Subsequent surgical repair of several injuries was completed including the distal coronary sinus, a large <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> of posterior portion of the heart, and first obtuse marginal branch bleed.

40|$|Introduction: Hemorrhage is {{the most}} common cause of shock in injured patients. Bleeding into the {{subcutaneous}} plane is underestimated cause of hypovolemic shock. Presentation of case: Unrestrained male driver involved in a rollover car crash. On examination, his pulse rate was 144  bpm, blood pressure 80 / 30  mmHg, and GCS was 7 / 15. His right pupil was dilated but reactive. Back examination revealed severe contusion with friction burns and lacerations. A Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma (FAST) was performed. No free intraperitoneal fluid was detected. CT scan of the brain has shown right temporo-parietal subdural hematoma and extensive hematoma in the deep subcutaneous soft tissues of the back. Decompressive cranicotomy and evacuation of the subdural hematoma was performed. On the 4 th postoperative day, three liters of dark brown altered blood was drained from the subcutaneous plane. Discussion: The patient developed severe hypovolemic shock and our aim was to identify and control the source of bleeding during the resuscitation. The source of bleeding was not obvious. Severe shearing force in blunt trauma causes separation between the loose subcutaneous tissues and the underlying relatively immobile deep fascia. This is known as post-traumatic closed <b>degloving</b> <b>injury.</b> To our knowledge this is the first reported case in the English Literature with severe subcutaneous hemorrhage in blunt trauma patients without any previous medical disease. Conclusion: Bleeding into the subcutaneous plane in closed <b>degloving</b> <b>injury</b> can cause severe hypovolemic shock.

40|$|Morel-Lavallée lesions are cystic lesions {{occurring}} {{between the}} subcutaneous tissue {{and the underlying}} layer of a fascia. The most frequent mechanism of occurrence is posttraumatic, usually after <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries.</b> The chain of events leading to the occurrence of this lesion is {{the formation of a}} potential space between the subcutaneous tissue and the firmly attached deep fascia, which in turn fills with blood and/or lymph and/or necrotic fat, secondary to disruption of the capillaries. We present a case of a 74 -year-old male patient with a cystic lesion of the lateral surface of his left thigh increasing in size over a period of six months. Despite the meticulous history acquisition, we were unable to reveal any alleged mechanism of injury of the area. The patient underwent an MRI which revealed an ovoid cyst. The patient underwent surgical excision of the cyst. The pathology examination revealed a simple cyst, lined by a fibrous capsule and filled with serosanguineous fluid, thus confirming the diagnosis.

40|$|Post-traumatic cysts of {{soft tissue}} usually {{occur at the}} {{junction}} of the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia, most often filled with serosanguinous fluid and lined with fibrous tissue. It appears as complication after closed <b>degloving</b> <b>injuries</b> when crushing and shearing forces cause separation of the skin and subcutaneous fat from the deep fascia and muscle, creating a cavity filled with hematoma and liquefied fat. This rare condition calls Morel-Lavallee lesion, which was first described by this French physician in 1853. Unrecognized injuries will evolve in cystic formation filled with serous fluid. Predestined regions of body {{for this kind of}} trauma are trochanteric, proximal thigh and ischiolumbal, most often associated with a pelvic girdle fracture. Long-standing Morel-Lavallee lesion may either remain stable or occasionally expand and can induce chronic pain.
