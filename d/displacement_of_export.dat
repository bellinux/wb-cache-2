Second, to what extent has Chinese competition led to the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> South African <b>exports?</b> Third, in which countries have South African exports been most affected? Fourth, which South African export sectors face the greatest threat from Chinese competition? Finally, how does South Africa's experience compare to that of Brazil, another middle-income country and regional power. We find that competition between South Africa and China increased significantly over the past decade, particularly in African markets.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} called {{attention}} that China may limit the export diversification and technological upgrading of {{countries such as}} Brazil, in its traditional markets for manufactures. The {{aim of the research}} is to estimate the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> Brazilian <b>exports</b> by China in the markets of South American countries, Mexico, the United States, European Union and African countries (Nigeria, South Africa and Mozambique) between 2002 - 2011. The model of constant market share (CMS) was used to estimate the loss of Brazil and China coincident exports in the markets selected. The study shows that the losses attributed to China were higher in the United States in the years 2002 - 2006 and in South America increased thereafter. Moreover, in the South American region the biggest losses are in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, but have been increasing in the markets of the other partners, especially in Argentina. Geographical proximity and the granting of a system of free intra - regional trade {{to a wide range of}} products did not prevent the displacement effect by China in the South American region Thus, Brazil's response should be in the direction of identifying and strengthening its competitive bases in the region through favorable policies to the creation of productive complementary - regional value chains...|$|R
40|$|We take {{advantage}} of a novel dataset that incorporates both the technological content of each product as well as its quality to unveil some new features of Brazil-ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trade flows and to challenge the view that the emergence of China would imply the deindustrialization <b>of</b> Brazilian <b>exports.</b> The trade between the two countries builds on <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> commodity goods from Brazil to China and of manufactured products from China to Brazil. Looking at the technological dimension of the dataset we show that Brazil (increasingly) exports to China products with lower technological content and (increasingly) imports products with higher technological content. The quality dimension of the dataset reveals that both countries export to each other basically low-quality goods (i. e. products whose unitvalue are in the lower range of worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distribution of unit-values for the product). We then show that the overlapping between Brazilian and Chinese total exports is limited and that the degree of competition between the two countries is relatively small. We also show that the number of products in which the two countries have comparative advantage declined in the last years and that in the last years both countries increased their advantage in the products in which they already had advantage in 1994 and lost advantage in the sectors in which they had small advantage in producing in 1994. Available data analyzed in this paper evidences that in the last years Brazilian <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> commodity products increased significantly due to the emergence of China and other Asian countries. We show, however, that Brazilian <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> high technological content and high quality increased more than the average and more than low technological and low quality exports in the last years. Overall, the emergence of China has been supporting a <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> Brazilian <b>exports</b> not only towards naturalbased products but also to goods with higher quality and higher technological content. ...|$|R

It is achieved, however, by the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> forest extraction to other countries {{on the order of}} 49 (34 – 70) M m 3, or ≈ 39 % of the regrowth of Vietnam's forests from 1987 to 2006. Approximately half of wood imports to Vietnam during this period were illegal. Leakage due to policies restricting forest exploitation and displacement due to growing domestic consumption and exports contributed respectively to an estimated 58 % and 42 % <b>of</b> total <b>displacement.</b> <b>Exports</b> <b>of</b> wood products from Vietnam also grew rapidly, amounting to 84 % <b>of</b> the <b>displacement,</b> which is a remarkable feature of the forest transition in Vietnam.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of Chinese competition on South African manufacturing exports to its major markets in Europe, the USA and Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper considers four related research questions. First, are China and South Africa competing {{with each other in}} export markets, how extensive is such competition and how is this changing over time? Second, to what extent has Chinese competition led to the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> South African <b>exports</b> in its major markets? Third, in which countries have South African exports been most affected? Finally, which South African export sectors face the greatest threat from Chinese competition? We find that competition between South Africa and China has increased significantly over the past decade, particularly in African markets. This has been a result of growth <b>of</b> Chinese <b>exports</b> both at the intensive and the extensive margins, with the number of products which they export in common increasing, as well as China increasing its share of the import market for products which it already exported {{at the start of the}} period. All types <b>of</b> manufactured <b>exports</b> lost ground to China, but the impact is strongest in low technology products. South African exports have nevertheless increased from 2001. The “crowding out” that has been described in the paper is therefore a relative story and not one of absolute declines in South African exports. The “crowding out” also only refers to manufacturing and not to primary products where Chinese economic growth and demand for resources has enhanced South African exports to third countries through rising commodity prices. This paper is based on research carried out for project on “Chinese Competition and the Restructuring of South African Manufacturing” funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council, Grant No. ES/ 1035125 / 1.

The extent of success is even much critical for enterprises. Therefore this study establishes the factors which influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success which measures the extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Design- Primary data were collected from 52 managers and representatives <b>of</b> horticultural <b>exporting</b> firms through a semi-structured questionnaire. The tobit model was used to estimate the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success by horticultural enterprises in Ghana. Findings- The result indicates that, manager’s educational level, managers past experience, manager trained in export management, manager’s entrepreneurial orientation, presence <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department, product diversification and government support directly influences the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Export barriers and constraints in accessing working capital negatively influences intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Practical implications- Personnel or personal development in terms <b>of</b> training in <b>export</b> management and build up of experience is important in the quest to improve the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Organizational reforms such as institution <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department and diversifying horticultural export products improves the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. To improve the intensity of success, external factors such as working capital inaccessibility and trade barriers should be addressed by various stake holders.

Here {{we focus on}} how these key factors interact to influence the results seen once reserves are created. For a settlement-limited fishery, <b>export</b> <b>of</b> increased production from within reserves can offset the effects of displaced fishing effort. We develop simple mathematical models that indicate net fisheries benefits can accrue at closures up to and perhaps beyond 50 % of total stock area through the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> production, given documented average increases in biomass within reserves. However, reserve monitoring programs face problems identifying independent control sites because the spatial extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> is unknown. Efforts to monitor reserve impacts on recruitment are further {{complicated by the fact}} that large reserve closures are likely necessary before significant changes in recruitment can be detected above normal interannual fluctuations. Resolving these limitations requires comprehensive monitoring data before reserves are implemented. Fortunately, studies of reserves that used Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) experimental designs show that control and reserve sites were equivalent prior to protection, and that control sites improved after reserves were in place. Consequently, any bias in our current perception of reserve impacts likely underestimates their effect...|$|R
