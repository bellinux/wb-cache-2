5|$|Doris Schattschneider {{identifies}} 11 {{strands of}} mathematical and scientific research anticipated or directly inspired by Escher. These are {{the classification of}} regular tilings using the edge relationships of tiles: two-color and two-motif tilings (counterchange symmetry or antisymmetry); color symmetry (in crystallography); metamorphosis or topological change; covering surfaces with symmetric patterns; Escher's algorithm (for generating patterns using decorated squares); creating tile shapes; local versus global definitions of regularity; symmetry of a tiling <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> the symmetry of a tile; orderliness not <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> symmetry groups; the filling of the central void in Escher's lithograph Print Gallery by H. Lenstra and B. de Smit.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of cysts is <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> {{changes in the}} concentration of nutrients in the medium and addition of some organic substances such as ethanol, n-butanol, or β-hydroxybutyrate. Cysts are rarely formed in liquid media. The {{formation of}} cysts is <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> chemical factors and is accompanied by metabolic shifts, changes in catabolism, respiration, and biosynthesis of macromolecules; it is also affected by aldehyde dehydrogenase and the response regulator AlgR.|$|E

50|$|The PFKFB3 {{promoter}} {{is predicted}} to contain multiple binding sites, including Sp-1 and AP-2 binding sites. It also contains motifs for the binding of E-box, nuclear factor-1 (NF-1), and progesterone response element. Expression of the promoter is shown to be <b>induce</b> <b>by</b> phorbol esters and cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling.|$|R
5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} downstream {{target of}} ATM and ATR is p53, {{as it is}} required for inducing apoptosis following DNA damage. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.|$|E
5|$|Hsp90 is {{exploited}} by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often mutated, amplified or translocated in malignancy, and Hsp90 works to buffer these cellular stresses <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 {{leads to the}} degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz's sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale is removed), Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> trauma to the skin), and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale mining {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. They include acid drainage <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities.|$|E
