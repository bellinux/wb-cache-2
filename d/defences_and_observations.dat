2500|$|Land {{clearing}} operations {{had been}} undertaken by 1st Field Squadron since {{the occupation of}} Nui Dat to improve base <b>defences</b> <b>and</b> <b>observation.</b> Later they were extended for tactical purposes to open up key routes within Phuoc Tuy by removing vegetation to deny cover and concealment to the Viet Cong, and also provided arable land for villagers {{as part of the}} Pacification program. In March 1968, a dedicated Land Clearing Team was formed by 17th Construction Squadron elements at Nui Dat to supplement existing arrangements. One particular operation, codenamed [...] "Cooktown Orchid" [...] conducted in April 1968, saw a large element of Plant Troop deploy under infantry and armoured protection to clear undergrowth and trees {{in the foothills of the}} Long Hai mountains. Land clearance operations proved quite dangerous for the plant operators who were exposed to land mines and booby traps, as well as to attack by small arms and other direct fire weapons. During this operation one D8 bulldozer was destroyed, and a sapper injured when an RPG round hit the dozer he was operating. In 1969 the squadron continued with land clearing tasks within the 1 ATF area of operations. During the operation, numerous bunker systems were uncovered and the D8 dozers detonated many mines. In August 1969, 9 Troop assisted in replacing a sabotaged bridge with a [...] floating pontoon bridge. The enemy had blown the bridge on National Route 51, [...] south-east of Saigon. The troop, working with the US Engineers, took only 13 hours to re-open the road.|$|R

5000|$|Research {{undertaken}} {{comparing the}} vocalisations of Australian falcons, found that two structurally distinct calls were emitted when a male hobby was restrained. This included a wide band harmonic vocalisation and a trill-type vocalisation. The trill-type vocalisation was given sporadically upon initial handling and harmonic vocalisation was assessed {{as the most}} common call of the species being used in situations of territorial <b>defence</b> <b>and</b> mobbing. [...] <b>Observations</b> of hobbys during breeding identified that two main calls were used by adults. One was a rapid peevish chatter Kee-Kee-Kee-Kee-Kee which was given by the male as he brought prey to the nest area and was given by both sexes in alarm, when mobbing other predatory birds and when selecting and defending the nest. The second call resembled a squeaky chittering and ticking {{which appears to be}} used in a social dominance and food possession or food begging context. Juveniles were observed calling in an unslurred chittering whine when begging for food and in a chattering kee-kee-kee… when alarmed, or excited, from the feathering stage.Calls by the Australian hobby are similar, but higher pitched, to the male peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) when arriving at the nest with food. The hobby is also described as having similar ‘alarm’ and contact calls to the Australian kestrel (Falco cenchroides).|$|R
