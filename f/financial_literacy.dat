Aside from direct building of housing, more than 4,000 families received transitional or upgraded shelters, more than 350 houses were repaired and rehabilitated, more than 24,500 emergency shelter kits were distributed, and more than 12,000 damage assessments were conducted (Habitat For Humanity International).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that only 6 % of South African citizens can maintain their standard of living during retirement. This is of great concern to both the government and individuals. In an attempt to counter this dilemma, the government has implemented several new tax exemptions and deductions to encourage taxpayers to increase their retirement savings. However, uncertainty exists regarding the effectiveness of these exemptions and deductions. For individuals to benefit from same, they will need to be informed on and understand the principles on which they are based. Above all, South African citizens need to grasp the importance of ensuring their financial security during retirement, which will hopefully create a culture of saving for that purpose. South Africans therefore need to increase their level of <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy,</b> either by informing themselves in that regard, or by consulting with professionals. This study was conducted from a South African perspective and focused on the probability of <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy</b> increasing <b>financial</b> independence during retirement. The data presented in this study was collected by means of two questionnaires, which were emailed to a selection of participants. The {{purpose of this study was}} first to determine the <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy</b> of South Africans with regard to retirement planning and second, to determine whether <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy</b> could increase <b>financial</b> independence during retirement. This study is an empirical study since primary data was collected specifically for this research project. Based on the data obtained by means of the questionnaires, it was concluded that the <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy</b> of the majority of South Africans is not sufficient to intentionally benefit from tax-beneficial retirement funds and investments. It was further concluded that although the majority of South Africans are not sufficiently financially literate to be able to optimise their retirement savings, they are willing to improve their level of <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy</b> and increase their savings towards retirement once they have been informed and have gained some understanding in this regard. Therefore, <b>financial</b> and tax <b>literacy</b> can potentially increase financial independence during retirement. Mini Dissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

30|$|Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a 3 -year {{cycle of}} large scale {{international}} assessments organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) since 2000. The first PISA survey {{was launched in}} 2000, followed by the cycles of 2003, 2006, 2009, and recently in 2012. In each cycle, PISA has assessed three key domains of knowledge and skill, namely reading, mathematics, and science literacies. Each of the three domains is cyclically treated as a major domain. For PISA 2012, {{the focus was on}} mathematics literacy with two newly added domains: problem-solving and <b>financial</b> <b>literacies.</b> PISA offers insight for education policy and practice, which helps to monitor trends in students’ acquisition of knowledge, and skills across countries, economies and different demographic subgroups within each country.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the impact of selected socioeconomic factors on financial education. Using a questionnaire, data were obtained from {{a convenience sample of}} 204 participants from several Alabama Black Belt Counties, and analyzed using descriptive statistics and logit analysis. The results showed that a majority had not taken financial education classes; therefore, many were willing to take the classes. In line with the preceding finding, therefore, only a few (nearly 21 %) got at least, 25 % of <b>financial</b> term <b>literacy</b> questions correct. In addition, two socioeconomic factors, number of persons in household and educational level, had a statistically significant effect on whether or not participants had taken prior financial education classes. Educational level, however, had a greater effect than number of persons in household (p = 0. 000 versus p = 0. 018). Consequently, it was recommended that policies and programs that encourage financial education in particular and higher education in general be put in place for residents in the study area. This is likely to significantly improve <b>financial</b> knowledge or <b>literacy,</b> ultimately leading to better personal finance decision making.

Romany ethnic group is better characterized by an inconsistent model compared to the non-Romany using an more consistent model. Participants from both groups, however, appear to be very impatient, with discount rates closer to the values of individuals dependent on addictive substances.
