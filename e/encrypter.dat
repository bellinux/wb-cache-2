40|$|In {{analogy to}} the {{well-known}} notion of finite [...] state compressibility of individual sequences, due to Lempel and Ziv, we define a similar notion of "finite-state encryptability" {{of an individual}} plaintext sequence, as the minimum asymptotic key rate that must be consumed by finite-state <b>encrypters</b> {{so as to guarantee}} perfect secrecy in a well-defined sense. Our main basic result is that the finite-state encryptability is equal to the finite-state compressibility for every individual sequence. This is in parallelism to Shannon's classical probabilistic counterpart result, asserting that the minimum required key rate is equal to the entropy rate of the source. However, the redundancy, defined as the gap between the upper bound (direct part) and the lower bound (converse part) in the encryption problem, turns out to decay at a different rate (in fact, much slower) than the analogous redundancy associated with the compression problem. We also extend our main theorem in several directions, allowing: (i) availability of side information (SI) at the encrypter/decrypter/eavesdropper, (ii) lossy reconstruction at the decrypter, and (iii) the combination of both lossy reconstruction and SI, {{in the spirit of the}} Wyner [...] Ziv problem.

50|$|In the Nordia <b>Encrypter</b> School, Akueldo rebel leaders plan to {{transport}} the druid Mona through Cross Land and into Idorus. Mona carries a forbidden original Nothingness Kartia that can destroy all of existence. Using a local band of thieves, Mona is escorted from Cross Land to eastern Idorus lands belonging to Count Shinon. The Count's daughter, Ele, discovers this plot and mounts a rescue with the free knight Toxa and two members of Vigilance, Alana and Duran. They save Mona and capture the Akueldo contact Misty. The remaining thieves attack the estate and Misty joins the party to redeem herself. Meanwhile, at Vigilance headquarters {{in the city of}} Kainas, Lacryma is left in command while chief Rimazan is away at Pentagram with her adopted father, Bishop Aile. Lacryma, along with Vigilance members Troy, Posha and Kun arrive at an inn overrun with stray Phantoms. The following morning, Troy is arrested by <b>Encrypter</b> police who suspect him of Kartia theft. One of the guards on duty is questioned using evidence found at the inn and exposed as the Akueldo rebel Zakuro. He is subdued and jailed, but later released by a fellow rebel named Cross. Rimzan returns to Kainas to defend the local Shrines' World Tree from the Akueldo agent Karis.

Later, the Pentagram Cardinal Belthshumeltz cuts off Saradiart's left arm to create a new original Heaven Kartia. Back at the Kainas Shrine, Lacryma confronts Aile about her parents. He recounts how Lacryma died from disease twelve years ago and that Shell used the original Life Kartia to bring her back, killing Shell in the process. Lacryma opens Shell's grave but discovers no remains and runs off, but Bachstail stays behind and finds the real original Death Kartia inside. Since Toxa used a forgery, Saradiart revives and swears vengeance on his former allies. He summons Eden with the original Earth Kartia, which falls and crushes Idorus. Saradiart's elven blood allows him to use an original without fear of death.|$|E

Troy uses it to complete his illegal sketches, determines {{that it is the}} original Human Kartia and that Vandor will be unable to create a copy without it. Meanwhile, Toxa meets with an elder elf and learns that Eden is the native home of Phantoms. The elder elf also mentions that Mona's powers can stop Saradiart and end the chaos. The elves give Toxa's party flying dragons to hasten their journey towards Nordia. They head towards the Nordia <b>Encrypter</b> School, where Lacryma's group awaits. Toxa gives a speech to rouse the troops, but Ele notices that Lacryma is still visibly shaken. Lacryma's party fights Vandor, but Kun stops her from killing her father. With new found resolve, Vandor calls himself Kainas once again and Troy gives him the finished text for the Human Kartia. Kainas asks Lacryma to stop Belthshumeltz while he battles Raguruzet.|$|E

The rebels wish {{to create the}} floating paradise of Eden, which requires the original Heaven and Earth Kartias made of elven bone and blood. Despite Toxa's objections, Shinon and Duran send Mona away to Pentagram. After she leaves the estate, Duran and Misty realize that the escort was a disguised rebel. Toxa's party pursues Mona, but are blocked by Idorus knights that have joined the rebellion. Misty distracts {{a large number of}} the enemy but is captured, while Karis comes to Toxa's rescue. She reveals that she and Bachstail are Inquirers and that she will help Toxa free Mona and Misty if he takes the Death Kartia from the Idorus <b>Encrypter</b> School. Toxa agrees to the plan and is able to retrieve the original. Lacryma volunteers to bait the rebels in Idorus, both to see her father and prove she doesn't need to be an Inquirer to do her job. At Idorus Fortress she questions Vandor as to why he has joined the Akueldo rebels. He reveals that her deceased mother, Shell, can be revived using the original Human Kartia located on Eden. Mona visits Lacryma in her cell and gives her the Nothingness Kartia, believing she'll do right with it.

Former Vigilance member Bachstail arrives and re-enlists, much {{to the chagrin of}} Lacryma. Rimzan assigns two parties to fight the thieves, each led by Lacryma and Duran. Before leaving, Troy gives Alana sketches of an illegal text and later asks Bachstail to read another copy. Bachstail states that they pertain to a forbidden original Kartia. Each party runs into problems during the operation. Toxa repeatedly leaves for the Shinon estate to visit Mona when he should be fighting, Ele accidentally tells Lacryma about Misty's past and Bachstail's actions causes Karis to retreat as soon as she spots him. After dealing with these struggles, the two teams are able to stop the thieves led by Cross and Zakuro. Rimzan departs for Nordia, leaving Lacryma in charge of Vigilance. Rimzan is seriously injured fighting Akueldo leader Saradiart, while Karis observes with Akueldo commander Raguruzet. Saradiart seems immortal, but Raguruzet states that he can be killed with the original Death Kartia. After the battle, Karis stays behind to treat Rimzan's wounds and vows to stop Saradiart.

40|$|Abstract. In Eurocrypt‚Äô 98, Blaze et al. {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} proxy re-encryption (PRE). It allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a ciphertext originally intended for Alice into one which can be decrypted by Bob, without the proxy knowing the corresponding plaintext. PRE has found many applications, such as in encrypted e-mail forwarding [8], distributed secure file systems [1, 2], multicast [10]cloud computation etc. However, all the PRE schemes until now require the delegator (or the delegator and the delegatee cooperatively) to generate the re-encryption keys. We observe {{that this is not}} the only way to generate the re-encryption keys, the <b>encrypter</b> also has the ability to generate re-encryption keys. Based on this observation, we introduce a new primitive: PRE +, which is almost the same as the traditional PRE except the re-encryption keys generated by the <b>encrypter.</b> Interestingly, this PRE + can be viewed as the dual of the traditional PRE. Compared with PRE, PRE + can easily achieve the non-transferable property and message-level based finegrained delegation, while these two properties are very desirable in practical applications. We first categorize PRE + as the single-hop and multi-hop variant and discuss its potential applications, then we give the definition and security model for the single-hop PRE +, construct a concrete scheme and prove its security. Finally we conclude our paper with many interesting open problems. ...|$|E

In this paper, aiming at providing secure cloud data sharing services in cloud storage, we propose a scalable and controllable cloud data sharing framework for cloud users (called: Scanf). To this end, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, namely, PRE+, which {{can be seen as}} the dual of traditional proxy re-encryption (PRE) primitive.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{practical}} identity-based encryption scheme which {{is suitable for}} wireless sensor network (WSN). We call it Receiver-Bounded Online/Offline Identity-based Encryption (RB-OOIBE). It splits the encryption process into two parts ‚Äì the offline and the online part. In the offline part, all heavy computations are done without {{the knowledge of the}} receiver‚Äôs identity and the plaintext message. In the online stage, only light computations such as modular operation and symmetric key encryption are required, together with the receiver‚Äôs identity and the plaintext message. Moreover, since each offline ciphertext can be re-used for the same receiver, the number of offline ciphertexts the <b>encrypter</b> holds only confines the number of receivers instead of the number of messages to be encrypted. In this way, a sensor node (with limited computation power and limited storage) in WSN can send encrypted data easily: A few offline ciphertexts can be computed in the manufacturing stage while the online part is light enough for the sensor to process. We propose an efficient construction for this new notion. The scheme can be proven selective-ID CCA secure in the standard model.

40|$|We {{propose a}} fully {{homomorphic}} encryption scheme ‚Äì i. e., a scheme that {{allows one to}} evaluate circuits over encrypted data {{without being able to}} decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result ‚Äì that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable. Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable. Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC 1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits. Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable ‚Äì i. e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the <b>encrypter</b> to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem...|$|E
