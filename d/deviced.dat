However, perhaps due to the Greeks' adoption of the Sumerian constellation, some confusion surrounds {{the identity of the}} archer. [...] Some identify Sagittarius as the centaur Chiron, the son of Philyra and Cronus and tutor to Jason, who was said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife, Rhea. However since there are two centaurs in the sky, some identify Chiron with the other, known as the constellation Centaurus. Or, as an alternative tradition holds, that Chiron <b>deviced</b> the constellations Sagittarius and Centaurus to help guide the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece.|$|E

40|$|MasterDesktop environment’s {{mobility}} {{is enabled}} {{by the development}} of mobile <b>devices</b> and virtualization technology. Thus users can use their desktop anywherehowever, desktop mobility has some drawbacks like lack of I/O <b>devices.</b> For instance, mobile <b>devices</b> have small screen and inconvenient input <b>devices.</b> Desktop virtualization solutions only use basic <b>devices</b> virtualized by VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor). So it is needed to extend I/O <b>devices</b> in such environments. This problem can be solved to allocate network <b>devices</b> to user’s desktop dynamically. But users must know network <b>device’s</b> address and driver s/w to use the <b>devices.</b> It isn’t proper solution in a dynamically changing environment. Thus, new <b>device</b> virtualization layer is required to support desktop mobility. The <b>device</b> virtualization layer must manage network <b>devices</b> dynamically and has extensibility for new network <b>devices.</b> In addition, the <b>device</b> virtualization should support that a desktop which want to use network <b>device</b> can access <b>device</b> virtualization layer without additional work.

5000|$|The non-radiative {{dielectric}} (NRD) waveguide [...] {{has been}} introduced by Yoneyama in 1981. In Fig. 1 the cross section of NRD guide is shown: it consists of a dielectric rectangular slab of height a and width b, which is placed between two metallic parallel plates of suitable width. The structure is practically {{the same as the}} H waveguide, proposed by Tischer in 1953. Due to the dielectric slab, the electromagnetic field is confined {{in the vicinity of the}} dielectric region, whereas in the outside region, for suitable frequencies, the electromagnetic field decays exponentially. Therefore, if the metallic plates are sufficiently extended, the field is practically negligible at the end of the plates and therefore the situation does not greatly differ from the ideal case in which the plates are infinitely extended. The polarization of the electric field in the required mode is mainly parallel to the conductive walls. As it is known, if the electric field is parallel to the walls, the conduction losses decrease in the metallic walls at the increasing frequency, whereas, if the field is perpendicular to the walls, losses increase at the increasing frequency. Since the NRD waveguide has been <b>deviced</b> for its implementation at millimeter waves, the selected polarization minimizes the ohmic losses in the metallic walls.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Ferdinand of Hungary {{was able}} to defeat the Swedish army at Regensburg in July 1634. This Ferdinand and his cousin the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand then raced to merge their armies. The Swedish forces of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn desperately tried to prevent this merger, but were unable {{to catch up with}} Ferdinand of Hungary. The Cardinal-Infante crossed the Danube in August 1634. In September both armies were able to merge, and camped south of Nördlingen in Swabia. At that time Nördlingen was {{protected}} by a small Swedish garrison. Shortly thereafter, the armies of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn also reached Nördlingen, preparing the events for the decisive Battle of Nördlingen. Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and his cousin Ferdinand then prepared for battle, ignoring the advice of the more experienced generals, such as the Imperial general Matthias Gallas. Bernhard and Horn also prepared for battle, but they were by now rivals and in disagreement with each other. They also underestimated the numerically superior enemy forces, due to incorrect reports that did not realize the Spanish Army of the late Duke of Feria had joined the Cardinal-Infante and believed that the enemy forces numbered only 7,000, not 21,000 infantry, compared to 16,000 Swedish infantry. During the battle, almost anything that could go wrong went wrong for the Swedish forces, due to the strong defensive efforts of the Spanish Infantry (the most feared Tercios Viejos, mainly those commanded by Fuenclara, Idiáquez and Toralto) after pushing back fifteen Swedish assaults against Blue and Yellow Horn regiments on the hill of Albuch they protected, so the two Ferdinands achieved an outstanding military victory. Gustaf Horn was captured, the Swedish army was destroyed, and the remainder that fled to Heilbronn was only a shadow of the former glorious army.
