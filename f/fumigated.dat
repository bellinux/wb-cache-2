5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was <b>fumigated</b> by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ark Royal transported {{aircraft}} {{across the}} Black Sea to Batumi, {{where they were}} ferried across the Caucasus to the British naval forces supporting White Russian forces fighting the Bolsheviks in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War. The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in late 1919 and disembarked her seaplanes at Malta to load a dozen de Havilland DH-9 bombers and 181 personnel of the supporting Z Force for transport to British Somaliland. The ship arrived in Berbera on 30 December and the squadron was unloaded to support the air and land campaign against the Mad Mullah. Ark Royal served during this campaign solely as a depot and repair ship for the RAF. She was withdrawn before its conclusion and transferred to the Black Sea to support the White Russian forces there {{as they began to}} collapse. The ship twice ferried refugees from the Caucasian coast to the Crimea and, after the second voyage, had to be <b>fumigated</b> at Constantinople after an outbreak of typhus among her passengers. During the summer of 1920, Ark Royal ferried RAF aircraft and personnel to Basra. She then returned to Britain for a refit and was put into reserve at Rosyth in November.|$|E

25|$|The bulk {{of modern}} {{commercial}} production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, <b>fumigated,</b> {{and covered with}} plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, {{in order to encourage}} the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground. Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings. However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of season five, Walt, Jesse and Mike {{eliminate}} their connection to the destroyed lab, and start a new meth production system with a corrupt pest control company, using residents' homes to cook meth while they are <b>fumigated.</b> They are aided by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser), a representative for the conglomerate that owned Gus's franchise. Lydia leaks them information on where to obtain the required chemicals and in return wants some of the meth to sell to the Czech Republic. A young boy sees them during one robbery, and Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons), one of the pest control workers, kills him. Horrified, Jesse and Mike leave the business once they obtain their money from the last meth batch. When Walt learns Hank has connected the blue meth to Mike, he contacts Todd's uncle Jack (Michael Bowen), a criminal with ties to the Aryan Brotherhood, to kill nine of Mike's associates simultaneously to defer suspicion; Walt kills Mike personally. After a few months, Walt has earned more than $80 million from meth, and Skyler convinces him to stop.|$|E
500|$|A {{short time}} after Henry Tudor's {{victory at the}} Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485, his army {{suddenly}} went down with [...] "the English sweat", which contemporary observers described as a new disease. The disease, which was unusual in that it mainly affected the affluent, might have originated in France where Henry VII had recruited soldiers for his army. An epidemic hit London in the hot summer of 1508. Victims died within a day, and there were deaths throughout the city. The streets were deserted apart from carts transporting bodies, and King Henry declared the city off limits except for physicians and apothecaries. The disease spread to Europe, arriving in Hamburg in July 1529 where one to two thousand victims died within the first few weeks. [...] During the following months it wreaked havoc in Prussia, Switzerland, and northern Europe. The last outbreak was in England in 1556. The disease – which killed {{tens of thousands of}} people – was probably influenza or a similar viral infection, but records from the time when medicine was not a science can be unreliable. As medicine became a science, the descriptions of disease became less vague. Although medicine could do little at the time to alleviate the suffering of the victims of infection, measures to control the spread of diseases were used. Restrictions on trade and travel were implemented, stricken families were isolated from their communities, buildings were <b>fumigated</b> and livestock killed.|$|E

2500|$|Janet Parker was {{the last}} person to die from smallpox. [...] The {{diagnosis}} was made by Professor A.

[...] Before the diagnosis had been confirmed, a member of Flewett’s laboratory had [...] collected fluid from Janet Parker’s vesicles and taken it across the grounds of the hospital for examination in the virus laboratory. Flewett recognised the danger of an outbreak occurring and immediately ordered his staff to fumigate the laboratory with formaldehyde. [...] The ward in which Janet Parker had been initially cared for was also <b>fumigated.</b> The building housing wards 31 and 32 were later demolished. Two members of Flewett’s team were subsequently quarantined but apart from Janet Parker’s mother, no further cases of smallpox occurred.

2500|$|To {{cure the}} disease, it is {{necessary}} to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it {{does not need to be}} <b>fumigated</b> any more [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{end of the}} war allowed Knowles to {{continue}} with his studies, and he made a tour of France in 1788. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 led to Knowles returning to active service in command of the 32-gun frigate [...] He was ordered to Halifax, but given permission to move to the Chesapeake, where a French convoy was planning to sail from. Problems with manning his ship meant that Knowles sailed from Portsmouth with a largely inexperienced crew, but Knowles was able to have them fully trained by the time of their arrival at Hampton Roads. Shortly after his arrival, the French escort arrived, and the convoy sailed shortly afterwards, observed by Knowles on the Daedalus. Knowles passed this latest information on to Lord Howe, who moved his Channel fleet to intercept it, setting in motion the events that would lead to the Glorious First of June. Having fulfilled his objective Knowles sailed to Halifax, and from there returned to England. He was appointed to the 74-gun [...] and served in the North Sea. Once again Knowles was beset by difficulties in manning his ship, the Edgar put to sea from the Nore manned by soldiers from 23 different regiments, and commanded by officers from still other regiments. Typhus and 'the itch' were rampant, on the ship's return to port she had to be scrubbed with lime water and <b>fumigated</b> with vinegar, while 100 men were discharged to the hospital. Knowles suffered a further mishap when the Edgar was dismasted in a storm off the Texel, and had to be towed back to the Nore.|$|E
