5|$|EATS {{training}} {{was put on}} hold in January 1942, following the outbreak {{of war in the}} Pacific, but resumed the next month. Owing to urgent requirements to house other RAAF units and elements of the United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), No.2 EFTS was disbanded on 31March 1942, and its operations transferred to No.5 Elementary Flying School at Narromine, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria. By the time it closed, No.2 EFTS had trained 806 EATS students, 610 of whom <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> to SFTSs.|$|E

5|$|Stone Sour is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Stone Sour. It was {{recorded}} and {{produced by the}} band and Tom Tatman at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and was released on August 27, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Writing for the album began in 2000 while vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist Jim Root were still actively involved in their other band, Slipknot. Work began on the album after Slipknot <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> hiatus following touring in support of their second album Iowa.|$|E
5|$|The second {{leg of the}} tour, {{comprising}} 25 arena {{shows in}} Europe from May to June 1992, was announced on 30 April. Ticketing details were kept secret until radio advertisements announced that tickets <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> sale at box offices. In many cases, tickets were limited to two-per-person to deter scalping. Due to the production costs and relatively small arena crowds, the European arena leg lost money. McGuinness had planned larger outdoor concerts in Berlin, Turin, Poland, and Vienna to help the tour break even, but only the Vienna concert occurred.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|On August 28, Michaels and Diesel {{captured}} the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{next day at}} SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel. This triggered a split between Michaels and Diesel, a storyline that was drawn out until Survivor Series that November. Michaels {{went on to win}} the Royal Rumble in 1995, which set up a championship grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel (who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Bob Backlund). As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match and was attacked by Sid the following night. After this, Michaels took time off because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a fan favorite.|$|E

5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> a fossil-collecting {{expedition to}} Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke {{had discovered the}} holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted amicably, Marsh secretly bribed the pit operators to divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope by pointing out that his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (or so he claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published the correction shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Up All Night: The Live Tour debuted {{at number}} one on Billboard Top Music Videos chart with first-week sales of 76,000 copies, surpassing sales of the Billboard 200 number one album, John Mayer's Born and Raised, which sold 65,000 copies.

Actually, Lloyd's List had already reported that Hyperion <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> shore on Summers Island on 13 September, but that part of her cargo had been landed and that she was expected to be refloated.
