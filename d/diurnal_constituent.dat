40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA thirty-four day record of near-bottom temperature and horizontal velocity spanning the lower {{third of the}} water column from within Monterey Canyon was examined. The observed internal tide is highly non-linear with kinetic energy dispersed among numerous overtides near the bottom and more concentrated in the primary semi <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituent</b> (M 2) higher in the water column. The bottom currents and temperature vary in strength over the record period, taking {{on the characteristics of}} an internal bore at times with large up-canyon accelerations accompanied by rapid temperature drops. The bores are nearly phase locked to the sea level variations and arrive at the measurement site ^ 8. 6 h after high tide in Monterey, CA. They are evident in the velocity records up to at least 35 m above the bottom and may be accompanied by high frequency pulses that extend higher. The variation is not caused by direct forcing from the barotropic tidal range as the strongest bores do not exclusively occur during either the spring or neap phase of the barotropic tide.

40|$|The Kochi Backwater (KB) is {{the second}} largest wetland system in India. It is {{connected}} to the sea at Fort Kochi and Munambam (30 km north of Kochi). As the tide is forced through two openings, its propagation in the backwater system is very complicated, particularly in the northern arm of the estuary. Using synchronous water level (WL) and current measurements in the KB from a network of stations during 2007 - 08, it was convenient to demarcate the northern KB into two distinct regions according to the tidal forcing from the north (Pallippuram) and south (Vallarpadam). This demarcation is useful for computing the propagation speeds of the dominant tidal constituents in the northern branch of the KB with dual opening for opposing tides. WL variations indicated that M 2 tide (Principal lunar semidiurnal constituent) dominated in the sea level variance, followed by the K 1 constituent (Luni-solar declinational <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituent).</b> The M 2 tidal influence was strongest near the mouth and decayed in the upstream direction. The propagation speed of the M 2 tide in the southern estuary was ~ 3. 14 m/s.

Measured values near to the grounding line could only be reproduced satisfactorily by increasing the bottom friction coefficient under the ice to 50 times the open-ocean value.

40|$|Several cruises were {{conducted}} to investigate the variability in tidal levels, tidal flows, and water circulation in the Pearl River estuary during the dry and wet seasons in 1998. Unlike other temperate estuaries, the average tidal range was small in the offshore waters and increased gradually towards the estuary, reaching the maximum in the upstream part of the Pearl River estuary. The extent of the amplitude increment was different between the <b>diurnal</b> and semi-diurnal <b>constituents.</b> The percentage of sea level variance in the semi-diurnal band increased when the tide progressed upstream, but it reversed in the diurnal band. Thus, the accentuated sea level variance in the semi-diurnal band resulted in the increased amplitudes of semi-diurnal constituents which were larger than <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents.</b> The distribution of the mean current in the estuary depicted an anti-clockwise circulation in the estuary: freshwater was dominant {{on the western side}} of the estuary, while salt water was dominant on the eastern side. The Pearl River estuary also showed a typical salt wedge circulation: a salt water intrusion largely occurred via the eastern channel in the estuary while river outflow dominated the western channel. In this study, long time series and large spatial coverage of tide and current observations allow in depth analysis of the temporal and spatial variations of tide and circulation, and the associated influence from open ocean in the Pearl River estuary.

40|$|Abstract Approximately {{one year}} of current, temperature, {{salinity}} and pressure data were collected at a site {{near the mouth of}} the Mobile Bay estuary in Alabama. This estuary is broad, shallow (3 m) and relatively flat. Diurnal tides account for 85 % of the current variance in the lower estuary. Tidal currents have significant vertical shear in both amplitude and direction. The principal <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> in the lower bay, O 1 and K 1, have amplitudes that range from 12 to 25 cm/s in the near-surface layer, 9 to 12 cm/s near the bed. The principal axis of the near-surface diurnal ellipse is rotated 30 ° clockwise relative to the near-bottom ellipse. This strong tidal current shear can exist because the estuary has a strong, persistent, haline stratification maintained by a continuous river input. The cause and strength of the tidal shear depends on a combination of factors, including differential topographic forcing through separate entrances into the bay and spatial and temporal variations in water column stability caused by changes in the magnitude of river flow and wind stress...|$|R
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of electromagnetic fields induced in the Earth’s oceans by {{the motion of}} the conductive seawater {{in the presence of the}} main magnetic field has been known for decades (Sanford 1971). In particular, the electromagnetic signatures of the ocean flows driven by the gravitational forcing of the Sun and the Moon have recently attracted an increased interest in the geomagnetic field community. Although the existence of compound tides generated by nonlinear ocean dynamics is also well established (Einšpigel and Martinec 2017), the fundamental part of tidal flows consists of the constituents present at discrete frequencies related to the movements of the celestial bodies. This attribute allows us to distinguish the tidally induced magnetic field from the magnetic field originated in the Earth’s liquid core, in the lithosphere, or the external contributions from the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and their induced counterparts. Indeed, the magnetic signatures of the principal lunar semi-diurnal constituent M_ 2, the larger lunar elliptic semi-diurnal constituent N_ 2, and partially also the lunar <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituent</b> O_ 1 have been detected in ground geomagnetic observatory data (Maus and Kuvshinov 2004) and seafloor measurements in the Northwestern Pacific (Schnepf et al. 2014). Similarly, the low-orbit satellite missions, such as CHAMP (Sabaka et al. 2015; Tyler et al. 2003) and Swarm (Sabaka et al. 2016), have successfully recovered the M_ 2 and partially also the N_ 2 tidally induced magnetic signals. Other tidal signal, such as S_ 2, K_ 1, and P_ 1 can be obscured by external fields (Guzavina et al. 2018; Maus and Kuvshinov 2004). Consequently, the tidal signals extracted from satellite data were used to constrain the electrical conductivity across the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (Grayver et al. 2016, 2017). Recently, Schnepf et al. (2018) have compared the numerical predictions of magnetic fields generated by oceanic and ionospheric tides. The idea to assimilate the magnetic field measurements directly into the global ocean flow modelling has been implemented by Irrgang et al. (2017); however, tides were not considered there. Another application of the forward modelling of tidal signals is the construction of base functions optimized for tidal signal recovery from satellite and observatory data (Telschow et al. 2018).|$|E

Tidal currents are generally weak and concentrated in the semidiurnal and diurnal bands, barely exceeding 3 cms - 1 in the semidiurnal band (M 2, S 2), and below 6 cms - 1 in the diurnal band (K 1, O 1). In the middle part of the basin, the M 2 currents oscillate along the main Channel axis; on the contrary the S 2 oscillations are oriented along the energetic Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS) flow. Diurnal tides have a more circular pattern, also following the AIS path and with a significant intensification in proximity of the shelf break, thus suggesting a substantial contribution from internal tides in the region.

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} tidal {{model for}} the northwest Atlantic was developed including the 8 leading semi-diurnal (M₂, S₂, N₂ and K₂) and diurnal (K₁, O₁, P₁, & Q₁) constituents. Altimetric tides from TOPEX/Poseidon, TOPEX Tandem Mission, JASON- 1, ENVISAT, and GFO missions were assimilated into the model. The model was a primitive equation, sigma coordinate system in the vertical, finite difference Princeton Ocean Model (POM). The model used a horizontal rectilinear grid of 1 / 12 ° X / 12 ° resolution. The vertical eddy viscosity is computed using the Mellor and Yamada (1982) level 2. 5 turbulence model. The model domain covers the region from 75 °W to 42 °W and 36 °N to 66 °N. The model is forced at the boundaries with elevations and depth averaged currents for the 8 semidiurnal and <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> extracted from a North Atlantic Model (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002). We carried out experiments with homogeneous and stratified (summer-diagnostic) fluid, with and without assimilation, and their results are compared. [...] The model reproduced the M₂, S₂, N₂, K₁ and O₁ tidal elevations to an accuracy of 2. 1 cm, 1. 6 cm, 0. 9 cm 1. 2 cm & 0. 9 cm respectively excluding the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine region. Including the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine region, the accuracy is 10. 7 cm, 2. 8 cm, 2. 5 cm, 1. 3 cm and 1. 1 cm respectively. Assimilation improved the model tidal elevation {{by a factor of}} 40 - 60 %. The semi-diurnal tidal currents agreed to better than the <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> with observations. The agreement was best for the Georges Bank region indicating the model's capability to handle strong tidal current variability well. Assimilation improved the model tidal currents by roughly 20 - 30 %. An enhancement of the K₁ and O₁ tidal elevation and currents at the shelf edge of Labrador is found in the model, in agreement with theory and observations. [...] Inclusion of horizontally and vertically varying stratification indicates that stratification has a significant influence on the vertical profile of currents in the shallow areas. Tidal currents decrease in the bottom boundary, increase significantly {{in the rest of the}} bottom layer, and decrease in the upper and middle water column.

The observed 18. 61 year nodal modulations of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> O 1 and K 1 are {{in agreement with the}} equilibrium tidal theory, except in the South China Sea. The observed modulations of the M 2 and N 2 amplitudes are smaller than theoretically predicted at the northern stations and larger at the southern stations. The discrepancies between the theoretically predicted nodal variations and the observations are discussed. The 8. 85 year perigean cycle is identifiable in the N 2 parameters at most stations, except those in the South China Sea. The radiational component of S 2 contributes on average 16 % of the observed S 2 except in the Gulf of Tonkin, on the south coast, where it accounts for up to 65 %.

The semidiurnal tidal parameters show significant secular trends in the Bohai and Yellow Seas, on the north coast, and in the Taiwan Strait. The largest increase is found for M 2 for which the amplitude increases by 4 – 7 mm/yr in the Yellow Sea. The potential causes for the linear trends in tidal constants are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tides in the {{northern}} Adriatic Sea are investigated using two distinct numerical models. First, a two-dimensional (2 -D) finite difference model is implemented with very high horizontal resolution (556 m) to simulate {{the northern}} Adriatic. After calibration of open boundary conditions the model gives very satisfactory results: The averaged vectorial difference between observed and simulated elevations is � 1. 3 cm {{for each of the}} seven major tidal constituents. Next, a 3 -D finite element model is applied to the entire sea in order to provide a better simulation of the tidal currents {{in the vicinity of the}} open boundary of the first model. Results show that the northern Adriatic behaves like a narrow rotating channel in which the instantaneous sea surface elevation (SSE) contours are aligned with the depth-averaged velocity vectors and in which the SSE is always higher to the right of the local current. These features emphasize the rotational character that tides can exhibit in a relatively small basin. Wave fitting to the current elevation structure shows that semidiurnal tidal constituents are well represented with a system of two frictionless Kelvin waves (incident and reflected). In contrast, the <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> are best described as a topographic wave propagating across, not along, the basin, from the Croatian coast to the Italian shore. Despite this obvious disparity the semidiurnal and diurnal tides can be understood as distinct members of a single family of linear waves, which exist under the combined actions of gravity and topography. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Singapore Strait {{connects the}} South China Sea, where tides are dominantly diurnal, to the dominantly semidiurnal Indian Ocean. At this transition, the tidal water level {{oscillations}} are observed to be semidiurnal while the tidal current oscillations are mixed, diurnal to fully diurnal. Due to {{the interaction of}} the <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> with the semidiurnal M 2 tide, the tides are strongly asymmetric. Both residual flows and subtidal flows, with periodicities of 2 weeks to 1 year, are strong. In order to analyze and explain the hydrodynamics around Singapore, a well-documented and calibrated regional tidal model application was further improved and validated. Analysis of the results of this model shows that the diurnal tidal wave is primarily standing, with an amphidromic point close to Singapore, explaining the dominantly diurnal current and semidiurnal water level oscillations. Analysis of the model results further indicates that the fortnightly constituents in the subtidal flow are probably compound tides, with a combined amplitude over 10 cm/s. Pronounced yearly and half-yearly cycles in spring tidal current amplitude and asymmetry exist, resulting from interaction of the diurnal and the semidiurnal spring-neap cycles, compound tides, and the monsoon currents. A simple analytical transport formula was applied to determine the relative importance of tidal asymmetry and residual flows, verified with a full sediment transport model. With fine sediment being more sensitive for residual flow and coarser sediment for tidal flow, a pronounced divergence in sediment transport pathways may exist, depending on the grain size.

40|$|The {{principal}} semidiurnal (M 2 and S 2) and diurnal (K 1 and O 1) tidal constituents {{are described}} on the west Florida continental shelf (WFS) {{using a combination of}} in situ measurements and a three-dimensional, primitive equation numerical model. The measurements are of sea level and currents along the coastline and across the shelf, respectively. The model extends from west of the Mississippi River to the Florida Keys with an open boundary arcing between. It is along this open boundary that the regional model is forced by a global tide model. Standard barotropic tidal analyses are performed for both the data and the model, and quantifiable metrics are provided for comparison. Based on these comparisons, the authors present coamplitude and cophase charts for sea level and velocity hodographs for currents. The semidiurnal constituents show marked spatial variability, whereas the <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> are spatially more uniform. Apalachicola Bay is a demarcation point for the semidiurnal tides that are well developed to the southeast along the WFS but are minimal to the west. The largest semidiurnal tides are in the Florida Big Bend and Florida Bay regions with a relative minimum in between just to the south of Tampa Bay. These spatial distributions may be explained on the basis of local geometry. A Lagrangian Stokes drift, coherently directed toward the northwest, is identified but is of relatively small magnitude when compared with the potential for particle transport by seasonal and synoptic-scale forcing. Bottom stress-induced tidal mixing is examined and estimates are made of the bottom logarithmic layer height by the M 2 tidal currents. 1...|$|R
40|$|An edited {{version of}} this paper was {{published}} by AGU. Copyright (2012) American Geophysical Union. This study analyzes tide transformation in the Guadalquivir estuary (SW Spain). When fresh water discharges are less than 40 m 3 /s, the estuary is tidally-dominated (flood-dominated) and well mixed. Under such conditions, the estuary can be divided into three stretches, each characterized by a different tide propagation process. In the first stretch of 25 km, the dominant process is diffusion. In the next stretch, approximately over 35 km length, convergence and friction processes are in balance. At the head of the estuary, in the last stretch, the tidal motion is partially standing because of tidal reflection on the Alcalá del Río dam, located 110 km upstream from the estuary mouth. The reflection coefficient R varies with the frequency; for <b>diurnal</b> <b>constituents</b> its magnitude ∣RD∣ is 0. 25; this value increases in the case of semi-diurnal (∣RS∣ ≈ 0. 40), and quarter-diurnal constituents (∣RQ∣ ≈ 0. 65), and reaches its minimum at the sixth-diurnal components (∣RX∣ ≈ 0. 10). The tidal reflection can generate residual currents that have consequences in the bed morphology. Furthermore, when the fresh water discharges are greater than 400 m 3 /s, the estuary is fluvially-dominated and the water level can be calculated as the linear superposition of tide and river contributions. However, superposition arguments do not hold for currents at any point in the estuary.

Long-duration {{observations}} of horizontal currents throughout {{nearly the entire}} water column at a location in the Kauai Channel, Hawaii (21. 75 ˚N, 158. 75 ˚W), are used to test hypotheses {{about the existence of}} energetic oscillations driven by non-linear processes acting on the semi-diurnal tide. For decades it has been believed that three classes of resonant interactions, based on weakly interacting, non-linear wave theory, are the dominant mechanisms for moving energy through frequency-wavenumber space of the internal wave field. Energy is thought to flow from sources, such as the tides and wind-forced inertial waves, toward small spatial scales and dissipation. A number of recent studies have suggested that non-linear processes, such as Parametric Subharmonic Instability, will result in a flow of energy from the principal semi-diurnal M 2 tide directly and quickly into small-vertical-scale oscillations at the M 2 subharmonic frequency, M 1 = M 2 / 2 (0. 966 cycles/day, or cpd), and that this can occur anywhere equatorward of 28. 8 ˚ latitude. However, numerical experiments have been highly idealized, and most observational studies lack sufficient frequency resolution to spectrally distinguish between linear <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>constituents</b> and oscillations of M 1 frequency. Observations for this study come from moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), which were deployed from November 2002 to June 2003 in the Kauai Channel as part of the Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME). These velocity time-series cover nearly the entire water column with 8 -m resolution, and are long enough to clearly resolve in frequency the energy in M 1 currents as distinct from currents forced by the principal <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>constituents</b> O 1 (0. 930 cpd) and K 1 (1. 003 cpd). Energetic semidiurnal tidal beams are observed in this dataset, and diurnal-band spectral energies in both velocity and shear fields appear to be dominated by locally generated internal tides at O 1 and K 1. The ratio of velocity power spectral densities at M 1 relative to M 2 is approximately 10 - 2, which is lower than expected from some numerical simulations. We find with bispectral analysis that a triad of waves with frequencies at O 1, K 1 and M 2 has higher bispectral energy (by an order of magnitude) and higher bicoherence (> 0. 1) than a triad with frequencies at M 1, M 1 and M 2 from 420 - 1000 m at this location...|$|R

Calculated corange and cotidal charts show that along the continental slope, local regions of increased sea level amplitude, highly variable phase and enhanced currents occur. It is shown that in these local regions, shelf waves (topographic waves) of tidal origin are generated. In the Arctic Ocean and Northern Atlantic Ocean more than 30 regions of enhanced currents are identified. To prove the near-resonant interaction of the diurnal tides with the local bottom topography, the natural periods of oscillations for all regions have been calculated. The flux of energy averaged over the tidal period depicts the gyres of semitrapped energy, suggesting that the shelf waves are partially trapped over the irregularities of the bottom topography. It is shown that the occurrence of near-resonance phenomenon changes the energy flow in the tidal waves. First, the flux of energy from the astronomical sources is amplified in the shelf wave regions, and afterwards the tidal energy is strongly dissipated in the same regions...|$|R

We also attempt an inversionfor the free inner-core nutation (FICN) resonant period from gravity data. The most probablesolution gives a period close to the annual prograde term (or S 1 tide). However the 95 per centconfidence interval extends the possible values between roughly 28 and 725 d for gravity, andfrom 362 to 414 d from nutation data, depending on the prior bounds. The precisions of theestimated long-period nutation and respective small <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>constituents</b> are hence notaccurate enough for a correct determination of the FICN complex frequency...|$|R
40|$|Three across-shelf Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) {{moorings}} {{were deployed}} on the continental {{shelf in the}} northern South China Sea in 2006 and 2007, {{in order to obtain}} time series of ocean currents. During each of the three observational periods, in spring, autumn, and winter seasons, the observation was sustained for at least 1 month. Conductivity-temperature-depth data were also collected in the vicinity of these ADCP moorings. The two <b>diurnal</b> baroclinic <b>constituents</b> (O- 1 and K- 1) are found to be more prominent than the semidiurnal baroclinic ones (M- 2 and S- 2) at each mooring site, which are different from the barotropic tides. The highest diurnal (semidiurnal) baroclinic kinetic energy density exceeded 10 (2. 7) kJ/m(2) during the observational periods. In each observational period, the vertical structures of baroclinic tidal ellipses indicate mode- 1 characteristics for O- 1 and K- 1, whereas some of the semidiurnal internal tides show mode- 2 characteristics in autumn. Propagation directions of the diurnal and semidiurnal internal tides are basically across-shelf, and their phase speeds estimated from phase changes and buoyancy frequencies indicate deceleration of internal tides, when the internal tidal waves propagate from deeper shelf break to shallower shelf. The increased stratification in autumn is favorable for maintaining internal tidal waveform and preserving internal tidal energy, while the intensity of the internal tidal flow decreases significantly in winter...|$|R
40|$|P>Improvements of {{a global}} state-of-the art ocean tide model are {{identified}} and quantified by applying three independent approaches, namely (i) empirical ocean tide analysis of multimission altimeter data, (ii) evaluation of GRACE data and gravity field models and (iii) high resolution hydrodynamic modelling. Although these approaches have different capabilities to sense ocean tides they obtain results which are basically consistent one with each other. The analysis of altimeter data clearly identifies significant residual amplitudes over shallow water for all major <b>diurnal</b> and semidiurnal <b>constituents</b> and the non-linear tide M- 4. GRACE data and the time-series of monthly gravity field models exhibit-on a larger scale-residual ocean tide signals over much the same areas. The analysis of dynamic residuals of hydrodynamic modelling with data assimilation proves the validity of linear dynamics in the deep ocean and shows correlation of dynamic residuals with energy dissipation in these areas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFjordic coastlines provide {{sheltered}} {{locations for}} finfish and shellfish aquaculture, {{and are often}} subject to harmful algal blooms (HABs) some of which develop offshore and are then advected to impact nearshore aquaculture. Numerical models are a potentially important tool for providing early warning of such HAB events. However, the complex topography of fjordic shelf regions is a significant challenge to modelling. This is frequently compounded by complex bathymetry and local weather patterns. Existing structured grid models do not provide the resolution needed to represent these coastlines in their wider shelf context. In a number of locations advectively transported blooms of the ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi are of particular concern for the finfish industry. Here were present a novel hydrodynamic model of the coastal waters {{to the west of}} Scotland that is based on unstructured finite volume methodology, providing a sufficiently high resolution hydrodynamical structure to realistically simulate the transport of particles (such as K. mikimotoi cells) within nearshore waters where aquaculture sites are sited. Model–observation comparisons reveal close correspondence of tidal elevations for major semidiurnal and <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>constituents.</b> The thermohaline structure of the model and its current fields are also in good agreement with a number of existing observational datasets. Simulations of the transport of Lagrangian drifting buoys, along with the incorporation of an individual-based biological model, based on a bloom of K. mikimotoi, demonstrate that unstructured grid models have considerable potential for HAB prediction in Scotland and in complex topographical regions elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the influence of stress changes over floating ice shelves on grounded ice streams, we develop a Bayesian method for inferring time-dependent 3 -D surface velocity fields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data. Our specific goal is to observe ocean tide-induced variability in vertical ice shelf position and horizontal ice stream flow. Thus, we consider the special case where observed surface displacement at a given location can be defined by a 3 -D secular velocity vector, a family of 3 -D sinusoidal functions, and a correction to the digital elevation model used to process the SAR data. Using nearly 9 months of SAR data collected from multiple satellite viewing geometries with the COSMO-SkyMed 4 -satellite constellation, we infer the spatiotemporal response of Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to ocean tidal forcing. Consistent with expected tidal uplift, inferred vertical motion over the ice shelf is dominated by semidiurnal and <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>constituents.</b> Horizontal ice flow variability, on the other hand, occurs primarily at the fortnightly spring-neap tidal period (M_(sf)). We propose that periodic grounding of the ice shelf is the primary mechanism for translating vertical tidal motion into horizontal flow variability, causing ice flow to accelerate first and most strongly over the ice shelf. Flow variations then propagate through the grounded ice stream at a mean rate of ∼ 29 km/d and decay quasi-linearly with distance over ∼ 85 km upstream of the grounding zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} which {{control the}} spread of tracers in the N. W. European Shelf Seas are reviewed. The perspective of this review is to allow a comparison with the vastly different regimes found in Australian waters. Whilst these N. W. European Shelf Seas are dominated by {{the influence of the}} M 2 semi-diurnal tide, the Gulfs off South Australia have significant diurnal constitutents and a peculiar near equality of M 2 and S 2 -producing 'dodge' tides. Nevertheless, generalised expressions for both the annual mean and the seasonal amplitude of sea surface temperature (derived from North Atlantic data) are generally applicable. The greater sensitivity of <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>constituents</b> to bed friction coupled with the proximity to the related inertial latitude suggests that tidal propagation models may require more tuning of the bed stress coefficient. However the greatest contrast is for 'estuaries' where the excess of evaporation over precipitation and river flow produces 'inverse estuaries' unknown in Europe. Whilst flushing time concepts can be used in similar fashions, the extraction of tracers from such estuaries occurs close to the bed via 'inverse' salt wedges. This contrast with mean surface extraction in European estuaries will have significant influences on the related ecology. A 'Future Work' section describes recent developments and plans to extend marine forecasting via Operational Oceanography. Whilst Australian requirements will differ considerably, the need to maintain awareness and adopt common practices is important to fulfill the wider goals of GOOS-the Global Ocean Observing System.

40|$|With the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission having {{reached the}} end of its nominal three-year lifetime, a large number of ocean tides models {{incorporating}} TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry data have been released. Because the major part of these models is based on the two classical analysis methods, i. e. harmonic and response analysis, it is interesting to compare and interpret the results of these two methods. Clearly, this requires that the same data are used and moreover that the data are processed with the same scheme. Therefore, both analysis methods have been implemented and three years of TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data have been processed to solve the major <b>diurnal</b> and semi-diurnal <b>constituents</b> of the global ocean tides by harmonic and response analysis. The results of both methods are evaluated from the differences with the most recent Grenoble hydrodynamic model and from the fit with the harmonic constants of a globallydistributed set of tide gauges. It was found that the solutions from the harmonic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Tidal and subtidal {{waves are}} {{analyzed}} with sea-level data and numerical modeling {{in a short}} and micro-tidal embayment, Alfacs Bay (NW Mediterranean Sea). Data analysis exhibits tidal wave amplification and seiching (characteristic period of 3. 5 h) along the bay. Numerical results show an eight-fold increase in quarter-wave resonant wave amplitudes from the mouth {{to the head of}} the bay. This amplification follows the classical description of a standing wave. Moreover, resonant wave velocities measured and computed at the bay mouth (node location) are about one order of magnitude higher than tidal currents. Analysis of astronomic tidal propagation in the bay reveals similar behavior for <b>diurnal</b> and semidiurnal <b>constituents.</b> Tidal waves amplify along the bay by 3 % for diurnal and 10 % for semidiurnal constituents. Numerical simulations conducted with different domains indicate that geometric effects dominate over frictional influences in causing the wave behavior. This behavior is consistent with the existence of a quasi-steady standing wave within the bay. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Tides are {{the main}} type of sea level {{variability}} in the world ocean. However, oceanic tides penetrate weakly, or do not penetrate at all, into enclosed basins such as the Baltic, Black and Caspian seas. Consequently, only directly forced tides are formed in these basins. Long observation time series (up to 123 years in the Baltic Sea and 38 years in the Black and Caspian seas) at numerous stations were used to precisely estimate tidal constituents. High-resolution spectra revealed fine structure of discrete peaks at tidal frequencies. The <b>diurnal</b> radiational <b>constituent</b> S 1 (1 cpd), apparently associated with breeze winds, was found {{to play an important}} role in general tidal dynamics in these seas. Harmonic analysis of tides for individual yearly series with consecutive vector averaging over the entire observational period was applied to estimate mean amplitudes and phases of tidal constituents. Our findings indicate that the formation and predominance of diurnal or semidiurnal tides in these seas appears to depend on the frequency-selective properties of the basins. Thus, in the Baltic Sea with fundamental modal period of about 27 h, diurnal tides dominate in the major eastern gulfs. In the Black Sea resonant amplification of semidiurnal tides is observed in the northwestern part. The predominance of semidiurnal tides in the Caspian Sea has also probably a resonant nature. Maximum tidal heights estimated for a 100 -year period are 23 cm in the Baltic Sea, 18 cm in the Black Sea and 21 cm in the southern Caspian Sea...|$|R
5000|$|Long-Period tides are {{gravitational}} tides, typically with amplitudes {{of a few}} centimeters or {{less and}} periods longer than one day, generated by changes in the Earth's orientation relative to the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The distance between a reference point {{on the surface of}} the Earth relative to these objects can be expressed as an infinite combination of periods and, as the distance changes, so does the tidal forcing. An analysis of the changing distance by Pierre-Simon de Laplace in the 18th century shows that these periods at which gravity varies cluster into three species, the semi-diurnal and <b>diurnal</b> tide <b>constituents</b> which have periods of a day or less, and the long period tidal constituents (see also tide). Long period tidal constituents with relatively strong forcing include the lunar fortnightly (Mf) and monthly (Ms) as well as the solar semiannual (Ssa) and annual (Sa) constituents. In addition to having periods longer than a day-long period tidal forcing is distinguished from that of the first and second species by being zonally symmetric. The long period tides are also distinguished by the way in which the oceans respond. In contrast to the first and second species, the long period tidal forcings occur sufficiently slowly that they do not excite surface gravity waves. This property of exciting surface gravity waves is responsible for the high amplitude semi-diurnal tides in the Bay of Fundy, for example. In contrast, the ocean responds to long period tidal forcing with a combination of an equilibrium tidal response along with a possible excitation of barotropic Rossby wave normal modes ...|$|R
40|$|The 120 m sea-level drop {{during the}} Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18 â�� 22 kyr BP) had a {{profound}} impact on the global tides and lead to an increased tidal dissipation rate, especially in the North Atlantic. Here, we present new simulations of the evolution of the global tides from the LGM to present for the dominating <b>diurnal</b> and semidiurnal <b>constituents.</b> The simulations are undertaken in time slices spanning 500 â�� 1000 years. Due to uncertainties in the location of the grounding line of the Antarctic ice sheets during the last glacial, simulations are carried out for two different grounding line scenarios. Our results replicate previously reported enhancements in dissipation and amplitudes of the semidiurnal tide during LGM and subsequent deglaciation, and they provide a detailed picture of the large global changes in M 2 tidal dynamics occurring over the deglaciation period. We show that Antarctic ice dynamics and the associated grounding line location have a large influence on global semidiurnal tides, whereas the diurnal tides mainly experience regional changes and are not impacted by grounding line shifts in Antarctica...|$|R
