Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite <b>digital</b> <b>imaging</b> system (SDIS) operator.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy for spatial resolution and radiation dose of a small-field <b>digital</b> mammographic <b>imaging</b> system using parabolic polycapillary optics. Materials and Methods: We developed a small-field <b>digital</b> mammographic <b>imaging</b> system {{composed of a}} CCD (charge coupled device) detector and an X-ray source coupled with parabolic polycapillary optics. The spatial resolution and radiation dose according to various filters were evaluated for a small-field <b>digital</b> mammographic <b>imaging</b> system.

Results: The small-field <b>digital</b> mammographic <b>imaging</b> system had spatial res-olutions of 12 lp/mm with molybdenum and rhodium filters with a 25 -μm thick-ness. With a thicker molybdenum filter (100 μm thick), the system had a higher spatial resolution of 11 lp/mm and contrast of 0. 48. The radiation dose for a rhodi-um filter with a 25 -μm thickness was 0. 13 mGy within a 10 -mm-diameter local field. A larger field image greater than 10 mm in diameter could be obtained b...|$|R

5|$|Eastman Kodak sued Apple and Research In Motion (RIM) in January 2010, filing two {{lawsuits}} against Apple and {{a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against both Apple and RIM after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak's patents for digital cameras. Kodak alleged Apple's and RIM's phones infringed on patented Kodak <b>digital</b> <b>imaging</b> technology. Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of Apple's iPhone and RIM's BlackBerry. After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against Apple and another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents, Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for loans. In the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak, Apple, and RIM that is, as of 2012, pending before ITC. In March 2012, bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper, overseeing Kodak's restructuring, denied Apple's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC over some of Kodak's cameras, photo frames, and printers. In July 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not infringe on Apple's patent technology for digital cameras, although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against Apple and RIM; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision.|$|E

25|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>imaging</b> uses an {{electronic}} image sensor {{to record the}} image {{as a set of}} electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and photographic paper, while <b>digital</b> <b>imaging</b> is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.|$|E
