In 2009, When asked by Bill Moyers if God is a figment of the human imagination, Wright responds: [...] "I would say so. Now, I don't think that precludes the possibility that as ideas about <b>God</b> <b>have</b> evolved <b>people</b> <b>have</b> moved closer to something that may be the truth about ultimate purpose and ultimate meaning... Very early on, apparently people started imagining sources of causality. Imagining things out there making things happen. And early on there were shamans who had mystical experiences that even today a Buddhist monk would say were valid forms of apprehension of the divine or something. But by and large I think people were making up stories that would help them control the world." ...|$|R

Furthermore, <b>God</b> <b>has</b> purposed in Christ that His people will [...] "be holy and blameless before Him" [...] (Ephesians 1:4). This purpose is repeatedly emphasized by Paul in Ephesians (see 2:21; 3:14-19; 4:1-3, 13-32; 5:1-18; cf. 1 Peter 1:2, 14-16). The fulfillment of this purpose for the church corporately is certain (Ephesians 5:27). But the fulfillment of this purpose for individuals in the church is conditional upon remaining in the Christian faith (Colossians 1:22-23).|$|R

50|$|The Black Death reached Sicily in 1347, {{before it}} {{affected}} mainland Italy. This was during Elizabeth's reign, and was likely {{one of her}} prime concerns throughout the remainder of her time in power. Outbreaks of the Black Death had occurred in Italy before in the thirteenth century, but they were generally localized and confined {{to one or two}} towns. 1347 was the first severe case recorded in Sicily, and initiated the pandemic that would become an unfortunate and familiar aspect of European life for centuries. Elizabeth could do nothing to relieve the people, although she refrained from fleeing the country which was a common trend among those Italians who could afford to. Gabriel de Mussis, an Italian notary in the fourteenth century, recounts an attitude of despondency in Sicily; occurrences such as heavy rainfalls, the birth of Siamese twins, and horses refusing to enter Messina were all considered signs that <b>God</b> <b>had</b> abandoned the <b>people.</b> The plague <b>had</b> drastic economic effects on Italy as well, and contributed to the first significant economic crisis in centuries.|$|R

5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that <b>God</b> <b>has</b> chosen some <b>people</b> for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Pharaoh told Joseph that {{in as much}} as <b>God</b> <b>had</b> shown him all this, there was none so {{discreet}} and wise as Joseph, and thus Pharaoh set Joseph over all the land of Egypt.

[...] And Pharaoh renamed Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On to be his wife. Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and in the seven years of plenty he gathered up grain as plentiful as the sand of the sea. Joseph and Asenath had two sons, the first of whom Joseph called Manasseh, for <b>God</b> <b>had</b> made him forget all his toil and all his father's house, and the second of whom he called Ephraim, for <b>God</b> <b>had</b> made him fruitful in the land of his affliction. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|R
500|$|Vermigli {{did not see}} predestination {{as central}} to his {{theological}} system, but it became associated with him because of controversies in which he became entangled. Vermigli developed his doctrine independently of John Calvin, and before Calvin published it in his 1559 Institutes of the Christian Religion. Vermigli saw God as sovereign over every event, and believed that all things, including evil, were used by him to accomplish his will. Nevertheless, Vermigli did not hold that humans are compelled to good or evil actions. Vermigli held that <b>God</b> <b>had</b> chosen some <b>people</b> for salvation {{on the basis of}} grace or unmerited favor alone, with no consideration for any good or evil characteristics, a view referred to as [...] "unconditional election". Vermigli also believed that God passed over the reprobate, those who were not elected to salvation. He saw this as included in the will of God, but different in character from the decision to choose the elect for salvation. Because all <b>people</b> <b>have</b> fallen into sin, the reprobating will of God treats them as by-nature fallen and deserving of damnation. Vermigli's formulation of reprobation as within God's decree while distinct from his saving election was slightly different from Calvin's. Calvin saw predestination to salvation and reprobation as two sides of a single decree. Vermigli's doctrine was to prove more influential in the Reformed confessions.|$|R
