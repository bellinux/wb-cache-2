5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, {{an increase in}} the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool,</b> wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E

5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool,</b> dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E

Other {{examples}} of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both {{hot and cold}} climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA. A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries.

5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.

5|$|Kaniakapūpū ("the {{singing of}} the land shells"), known {{formerly}} as Luakaha ("place of relaxation"), is {{the ruins of the}} former summer palace of King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Built in the 1840s, and situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> uplands of the Nuʻuanu Valley, it served as the king and queen's summer retreat after the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii moved from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1845. It was famous for being the site of a grand luau attended by an estimated ten thousand guests during the 1847 Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day celebration. The palace had fallen into ruins by 1874; no records exist about its condition in the intervening years. Rediscovered in the 1950s, the site was cleared and efforts were made to stabilize the ruins from further damage by the elements and invasive plant growth. The site remains officially off-limits to the public and trespassers are subjected to citations, although the site is not regularly monitored.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{benefits}} of mechanical harvesting is the relatively low cost.

The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.|$|E
25|$|OTEC {{technology}} supports chilled-soil agriculture. When cold seawater {{flows through}} underground pipes, it chills the surrounding soil. The temperature difference between roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> soil and {{leaves in the}} warm air allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics. Dr. John P. Craven, Dr. Jack Davidson and Richard Bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). The research facility demonstrated that more than 100 different crops can be grown using this system. Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.|$|E
