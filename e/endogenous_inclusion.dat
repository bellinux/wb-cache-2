They {{are the product of}} chemical reactions, physical effects, and contamination that occurs during the melting and pouring process. These inclusions are categorized by origin as either endogenous or exogenous. <b>Endogenous</b> <b>inclusions,</b> also known as indigenous, occur within the metal and are the result of chemical reactions. These products precipitate during cooling and are typically very small. Exogenous inclusions are caused by the entrapment of nonmetals.

40|$|International audienceThermomechanical {{performance}} of metallic alloys {{is directly related}} to the metal cleanliness that has always been a challenge for metallurgists. During liquid metal processing, particles can grow or decrease in size either by mass transfer with the liquid phase or by agglomeration/fragmentation mechanisms. As a function of numerical density of inclusions and of the hydrodynamics of the reactor, different numerical modeling approaches are proposed; in the case of an isolated particle, the Lagrangian technique coupled with a dissolution model is applied, whereas in the opposite case of large inclusion phase concentration, the population balance equation must be solved. Three examples of numerical modeling studies achieved at Institut Jean Lamour are discussed. They illustrate the application of the Lagrangian technique (for isolated exogenous inclusion in titanium bath) and the Eulerian technique without or with the aggregation process: for precipitation and growing of inclusions at the solidification front of a Maraging steel, and for <b>endogenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the molten steel bath of a gas-stirred ladle, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of ultrasound in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) usually relies on ultrasonic transducers {{in contact with}} the biological tissue through a coupling medium. This is a major drawback for important potential applications such as surgery. Here we report the use of a remote optical method, derived from industrial laserultrasonics, to detect ultrasound in tissues. This approach enables non-contact PAT (NCPAT) without exceeding laser exposure safety limits. The sensitivity of the method is based on the use of suitably shaped detection laser pulses and a confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer in differential configuration. Reliable image reconstruction is obtained by measuring remotely the surface profile of the tissue with an optical coherence tomography system. The proposed method also allows non-contact ultrasound imaging (US) by applying a second reconstruction algorithm to the data acquired for NCPAT. <b>Endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>inclusions</b> exhibiting optical and acoustic contrasts were detected ex vivo in chicken breast and calf brain specimens.

40|$|Abnormal {{substances}} in the nuclei {{that can be}} observed by light microscopy are often broadly referred to as nuclear inclusions. Although their recognition in the appropriate clinicopathological settings can aid in the diagnosis of some disease entities and tumor types, {{they can also be}} a source of error. There are 2 morphologically distinct types of inclu-sions with different mechanisms of formation and diagnostic significance, including bona fide nuclear inclusions and nuclear pseudoinclusions. Bona fide nuclear inclusions result from accumulation in the nuclei of viral particles, cytoplasmic materials (such as surfactant, immunoglobulin, and glycogen), biotin, nuclear lamins, or polyglutamine. Some of them are diagnosti-cally helpful, such as surfactant inclusion, which can support the pulmonary origin of an adenocarcinoma, whereas others may be misleading, such as biotin inclusion, which can be mistaken for herpes infection. Nuclear pseudoinclusions, which represent invaginations of cytoplasm into the nucleus, are delimited by the nuclear membrane. Although not totally specific, they are particularly common in papillary thyroid carcinoma, meningioma, and usual ductal hyperplasia of the breast and hence may aid in the diagnosis of these entities. Nuclear pseudo-pseudoinclusions, which are artefactual bubbles in the nuclei that mimic nuclear pseudoinclusions or clear nuclei, can lead to misdiagnosis of follicular adenoma or hyperplastic nodule as papillary thyroid carcinoma.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{plays an}} important role in gene expression by producing different proteins from a gene. Caspase- 2 pre-mRNA produces anti-apoptotic Casp- 2 S and pro-apoptotic Casp- 2 L proteins through exon 9 inclusion or skipping. However, the molecular mechanisms of exon 9 splicing are not well understood. Here we show that knockdown of SRSF 3 (also known as SRp 20) with siRNA induced significant increase of <b>endogenous</b> exon 9 <b>inclusion.</b> In addition, overexpression of SRSF 3 promoted exon 9 skipping. Thus we conclude that SRSF 3 promotes exon 9 skipping. In order to understand the functional target of SRSF 3 on caspase- 2 pre-mRNA, we performed substitution and deletion mutagenesis on the potential SRSF 3 binding sites that were predicted from previous reports. We demonstrate that substitution mutagenesis of the potential SRSF 3 binding site on exon 8 severely disrupted the effects of SRSF 3 on exon 9 skipping. Furthermore, with the approach of RNA pulldown and immunoblotting analysis we show that SRSF 3 interacts with the potential SRSF 3 binding RNA sequence on exon 8 but not with the mutant RNA sequence. In addition, we show that a deletion of 26 nt RNA from 52 ̆ 7 end of exon 8, a 33 nt RNA from 32 ̆ 7 end of exon 10 and a 2225 nt RNA from intron 9 did not compromise the function of SRSF 3 on exon 9 splicing. Therefore we conclude that SRSF 3 promotes exon 9 skipping of caspase- 2 pre-mRNA by interacting with exon 8. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of caspase- 2 pre-mRNA splicing...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{short-term}} load forecasting(STLF) {{has been the}} object of particular attention in the power systems field. STLF has been applied almost exclusively to the generation sector, based on variables, which are transversal to most models. Among the most significant variables we can find load, expressed as active power (MW), as well as exogenous variables, such as weather and economy-related ones; although the latter are applied in larger forecasting horizons than STLF. In this paper, the application of STLF to the distribution sector is suggested including inductive reactive power as a forecasting <b>endogenous</b> variable. The <b>inclusion</b> of this additional variable is mainly due to the evidence that correlations between load and weather variables are tenuous, due to the mild climate of the actual case-study system and the consequent feeble penetration of electrical heating ventilation and air conditioning loads. Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been chosen as the forecasting methodology, with standard feed forward back propagation algorithm, {{because it is a}} largely used method with generally considered satisfactory results. Usually the input vector to ANN applied to load forecasting is defined in a discretionary way, mainly based on experience, on engineering judgement criteria and on concern about the ANN dimension, always taking into consideration the apparent (or actually evaluated) correlations within the available data. The approach referred in the paper includes pre-processing the data in order to influence the composition of the input vector {{in such a way as}} to reduce the margin of discretion in its definition. A relative entropy analysis has been performed to the time series of each variable. The paper also includes an illustrative case study. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} indoor {{experiments}} were conducted at Massey University and AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, New Zealand, {{to study the}} effect of cottonseed condensed tannin (CT) upon the nutritional value of solvent extracted cottonseed meal (CSM) for ruminant and monogastric livestock. Ruminant nutrition experiments were conducted using samples suspended in situ in the rumen of fistulated sheep and by incubating samples with rumen fluid in vitro, to study effects upon solubility and degradability of cottonseed proteins. Monogastric nutrition experiments were done initially with laboratory rats {{as a model for}} production animals such as the pig, and then with pigs. In all cases half of the animals were supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW 3500). PEG specifically binds and inactivates CT and can be used to deduce the effects of CT by comparing control animals (CT acting) with PEG supplemented animals (CT inactivated). 1. Experimental varieties of cottonseed and of industrial CSM were analysed for extractable and bound CT and free gossypol, crude protein, oil and fibre. CT was present in the hulls of all varieties, with higher concentrations recorded for high tannin and glandless selections (55 g kg- 1 and 58 g kg- 1 DM) than for the multiple host plant resistant and high gossypol selections (38 g kg- 1 DM). CT was present in trace amounts in the kernels of high tannin selections, but was not detected in the kernels of all other selections. On average for the hulls of all varieties, approximately 22, 60 and 18 % of total CT was present in the extractable, protein-bound and fibre-bound forms, respectively. Free gossypol was mainly found in the kernels, with negligible amounts being found in the hulls of the experimental varieties. Kernels of high gossypol selections contained higher concentrations of free gossypol (18 g kg- 1 DM) than kernels of multiple host plant resistant, high tannin and commercial selections (10 - 12 g kg- 1 DM), with free gossypol concentration being very low (0. 8 g kg- 1 DM) in the kernels of glandless cottonseed. A negative correlation (r = - 0. 50, P 10, 000) fraction affords an estimate of <b>endogenous</b> loss. <b>Inclusion</b> of hulls in the EHC based diet increased ileal flow of total N (1387 vs. 1623 mg kg- 1 dry matter intake; p< 0. 05), increased ileal flow of total amino acids (23 %; p< 0. 01), and significantly increased ileal flow of several individual amino acids. There was no significant effect of PEG and no PEG x diet interaction, showing that the hull effects could not be explained by action of CT. The presence of some hulls in commercial CSM will contribute to lowering apparent ileal amino acid digestibility, due to its effect in increasing endogenous loss. 5. The effect of adding cottonseed hulls to casein and to cottonseed kernel based diets on the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids, and the proportion of this effect accounted for by CT, was determined using the growing rat. Sixty rats were allocated randomly to 10 semi-synthetic diets, containing either casein (4 diets) or purified unheated solvent-extracted cottonseed kernel (6 diets) as the sole protein sources, with chromic oxide added as an indigestible marker. Two of the casein diets contained no hulls whilst the remaining two diets contained 70 g hulls kg- 1. Two of the cottonseed kernel based diets contained no hulls, with two containing 23 g hulls kg- 1 and the remaining two containing 46 g hulls kg- 1. For each pair of diets, PEG was either included or excluded. Samples of digesta were collected at death from the terminal 15 cm of ileum. The inclusion of hulls depressed the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids, but with the response differing between diets. With the casein based diet the mean apparent and true ileal amino acid digestibilities were significantly depressed from 0. 89 and 0. 96 to 0. 85 and 0. 92, respectively, by the inclusion of hulls in the diet, and addition of PEG then restored these to 0. 89 and 0. 95. All of the depression could be explained by the CT content of the hulls. However, with the cottonseed kernel based diet the response fell into three categories. The apparent and true ileal digestibilities of the essential amino acids cystine and methionine were not affected by hull addition, ileal digestibilities of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, threonine and valine were markedly depressed by hull addition with approximately 50 % of the depression being explained by CT, whilst the ileal digestibilities of histidine, arginine and phenylalanine were depressed by hull addition but little or none of this effect could be explained by CT. With the cottonseed kernel based diet it seems that unknown components of the hulls other than CT also depressed the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids. 6. The effects of heat treatment, with or without the addition of cottonseed hulls, on the chemical composition of CSM and upon reactivity of the CT were studied. Heat treatment (100 °C for 2 h, in a forced draught oven) reduced the concentrations of free gossypol and fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) available lysine by small amounts, reduced measurable total CT content by 13 %, reduced the solubility of total N, and reduced potential degradability of the 52 and 48 kDa cottonseed storage proteins by mixed rumen micro-organisms. Addition of hulls further depressed solubility of total N and ruminal degradation of the two major storage proteins in cottonseed kernel. The action of PEG in vitro indicated that only part of the depression caused by hull addition could be explained by the presence of CT in the hulls, and that the effects of CT upon N solubility and potential degradability in heated CSM were similar to that in unheated CSM. Addition of hulls also substantially reduced FDNB available lysine. Although application of heat inactivated 13 % of the total CT such that it could no longer be detected with butanol/HCl, it did not seem to change the reversible reactivity of CT with kernel proteins. Commercial CSM produced from the Brisbane mill had a lower total CT content, lower N solubility and ruminal protein degradation rate than CSM produced from the Narrabri mill, but a similar level of FDNB available lysine. 7. The effect of CT from heated and unheated cottonseed on the apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids for the growing rat and pig was determined. In Experiment 1, twenty-four rats were allocated to four semi-synthetic diets, which contained cottonseed kernel/hulls as the sole protein source. Two of the diets contained unheated solvent extracted cottonseed kernel/hulls while the remaining two diets contained similar material but which had been heat-treated by autoclaving at 110 °C for 120 min. In Experiment 2, twelve rats and twelve pigs were fed four semisynthetic diets containing commercial CSM as the sole protein source. Chromic oxide was added to all diets as an indigestible marker. For each pair of diets in both experiments, PEG was either included or excluded. Ileal contents from the terminal 15 and 45 cm of ileum were collected at slaughter for the rats and pigs, respectively. Apparent ileal amino acid digestibility for rats fed the cottonseed kernel/hulls diet was significantly depressed by the heat treatment, particularly for lysine and threonine. On average, apparent ileal amino acid digestibility in the diets without PEG was decreased from 0. 80 to 0. 70 by heat treatment. Dietary cottonseed CT depressed apparent ileal protein digestibility in the pig and in the rat. The addition of PEG to the diets significantly increased the apparent ileal digestibility of N and some amino acids for the pigs and the rats. The mean increase in apparent ileal digestibility due to PEG addition for the 14 amino acids was 2 % units in both species fed the commercial CSM diets, and 2 or 4 % units in rats fed the unheated or the heated cottonseed kernel/hull diets, respectively. The effect of PEG was similar in the heated and unheated cottonseed kernel/hulls for most amino acids, but responses to PEG for lysine, threonine and tyrosine were greater in heated than unheated CSM. For several of the amino acids there were significant animal species differences in apparent ileal digestibility. Studies into the effects of cottonseed CT should be carried out in the target animal species. The commercial CSM had a low apparent ileal amino acid digestibility overall, particularly for the essential amino acids lysine and threonine. It was concluded that effects of heating did not eliminate the reversible reactivity of cottonseed CT on amino acid digestion in rats and pigs but rather appeared to increase it for threonine, tyrosine and lysine in Experiment 1, causing large reductions in apparent ileal digestibility. It was concluded that CT in CSM are mainly in the protein- and fibre-bound forms (80 %), with only 10 - 20 % of CT being extractable. In the absence of heat, adding graded levels of hulls reduced both the solubility and degradability of protein by rumen microorganisms, giving a rumen 'by-pass' effect. However, the magnitude of these effects was small and they are not regarded as being nutritionally significant under practical conditions of ruminant nutrition. Adding hulls significantly depressed the digestion of amino acids in the small intestine of the monogastric animals. This effect is considered large, and {{is probably one of the}} factors responsible for the generally low levels of amino acid availability found for commercially produced CSM. Approximately half of the 'hull effect' is due to their content of CT and the cause of the other 50 % is unknown. As there is no CT in cottonseed kernels, this explains the lack of response to PEG when the diet does not contain cottonseed hulls. The study has also shown that the large amount of heat applied during normal commercial CSM processing reduces the digestion of amino acids by monogastric animals. A combination of heat and CT from hulls is especially damaging for lowing ileal amino acid digestion in monogastric species, particularly for the limiting essential amino acids lysine and threonine...|$|R
