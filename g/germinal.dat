They won the first leg 4–0 at Veltwijckstadion with Fredi Bobic and Jonathan Akpoborie each scoring twice. In the return game, Stuttgart {{suffered}} a 2–4 loss, but regardless of this, goals from Frank Verlaat and Gerhard Poschner ensured they won the stage 6–4.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of decimal time proved an immense task {{and under the}} article 22 {{of the law of}} 18 <b>Germinal,</b> Year III (7 April 1795), the use of decimal time was no longer mandatory, though the Republican Calendar was retained. On 1 January 1806, France reverted to the traditional timekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Important {{factors for}} the {{germination}} of spores are mainly moisture and temperature. The spores usually remain germinable after several years; {{there were even}} spores preserved in herbarium specimens which germinated after 75 years. After the spores' development, they first receive a diploid nucleus, and the meiosis {{takes place in the}} spore. At the germination, the spore shells open either alongside special <b>germinal</b> pores or chinks, or rip irregularly and then release one to four haploid protoplasts.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar <b>germinal</b> centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a <b>germinal</b> disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} time {{anything}} other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus <b>germinal</b> in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs {{was the first}} place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.|$|E

25|$|Cephalopod eggs span a large {{range of}} sizes, from 1 to 30mm in diameter. The fertilised ovum {{initially}} divides {{to produce a}} disc of <b>germinal</b> cells at one pole, with the yolk remaining at the opposite pole. The <b>germinal</b> disc grows to envelop and eventually absorb the yolk, forming the embryo. The tentacles and arms first appear at the hind part of the body, where the foot would be in other molluscs, and only later migrate towards the head.|$|E

25|$|In 1800 the Banque de France, {{a federal}} {{establishment}} {{with a private}} board of executives, was created and commissioned to produce the national currency. In 1803, the Franc <b>germinal</b> (named after the month <b>Germinal</b> in the revolutionary calendar) was established, creating a gold franc containing 290.034mg of fine gold. From this point, gold and silver-based units circulated interchangeably {{on the basis of}} a 1:15.5 ratio between the values of the two metals (bimetallism) until 1864, when all silver coins except the 5-franc piece were debased from 90% to 83.5% silver without the weights changing.|$|E
25|$|Marker for <b>germinal</b> center {{phenotype}} (CD10, HGAL, BCL6, CD38) {{are considered}} a favorable prognostic factor, but CD10+, BCL2+ tumors could have poorer survival. For some authors, CD10 expression in DLBCL does not influence survival.|$|E
25|$|Autoreactive B {{cells can}} accidentally emerge during somatic {{hypermutation}} and migrate into the <b>germinal</b> center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally {{do not receive}} survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a <b>germinal</b> centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence.|$|E
25|$|Testicular seminoma {{originates}} in the <b>germinal</b> epithelium of the seminiferous tubules. About half of germ cell {{tumors of the}} testicles are seminomas. Treatment usually requires removal of one testicle. However, fertility usually isn't affected. All other sexual functions will remain intact.|$|E
25|$|The matrix, {{sometimes}} called the matrix unguis, keratogenous membrane, nail matrix, or onychostroma, is the tissue (or <b>germinal</b> matrix) which the nail protects. It {{is the part of}} the nail bed that is beneath the nail and contains nerves, lymph and blood vessels.|$|E

25|$|A lymph {{follicle}} is a dense {{collection of}} lymphocytes, the number, size and configuration of which change {{in accordance with}} the functional state of the lymph node. For example, the follicles expand significantly when encountering a foreign antigen. The selection of B cells, or B lymphocytes, occurs in the <b>germinal</b> center of the lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|Tingible body macrophages (TBMs)– large {{phagocytic}} {{cells in}} the <b>germinal</b> centers of secondary lymph nodes– express CD68 protein. These cells normally engulf B cells that have undergone apoptosis after somatic hypermutation. In some people with SLE, significantly fewer TBMs can be found, and these cells rarely contain material from apoptotic B cells. Also, uningested apoptotic nuclei can be found outside of TBMs. This material may present {{a threat to the}} tolerization of B cells and T cells. Dendritic {{cells in the}} <b>germinal</b> center may endocytose such antigenic material and present it to T cells, activating them. Also, apoptotic chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and make this material available for activating other B cells that may have randomly acquired self-specificity through somatic hypermutation. Necrosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death, is increased in T lymphocytes, due to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and depletion of ATP.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{vaccination}} generates {{an effective}} immune memory via {{the display of}} antigen-antibody complexes on follicular dendritic cells (FDC), which are potent B-cell stimulators. T-cells can be stimulated by similar, <b>germinal</b> centre dendritic cells. FDC are able to generate an immune memory because antibodies production “overlaps” long-term expression of antigen, allowing antigen-antibody immunocomplexes to form and be displayed by FDC.|$|E
25|$|This {{exposure}} {{of the body to}} substantial amounts of previously isolated thyroid enzymes is thought to contribute to the exacerbation of tolerance breakdown, giving rise to the more pronounced symptoms seen later in the disease. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyrocyte-associated tissues often leads to the histologically significant finding of <b>germinal</b> center development within the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|As a {{practical}} matter, however, international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists {{and others to}} improve their offspring by <b>germinal</b> choice technology. According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky, existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their child's genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Granulosa cell {{tumors are}} the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and {{juvenile}} granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the ovarian follicle from a population of cells that surrounds <b>germinal</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|France was a {{founding}} member of the Latin Monetary Union (LMU) in 1865. The common currency was based on the franc <b>germinal,</b> with the name franc already being used in Switzerland and Belgium, whilst other countries used their own names for the currency. In 1873, the LMU went over to a purely gold standard of 1 franc = 0.290322581 grams of gold.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} public {{interest}} organization, the U.S.-based Center for Genetics and Society, was formed, in 2001, {{with the specific}} goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology, such as full-term human cloning and <b>germinal</b> choice technology. The Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future of the Chicago-Kent College of Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting.|$|E
25|$|A {{study that}} {{investigated}} the methylome of B cells along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), {{showed that there}} is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most differentiated stages.

Furthermore, this study showed {{that there is a}} similarity between B cell tumors and long-lived B cells in their DNA methylation signatures.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, in Areguá is born {{his only}} son, Alejandro Rafael. In July 1908, Albino Jara {{organized}} a military insurrection. Barrett organized {{the attention to}} the wounded {{in the streets of}} Asunción. On October 3 of the same year, Barrett was arrested because of denounces about tortures and abuse that he published in <b>Germinal</b> (an anarchist newspaper that he owned) and on October 13, thanks to the help of the English Consul, he was released. He was exiled to Corumbá in the Brazilian Mato Grosso do Sul.|$|E
25|$|Monocytes {{isolated}} from whole blood {{of people with}} SLE show reduced expression of CD44 surface molecules involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells. Most of the monocytes and tingible body macrophages (TBMs), which {{are found in the}} <b>germinal</b> centres of lymph nodes, even show a definitely different morphology; they are smaller or scarce and die earlier. Serum components like complement factors, CRP, and some glycoproteins are, furthermore, decisively important for an efficiently operating phagocytosis. With SLE, these components are often missing, diminished, or inefficient.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, the {{hypersensitivity}} {{is seen as}} diffuse parenchymal infiltration by lymphocytes, particularly plasma B-cells, {{which can}} often be seen as secondary lymphoid follicles (<b>germinal</b> centers, {{not to be confused}} with the normally present colloid-filled follicles that constitute the thyroid). Atrophy of the colloid bodies is lined by Hürthle cells, cells with intensely eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, a metaplasia from the normal cuboidal cells that constitute the lining of the thyroid follicles. Severe thyroid atrophy presents often with denser fibrotic bands of collagen that remains within the confines of the thyroid capsule.|$|E
25|$|According to Yasht 13.14, {{the waters}} flow, the plants spring forth, and the winds blow through the khvarenah of the Fravashis. In Yasna 68.11, {{the waters of}} Aredvi Sura are invoked to bestow {{radiance}} and glory. Khvarenah is also associated with the waters in other texts; with the world-sea Vourukasha in Yasht 19.51 and 19.56-57; with the Helmand river in Yasht 19.66ff. It is also identified with Haoma, together with which it plays a seminal role in {{the legend of the}} birth of Zoroaster. In these passages, khvarenah has a seminal and <b>germinal</b> implication, being both fiery fluid and living seed.|$|E

Immature B cells which are miR-155 deficient evade apoptosis as a result of elevated Bcl-2 protein levels; a protein that was found to be involved in B Cell malignancies and to be controlled by miR-155.|$|E
25|$|Between the births of {{her sons}} – Hans in 1892 and Peter in 1896 – Kollwitz saw a {{performance}} of Gerhart Hauptmann's The Weavers, which dramatized the oppression of the Silesian weavers in Langenbielau and their failed revolt in 1844. Inspired, the artist ceased work {{on a series of}} etchings she had intended to illustrate Émile Zola's <b>Germinal,</b> and produced a cycle of six works on the weavers theme, three lithographs (Poverty, Death, and Conspiracy) and three etchings with aquatint and sandpaper (March of the Weavers, Riot, and The End). Not a literal illustration of the drama, the works were a free and naturalistic expression of the workers' misery, hope, courage, and eventually, doom.|$|E
25|$|Sembène's {{third and}} most famous novel is Les Bouts de Bois de Dieu (God's Bits of Wood, 1960); most critics {{consider}} it his masterpiece, rivaled only by Xala. The novel fictionalizes the real-life {{story of a}} railroad strike on the Dakar-Niger line that lasted from 1947 to 1948. Though the charismatic and brilliant union spokesman, Ibrahima Bakayoko, is the most central figure, the novel has no true hero except the community itself, which bands together {{in the face of}} hardship and oppression to assert their rights. Accordingly, the novel features nearly fifty characters in both Senegal and neighboring Mali, showing the strike from all possible angles; in this, the novel is often compared to Émile Zola's <b>Germinal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ovary is {{differentiated}} into {{a central}} part, the medulla of ovary, {{covered by a}} surface layer, the <b>germinal</b> epithelium. The immature ova originate from cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac. Once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called oogonia. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells (pre-granulosa cells) In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. The embryological origin of granulosa cells, on the other hand, remains controversial. Just as in the male, there is a gubernaculum in the female, which pulls it downward, albeit {{not as much as}} in males. The gubernaculum later becomes the proper ovarian ligament and the round ligament of the uterus.|$|E
