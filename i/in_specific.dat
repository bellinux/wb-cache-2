Red vs. Blue generated annual revenues of US$200,000, and special promotional episodes were commissioned by Bungie. The first series, The Blood Gulch Chronicles, ended on June 28, 2007, after 100 regular episodes and numerous promotional videos. Subsequent series include The Recollection, which contains more dramatic elements than its comedic predecessor, Project Freelancer, The Chorus Trilogy, and Anthology, the most recent series. Other machinima series include Fire Team Charlie, The Codex, and the in-game interview show This Spartan Life.|$|E

In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed <b>in</b> <b>specific</b> eurozone markets.|$|E

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive <b>in</b> <b>specific</b> areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them <b>in</b> <b>specific</b> brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E
5|$|Children's author Alison Uttley (1884–1976) {{was born}} at Cromford; her {{well-known}} novel A Traveller in Time, set in Dethick, recounts the Babington Plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, from imprisonment. Crichton Porteous (1901–91) set several books <b>in</b> <b>specific</b> locations in the Peak; Toad Hole, Lucky Columbell and Broken River, for example, are set in the Derwent Valley. More recently, Geraldine Brooks's first novel, Year of Wonders (2001), blends fact and fiction {{to tell the story}} of the plague village of Eyam, which also inspired Children of Winter by children's novelist Berlie Doherty (b. 1943). Doherty has set several other works in the Peak, including Deep Secret, based on the drowning of the villages of Derwent and Ashopton by the Ladybower Reservoir, and Blue John, inspired by the Blue John Cavern at Castleton.|$|E

5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling.

Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they must be used <b>in</b> <b>specific</b> sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E
5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds).

Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only <b>in</b> <b>specific</b> tracts of skin called pterylae.
