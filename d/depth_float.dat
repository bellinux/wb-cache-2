Since the added mass of a floating body varies with wave frequency and water depth, a correction factor is developed to take these effects into account. Using a developed two-dimensional numerical wave tank technique, the reference added masses are calculated for various water depths at high frequency, and used them as basis values to formulate the correction factors. To verify the effectiveness of the developed formulas, the predicted heave added mass coefficients for various wetted body sections and wave frequencies are compared with numerical results from the Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) technique...|$|R

40|$|Offshore wind is a {{valuable}} source of renewable energy, as it is typically strong and steady. Turbines have been utilized offshore in parts of Europe and Asia, however only at shallow <b>depths.</b> <b>Floating</b> wind turbines must be implemented in deeper areas to be economical, but this technology is relatively new and untested. This paper describes a numerical analysis model {{that can be used}} to investigate the motion of a 5 MW floating turbine subjected to ocean conditions. Prototype designs for a spar buoy and barge platform are studied. The stiffness and damping effects brought about by the mooring lines are evaluated using a dynamic cable model. A boundary element model is used to calculate added mass and damping effects, as well as the forces on the structure caused by the wave- body interaction. The governing equations of motion include all the added mass, damping and stiffness components in the frequency domain. Response of the structure is found by solving the governing equation combined with a wave spectrum to represent actual ocean wave fields. Approximate bending moments at the base of each design are found by inputting the predicted base motion into a linear modal analysis model created in SAP 2000. Based on the results found in this paper, incoming waves cause much greater motion of the barge design, especially in the pitching directio...|$|R

Studies on the choanoflagellate distribution during two deep-sea expeditions, to the South Atlantic (5038 m) and Antarctica (Weddell Sea, 2551 m), revealed the deepest records of choanoflagellates so far. A new species, (Lagenoeca antarctica) with a conspicuous spike structure on the theca is described from deep Antarctic waters. Lagenoeca antarctica sp. n. is a solitary unstalked free living salpingoecid-like choanoflagellate. The protoplast {{is surrounded by a}} typical theca with unique spikes only visible in SEM micrographs. The ovoid cell nearly fills the whole theca and ranges in size from 4 to 6 µm. The collar measures 2 - 3 µm and the flagellum 3 - 5 µm. A second species, Salpingoeca abyssalis sp. n., was isolated from the abyssal plain of the South Atlantic (5038 m <b>depth).</b> <b>Floating</b> and attached forms were observed. The protoplast ranges from to 2 to 4 µm in length and 1 to 2 µm in width. The collar is about the same length as the protoplast and the flagellum has 2 to 2. 5 × the length of the protoplast.

To {{gain insight into}} how these changes may affect biotic communities, we examined whether variation in the abundance and community structure of large fishes (SL. 8 cm) in Everglades marshes varied more at regional or intraregional scales, and whether this variation was related to hydroperiod, water <b>depth,</b> <b>floating</b> mat volume, and vegetation density. From October 1997 to October 2002, we used an airboat electrofisher to sample large fishes at sites within three regions of the Everglades. Each of these regions is subject to unique watermanagement schedules. Dry-down events (water depth, 10 cm) occurred at several sites during spring in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. The 2001 dry-down event was the most severe and widespread. Abundance of several fishes decreased significantly through time, {{and the number of}} days post-dry-down covaried significantly with abundance for several species. Processes operating at the regional scale appear to play important roles in regulating large fishes. The most pronounced patterns in abundance and community structure occurred at the regional scale, and the effect size for region was greater than the effect size for sites nested within region for abundance of all species combined, all predators combined, and each of the seven most abundant species. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed distinct groupings of sites corresponding to the three regions. We also found significant variation in community structure through time that correlated with the number of days post-dry-down. Our results suggest that hydroperiod and water management at the regional scale influence large fish communities of Everglades marshes...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} float chamber, and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the float chamber affected this. Fish's design kept the float chamber, but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel <b>depth.</b> The <b>float</b> chamber was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the metering jet. This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|R

Broodstock of a pilot fish culture project in the Komodo area (Flores, Indonesia) were kept in floating fish cages with a surface area of 16 m 2 and a depth of 6 m, where they reproduced natu-rally without hormonal treatment. The grouper species stocked at Komodo were found to typically spawn around the period of new moon. Duration of spawning varied from 3 – 14 days. Spawning occurred in groups (E. fuscoguttatus) or in discrete pairs (E. coioides, C. altivelis). Time of spawning varied between dusk (E. coioides) to beyond midnight (C. altivelis and E. fuscoguttatus). Possibly, natural spawning was facilitated by the broodstock compartment’s water depth, which was about two times greater than in the shore-based tanks that are most commonly used. The greater water <b>depth</b> of <b>floating</b> fish cages appears to facilitate pre-spawning behaviour (“dancing”) and spawning itself.

5000|$|A fixed {{platform}} {{is a type}} of offshore platform used for the production of oil or gas. These platforms are built on concrete and/or steel legs anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting a deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters.

Steel jackets are vertical sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed. Concrete caisson structures, pioneered by the Condeep concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore (Norwegian fjords and Scottish firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed.

The results show that increased solar radiation after transfer from deep to shallow water, as well as UV radiation, affected the succession of macrobenthic communities.
