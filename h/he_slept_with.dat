500|$|Since his {{military}} service, Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> a loaded pistol under his pillow. A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records {{indicated that he}} took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares. During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on Placidyl, and locked himself alone {{in a hotel room}} for a week to successfully break the addiction. Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness, and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming. His first wife, Wanda Hendrix, stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans. Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge. His poem [...] "The Crosses Grow on Anzio" [...] appeared in his book To Hell and Back, but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Buzz {{magazine}} became bored of the repetitive {{nature of the}} storyline surrounding Mark trying to ask Kate out again. They said [...] "honestly, {{how many times have}} we been through this with these two?" [...] They later branded him [...] "one angry man" [...] during the police corruption storyline. They said <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> Jade because [...] "too much stewing over work and not enough play makes Brennan a dull boy". TV Week described Mark's departure episode as [...] "edge-of-your-seat." [...] While a reporter for the Daily Record said [...] "Goodbye Brennan - we enjoyed having you and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end." [...] Nicky Branagh from Studentbeans.com included Mark in her list of the [...] "Top ten hottest Aussie soap guys" [...] and she stated [...] "As Ramsay Street's resident hottie back in 2010, Scott McGregor graced Neighbours as the coolest kind of police investigator (he rode a motorbike). Unfortunately for us, Scott fled his neighbourly friends to flaunt his devilishly handsome face to the world as a model." ...|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1864, a {{ball was}} put on by a Massachusetts {{regiment}} stationed in Virginia featuring young drummer boys dressed as women. One man wrote to his wife that <b>he</b> had <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> one of the [...] "boy-girls." ...|$|R

500|$|Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones: Indiana's father, a {{professor}} of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery {{in mind when he}} suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as [...] "a crazy, eccentric" [...] professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is [...] "strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, [...] "Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond movies." [...] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. [...] "I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [...] Burton," [...] Connery commented. [...] "I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father." [...] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that [...] "whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better". Connery signed to the film on March25, 1988. He improvised the line, [...] "She talks in her sleep", which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> Elsa occurs later.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome {{died from}} cancer in 2004, and the Herolds' only child {{died in a}} car accident; as a result, Sandra Herold {{regarded}} Travis almost as a son and pampered him. Sandra slept and bathed with Travis, saying, [...] "I'm, like, hollow now. <b>He</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> me every night. Until you've eaten with a chimp and bathed with a chimp, you don't know a chimp." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mircea Eliade's The Encyclopedia of Religion (1993) draws {{parallels}} between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> her, she {{was transformed into a}} beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common Northern European motif (see [...] "Loathly lady").|$|E
50|$|Some of the character's earlier minor storylines {{involved}} David Platt {{developing a}} crush on Mel, but she stood him up. To get his revenge, he spread gossip that <b>he</b> had <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> Mel, but was forced to apologise by his mother.|$|R
50|$|Colton Haynes - When {{asked if}} he was a gold star by Andy Cohen, Haynes said that he was not a gold star because <b>he</b> has <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> four women. <b>He</b> lost his virginity to a woman while still closeted and <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> three more women after having come out as gay.|$|R
50|$|He is {{particularly}} angry that the Managing Director {{of the firm}} has strung him on for weeks.

2500|$|In Morocco {{during one}} of their trips to North Africa, Crosby and Caresse took a 13-year-old dancing girl named Zora to bed with them. His seductive {{abilities}} became legendary in some social circles in Paris, and he engaged {{in a series of}} ongoing affairs, maintaining relationships with a variety of beautiful and doting young women. In July 1925, he met a fourteen-year-old girl named [...] "Nubile." [...] <b>He</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> a 13-year-old Berber girl in North Africa and a young Arab boy in Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|Francia had a {{very liberal}} view of sexuality. He made {{marriage}} subject to high taxation and restrictions, and insisted he personally officiate over all weddings. Francia kept a ledger of all the women <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with,</b> and despite having no close relationships he sired seven illegitimate children, the oldest being Ubalda García de Cañete. When he caught her prostituting herself outside his palace, he declared prostitution an honourable profession and that all whores should wear golden hair combs. They thus became known as [...] "peinetas de oro" [...] (gold combs) in order to humiliate Spanish ladies, {{as it was a}} Spanish fashion.|$|E
2500|$|In his lifetime, Johnson {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a man who had numerous children with several European and Native American women. At the time, men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children, as long as they could afford it and supported them. One 20th-century scholar estimated that Johnson had perhaps 100 illegitimate children, but the historian Francis Jennings argued that [...] "there is no truth in wild stories that <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> innumerable Mohawk women." [...] In his will, Johnson acknowledged children by Catherine Weisenberg and Molly Brant, German and Mohawk, respectively, with whom he had long-term relationships. He implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers.|$|E
