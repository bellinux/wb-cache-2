5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Goldman {{moved with}} her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she {{enrolled}} in a Realschule. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and {{she was unable to}} attend.|$|E

5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> riskier slip knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E

25|$|The edges may be {{directed}} or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent {{people at a}} party, {{and there is an}} edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> person B only if B also shakes <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>A.</b> In contrast, if any edge from a person A to a person B corresponds to As admiring B, then this graph is directed, because admiration is not necessarily reciprocated. The former type of graph is called an undirected graph and the edges are called undirected edges while the latter type of graph is called a directed graph and the edges are called directed edges.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015, a {{branding}} {{campaign was}} launched to highlight county government services, with its centerpiece being the official seal of Bergen County, depicting a Dutch settler shaking <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Native American.

25|$|Before {{settling}} in Foster City, California in 1977, the Thiels {{had lived in}} South Africa and South-West Africa, and Peter had to change elementary schools seven times. One of Peter's elementary schools, a strict establishment in Swakopmund, required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment, such as striking students' <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ruler for mistakes. This experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in Thiel's support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult.|$|E

25|$|The {{abuses of}} the hacienda system and the caciques made the area ripe for the insurgent {{movement}} under Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. In 1810, José María Morelos y Pavón passed through the Costa Grande from Michoacán {{in order to take}} Acapulco, having little trouble recruiting soldiers. However, many hacienda owners were also recruited, especially in Tecpan and Coyuca, mostly due to strong nationalist and anti-Spanish sentiment among criollos in the area. For the most part, the Costa Grande would remain in insurgent <b>hands,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major insurgent headquarters in Tecpan, which was a province created by Morelos himself in 1811.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the {{appetite}} {{of the god}} was not appeased. He ever wished for more. In order to furnish him with a larger supply, the victims were piled up on his <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> big chain above them which kept them in their place. Some devout persons had at the beginning wished to count them, to see whether their number corresponded with {{the days of the}} solar year; but others were brought, and it was impossible to distinguish them in the giddy motion of the horrible arms. This lasted for a long, indefinite time until the evening. Then the partitions inside assumed a darker glow, and burning flesh could be seen. Some even believed that they could descry hair, limbs, and whole bodies.|$|E
25|$|During the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary {{were seen}} on Spanish soil at Ezquioga. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked {{the palms of}} her <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword. Seers gained much {{credence}} in Integrist and Carlist circles. The visions at Ezquioga were widely covered in the press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. Conservative elements in the Spanish Church actively encouraged the Fátima devotion {{as a way of}} countering the perceived threat of atheistic Communism. In Portugal and its former colony of Brazil, conservative groups were sometimes associated with the cult of Fátima. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, some Catholics interpreted this in terms of the Fátima apparitions, and believed that the Virgin's prophecy was about to be fulfilled.|$|E

25|$|The letter X is {{the most}} known symbol of {{straight}} edge, and is sometimes worn as a marking {{on the back of}} both hands, though it can be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight edge have also incorporated the symbol into clothing and pins. According to a series of interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge X {{can be traced to the}} Teen Idles' brief West Coast tour in 1980. The band's members were scheduled to play at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens, but when they arrived, club management discovered that they were all under the legal drinking age and would be denied entry to the club. As a compromise, management marked each of the members' <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large black X as a warning to the club's staff not to serve alcohol to the band.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} who are not married and are not closely related are {{generally}} not allowed to touch each other. Many Orthodox married couples will also not touch one another in public. A person who refrains from touching the opposite sex is said to be shomer negiah. Shmirath negiah applies to touching that is b'derech chiba (in an affectionate manner). According to some authorities, mainly of Modern Orthodox background, a quick handshake, particularly in the context of earning a living in a business setting, does not fall under this category. However, people who are stringently shomer negiah will avoid shaking <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> member of the opposite sex, even in a business context. This is almost universally observed within the Haredi community, and somewhat observed within the Modern Orthodox community where the term originated in recent decades. Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of soft skin of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rotary motion, and chewed as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the sensations}} of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than {{shake hands with}} him. This was not the case; Hitler {{had been told by}} IOC {{president}} Baillet-Latour not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not; this, however was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years retellings of what Brundage termed [...] "a fairy tale" [...] roused the American to [...] "acute fury". Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, [...] "Do you really think that I'd allow myself to be photographed shaking <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Negro?" ...|$|E

[...] Wooden Leg himself did not attend the 50th anniversary, not out of fear, but because the site was now on Crow land, to whom he still felt much animosity. [...] He had resolved [...] "never again to go to any place where I might be called upon to shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Crow". [...] This was very different to his attitude to other former enemies such as the Shoshones, to whom he travelled on a friendly visit. [...] In 1913 Wooden Leg was part of a Cheyenne delegation to Washington. [...] He also visited New York and Philadelphia during this trip.|$|E
