40|$|The {{social welfare}} reform recognizes the further {{development}} {{and expansion of}} <b>daycare</b> center <b>services</b> as an important precondition for deinstitutionalization {{as one of the}} key objectives of the reform. Decreasing the number of children and adults in residential institutions, their return to their natural families and preventing institutionalization depend primarily on the support provided at local level to the family for taking care of their family members. Today in Serbia there are 49 daycare centers with 1400 children and persons with disability as beneficiaries. Between 2000 and 2007, thirty seven new daycare centers were established, the total number of beneficiaries more than tripled and the NGO sector became equal with the government sector in <b>service</b> provision. Yet, <b>daycare</b> center <b>services</b> are still not sufficiently developed. In 123 municipalities there are no <b>daycare</b> center <b>services</b> at all and overall these services are significantly less accessible than residential <b>services.</b> <b>Daycare</b> center <b>services</b> consist of both well established and sustainable daycare with significant capacity and also of small, project-based daycare centers that provide services for a few hours and have an uncertain future. The second group consists mostly of daycare centers organized by the NGO sector. The monthly costs of <b>daycare</b> center <b>services</b> per beneficiary in 2007 amounted to 13. 750 diners on average. According to the survey findings, for example, the annual costs for running a <b>daycare</b> center <b>service</b> for 20 beneficiaries are between 2 and 6 million dinars depending on the complexity of the provided services and programs. The costs of residential placement are on average higher than the costs in daycare centers. Further development of <b>daycare</b> center <b>services</b> in Serbia requires additional and focused efforts at central level in terms of formulating special financial incentives for underdeveloped municipalities, developing professional capacity at local level, educating local governments, conceptualizing and establishing regulatory mechanisms, exchanging good practice examples, etc. Still, placing non-residential services {{at the heart of the}} social welfare system can be expected only after undertaking more profound legislative changes. ...|$|R

40|$|Background To {{decide the}} minimal levels (thresholds) of {{physical}} activities {{necessary for a}} self-supporting life using discriminate analysis between community-dwelling elderly individuals and daycare-service-receiving elderly individuals in Japan. Method A total of twenty-six elderly women, including twelve living a self-supporting life and fourteen using a <b>daycare</b> <b>service,</b> were recruited in this study. The parameters examined were physical performance, activities of daily living, exercise capacity. Discriminate {{analysis was used to}} determine the thresholds of physical activities needed to live a self-supporting life. Results Muscle masses, grip strength, lower-extremity muscle force, gait ability and balance function in elderly individuals living a self-supporting life were significant higher than those in elderly individuals using a <b>daycare</b> <b>service.</b> A threshold of physical ability over 75 % classifies accurately using the methods of discriminate analysis indicate total body muscle mass, thigh muscle mass, knee extension force, 6 min walking distance (6 MD), 10 m obstacle walking time, Activity of daily living (ADL) index and daily steps. Conclusions The present study indicates that thresholds of physical activities including gait abilities, muscle force, and muscle mass are very important factors in maintaining a self-supporting life for elderly individuals. Thresholds of physical activities were more effective than standard values of physical activity for elderly individuals using a care service in meeting the goals of rehabilitation...|$|R
