40|$|Infection by <b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> nepovirus (GFLV), a bipartite RNA virus of {{positive}} polarity {{belonging to the}} Comoviridae family, causes extensive cytopathic modifications of the host endomembrane system that eventually culminate {{in the formation of}} a perinuclear “viral compartment. ” We identified by immunoconfocal microscopy this compartment as the site of virus replication since it contained the RNA 1 -encoded proteins necessary for replication, newly synthesized viral RNA, and double-stranded replicative forms. In addition, by using transgenic T-BY 2 protoplasts expressing green fluorescent protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in the Golgi apparatus (GA), we could directly show that GFLV replication induced a depletion of the cortical ER, together with a condensation and redistribution of ER-derived membranes, to generate the viral compartment. Brefeldin A, a drug known to inhibit vesicle trafficking between the GA and the ER, was found to inhibit GFLV replication. Cerulenin, a drug inhibiting de novo synthesis of phospholipids, also inhibited GFLV replication. These observations imply that GFLV replication depends both on ER-derived membrane recruitment and on de novo lipid synthesis. In contrast to proteins involved in viral replication, the 2 B movement protein and, to a lesser extent, the 2 C coat protein were not confined to the viral compartment but were transported toward the cell periphery, a finding consistent with their role in cell-to-cell movement of virus particles...|$|R

50|$|<b>Grapevine</b> <b>Fanleaf</b> <b>Virus</b> (GFLV), {{the cause}} of fanleaf degradation, is the most {{destructive}} viral disease of grapes worldwide. Xiphinema index was discovered to be a vector of this disease in the 1950s.

It is spread by contaminated seed and the grafting of infected rootstocks. In an early experiment, it was shown that California dagger nematodes inoculated with GFLV were still infective after eight months. It is speculated that the two pathogens evolved together, since {{there is evidence that}} the presence of GFLV gives a survival advantage to X. index and not other species of nematodes.

Other documented hosts include: grapevine, raspberry, apple, asparagus, cabbage, carrot, cherry, red clover, peach. [...] The nematode itself inflicts direct damage to plants roots as it penetrates at its preferred feeding site just behind the root tip. [...] Its long stylet enables it to reach into the vascular system of the plant causing local necrosis and hypertrophy. [...] This feeding action prompts the formation of galls on lateral roots, in turn leading to a stunted root system. [...] Above ground symptoms may not always be present in low-level infections but could include: reduced vigor, and chlorosis of leaves. [...] It is often not just the presence of nematodes that is a concern but it is their ability to serve as a virus vector, in this case for the arabis mosaic virus. The odontophore and esophagus are lined with cuticle, which has been shown to retain virus particles as a monolayer. These particles can then be shed with the cuticular lining as the nematode progresses through its normal life cycle.

The crucial point in the process of genetic transformation is to have cells that are able to both regenerate and be transformed. A regeneration system seems to be a major problem in the transformation process. Somatic embryogenesis is the favoured regenerative protocol in genetic transformations of grapes. Comparison of an embryogenic and organogenic system in grape demonstrated that organogenesis frequently leads to chemical transformation of tissues. In this respect we started to develop and apply procedures suitable for the genetic transformation of grapevine. Two sources of explants were used for embryo induction. In the first case, immature zygotic ovules of Vitis vinifera seedless genotypes were used. In the second case in vivo leaf tissues from rootstocks Vitis rupestris cv.

Research on clonal selection of "Sangiovese" conducted {{in the framework of}} the "Qualitative Improvement of Gra-pevine Production and Propagation Material" project within the above-specified area also focused on a biotype with special characteristics, known locally as "Morellino pizzuto". Investigations were car¬ried out to improve knowledge of the ampelographic and genetic charac¬teristics and health status of this variety. Ampelographic determinations on various plant parts of two presumed clones (CH 6 and GA 5) led to identification of characteristics distinguishing these {{from the rest of the}} "Sangiovese" population. In particular, the two presumed clones were distinguished from the homologated clones "Sangiovese "RIO" and "SS-F 9 -A 5 - 48 " used as a reference. The relevant characters were mainly apex and lower leaf surface tomentosity, intensity of shoot tip anthocyanin pigmentation and of lower leaf surface venation, cluster and grape shape. The two presumed clones were compared with "Sangiovese" clones "RIO", "SS-F 9 -A 5 - 48 " and "BBS II" using the microsatellite amplification test, in order to assess their putative genetic identity. DNA extracted from leaf material of container-grown samples was purified and amplified using the PCR technique. Analysis of several loci showed that the biotype of "Mo¬rellino pizzuto" presents certain differences in comparison to traditional "Sangiovese" but also has some degree of relationship with the latter.

In addition to the 5 ′ and 3 ′ noncoding sequences and the 2 A-coding sequence, an additional sequence coding for 2 BMP and/or 2 CCP or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is necessary for RNA 2 replication.

At the first and second harvest, infected leaves showed increases in the concentration of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, the latter increasing for enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase. In contrast, at the last harvest time, increases in the ascorbate pool and ascorbate peroxidase activity maintained hydrogen peroxide to control levels. The glutathione pool was negatively affected as summer progressed, showing a decrease in its total and reduced form amounts. At the same time, increases in the ascorbate pool were observed, making antioxidant defenses of grapevine effective also at the last harvest time. Increases in phenolic acids, and in particular in p-hydroxybenzoic acid, at the first and second harvest might have enhanced the efficiency of the antioxidant system through an interrelation between a peroxidase/phenol/ascorbate system and the NADPH/glutathione/ascorbate cycle. The lack of increase in p-hydroxybenzoic acid at the third harvest could be due instead to the enhanced utilization of this acid for hydrogen peroxide detoxification.

Grapevine protection against these agressors involves the participation of a panel of institutional and professional stakeholders, whose missions range from regulation and research to advice and field application. A crucial phytosanitary problem of viticulture is posed by fungal diseases, and among these downy and powdery mildews, which are controlled by a massive use of fungicides.

Trunk diseases represent another worrying problem, whose etiology is still poorly understood and against which control measures are lacking, since the ban of sodium arsenite. Grapevine can also be affected by numerous diseases caused by <b>viruses</b> (<b>fanleaf,</b> leafroll, etc.) and by phytoplasmas ('Flavescence dorée', 'Bois noir').

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Xiphinema {{index and}} X. diversicaudatum are {{nematodes}} that transmit the <b>grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> <b>virus</b> and the Arabis mosaic virus, respectively. These viruses {{are the two}} agents mainly responsible for the disease that causes the most economic damage to grapevines worldwide. The infectious degeneration of grapevines affects vine performance and grape composition. The control of Xiphinema populations by soil disinfection is now impossible because of the removal from the market of the last available chemical treatments. In this study, saponins are assessed as an alternative treatment to control nematode populations. Methods and Results: The nematicidal effect of saponins from Gypsophila paniculata roots was tested against X. index and X. diversicaudatum. In aqueous media, a concentration of 1 mg/mL {{was associated with a}} mortality of greater than 95 % in both nematodes, while in rearing soil, 73 % of X. index and 85 % of X. diversicaudatum were killed by 150 μg of saponins per gram of soil. In addition, an ecotoxicological study was undertaken on two soil bio-indicators (the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae and soil nitrification) that revealed that they were not affected by Gy. paniculata saponins at a nematicidal concentration. In the soil, investigation of the major Gy. paniculata root saponins revealed that these molecules were completely degraded in the soil within 4 days. Conclusion: We show that Gy. paniculata saponins are an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment against two nematodes that transmit <b>grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> <b>virus.</b> Significance of the Study: This saponin-based alternative to chemical treatments could provide an environmentally safe and efficient solution for vine growers to use against grapevine fanleaf vector nematodes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> <b>virus</b> (GFLV) is {{responsible}} for fanleaf degeneration, {{which is one of}} the most severe virus diseases of grapevines worldwide. GFLV causes substantial crop losses, reduces fruit quality and shortens the longevity of grapevines in the vineyard. GFLV is transmitted specifically from grapevine to grapevine by the ectoparasitic nematode Xiphinema index, and belongs to the genus Nepovirus in the family Comoviridae. Since the discovery of the nematode vector in the late 1950 ’s and the identification of GFLV as the agent responsible for fanleaf degeneration in the early 1960 ’s, a wealth of information has been accumulated on its transmission, biological properties and serological characteristics, as well as on the structure and expression of the GFLV genome. Although dissemination of the virus through propagatio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> <b>virus</b> (GFLV) and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV- 3) {{have been}} {{detected}} by Double-Antibody Sandwich (DAS) -ELISA in six lo-cations where grapevines are commonly grown in Jor-dan. Using pairs of specific primers, fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of GLRaV- 3 and the coat protein (CP) gene of GFLV were amplified from symptomatic grapevine tissues by Im-munocapture-Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (IC-RT-PCR). After cloning and sequencing, sequences of the amplified fragments were deposited in Genbank. Alignment analysis revealed that the ampli-fied CP gene fragment of the Jordanian isolate of GFLV (GFLV-JOR) shared sequence identity between 82 and 88 % with 11 GFLV isolates {{from different parts of}} the world. High sequence identity (95 - 99 %) was observed between the amplified fragment of RdRp gene of GLRaV- 3 from Jordan (GLRaV- 3 -JOR) and isolate...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{samples were}} {{collected}} in late spring 2005 from vineyards in 25 different locations of the Bekaa valley, the main grapevine-growing area of Lebanon, to investi-gate {{the presence of the}} longidorid nematode Xiphine-ma index Thorne & Allen, the vector of Grapevine fan-leaf virus (GFLV). Approximately 14 % of the samples contained the nematode, which was found in all devel-opmental stages except for males, which are very rare in this species. The density of the nematode population ranged from 8 to 45 specimens/ 500 ml of soil. The main morphological characteristics of taxonomic relevance in the Lebanese population of X. index are described, while selected morphometric parameters from a popula-tion of 18 specimens were compared with those report-ed in the literature. This is the first survey for the pres-ence and distribution of X. index in Lebanon. Key words: Xiphinema index, nematode virus vector, <b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> <b>virus...</b>|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{was characterized}} in 14 isolates of <b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> <b>virus</b> (GFLV) recovered from grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Virions {{were collected by}} immunocapture, and a 1557 bp fragment containing part of the viral coat protein gene {{and part of the}} untranslated region to its 3 « side was amplified by RT–PCR. Sequence variation among isolates was characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and by sequencing. The AvaII-generated RFLP patterns from the various isolates were highly variable. The isolates were passaged in Chenopodium quinoa. The RFLP patterns altered with passage through the alternate host, but the variation stabilized after a number of passages. Individual genomes were recovered by cloning. The subcloned sequences were found to vary from each other by as much as 13 %, and the encoded amino acid sequences by as much as 9 %. The data suggest that the GFLV genome consists of quasispecies populations...|$|E
