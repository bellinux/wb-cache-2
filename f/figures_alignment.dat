40|$|The {{fabrication}} of free-form optics presents unique challenges {{not only to}} the diamond turning process, but also to the process by which the whorkpiece is located with respect to the machine axes. While rotationally symmetric parts only require alignment in, at most, three directions, free-form optics require alignment in up to six directions. Distinct from alignment in an optical system, fixture alignment for diamond turning requires a separate set of techniques to accommodate the forces encountered in machining. Some general principles, alignment techniques, and an application are discussed. While the techniques discussed here focus on diamond turning, many of the considerations apply to other fabrication techniques as well. Background Why is alignment important in fabrication? One important thing to remember about part alignment in diamond turning is that it has no effect on the figure error of the part. <b>Figure</b> <b>alignment</b> is mainly impacted by the geometric errors of the machine and tool alignment errors. Hence, it can be argued part placement has no impact on the final optical surface...|$|R

In particular, the study on detecting human-related video events in complex scenes with both a crowd of people and dynamic motion is still limited. In this paper, we investigate detecting video events that involve elementary human actions, e. g. making cellphone call, putting an object down, and pointing to something, in complex scenes using a novel spatio-temporal descriptor based approach. A new spatiotemporal descriptor, which temporally integrates the statistics of a set of response maps of low-level features, e. g. image gradients and optical flows, in a space-time cube, is proposed to capture the characteristics of actions in terms of their appearance and motion patterns. Based on this kind of descriptors, the bag-of-words method is utilized to describe a human figure as a concise feature vector. Then, these features are employed to train SVM classifiers at multiple spatial pyramid levels to distinguish different actions. Finally, a Gaussian kernel based temporal filtering is conducted to segment the sequences of events from a video stream taking account of the temporal consistency of actions. The proposed approach is capable of tolerating spatial layout variations and local deformations of human actions due to diverse view angles and rough human <b>figure</b> <b>alignment</b> in complex scenes. Extensive experiments on the 50 -hour video dataset of TRECVid 2008 event detection task demonstrate that our approach outperforms the well-known SIFT descriptor based methods and effectively detects video events in challenging real-world conditions...|$|R

The six orthogonal kinematic degrees of freedom are controlled by six hydraulic zones [...] three axial, two lateral, plus a transverse lateral. By varying the fluid volumes in these hydraulic zones the mirror position can be adjusted in all six degrees of freedom. Because of the finite lengths of the linkages that connect the mirror to the lateral supports, any shift in mirror position changes the amplitudes and directions of the applied forces with a resulting effect on the static balance and mirror figure. These effects have been calculated for mirror translations and rotations in all six degrees of freedom, resulting in predictions {{of the changes in}} the axial and lateral support forces and in the mirror figure.

A system concept for a dual purpose optical truss laser metrology system is described which is used for both <b>figure</b> and <b>alignment</b> maintenance and telescope pointing. A two-stage figure active control approach was developed for several proposed spaceborne far infrared segmented telescopes, {{one of which is}} the 10 - 20 meters Large Deployable Reflector (LDR). The first active control stage, the figure initialization control system, aligns the optical elements (i. e., the primary segments, secondary and focal plane assembly) based on images obtained.

It measures the relative positions and alignments of the telescope segments so that a controller can reposition them appropriately. The application of this optical truss for figure maintenance control is the subject of {{the first part of this}} paper. The second portion of this paper discusses the application of the optical truss to telescope pointing.
