40|$|It is {{now well}} known that the field {{emission}} performance of single crystal silicon field emitters is improved by the formation of porous silicon on their surface.

40|$|Appendices {{available}} on CD-Rom in hardcopy available in Baillieu Special Collections© 2002 Dr. David Hayden CollinsFugitive air emissions from heavy industrial buildings exhibit substantial {{spatial and temporal}} variability. These characteristics present substantial challenges for representative sampling, accurate analysis, plume dispersion modelling and environmental impact assessment. Little published research is available to remedy these problems. In this thesis, {{a broad range of}} interesting and useful experimental, analytical and numerical modelling methods were developed, validated and applied to assist with the characterisation and control of fugitive air emissions from heavy industrial buildings. By way of introduction, building emission pathways were described and existing studies were reviewed. Field studies were then carried out at a number of aluminium smelters to characterise the velocity and concentration profiles associated with common fugitive building emission sources. Many recommendations for improvement to existing USEPA measurement methods were put forward based on the insight gained from these studies. A number of general analytical models were developed for estimating buoyancy and wind driven building emission velocity distribution, concentration distribution and flow rate. The estimates obtained were in good agreement with observations. A two dimensional computational fluid dynamic (2 D CFD) modelling study was then carried out to assess the usefulness of CFD modelling for <b>emission</b> <b>characterisation.</b> The agreement between modelled and limited measured data was excellent. Next typical fugitive emission sources were investigated and mathematical models were developed to help estimate emissions. For example, a generalised mathematical model for estimating leakage from process hoods was developed and validated. Application of the model revealed some surprising and important insights into hooding design and emission management. In addition, a series of field experiments were conducted to characterise a few common fugitive emissions processes and develop improved control strategies. Finally, two studies were carried out to better understand the interaction between fugitive building emissions and the external environment. Firstly, a 3 D CFD case study was conducted to characterise the building wake flows for the general case of wind directions oblique to the long axis of buildings. As part of this study commonly used plume rise and dispersion expressions were reviewed and were found to compare reasonably well against available plume rise data for fugitive emission plumes from buildings. Secondly, an extensive field study was carried out to determine the effect of the large buoyant fugitive emission plumes on the development of a thermal internal boundary layer at a coastal site. In conclusion, this thesis represents a unique study into the behaviour of fugitive building emissions. Many valuable methods were developed and validated and important insights were obtained which will help improve the accuracy of <b>emission</b> <b>characterisation,</b> and reduce the cost of <b>emission</b> <b>characterisation</b> and control.

In the present study, pure ultra-low sulphur diesel fuel (ULSD) and DMC blended diesel fuel were tested for their <b>emission</b> <b>characterisations</b> on a 4 -cylinder diesel engine. The experiments were conducted using ULSD with different proportions of DMC. The %DMC affects the fuel properties, the injection properties and hence the combustion process and the emissions. Experimental results show that power output was reduced with an increase of %DMC on a fixed fuel pump setting or {{there was an increase}} in fuel consumption. Reduction in power is due to the lower calorific value of the blended fuel. The results also indicate a significant decrease in smoke and particulate concentrations, as well as the total carbon content of the particulate, with addition of DMC. There was also a slight decrease in nitrogen oxides (NO x). However, an increase in both hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) was observed.

40|$|Smouldering {{combustion}} {{is being}} developed as a remediation process for soils contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR) is particularly effective on high molecular weight NAPLs such as coal tars and heavy oils, which {{are among the most}} recalcitrant of industrial contaminants. Smouldering is a lower energy, flameless form of combustion that is oxygen-limited. Typical smouldering examples involve porous solid fuels that are destroyed by the smouldering reaction (e. g., a smouldering charcoal briquette or smouldering polyurethane foam in furniture that leads to a fire). The oxygen limitation occurs because the oxygen for the combustion reaction has to travel through the porous matrix (in the case of STAR, the soil) to reach the fuel (contaminant). STAR is proving to be particularly effective in the in situ destruction of contaminants, with little to no detectable residue remaining in many cases. Upward scaling of the STAR process has not led to any loss in efficiency. Small-scale ex situ field demonstrations were conducted on two different contaminant and porous media matrices to highlight the broad range of suitable conditions for STAR. The first trial used an idealised mixture of coal tar in coarse sand. Comparison of this field trial data to small and intermediate scale experiments suggests that process efficiency improves with scale. The relative airflow required by the process decreases as scale increases. The second field trial used an industrial mixture of oil wastes from a variety of sources, offering important insights into the effects of moisture and the mechanisms of heat transfer that influence the STAR process. This paper presents laboratory, intermediate and field-scale experiments {{in the context of the}} scaling process. Discussion focuses on the key parameters required for successful STAR as well as <b>emissions</b> <b>characterisation</b> for combustion byproducts...|$|R

For each sample, both current-voltage and current-time measurements of each FEA were carried out before and after arzodisation. The morphology and thickness of the porous silicon layer on the emitters were controlled by the anodising current density and duration of the anodisation process. The emission uniformity of FEAs was evaluated by comparing the I-V curves from different FEAs, which show that the emission uniformity had been improved after anodisation. In addition, the I-t measurements show that the emission stability of FEAs is very sensitive to anodisation time, and {{it is essential to}} use a very short anodisation time (similar to 0. 1 second) to obtain stable emission currents. Under these conditions no adverse effects of the anodisation process on emission stability have been found whilst the improvements in operating voltage and uniformity are maintained...|$|E

Fowler-Nordheim plots of the field emission characteristics of silicide coated tips were obtained as the layer was removed by field evaporation.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the liquid fuel spray and flow field characteristics inside a combustor is crucial for designing a fuel efficient and low <b>emission</b> device. <b>Characterisation</b> of the flow field of a model gas turbine liquid swirl burner is performed by using a 2 -D particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) system. The flow field pattern of an axial flow burner with a fixed swirl intensity is compared under confined and unconfined conditions, i. e., with and without the combustor wall. The effect of temperature on the main swirling air flow is investigated under open and non-reacting conditions. The result shows that axial and radial velocities increase {{as a result of}} decreased flow density and increased flow volume. The flow field of the main swirling flow with liquid fuel spray injection is compared to non-spray swirling flow. Introduction of liquid fuel spray changes the swirl air flow field at the burner outlet, where the radial velocity components increase for both open and confined environment. Under reacting condition, the enclosure generates a corner recirculation zone that intensifies the strength of radial velocity. The reverse flow and corner recirculation zone assists in stabilizing the flame by preheating the reactants. The flow field data can be used as validation target for swirl combustion modelling...|$|R

To meet this goal, different simulations were performed, using the flexible air quality regional model (FARM), to study two scenarios: winter and summer situations. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} FARM model in order to simulate the air quality situation of the selected periods, a comparison of modelled results against observed air quality data was carried out for both primary pollutants and particulate matter next to the measurement stations. Farm performed well in simulating especially ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations, showing a good reproduction of both daily peaks and their daytime variations. PM model results revealed the tendency to under-predict the observed values, so we tried to use a different emission factor for the road traffic (Lohmeyer factor). The new results were good for the urban and suburban areas, but they give over-predictions close to highways.

40|$|AbstractROSANNE is a collaborative {{project in}} the Seventh EU Framework Programme which aims at developing/harmonising {{measurement}} methods for skid resistance, noise emission and rolling resistance of road pavements as a preparation for standardization. To achieve this, the project is following the recommendations of key predecessor projects like TYROSAFE, HERMES, SILVIA, SILENCE and MIRIAM as well as considering the ongoing work in CEN and ISO groups. Work package 1 deals with skid resistance and aims at the harmonization of skid resistance measurement following the TYROSAFE Roadmap, by deriving conversion factors for friction indices based on similar groups of devices, namely longitudinal and sideways skid resistance measurement devices. During the first project year a first round robin test {{was carried out in}} Nantes, ten different devices participated to the test. The results of this test are collected in report D 1. 2 “Analysis of data from the first round of tests and initial development of the common scale”. Work package 2 is dealing with the pavement influence on road traffic noise emission: the main objective of this work package is to combine the existing measurement methods of SPB (ISO 11819 - 1) and CPX (ISO/DIS 11819 - 2) into a stable and reliable harmonised pavement noise <b>emission</b> <b>characterisation</b> method. The project is validating procedure incorporating correction mechanisms for temperature influence and investigating its potential use for noise calculation methods like the one proposed by the CNOSSOS-EU project. Work package 3 is dealing with rolling resistance, where the ROSANNE project is mainly building on the results obtained in the MIRIAM project and is considering standardized trailer measurements of rolling resistance coefficients of road surfaces. After a first report D 3. 1 “State of the art on rolling resistance measurement devices including draft standard outline” the following main report was produced “Parameters influencing rolling resistance and possible correction procedures”. In the frame of work package 4 the project is also exploring the potential for developments in the measurement of surface texture in order to find out parameters that better reflect the physical process of tyre/road interaction and that may improve the understanding of how the texture influences noise emission, skid resistance and rolling resistance. In addition to that this work package is also investigating the performance of reference tyres and pavements which are necessary for the measurement of all three road surface properties.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IOP Publishing via the DOI in this record. Nano-contact spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) are anticipated to find application as nanoscale sources of microwave emission in future technological applications. Presently the output power and phase stability of individual STVOs are not competitive with existing oscillator technologies. Synchronisation of multiple nano-contact STVOs via magnetisation dynamics has been proposed to enhance the microwave emission. The control of device-to-device variations, such as mode splitting of the microwave emission, is essential if multiple STVOs are to be successfully synchronised. In this work a combination of electrical measurements and time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy (TRSKM) was used to demonstrate how mode splitting in the microwave emission of STVOs {{was related to the}} magnetisation dynamics that are generated. The free-running STVO response to a DC current only was used to identify devices and bias magnetic field configurations for which single and multiple modes of microwave emission were observed. Stroboscopic Kerr images were acquired by injecting a small amplitude RF current to phase lock the free-running STVO response. The images showed that the magnetisation dynamics of a multimode device with moderate splitting could be controlled by injecting an RF current so that they exhibit similar spatial character to that of a single mode. Significant splitting was found to result from a complicated equilibrium magnetic state that was observed in Kerr images as irregular spatial characteristics of the magnetisation dynamics. Such dynamics were observed far from the nano-contact and so their presence cannot be detected in electrical measurements. This work demonstrates that TRSKM is a powerful tool for the direct observation of the magnetisation dynamics generated by STVOs that exhibit complicated microwave <b>emission.</b> <b>Characterisation</b> of such dynamics outside the nano-contact perimeter permits a deeper insight into the requirements for optimal phase-locking of multiple STVOs that share common magnetic layers.

40|$|Simple {{connections}} between structure and optical response empower us with essential intuition to engineer complex optical functionalities. In this thesis, I study photonic crystals, quasicrystals and amorphous materials {{to quantify the}} structural properties {{that give rise to}} photonic band gaps (PBGs). Along the way, I develop two novel perspectives on the optical analysis of arbitrarily-structured media: generalised photonic band structure and local self-uniformity (LSU). Generalised photonic band structures reproduce the Bloch-wave band structure of photonic crystals but, crucially, also yield naturally unfolded complete dispersion relations for aperiodic materials. Using generalised band structures, I demonstrate that the overall form of a material's dispersion relation is determined by the non-zero momentum transfers of its structure factor. I observe in great detail the fractal-like PBG spectra of a pair of Penrose photonic quasicrystals. Here, I demonstrate that, in most cases, the Penrose PBGs form through a mechanism of Bragg scattering-induced standing wave formation. The fundamental gap of each structure, however, is attributed to spatially localised scattering resonances. I also fabricate and characterise hyperuniform gold metasurfaces. Fluorescence <b>emission</b> <b>characterisation</b> reveals a statistically isotropic distribution of momentum states within the light cone; this property is shown to result from the metasurface structure factor. In the second part of this thesis I introduce LSU as a continuous measure {{of the extent to which}} a network possesses an optimal PBG-forming structure. Specifically, LSU measures the geometrical and topological similarities of the local vertex environments in a network of uniform valency. I demonstrate that both known optimal photonic crystal structures and disordered PBG-forming networks possess significant LSU. Further, I produce the first known designs of amorphous gyroid networks. Amorphous gyroids possess significant LSU and can exhibit a sizeable complete PBG; these PBGs are validated experimentally by performing microwave transmission experiments on centimetre-scale alumina prototypes (εr = 9 : 5 ± 0. 3 at 22 GHz). Using ensembles of both amorphous gyroids and planar hyperuniform networks, I demonstrate the striking correlation between LSU and PBG-forming ability. I rationalise the success of LSU by advancing a picture of photonic tight binding in high index connected networks. This picture explains the origin of PBGs in both ordered and disordered connected networks, and suggests why the diamond architecture possesses the largest known PBG. To conclude, I explore the possibility that amorphous gyroids exist in the wing scales of butteries. I reveal that the microstructure in the scales of Pseudolycaena marsyas possesses substantial amorphous gyroid character and demonstrate that the buttery's reflectance spectrum can be effectively reproduced by amorphous gyroid microstructures...|$|E
40|$|Smouldering Technology for Aquifer Remediation (STAR) {{is a novel}} {{technology}} for the remediation of contamination by non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in the subsurface. Smouldering {{is a form of}} combustion that is flameless. Generally, smouldering is slower and less energetic than flaming combustion. Familiar examples of smouldering involve solid fuels that are destroyed by the reaction (e. g., a smouldering cigarette or peat smouldering after a wildfire). In STAR, the NAPL serves as the fuel within an inert, porous soil medium. Once the NAPL fuel is ignited in the subsurface, the hot gases emitted from the exothermic NAPL smouldering heat the porous media ahead of the reaction, increasing the both reaction efficiency and the flammability limits of many liquid fuels. STAR {{has the potential to be}} both self-sustaining and self-targeting. If the energy released by the smouldering reaction, stored and recirculated ahead of the reaction is sufficient to allow the smouldering front to propagate forward, the ignition source may be removed and the smouldering reaction may become self-sustaining. The distribution of NAPL fuel in the subsurface is the path the smouldering front will follow. Because the soil is inert, the smouldering front follows the path of the fuel within the soil and does not spread beyond this path, making the reaction self-targeting. The smouldering reaction is controlled by the delivery of air or oxidant to the subsurface. Once the air or oxidant supply is removed, the reaction stops, making the reaction self-terminating. Results from laboratory and field experiments are very promising. At the laboratory scale, nine NAPL fuels have been tested. NAPLs including petrochemicals, chlorinated solvents and coal tar have been remediated successfully by STAR. Physical and chemical analysis of soils after treatment by STAR suggested little to no residual NAPL contamination remained. More extensive characterisation work has been carried out on coal tar, the most energetic of the NAPL fuels. Parameters such as air flow rate, initial NAPL saturation, soil type and ignition method have been varied to study their impact on the smouldering reaction. Larger scale studies have been carried out in the development of this technology toward field-deployable configurations. Field scenarios for STAR include both in situ and ex situ configurations. The laboratory experiments scale directly to the ex situ field configuration where excavated, NAPL-contaminated soil is placed in a reactor vessel and treated by STAR. For the in situ configuration, the STAR process is initiated in the NAPL pool in the subsurface. Air or oxidant is supplied to support the reaction and force it to follow the NAPL fuel through the subsurface. Successful application of the in situ STAR method has the potential for leaving the treated soil in place, avoiding the costly excavation and disposal processes while protecting the aquifer. Because the contaminant is destroyed in place, treatment costs of recovered NAPL are avoided as well. Field trials are underway for ex situ STAR. This paper presents laboratory, small-scale field experiments and pilot ex situ field trials that have been conducted.

For the anechoic chamber, a CAD tool is developed to aid the design of an anechoic chamber. The objective is to estimate the chamber performance accurately. The ultimate goal is to minimise the cost but optimise the chamber performance for given conditions and specifications. This is very important for a commercial company.

It is possible that the largest challenge facing the development of a Si-based quantum cascade laser is that of the demand requiring epitaxial growth.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are ideal}} candidates {{to be used}} as field emission sources. Electrodeposition could provide a viable method to deposit CNTs over large areas as part of an industrialized process. It has been shown that CNTs can be co-deposited with nickel onto various substrates, using a suitable CNT dispersant. In the present study, a multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT) : nickel (Ni) composite has been electrodeposited without the use of a dispersant. The field emission properties of the resulting electrodeposits were studied. Unpurified MWNTs grown by CVD were added to a Ni plating bath comprising of IM NiSO· 6 HO, 0. 2 M NiCl and 0. 5 M HBO. Due to their hydrophobic nature, MWNTs did not disperse naturally, so the plating solution was placed in a sonic bath for 15 minutes before electrodeposition. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a μAutolab computer controlled potentiostat with a three-electrode configuration and typical cell volume of 10 cm. A spiral wound platinum wire served as the counter electrode with a Ag:AgCl wire reference electrode. Cu plates were used as cathodes, with an exposed surface area of 2 cm. After deposition, samples were thoroughly rinsed in deionised water to remove Ni salts. The resulting electrodeposits were imaged using a scanning electron microscope (FIG. 1) Importantly, these deposits were observed after the samples were thoroughly rinsed in deionised water, suggesting that there is a strong adhesion between the nickel coated nanotubes and the substrate surface. FIG. 1 (a) shows MWNTs (0. 013 mg/ml) electrodeposited directly after sonication. Note that a thick Ni coating is not observed (see inset), and that uniform MWNT deposition is observed over a relatively large area. FIG. 1 (b) shows MWNTs deposited with the same solution after five minutes. A much thicker Ni coating indicates that a relatively higher concentration of Ni to MWNT was present. This was probably due to a rebundling of MWNTs over time, after the sonication process. FIG. 1 (c) and (d) show MWNTs deposited with a much lower concentration (0. 005 mg/ml), and therefore relatively higher concentration of Ni, resulting in thicker Ni coating. Beads of Ni (visible in FIG. 1 (d)), approximately one micron in diameter completely encased the MWNTs, previously observed by Aria et al., using a poly(acrylic acid) dispersant. Subsequently, the substrates were subjected to field <b>emission</b> <b>characterisation</b> using a 5 mm spherical stainless steel anode. The emission current was recorded as a function of macroscopic electric field at a vacuum of around 10 mbar. The threshold field was taken to be the field at which an emission current of 1 nA was detected and the macroscopic field was calculated by dividing the applied voltage by the electrode gap, which was typically 25 μm. Threshold fields of the order 20 V/μm were observed (FIG. 2), after conditioning. It is expected that by altering the deposition conditions, the much lower threshold fields would be observed. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Normalization is an {{optional}} step in LCIA {{that is used}} to better understand the relative importance and magnitude of the impact category indicator results. It is used for error checking, as a first step in weighting, and for standalone presentation of results. A normalized score for a certain impact category is obtained by determining the ratio of the category indicator result of the product and that of a reference system, such as the world in a certain year or the population of a specific area in a certain year. Biased Normalization. In determining these two quantities, the numerator, the denominator, or both can suffer from incompleteness {{due to a lack of}} <b>emission</b> data and/or <b>characterisation</b> factors. This leads to what we call a biased normalization. As a consequence, the normalized category indicator result can be too low or too high. Some examples from hypothetical and real case studies demonstrate this. Consequences of Biased Normalization. Especially when for some impact categories the normalized category indicator result is right, for others too low, and for others too high, severe problems in using normalized scores can show up. It is shown how this may affect the three types of usage of normalized results: error checking, weighting and standalone presentation. Detection and Remedies of Biased Normalization. Some easy checks are proposed that at least alert the LCA practitioner of the possibility of a biased result. These checks are illustrated for an example system on hydrogen production. A number of remedies of this problem is possible. These are discussed. In particular, case-dependent normalization is shown to solve some problems, but on the expense of creating other problems. Discussion. It appears that there is only one good solution: data-bases and tables of characterisation factors must be made more completely, so that the risk of detrimental bias is reduced. On the other hand, the use of the previously introduced checks should become a standard element in LCA practice, and should be facilitated with LCA software...|$|R

Blue-light photo-excitation generates a non-fluorescent intermediate photoproduct (flavin-C(4 a) -cysteinyl adduct with absorption peak at 390 nm). The photo-cycle dynamics is studied by dark-state absorption and fluorescence measurement, by following the temporal absorption and emission changes under blue and violet light exposure, and by measuring the temporal absorption and fluorescence recovery after light exposure. A bi-exponential absorption recovery after light exposure with a fast (in the several ten seconds range) and a slow component (in the near ten minute range) are resolved. The quantum yield of photo-adduct formation is extracted from excitation intensity dependent absorption measurements. It decreases somewhat with rising excitation intensity. The behaviour of the combined wildtype LOV 1 � LOV 2 double domains is compared with the behaviour of the separate LOV 1 and LOV 2 domains. The blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome 3 (cry 3) from Arabidopsis thaliana was characterized at room temperature in vitro in aqueous solution by optical absorption and emission spectroscopic studies. The protein non-covalently binds the chromophores flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and N 5,N 10 -methenyl- 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydrofolate (MTHF). In the dark-adapted state of cry 3, the bound FAD is present in the oxidized form (FAD-ox, ca. 38. 5 %), in the semiquinone form (FADH°, ca. 5 %), and in the fully reduced neutral form (FADH 2) or fully reduced anionic form (FADH-, ca 55 %). Some amount of FAD (ca. 1. 5 %) in the oxidized state remains unbound probably caused by protein aggregation and/or denaturation. Förster-type energy transfer from MTHF to FAD-ox is observed. Photo-excitation reversibly modifies the protein conformation causing a slight rise of the MTHF absorption strength and an increase of the MTHF fluorescence efficiency (efficient protein conformation photo-cycle). Additionally there occurs reversible reduction of bound FAD-ox to FADH 2 (or FADH°, FAD-ox photo-cycle of moderate efficiency), reversible reduction of FADH° to FADH 2, and modification of re-oxidable FADH 2 to permanent FADH 2 with low quantum efficiency. Photo-excitation of MTHF causes the reversible formation of a MTHF species (MTHF�, MTHF photo-cycle, moderate quantum efficiency) with slow recovery to the initial dark state, and also the formation of an irreversible photoproduct (MTHF��) ...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} one of the main sources of {{acoustic}} pollution, with an ubiquitous presence in anthropised environments. Therefore, it is a constant component of residual noise during every noise measurement. The generation and propagation of traffic noise is governed by three main different mechanisms: vehicles' power unit (i. e. the engine, gearbox and cooling system), vehicles' profile aerodynamics and tyre-road interaction. While engine noise is the main source up to 35 km/h, for higher speeds propulsion noise is negligible over noise due to tyre/road interaction. For heavy vehicles, like lorries, the contribution of propulsion noise cannot be neglected even at higher speeds. Tyre/road interaction depends greatly on the characteristics of road surfaces: a subtle difference in road surfaces may yield a large variation in noise levels. This idea has lead to a series of studies that focused on providing theoretical and phenomenological analysis of the influence of road profile on noise <b>emission.</b> The <b>characterisation</b> of a road surface requires the measurement of its profile: the device used to carry out these measurements is known as profilometer; modern road profilometry is based on laser triangulation sensors, which allow a simple and direct measurement of road texture. The purpose of this work, carried out at the CNR spin-off company iPool srl, was to develop a laser profilometer focused on measuring the macrotexture and megatexture of road pavements, which cover wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as the size of tyre tread elements and of the tyre/road interface and to verify some of the existing models to predict tyre rolling noise based on road texture knowledge. This work confirms the importance of macrotexture (MaTx) and part of megatexture (MeTx) in the generation of rolling noise. The profilometer, mounted on a vehicle, is composed of a laser displacement sensor, an accelerometer, known in jargon as inertial unit and a rotary encoder attached to a wheel, which provides the horizontal travelled distance. This profilometer presents many strong points, viz. a simple usage and relative low cost compared to other laser profilometers; moreover it presents a new procedure to obtain the road profile by combining the information provided by the laser output, a time-domain displacement signal and a record of the distance travelled by the vehicle, measured by the angular encoder. Chapter 1 provides a description of the main terminology and devices used in profiling, while chapter 2 deals the essential theoretical background of the dominant phenomena involved in the generation of rolling noise and describes the main models that correlate rolling noise and road texture. Chapter 3 accurately explains every component the profilometer; it is roughly divided in two main parts, the first one outlines the hardware components specifications and limits, while the second part overviews the signal processing. An algorithm in Matlab environment for data processing was also developed, dealing with the re-mapping of the time-domain vertical displacement signal with a constant sampling frequency to a space-domain profile, sampled every 0. 5 mm, and subsequent evaluation of road texture parameters has been conducted on different sites. A simple mathematical model of road texture enveloped by the tyre has also been used during data analysis, simulating the actual road surface that is in contact with the tyre. The following chapter addresses the possible sources of uncertainty of profiling operations. A theoretical model of the response of the laser sensor at different wavelengths has also been developed, taking into account the finite spot size of the laser and the finite exposure time of the pixel array. These two factors contribute to the identification of the working range of the sensor. Chapter 5 presents a calibration of the device and consequent assessment of reproducibility and repeatability of measurements. Calibration has dealt with every component singularly through specific measurements, such as measurements of the lateral profile of a rotating disc with cogs of different sizes, calibration of the accelerometer with a B&K calibrator and an oscillating bar, and the measurement of the profile of a surface with known characteristics. Repeatability of measurements has been thoroughly verified, via repetitions of measurements of the same road profile; reproducibility has been checked by measuring the same road profile with another profilometer already available on the market, and owned by the Department of Civil Engineering of Università di Pisa. Finally, an evaluation of the correlation between rolling noise and road texture is presented in chapter 6. Measurements of road texture provided by the profilometer are correlated with rolling noise emission on six different kinds of pavements: again, the chapter can be divided in two main sections. The former deals with the calculation of the correlation coefficient between parameters related to road texture, such as third-octave bands texture spectrum and rolling noise measured by CPX method, while the latter deals with the comparison of two existing models and the elaboration of a simple model to obtain the mean CPX broadband level of a road surface based the knowledge of its texture spectrum. The model uses two bands of the octave band texture spectrum, to predict rolling noise: the octave band centred at 5 mm, related to air pumping, is negatively correlated to sound generation, while the band at 80 mm shows a positive correlation, related to tyre vibrations. One of the main innovations of this model, despite the limited number of samples, is the usage of enveloped texture, which distinguishes road surfaces with sharp edges and deep grooves. The correlations found confirm the theoretical knowledge of tyre/road noise, but also underline that a complete description of rolling noise must take into account not only road texture, but also the tyre itself. In fact, a resonance in the CPX noise spectrum at 80 km/h was also successfully identified. The further perfectioning of the profilometer will permit deeper studies of the correlation between properties of road texture and rolling noise, and to develop a comprehensive model of tyre/road interaction noise: possible improvements are the simultaneous usage of two or more displacement sensors that profile adjacent lines, in order to reduce uncertainty in the evaluation of texture spectrum and the substitution of the current sensor with one that has a smaller spot size...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} strongly affect {{landscapes and}} also cause {{a variety of}} environmental and health problems in many European countries. Environmental policies to minimise this negative impacts of agriculture differ between countries. This thesis focuses on environmental consequences of agricultural activities in the Czech Republic and possibilities to reduce the associated environmental problems. The causes and solutions of these air, water and soil pollution problems are complex, and designing sustainable farming systems requires integration of social, economic, and natural sciences. The agriculture practices in the Czech Republic have changed dramatically due to political changes during last decade. These changes ameliorate environmental problems to some extent through {{a reduction in the}} use of fertilizers and livestock numbers. However, agriculture still poses a threat to the environment and human health. The agricultural productivity may intensify in the future leading to increased pollution. Now the Czech Republic {{is a member of the}} European Union, Czech farmers have to deal with many new regulations set by European Commission aiming at reducing environmental problems. The overall objective of this thesis is to assess the future environmental impact by the agricultural sector in the Czech Republic. National and European environmental policies and the interaction between human activities and environmental trends have been considered. The novel aspect of this thesis is to include process-based emission factors in a region specific model to quantify both emissions and their potential environmental and health impacts. Additionally, these results are used in another purposely developed model to assess the reduction costs involved. To achieve the overall objective three specific research aims are defined. The first aim is to analyse different emission estimation methods with respect to their usefulness for an integrated assessment at the national scale. The second is to evaluate the potential environmental impact of agricultural emissions at the sub-national level while considering different agricultural practices and environmental characteristics. The third aim is to integrate emission estimation methods and impact assessment approaches in a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of environmental policy measures. This model is applied in a case study focusing on dairy cattle as one of the most polluting sub-sectors of Czech agriculture. It is used to analyse the current situation and to explore future trends up to 2020 as affected by (i) different views of hypothetical model users on importance of environmental impact, (ii) changes in projected animal numbers and management and (iii) changes in the application of emission reduction measures. Integrated assessments that analyse environmental problems by agriculture simultaneously, need complete, detailed and consistent emission estimates that consider possible interrelations between different pollutants. Three types of emission estimation methods were analysed: emission factor, regression analyses and process-based methods. Selected examples of emission estimation methods were reviewed to illustrate the large variety in methods available. These methods were evaluated based on three steps: (1) Comparison of emission estimation methods with respect to specific characteristics, (2) Scoring of methods based on quality and country-specific criteria and the extent to which interrelations between pollutants are accounted for, and (3) Multi-Criteria Analysis taking into account the relative importance of the different criteria. The usefulness of this approach was demonstrated by applying it to a case study focusing on agriculture in the Czech Republic. The evaluation of emission estimation methods reveals large differences. We conclude that the following methods best meet our criteria: the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, methods from the INITIATOR model and the detailed method of the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook. Based on this analysis we suggest that combining parts of each of the four methods forms a sound basis for a new emission estimation method for quantifying agricultural emissions of air, water and soil pollution simultaneously. The potential environmental and health impact of selected agricultural emissions was evaluated based on a new innovative approach. Emission estimates were combined with a country-specific set of indicators to assess the environmental impact of dairy cattle in nine regions defined according to specific environmental characteristics. In this thesis different characterisation factors available in the literature were compared and evaluated with respect to usefulness for a study focusing on dairy cattle in the Czech Republic. We conclude that for our case the most appropriate set of characterisation factors are those from Sepällä et al. (2006) and EDIP (2003). These factors are based on the most recent data and best available scientific models and take into account, where possible national and regional differences. However, a weakness of these combinations may be potential internal inconsistencies We estimate the contribution of emissions of ammonia (NH 3) nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrate (NO- 3), phosphate (PO 4 - 3), particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to a number of environmental and health problems. The results show large regional differences in the current environmental and health impact per unit of agricultural production in the Czech Republic. The regional acidifying, eutrophying and global warming impact of dairy cattle is calculated to be up to three times the national average, depending on the dairy cattle intensity. Aquatic eutrophication is found to be a problem in regions with relatively high eutrophying emissions per hectare of so-called nitrate vulnerable zones. Human toxicity problems caused by dairy cattle livestock and manure management are problematic in regions with a high population density in rural areas. A linear optimisation model (DAIRY) including Multi-Criteria Analysis was developed to analyse cost-effectiveness of policy measures to reduce the environmental impact of dairy cattle in the Czech Republic. The DAIRY model combines process-based and emission factor approaches to calculate the above-mentioned <b>emissions,</b> and site-dependent <b>characterisation</b> factors to assess their contribution to acidification, terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity. In addition, a so-called overall environmental impact (OEI) indicator was used to assess the environmental performance of dairy cattle. The DAIRY model was used to analyse the current situation and to explore future trends up to 2020, under different environmental and cost constraints. The analysis of past and future trends of environmental and health impact by dairy cattle reveals decreasing trends over time, mainly as a result of reduced cattle numbers. In 2005 the OEI was considerably lower than in 1990. In the No Control scenario, which assumes no emission control, the 2020 environmental impact is 9 % lower than in 2005, mainly as a result of continued reduction in cattle numbers. Technical measures aimed at reducing ammonia emissions may reduce the 2020 uncontrolled OEI levels by 10 %. Implementation of all technical measures considered would reduce the 2020 OEI levels by 30 % at the national level. In optimised scenarios, the reductions in OEI in 2020 range from 1 % to 30 % relative to the No Control scenario, while the costs to achieve this reduction range between 0. 2 and 16 MEuro. We show that targets for OEI close to maximum feasible reduction can be realized at about one-third of the costs of non-optimised scenarios. In such cost-effective scenarios the model tends to select measures to reduce aquatic eutrophication and climate change first, which is in contrast to current policies aiming at acidification and terrestrial eutrophication. Cost-optimal solutions at the national level are not always the cheapest solutions at the regional level. The future environmental impact of dairy cattle in the Czech Republic was analysed for two reference scenarios. The No Control scenario assumes no emission control while the Policy Scenario aims at cost-effective reduction of the OEI by 20 % relative to No Control scenario. Next, we explored how these calculated trends change as result of different assumption on (i) different views of hypothetical model users on importance of environmental impact, (ii) changes in projected animal numbers and management and (iii) changes in the application of emission reduction measures. The reference scenarios indicate that the overall environmental impact by dairy cattle is mainly associated with global warming and aquatic eutrophication while leaching and housing are the two most contributing processes. The costs to reduce OEI by 20 % are 12 MEuro. The most cost-effective combination of measures to achieve this target includes manure efficiency improvement and improved timing of manure application. The results suggest that regardless of model users views on the relative importance of different environmental problems, global warming and aquatic eutrophication are most important. However, the relative shares of these two in OEI depend on the valuation of the environmental impact categories. This, in turn, has an impact on the costs of reducing OEI, because it is cheaper to reduce emissions of nitrate than emissions of greenhouse gases. As a result costs to reduce 20 % OEI range from 7 to 26 MEuro for different sets of valuation factors. The model result also suggests that dairy cattle kept in slurry-based systems have a better environmental performance than dairy cattle kept in straw-based systems. In addition, cattle numbers influence the OEI and the reduction costs more than changes in milk yield. The costs of reducing OEI by 20 % relative to uncontrolled level range between 2 and 16 MEuro for scenarios with different assumptions on animal numbers and manure management. Taking into account unintended side-effects of reduction measures on the environment as a criterion for selection of measures, increases the reduction costs considerably. The changes in applicability of emission reduction measures lead to costs ranging between 24 and 50 MEuro. The research approach taken in this thesis is based on a unique combination of methods to estimate emissions, their potential environmental impact and possible solutions. These serve as essential building blocks of the DAIRY model. A major strength of the DAIRY model is that it allows for comprehensive analyses at the sector level and for identification of cost-effective ways to reduce the overall environmental impact of dairy cattle. As such, it can serve as example for other countries and sectors...|$|R
