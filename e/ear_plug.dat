50|$|Lethal {{sampling}} {{is required}} to obtain age information and precise dietary composition. The age of a whale can be reliably gathered by examining the <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> in {{the head of the}} dead animal, which accumulates as annual growth rings. Japan initially argued that simple population distribution of whale species is enough to determine the level of sustainability of the hunt and argued that certain species of whale, particularly minke whales, are in sufficient number to be hunted. The anti-whaling side countered by arguing that more accurate composition of population distribution in term of age and sex distribution is needed to determine the sustainability, which ironically provided the justification for the Japanese hunt under the scientific research exemption. According to lethal-sampling opponent Nick Gales, age data is not needed to establish a catch limit for whaling {{within the framework of the}} Revised Management Procedure (RMP) computer modeling, which is the stated goal of the Japanese research. However, deputy whaling commissioner of Japan, Joji Morishita, told BBC News that the reason for the moratorium on commercial whaling was scientific uncertainty about the number of whales, and they were asked to collect more data.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{following}} study is to evaluate immediate protective effect of <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> from noise morphologically and functionally. An 1 -month aged 29 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Subjects were divided into four groups as normal control(G 1), bilaterally plugged group (G 2), unilaterally plugged group (G 3) and noise control group (G 4) and later 3 groups were exposed to 110 sound pressure level white noise for 60 min. Immediately after noise exposure, audiologic tests were performed and cochlear morphology and expression levels of a-synuclein in the cochlea were investigated. There were no functional changes in G 2 and plugged ears of G 3 after noise exposure, whereas unplugged ears of G 3 and G 4 showed significant hearing loss. In morphological study, there were a significant degeneration of the organ of Corti and mean number and diameter of efferent buttons, in unplugged ears of G 3 and G 4. Plugged ears of G 3 also showed mild changes in morphological study. Reduction of a-synuclein was observed at the efferent terminals or cochlear extracts after noise exposure. The protective effect of <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> on noise exposure was proven morphologically and functionally in the animal model of noise-induced hearing loss.

40|$|Background: Aircrews {{are often}} exposed to high ambient sound levels, {{especially}} in military aviation. Since long-term exposure to such noise may cause hearing damage, selection of adequate hearing protective devices is crucial. Such devices also affect speech intelligibility. When speech intelligibility and hearing protection lead to conflicting requirements, a compromise must be reached. The selection of personal equipment for RNLAF Chinook aircrews {{is taken as}} an example of this process. Methods: Sound attenuation offered by aircrew helmets and <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> was measured using a standardized method. Sound attenuation results were used to calculate sound exposure. Objective predictions of speech intelligibility were calculated using the Speech Transmission Index (STI) method. Subjective preference was investigated through a survey among 28 experienced aircrew members. Results: The use of <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> in addition to a (RNLAF standard) helmet may lead to a significant reduction of sound exposure. Using <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> that offer high sound attenuation, instead of using a less attenuating type, gives a little additional reduction of sound exposure, at the expense of a large reduction in speech intelligibility. Hence, it is better to use 'light' <b>ear</b> <b>plugs.</b> Better performance still is offered by Communications Earplugs, <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> featuring integrated miniature earphones. Results from the user preference survey correspond well with objective measurement results. Conclusions: In the case of the RNLAF Chinook, the best solution is using Communications EarPlugs in combination with a standard helmet. The Chinook case clearly illustrates that hearing protection and speech intelligibility should be treated as connected issues...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, our <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> results {{argue against}} hearing loss {{as the major}} {{contributor}} to frequency-specific gap detection deficits in sound exposed animals. Our unilaterally exposed mice showed similar gap detection deficits when either both ears, or more importantly, just the unexposed ear, were tested. Since unexposed ears did not display any sign of ABR threshold increase after exposure, cochlear damage cannot be a reasonable explanation of the gap detection deficits. Although not completely definitive, this new finding further validates the gap detection methodology for tinnitus assessment. Alternatively, GPIAS might detect plastic changes along the auditory neuraxis caused by sound exposure, while not being capable of detecting tinnitus (Kaltenbach et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2006; Noreña and Eggermont 2003).|$|E
40|$|Conductive {{hearing loss}} {{produced}} by middle ear disease (MED) is very {{prevalent in the}} first 5 years of childhood.

However, after cessation of the MED, or removal of the <b>ear</b> <b>plug,</b> binaural hearing gradually improves. We suggest here that this improvement is a passive form of auditory learning.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a wider normative sample base for the Auditory Comprehension Test (ACT) (Green and Krammer, 1983) ? The ACT is effective in differentiating between individuals who have a binaural deficit in speech comprehension {{and those who do}} not. One hundred and three first year University students were tested on the ACT (seventy- three females and thirty males). Three out of this number (2, 91 %) were found to have binaural deficits. No significant differences were found to exist between males and females on Left, Right, and Both ear scores of the ACT. Significant differences were found to exist between performance on each ear condition for this current study in comparison with an earlier study (Green & Kramer, 1984) with a smaller sample. This indicates a need for more exhaustive methods of standardising the administration and scoring of the ACT, as well as testing with larger and more varied population groups. <b>Ear</b> <b>plug</b> testing with one of the three subjects found to have binaural deficits indicated a 27 point improvement (21, 78 %) when the <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> was fitted in V the weaker ear as compared to the open field binaural no~ear plug condition. An interview conducted with the same subject revealed a preference for visual or audio-visual modes of assimilating environmental stimuli in comparison to auditory inputs alone. This subject showed extreme elevations on the Hypomania scale of the MMPI, The Emotional Perception Test (Green & Severson, 1986) did not reveal any differences in the same subject?s ability to discriminate emotions in comparison to the test norms, although there was a relatively more frequent overestimation of the sadness emotion by this subject in comparison to the normative sample. The promise of the ACT both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool is emphasized. The need for a comprehensive scoring manual is emphatically indicated...|$|E
30|$|Rationale {{for this}} study was to {{determine}} whether the sound exposed ear, which has potential hearing loss caused by exposure, contributes to our tinnitus assessment results. A separate group of 8 mice were sound exposed and 84  days post exposure they were assessed for the presence of tinnitus as described above. Based on these test results all mice were separated into two groups: tinnitus positive and tinnitus negative. All animals were then retested with the addition of an <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> in the exposed ear installed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Before testing, animals recovered from anesthesia in individual cages for two hours. This kind of a plug is known to attenuate sounds by 20 – 30  dB (Turner et al. 2006), and therefore significantly reduce the contribution of this ear to our test results. Results of these two assessments were compared for every animal from both groups.|$|E
