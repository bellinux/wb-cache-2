25|$|Panic {{disorders}} {{appear to}} modify levels-of-processing by increasing ability to recall words with threatening meanings over positive and neutral words. In one study, both implicit (free recall) and <b>explicit</b> (<b>memory</b> of emotional aspects) memorization of word lists were enhanced by threatening meanings in such patients.|$|E

25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one got up in the morning. <b>Explicit</b> <b>memories,</b> on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of <b>explicit</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R

25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E
25|$|Explicit, unlike {{implicit}} memory for odors, is thought {{by some to}} be a phenomenon that is exclusive to humans. <b>Explicit</b> <b>memory</b> refers to memories that are remembered with conscious awareness of doing so. In olfaction, <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> refers to attributing associative meaning to odors. Through the assignment of associations to odors as well as non-odor stimuli, olfactory stimuli can gain meaning. Explicit memories of odors include information which can be used to process and compare other encountered odors. Attention focused on odors aids in the functioning of everyday life as well as the engagement of proper responses to experienced events. Evidence of explicit olfaction memory is seen through behaviours in tasks involving a working memory component. The two most commonly used tests for explicit odor memory are odor identification and odor recognition, which are discussed in greater detail below.|$|E
2500|$|Implicit memory tests, in {{contrast}} with <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> tests, measure the recall value of a particular stimulus based on later performance on stimulus-related tasks. During these tasks, the subject does not explicitly recall the stimulus, but the previous stimulus still affects performance. [...] For example, in a word-completion implicit memory task, if a subject reads a list containing the word [...] "dog", the subject provides this word more readily when asked for three-letter words beginning in [...] "d". The levels-of-processing effect is only found for <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> tests. One study found that word completion tasks were unaffected by levels of semantic encodings achieved using three words with various levels of meaning in common. Another found that typical level-of-processing effects are reversed in word completion tasks; subjects recalled pictures pairs more completely if they were shown a word representing a picture rather than asked to rate a picture for pleasantness (semantic encoding). [...] Typical level-of-processing theory would predict that picture encodings would create deeper processing than lexical encoding.|$|E
30|$|Further {{study on}} {{summaries}} and landmarks {{is another important}} area for future work. Clustering algorithms for the content of data and attributes other than timestamps and locations should be studied. A search function is also necessary to enable <b>explicit</b> <b>memories</b> to be quickly and easily found. Taking into consideration the studies reported in this paper, we have to study several search functions, such as temporal, geographical, keyword, and spatio-temporal searches.|$|R
40|$|Attention {{and memory}} are intimately linked. Two {{functional}} imaging studies {{in this issue}} of Neuron provide novel evidence for this powerful, reciprocal relationship. Turk-Browne and colleagues report that attention simultaneously facilitates the formation of both implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>memories,</b> while Summerfield and colleagues demonstrate that memory for the past can guide the allocation of attention in the present. Together, these elegant studies reveal bidirectional interactions between attention and memory...|$|R
50|$|REM {{sleep and}} slow-wave sleep play {{different}} roles in memory consolidation. REM {{is associated with}} the consolidation of nondeclarative (implicit) memories. An example of a nondeclarative memory would be a task that we can do without consciously thinking about it, such as riding a bike. Slow-wave, or non-REM (NREM) sleep, {{is associated with the}} consolidation of declarative (<b>explicit)</b> <b>memories.</b> These are facts that need to be consciously remembered, such as dates for a history class.|$|R
2500|$|First {{there is}} {{explicit}} or conscious memory, {{which refers to}} the conscious recollection of previous experiences. [...] An example of <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> is remembering what you did last weekend. [...] When it comes to an anesthetized patient, a doctor may ask the patient after undergoing general anesthesia {{if he or she}} could remember hearing any distinct sounds or words while under anesthesia. [...] This approach is called a [...] "recall test" [...] because patients are asked to recall any memories they had during surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{typically}} {{the result of}} physical or psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to remember information preceding the traumatic event. [...] It is usually accompanied by some type of anterograde amnesia, or inability to acquire new knowledge. Focal retrograde amnesia (FRA), sometimes known as functional amnesia, refers {{to the presence of}} retrograde amnesia while knowledge acquisition remains intact (no anterograde amnesia). Memory for how to use objects and perform skills (implicit memory) may remain intact while specific knowledge of personal events or previously learned facts (<b>explicit</b> <b>memory)</b> become inaccessible or lost. Amnesia can result from a number of different causes, including encephalitis, severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin B1 deficiency as seen in Korsakoff's Syndrome, and psychotic episodes, or by witnessing an emotionally traumatic event (Dissociative amnesia). Dysfunction of the temporal and frontal lobes have been observed in many cases of focal retrograde amnesia, whether metabolic or the result of lesions. However, this evidence only appears to correlate with the symptoms of retrograde amnesia as cases have been observed where patients suffering from minor concussions, showing no visible brain damage, develop FRA. It has been suggested that FRA could represent a variety of different disorders, cognitive deficits, or conditions that result in disproportionate loss of <b>explicit</b> <b>memory,</b> hence Disproportionate Retrograde Amnesia.|$|E
2500|$|Auditory stimuli follow {{conventional}} levels-of-processing rules, although are somewhat weaker in general recall value {{when compared with}} vision. Some studies suggest that auditory weakness is only present for <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> (direct recall), rather than implicit memory. [...] When test subjects are presented with auditory versus visual word cues, they only perform worse on directed recall of a spoken word versus a seen word, and perform about equally on implicit free-association tests. Within auditory stimuli, semantic analysis produces {{the highest levels of}} recall ability for stimuli. Experiments suggest that levels-of-processing on the auditory level is directly correlated with neural activation.|$|E
50|$|Activation {{processing}} {{is one of}} {{two parts}} in Mandler's dual processing theory. According to Mandler, there are two processes that operate on mental representations. The first is activation, where increased activity causes a memory to be more distinctive. This increases the familiarity component of the memory, which explains results from priming effects. The second is elaboration, which is a conscious memory used to encode <b>explicit</b> <b>memories</b> that involves activation, but also creating new relationships amongst existing memories.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} MPI-1 {{model has}} no shared memory concept, and MPI-2 {{has only a}} limited distributed shared memory concept. Nonetheless, MPI programs are regularly run on shared memory computers, and both MPICH and Open MPI can use shared memory for message transfer if it is available. Designing programs around the MPI model (contrary to <b>explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> models) has advantages over NUMA architectures since MPI encourages <b>memory</b> locality. <b>Explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> programming was introduced in MPI-3.|$|R

2500|$|Odor {{memory is}} weaker than visual memory, {{achieving}} a successful identification rate of only 70-80% of visual memory. [...] Levels-of-processing effects {{have been found}} within odor memory if subjects are asked to [...] "visualize" [...] smells and associate them with a particular picture. Subjects who perform this task have a different recall value on <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> tests than subjects who memorize smells using self-chosen methods. The difference in recall value, however, depends on the subject, and the subject's ability to form images from odors. Attributing verbal attributes to odors has similar effects. Semantic processing of odors (e.g. attributing the [...] "mud" [...] odor to [...] "smell like a puddle") has found {{to have the most}} positive effects on recall.|$|E
2500|$|Behaviorism notwithstanding, the {{unconscious}} mind has maintained its importance in psychology. Cognitive psychologists {{have used a}} [...] "filter" [...] model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make {{their way through the}} filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior. A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>memory.</b> In another approach, one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective threshold.|$|E
2500|$|Olfactory memory {{refers to}} the {{recollection}} of odors. Studies have found various characteristics of common memories of odor memory including persistence and high resistance to interference. <b>Explicit</b> <b>memory</b> is typically the form focused on in the studies of olfactory memory, though implicit forms of memory certainly supply distinct contributions {{to the understanding of}} odors and memories of them. [...] Research has demonstrated that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main olfactory system following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior. Mammalian olfactory cues {{play an important role in}} the coordination of the mother infant bond, and the following normal development of the offspring. Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and provide a basis for recognition of the mother by her offspring.|$|E
50|$|The Org is {{the secret}} {{criminal}} underground that links all criminal and terrorist organizations. In reality, Mercedes Merced is the Taskmaster’s S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, posing as the Org and the Hub (the voice of the Org), to guide him through his memory loss and gather intelligence on the criminal underworld. Mercedes is also the Taskmaster's wife, having been happily married while they were both agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. As {{a result of the}} Taskmaster's powers, his <b>explicit</b> <b>memories</b> of Mercedes were lost, and had no recollection of being married.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{procedural}} memory (or implicit memory) {{is not based}} on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning. It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new <b>explicit</b> <b>memories</b> have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.|$|R
40|$|The Cray T 3 D {{system is}} the first-phase system in Cray Research, Inc. 's (CRI) {{three-phase}} massively parallel processing (MPP) program. This system features a heterogeneous architecture that closely couples DEC's Alpha microprocessors and CRI's parallel-vector technology, i. e., the Cray Y-MP and Cray C 90. An overview of the Cray T 3 D hardware and available programming models is presented. Under Cray Research adaptive Fortran (CRAFT) model four programming methods (data parallel, work sharing, message-passing using PVM, and <b>explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> model) are available to the users. However, at this time data parallel and work sharing programming models are not available to the user community. The differences between standard PVM and CRI's PVM are highlighted with performance measurements such as latencies and communication bandwidths. We {{have found that the}} performance of neither standard PVM nor CRI s PVM exploits the hardware capabilities of the T 3 D. The reasons for the bad performance of PVM as a native message-passing library are presented. This is illustrated by the performance of NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) programmed in <b>explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> model on Cray T 3 D. In general, the performance of standard PVM is about 4 to 5 times less than obtained by using <b>explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> model. This degradation in performance is also seen on CM- 5 where the performance of applications using native message-passing library CMMD on CM- 5 is also about 4 to 5 times less than using data parallel methods. The issues involved (such as barriers, synchronization, invalidating data cache, aligning data cache etc.) while programming in <b>explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> model are discussed. Comparative performance of NPB using <b>explicit</b> shared <b>memory</b> programming model on the Cray T 3 D and other highly parallel systems such as the TMC CM- 5, Intel Paragon, Cray C 90, IBM-SP 1, etc. is presented...|$|R
2500|$|Neuromodulation {{exists in}} the {{olfactory}} system and is responsible for neural plasticity and behavioural change in both mammals and insects. In the context of olfactory memory, neuromodulators regulate storage of information {{in a way that}} maintains the significance of the olfactory experience. These systems are highly dependent on norepinephrine and acetylcholine, which affect both implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>memory.</b> Studies involving the noradrenergic system of mice demonstrate elimination of habitual learning when areas involving this system are lesioned, and subsequent restoration of habitual learning abilities when noradrenaline is injected into the olfactory bulb. [...] The importance of cholinergic systems has been demonstrated in studies of rats and the effects of scopolamine, with acetylcholine being involved in initial learning stages and more specifically in the reduction of interference between stored memories.|$|E
2500|$|Faces are an {{important}} part of one's social life. [...] To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the fusiform gyrus (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of implicit memory. REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit visuospatial memory processes, rather than slow-wave sleep which is crucial for <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> consolidation. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance. [...] A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.|$|E
2500|$|Illness, {{though much}} rarer, {{can also cause}} {{anterograde}} amnesia if it causes encephalitis, which is the inflammation of brain tissue. There are several types of encephalitis: one such is herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV), which, if left untreated, can lead to neurological deterioration. How HSV gains access to the brain is unknown; the virus shows a distinct predilection for {{certain parts of the}} brain. Initially, it is present in the limbic cortices; it may then spread to the adjacent frontal and temporal lobes. Damage to specific areas can result in reduced or eliminated ability to encode new explicit memories, giving rise to anterograde amnesia. Patients suffering from anterograde amnesia may have [...] episodic, semantic, or both types of <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> impaired for events after the trauma that caused the amnesia. This suggests that memory consolidation for different types of memory takes place in different regions of the brain. Despite this, current knowledge on human memory is still insufficient to [...] "map out" [...] the wiring of a human brain to discover which parts of which lobe are responsible for the various episodic and semantic knowledge within a person's memory.|$|E

Implicit memory centers on the 'how' of music and involves automatic processes such as procedural memory and motor skill learning - in other words skills critical for playing an instrument. Samson and Baird (2009) found that the ability of musicians with Alzheimer's Disease to play an instrument (implicit procedural memory) may be preserved.|$|R

2500|$|While choline during {{development}} is important, adult levels of choline are also important. [...] Choline {{has been shown}} to increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine from neurons, which in turn increases memory. [...] A double-blind study was conducted using normal college students (no neurological disorders). [...] Results showed that twenty-five grams of phosphatidylcholine (another form of choline) created a significant improvement in <b>explicit</b> <b>memory,</b> measured by a serial learning task, however this improvement may be attributed to the improvement of slow learners. [...] Another study found that a single ten-gram oral dose of choline, given to normal volunteers (again, without neurological disorders) significantly decreased the number of trials needed to master a serial-learning word test. [...] This increase in memory is particularly beneficial to memory loss suffered by old age. [...] A study conducted on rats who, like humans, suffer from an age-related loss of memory were tested on how choline affected memory. [...] The results showed that rats who had a chronic low-choline diet showed greater memory loss then their same-age control counterparts, while rats who had choline-enriched diets showed a diminished memory loss compared to both the choline-low diet and control rat groups. [...] Furthermore, young rats who were choline-deficient performed as poorly on memory tasks as older rats while older rats that were given choline supplements performed as well as three-month-old rats.|$|E
50|$|While {{the human}} brain is {{certainly}} regarded for its plasticity, {{there is some evidence}} that shows traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young children can have negative effects on <b>explicit</b> <b>memory.</b> Researchers have looked at children with TBI in early childhood (i.e. infancy) and late childhood. Findings showed that children with severe TBI in late childhood experienced impaired <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> while still maintaining implicit memory formation. Researchers also found that children with severe TBI in early childhood had both increased chance of having both impaired <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> and implicit memory. While children with severe TBI are at risk for impaired <b>explicit</b> <b>memory,</b> the chances of impaired <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> in adults with severe TBI is much greater.|$|E
50|$|People use <b>explicit</b> <b>memory</b> {{throughout}} the day, such as remembering {{the time of}} an appointment or recollecting an event from years ago. <b>Explicit</b> <b>memory</b> involves conscious recollection, compared with implicit memory which is an unconscious, unintentional form of memory.

40|$|Dissociations between <b>explicit</b> and {{implicit}} <b>memory</b> tests, between recollective {{and automatic}} retrieval processes, and between memorial states {{of awareness of}} past events all suggest that human memory is not a unitary faculty.

40|$|Memories are not static or frozen, {{remaining}} in particular sites or places, within and belonging to particular groups, cultures or nations; rather, memory travels. Broadly speaking, memory has travelled {{because of the}} demographic displacements brought about by modernity’s extremes – slavery, colonialism, ethnic cleansing and genocide – and {{also because of the}} trade, travel and migration made possible by globalisation. Whether social movement is violent, exilic, migratory, emancipatory or oppressive, it is accompanied by memory. With the movement of people, memories of modernity’s histories and postmodern legacies meet, correspond and often become mutually constitutive. Even where memories compete with each other for cultural dominance, mutual dialogue and recognition is implicit if not <b>explicit.</b> <b>Memories</b> travel through and across cultures and national boundaries, a process increasingly facilitated by mass media technologies.
