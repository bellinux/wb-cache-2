5|$|Having reached Virginia, Timberlake {{set out for}} New York to {{meet with}} Amherst to receive his commission. Not long afterward, he {{received}} notice that he was {{among a number of}} officers to be reduced to half pay. Having learned this, he left the militia and returned home to Virginia to petition the General Assembly to compensate him for his expenses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> , but was denied.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} timetable allowed 18 minutes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey.</b> Off-peak {{service frequency}} was every 15 minutes, increased to ten minutes {{during the morning}} peak and reduced 20 minutes in the early mornings and after 8pm. From May 1864, workmen's returns were offered on the 5:30am and 5:40am services from Paddington {{at the cost of}} a single ticket (3d).|$|E

5|$|Adams {{worked to}} {{coordinate}} {{resistance to the}} Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston Town Meeting (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic boycott of British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House—with the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature—which proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably dressed and had little money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> to Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey,</b> sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|Both Foudroyant and Lion {{were too}} {{battered}} {{to provide an}} effective tow to the dismasted French ship, {{and as a result}} Penelope was left to bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily. Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> to Britain, and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta. Malta was, with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile, the most powerful third rate in the British fleet, and served for many years, participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.|$|E

5|$|Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, {{and arrived}} in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after a detour below 40°S for a {{magnetic}} survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour {{was used as}} the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young able seaman, Charles Bonner, fell to his death {{from the top of the}} mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port Chalmers, two days later.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Chinese vessels were {{equipped}} with Chinese crews, with Western captains and instructors in place. They sailed {{out of the}} Tyne River on 9 August, and stopped in Plymouth Sound two days later where Admiral Ding Ruchang joined them to take command of the ships <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> to China. Following their arrival on 20 October in Hong Kong, they toured Canton (now Guangzhou) and Shanghai, before travelling to the Taku Forts. Chaoyong was boarded by Hongzhang, and the two cruisers took the diplomat to inspect the dredging of the port at Taku (now the Port of Tianjin). Both ships {{were assigned to the}} Beiyang Fleet in the north, and Ruchang was placed in command.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the escape}} from Cadiz, the {{remaining}} four ships of Lamellerie's squadron sailed southwards, reaching the French African trading post of Senegal in March and then crossing the Atlantic to Cayenne, arriving on 27 March. Taking on fresh supplies, the squadron sailed from Cayenne on 7 April and operated with limited success against British merchant shipping in the Caribbean Sea, including 15 days cruising off Barbados. Retiring to the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico, Lamellerie resupplied his ships again in preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> back to France. The frigate squadron sailed on 18 May, leaving the Caribbean just as a large French squadron under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez arrived.|$|E

5|$|In {{her next}} letter Hańska made {{arrangements}} for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby {{allow for a}} direct correspondence. Before long she sent him the news {{that she and her}} husband would be traveling Europe, and visiting Vienna, Hanski's childhood home. They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey.</b> Also, sometime in 1833, Balzac wrote his first confession of love to her, despite being at that time in another relationship.|$|E
5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her mother at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey.</b> On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to eat as much as they could. She remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E
5|$|As Southampton stopped firing, the {{remaining}} masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on Heureuse Réunion were immense: of the 600–700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from {{a crew of}} 212. Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary jury masts were fitted to Heureuse Réunion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal. Heureuse Réunion was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name Améthyste, returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{took the}} cross, or vowed {{to go on}} crusade, along with King Henry and many others in January 1188, or when he began his preaching {{campaign}} on 11 February 1188 to drum up support for the Third Crusade. In April 1188, Baldwin was in Wales on a tour attempting to secure support for the king's crusade, and was forcing his servants and followers to exercise on foot up and down hills in preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> to the Holy Land. He {{spent most of the}} year in Wales, preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Gerald claimed about 3000 recruits for the crusade from his and Baldwin's efforts in Wales, although he also suggested that Baldwin mainly embarked on the tour to avoid his dispute with the Canterbury monks.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey,</b> he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{battalion}} was stretched across several locations, with companies being formed in Seymour, Victoria, Brighton, Tasmania, and Northam, Western Australia. The Tasmanians and Western Australians had initially been intended {{to join the}} 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, and during its formative period, the companies completed basic training in their home locations, before concentrating together at Warradale, South Australia with the Tasmanians sailing to Melbourne to link up with Victorians prior to entraining <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> west, while the Western Australians crossed the Nullarbor Plain. At this point, the unit's establishment was completed, as {{the battalion}} structure was finalised. It was structured {{along the same lines}} as the other 2nd AIF machine gun battalions, which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons– signals, anti-aircraft and administration– and four machine gun companies, each equipped with 12 Vickers machine guns, to make a total of 48 across the entire battalion. Within the machine gun companies there were three platoons; these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in Headquarters Company through to 13 to 15 in 'D' Company. A Light Aid Detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and {{a lawyer for the}} new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E
5|$|Rowley also {{seized the}} East Indiamen Streatham and Europe and {{restored}} their previous captains and crews, {{who had been}} released {{as part of the}} truce. A number of smaller merchant ships were captured and all were refitted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> to Britain, to be convoyed there by the newly captured Caroline. This 40-gun frigate, only three years old and very large and powerfully built, was given to Corbett in recognition of his services in the operation and renamed HMS Bourbonaise, reflecting the British name for Île Bonaparte, Île Bourbon. Willoughby was promoted to post captain and immediately took command of Corbett's former ship Nereide. Late on 28September, Rowley led his force to sea from Saint-Paul having burnt or seized all government shipping, stores and buildings in the town and surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 tribute Winton Train carried {{some of the}} {{individuals}} Sir Nicholas arranged to have transported to safety in 1939, along with their families, as it retraced the original kindertransport route taken by the trains on which they rode as children to safety in Great Britain 70 years earlier. The Winton Train departed on 1 September 2009, the 70th anniversary of the eighth, and intended last, train arranged by Winton to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day. It departed from Prague Main railway station and travelled through Germany and the Netherlands. After a transfer by ferry to Harwich, the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London's Liverpool Street station on 4 September, where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> across mainland Europe, the train was formed of period carriages and was hauled by historically authentic steam locomotives, while the British leg was hauled by 60163 Tornado, a brand-new, main-line British steam locomotive completed in 2008, along with carriages that were constructed in the 1950s.|$|E
