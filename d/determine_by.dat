5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot <b>determine</b> <b>by</b> themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of methylene blue after {{the reaction of}} hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH0.4–0.7 is used to <b>determine</b> <b>by</b> photometric measurements sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50mg/L (20ppb to 1.5ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60min. Ready-to-use kits such as the Spectroquant sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The methylene blue sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). It should be observed that in this test, methylene blue {{is a product of}} reaction and not a reagent.|$|E
25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each {{well of the}} plate with some biological entity that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily <b>determine</b> <b>by</b> itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a single well. A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates {{in the space of}} a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.|$|E

25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses before the jury. In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to <b>determine</b> <b>by</b> lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavior}} of Balaur. Because of the lack of skull material, it is impossible to <b>determine</b> <b>by</b> the shape of the teeth whether Balaur was a carnivore or a herbivore. The original description assumed it was carnivorous because it had been found that it was closely related to Velociraptor. Csiki speculated in 2010 that it may {{have been one of the}} apex predators in its limited island ecosystem, because of larger theropods not even the teeth have ever been found in Romania. He also believed that it likely used its double sickle claws for slashing prey, and that the atrophied state of its hands indicates that it probably did not use them to hunt. One of the original discoverers indicated that it [...] "was probably more of a kickboxer than a sprinter" [...] compared to Velociraptor, and was probably able to hunt larger animals than itself. However, more recent studies by Denver Fowler and others have shown that the foot anatomy of paravians like Balaur indicate that they used their large claws to grip and pin prey to the ground while flapping with their proto-wings to stay on top of their victim. Once it was worn out, they might have proceeded to feast while it was still alive as some modern birds of prey still do. Due to the shape of the claws, they would not have been effective in slashing attacks. The very short, fused metatarsus of Balaur and enlarged first claw, strange even by dromaeosaur standards, are thought to be consistent with these newer studies, lending further support to the idea that Balaur was a predator.|$|E

2500|$|The formal {{approach}} of English courts is that agreement exists when an offer is mirrored by an unequivocal {{acceptance of the}} terms on offer. Whether an offer has been made, or it has been accepted, is an issue courts <b>determine</b> <b>by</b> asking what a reasonable person would have thought was intended. Offers are distinguished from [...] "invitations to treat" [...] (or an invitatio ad offerendum, the invitation of an offer) which cannot be simply accepted by the other party. Traditionally, English law has viewed the display of goods in a shop, even with a price tag, as an invitation to treat, so that when a customer takes the product to the till it is she who is making the offer, and the shopkeeper may refuse to sell. Similarly, and as a very general rule, an advertisement, the invitation {{to make a bid}} at an auction with a reserve price, or the invitation to submit a tender bid are not considered offers. On the other hand, a person inviting tenders may fall under a duty to consider the submissions if they arrive before the deadline, so the bidder (even though there is no contract) could sue for damages if his bid is never considered. An auctioneer who publicises an auction as being without a reserve price falls under a duty to accept the highest bid. An automated vending machine constitutes a standing offer, and a court may construe an advertisement, or something on display like a deckchair, to be a serious offer if a customer would be led to believe they were accepting its terms by performing an action. Statute imposes criminal penalties for businesses that engage in misleading advertising, or not selling products at the prices they display in store, or unlawfully discriminating against customers on grounds of race, gender, sexuality, disability, belief or age. The Principles of European Contract Law article 2:201 suggests that most EU member states count a proposal to supply any good or service by a professional as an offer.|$|E

40|$|A flow cytometric {{method was}} {{developed}} to perform differential leukocyte counts on bovine blood. Blood specimens from 50 healthy Holstein cows were analyzed by use of a flow cytometer. The method entailed diluting blood with phosphate-buffered, hypotonic saline solution containing acridine orange, and performing a step-wise, 3 -parameter analysis on the bases of cell size, cellular granularity, and granulocyte fluorescence. Initially, proportions of monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes were <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> creating appropriate windows on dot plots of cell size (<b>determined</b> <b>by</b> forward light scatter) vs cellular granularity (<b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the logarithm of side light scatter). Eosinophils were resolved by analysis of granulocytes as dot plots of logarithms of green vs red fluorescence ascribed to acridine orange. Proportions of eosinophils and neutrophils were computed from data so generated. Microclumps of platelets spuriously affected counts of some granulocytes, particularly eosinophils. Differential leukocyte counts <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> flow cytometry generally compared favorably with those obtained by use of the conventional microscopic method, using Wright-stained blood films.
