40|$|Despite their {{relatively}} short history, deposit insurance schemes (DISs) are currently a common {{element of the}} banking system. In 2004, 83 explicite DISs operated around the world. The Bank Guarantee Fund (Bankowy Fundusz Gwarancyjny – BFG) – the Polish institution guaranteeing household deposits – is celebrating its 10 th anniversary this year. Over its 10 years of active operation the BFG has proved that, along with the National Bank of Poland and the Commission for Banking Supervision, it {{is among the most}} important institutions protecting the Polish financial system from destabilisation. The introductory part of this paper presents the position of the Bank Guarantee Fund within the Polish financial safety net. Other guarantee schemes operating in the Polish financial services sector have also been presented. Moreover, the paper explains the reasons for the launching of a DIS and points out the purposes for the establishment of the BFG. Further, it describes the evolution of Polish deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>arrangements</b> since 1982. Special emphasis has also been put on the analysis of Bank Guarantee Fund administration. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} describe Polish deposit insurance scheme. Particular features of the Polish scheme are discussed with reference to the Community regulations in this field and also arrangements adopted in the remaining 24 countries of the European Union. The third chapter of this paper describes the fundamental area of the Fund’s activity, i. e. guarantee activities consisting in making compensation payouts to depositors in the event of a bank’s bankruptcy. The scope of coverage (eligible types of deposits and depositors) offered by the Polish scheme has been analysed. The scope of the BFG’s guarantee activities from 1995 to 2004 has also been presented. In the fourth chapter, the BFG’s activities aimed at minimising risk in the banking sector have been presented. The principles and experience of the Fund regarding financial support for the rehabilitation of banks threatened with insolvency have been discussed in greatest detail here. The fifth chapter describes the principles and procedures regarding the financing of guarantee and assistance activities of the Bank Guarantee Fund. In the summary, the paper indicates possible directions for changes in the BFG legislation. It has been pointed out that despite the fact that Polish regulations comply with EU requirements,they must be adjusted to suit the changing domestic conditions. deposit insurance scheme, bank failure, assistance activities, Polish banking sector, financial stability, financial safety net, central bank, banking supervision, Community regulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{multimillion dollar}} price {{guarantees}} that an auction house can offer for paintings {{have already had}} a large impact on auction house profits, and place new demands on the auctioneer's decision making and negotiating skills. Yet auctioneers have not been studied as independent entities and decision makers. To create a price guarantee, the auction house and the seller must negotiate both the guarantee amount and the extra commission the seller pays if the auction price exceeds the guarantee. We present a normative model of negotiations and find the frontier of guarantee and commission that is the Nash bargaining solution. We also determine the optimal reserve that the auctioneer should place on guaranteed property. We find that guarantees decrease the auction house's expected revenue compared to a conventional auction, but do allow it to attract business which might otherwise be lost. Guarantees benefit sellers, increasing the expected value and lowering the variance of their auction revenue. The auctioneer's optimal strategy depends {{not only on the}} distribution of the artwork's auction price, but also the price it will bring if it fails to sell at auction. In the latter case the auction house must pay the seller the guarantee and then sell the artwork, which it now owns, in a private secondary market where buyers regard the property as "damaged goods" and lower their offers. Although all points on the frontier produce equal expected revenue, several frequently used decision making rules suggest that both parties may prefer a <b>guarantee</b> <b>arrangement</b> where the seller pays no additional commission and the guarantee has the lowest value on the frontier. auctions, guarantees, negotiation, decision-making...|$|R

Activation of a debt guarantee creates a new liability and the guarantor now becomes the new debtor. This raises issues on how to treat flows between the original debtor and creditor and between the original debtor and the guarantor (the new debtor). Activation of guarantees affects transactions or other economic flows. Usual cases of guarantees in terms of institutional units involved and motivations may be: (1) government providing guarantees for borrowing by public enterprises or private enterprises (for example, to encourage certain types of activities), (2) financial intermediaries providing guarantees as services for payment of a fee, and (3) parents providing guarantees for their subsidiaries (for example, to cut interest costs).

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2018 - 08 OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the health and financial implications of implementing a PBRSA along with lower patient cost sharing for two distinct PBRSAs in a case study of first-line pembrolizumab (PEMB) therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. METHODS: We evaluated two distinct PBRSAs based on surrogate endpoints from the pivotal KEYNOTE- 024 trial for a hypothetical treated population of 50 patients. The first PBRSA is an example of a conditional treatment continuation (CTC-PBRSA) arrangement in which a 25 % rebate or manufacturer (MFTR) risk share of PEMB costs is applied to all in patients the first four months and subsequently dropped for patients who achieve or maintain an objective response. The second PBRSA is an outcome <b>guarantee</b> <b>arrangement</b> (OG-PBRSA), where the payer is reimbursed based on the duration of progression free survival realized by each patient relative to an outcome target of ten months. To evaluate the potential health and cost implications of these PBRSAs along with lower patient cost sharing we developed a partitioned survival model composed of three health states: PFS, disease progression, and death. Parametric survival curves were fit using published survival data from pivotal clinical trials and survival was extrapolated for a lifetime time horizon using one-week increments. Model parameters such as survival, drug utilization rates, adverse event rates, utilities, and costs were derived from clinical trials and other published sources. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: In our hypothetical treated population of 50 patients, three additional patients were treated with PEMB under our PBRSAs at an additional drug cost of approximately $ 600, 000, excluding drug rebates, compared to the base case. The payer received drug rebate amounts of $ 460, 000 under the CTC-PBRSA and $ 113, 000 under the OG-PBRSA. Average lifetime QALYs were 1. 64 for the base case and 1. 67 for both of our PBRSAs, which produced an incremental cost per QALY of $ 85, 000 and $ 321, 000 for the CTC-PBRSA and OG-PBRSA compared to traditional reimbursement practices, respectively. From our sensitivity analysis, the initial cost of implementing a pilot PBRSA was found to be the most influential parameter for both of our PBRSAs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our decision model showed the CTC-PBRSA was more cost-effective than the OG-PBRSA with similar MFTR risk sharing of drug costs relative to the base case. Our findings suggest the barriers to the use of PBRSAs in the US health care environment are not insurmountable, and their use along with lower patient cost sharing may lead to cost savings and improved health outcomes. However, the generalizability of our results is limited to the specific terms of our PBRSAs, which reaffirms the need to carefully structure and implement PBRSAs based on the needs and demographics of the patient population of interest...|$|R

If these measures are not enacted or if the solvency of the plan remains questioned, and the applicable authority believes the plan to continue to fail to meet solvency standards, then the board of trustees, under direction of the applicable authority, shall terminate the plan and take actions to satisfy any claims, as necessary to ensure that the plan provides benefits in a timely manner to its participants and beneficiaries. The Secretary is permitted, upon approval by a US district court, to appoint to an AHP a trustee to ensure that the AHP remains solvent.|$|R
