40|$|Ein Schwerpunkt des umfassenden Umweltschutzprogrammes der BEWAG zur Senkung der Emissionen der Kraftwerke war die Modernisierung des Heizkraftwerkes Moabit. Als Ersatz fuer einen aus der Mitte der fuenfziger Jahre stammenden Block wurde hier mit der neuen Technik der zirkulierenden Wirbelschichtfeuerung (ZWS) eine moderne Anlage errichtet. Der Tradition des aeltesten Kraftwerkes Berlins als Versuchsfeld fuer neue richtungsweisende Techniken folgend entstand ein Kraftwerk, in dem die Emissionsreduzierung nicht durch nachgeschaltete Rauchgasreinigungsanlagen, sondern durch eine besonders umweltschonende Feuerungstechnik erreicht wurde. Da die Anlage nach dem Prinzip der Kraft-Waerme-Kopplung arbeitet, ist auch die Brennstoffausnutzung bedeutend hoeher als bei reiner Stromerzeugung. Der 100 -MW-Heizkraftwerksblock mit ZWS-Feuerung ist die gegenwaertig groesste Anlage dieser Art in Deutschland. (orig. /KO) One {{main focus}} of the {{comprehensive}} environmental protection programme of the BEWAG (Berliner Kraft- und Licht Aktiengesellschaft) {{in order to reduce}} the emissions of the <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> was the modernisation of the combined <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> of Moabit. One heating block that had been erected in the middle of the fifties was replaced by a modern plant with the new technique of circulating fluidized bed combustion. The tradition of using the oldest <b>power</b> <b>station</b> of Berlin as a testing field for new directional technologies was carried on. Hence a new <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was erected that did not achieve the reduction of emissions by an additionally connected flue gas dust collector plant but by an environmentally harmless fuel engineering. Since the plant works according to the method of a combined <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> generation the fuel utilisation is considerably higher than in the case of a pure current generation. The 100 -MW <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> block with the circulating fluidized bed combustion is the largest plant of this kind in Germany at the present.
