25|$|I am {{honored to}} receive this award (the Distinguished Service Medal) today {{but at the}} same time I am saddened to be leaving active {{military}} service. The Army has been my life and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> each of my twenty-five years of service.|$|E
25|$|I am {{honestly}} {{against the}} social intermingling of Negroes and Whites but I hold nothing personal against the Negroes as a race. They {{should be proud}} of their God-given heritage just as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> mine. I believe Negroes should have the right , and in Mississippi too—when their main purpose is not to put me out of office and when they won't try to besmirch the reputation of my state.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> {{my white}} skin, {{just as a}} Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race {{is not a man}} at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> what I did {{and would}} do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, she was {{featured}} on a Canadian postage stamp along with teammate Kadeisha Buchanan commemorating the 2015 Women's World Cup hosted in Canada. On June 30, 2017, she {{was appointed to}} the Order of Canada. Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's not something you can dream about happening to you. I can dream of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but to have your country recognize you – I don't even know what to say." ...|$|E
60|$|Back in {{the rifle}} pit Jed and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> heroes. The women wept and blessed us, and kissed us and mauled us. And <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the demonstration, although, like Jed, I let on that I {{did not like}} all such making-over. But Jeremy Hopkins, a great bandage about the stump of his left wrist, said we were the stuff white men were made out of--men like Daniel Boone, like Kit Carson, and Davy Crockett. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> that than all the rest.|$|R

500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole {{was proud}} of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole, a term that was {{commonly}} used in a racially neutral sense or {{to refer to the}} children of white settlers with indigenous women. In her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole, she records her bloodline thus: [...] "I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood coursing through my veins. My father was a soldier of an old Scottish family." [...] Legally, she was classified as a mulatto, a multiracial person with limited political rights; Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the [...] "lazy Creole", She {{was proud of}} her black ancestry, writing, [...] "I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the relationship – to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns." ...|$|E
500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush. [...] There were tears from McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I am grateful to him. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> him." [...] The Almanac of American Politics called it [...] "a moving, elegiac speech that ended as if in a minor key." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course {{all that}} changes when the {{opportunity}} comes. It wasn't so much that I disliked the idea of marriage, for myself, as that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the freedom which I enjoyed. However that <b>is</b> all over. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> free no longer." ...|$|R
500|$|Delhi police {{registered}} {{a criminal}} case against {{the editor of a}} Delhi-based tabloid, Mail Today, for disclosing the female victim's identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code. Shashi Tharoor, then a union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, with a view to showing respect for her courageous response by naming future laws after her, but Tharoor's remark created controversy. Speaking to a British press reporter on 5 January, the victim's father was quoted as saying, [...] "We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter." [...] Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father's reported quote and the victim's name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name. However, the following day Zee News quoted the father as saying, [...] "I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one." ...|$|E
500|$|While it {{eventually}} became a bestseller in the United States, The Red Badge of Courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when {{it was published in}} late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: [...] "I have only one pride {{and that is that the}} English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been [...] with great praise by the English reviewers. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." [...] Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a [...] "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to [...] "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." [...] Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that [...] "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be [...] "positively... cold and ineffectual" [...] when compared to The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E

"Lahore {{is not on}} our minds, {{the team}} has done a really great job mentally getting over it, it was heartbreaking to lose the Twenty20 final {{but we had a}} great tournament. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the way the team played in England and I am {{confident}} we will do as well in the Test matches." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It was {{the best}} thing I ever did musically. Thats the only thing Ive ever done that I can listen to today without {{throwing}} up. I always said if I could record one album <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of,</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> satisfied." ...|$|R

2500|$|Heterosexual Swedish {{international}} and former Arsenal and West Ham United midfielder Freddie Ljungberg endured questions over his sexuality [...] "due to his bachelor lifestyle {{and love of}} musicals and fashion". Despite denying the speculation, he told the New York Times that [...] "I don’t mind at all. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> that. I love fashion, and I think so many gay people have amazing style. So that is a compliment to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another of {{his network}} {{assignments}} was The Morning Show, CBS' short-lived challenge to NBC's Today in 1954. His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion puppet named Charlemane about the news. He considered this discourse with a puppet as [...] "one of the highlights" [...] of the show. He added, [...] "A puppet can render opinions on {{people and things}} that a human commentator would not feel free to utter. I was and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Cronkite also angered the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the show's sponsor, by grammatically correcting its advertising slogan. Instead of saying [...] "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should" [...] verbatim, he substituted [...] "as" [...] for [...] "like." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{a matter}} <b>of</b> course <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> being thus {{received}} by my elders, {{but when my}} father came up hurriedly, taking me {{in his arms and}} kissing me on the cheek as if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> a mere child, truly was my cup of happiness running over! ...|$|R
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> them." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{proud as}} he is of SIUE's {{athletic}} success, Dr. Hewitt is even more proud of its academic success.

2500|$|Before {{becoming}} a U.S. senator, Dodd {{was hired to}} lobby for Guatemala in the United States for $50,000 a year by dictator Carlos Castillo Armas. According to the North American Congress on Latin America, Dodd [...] "had perhaps the coziest relationship with the Castillo Armas government." [...] After a short trip to Guatemala in 1955, Dodd urged the House of Representatives to increase aid to the Central American country. Dodd's amendment passed and Guatemala received $15 million of US aid in 1956. Dodd was unapologetic when criticized for his lobbying {{efforts on behalf of}} the Guatemalan dictatorship. When a Republican organizer challenged Dodd on his lobbying, Dodd stated [...] "I am a practicing attorney and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the fact that the anti-communist government of Guatemala has asked me to handle its legal affairs in the US. Of course I will not represent the government of Guatemala or any other private client if I am elected to the Senate." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, she did," [...] {{admitted}} Marilla. [...] "She's {{a bright}} child, Matthew. And she looked real nice too.

60|$|Zulime {{was much}} excited {{at the thought}} of meeting the great novelist, but when he came, she took his hand with graceful composure, expressing just the right {{mingling}} of reserve and pleasure. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> her, and the fact that Howells instantly and plainly approved of her, added to my satisfaction.|$|R
