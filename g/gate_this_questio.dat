Comment: This contribution deals with the discovery of infinitely many rational approximants to ζ(3) classified in 12 cases and linked with simultaneous rational approximation problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{concept of}} [n, cx•) •-refinability was {{introduced}} by Hodel and Vaughan and was used, by Worrell and Wicke, to characterize compactness in countably compact spaces. In this paper, this notion and its modified version are used to characterize paracompactness in locally LindelSf spaces and LindelSfness, so that some results from Watson and Smith are generalized. 1. Introduction. A question which has been much worked upon is: When is an Ricompact space Linde 16 f? It is well-known from Aquaro [1] that Ri-compact metaLinde 16 f spaces are LindelSf.

40|$|Abstract · In {{addressing}} the question “Do representations need reality?”, this paper attempts {{to show that}} a principled understanding of representations requires that they have objective, systematic content. It is claimed that there is an interesting form of nonconceptual, intentionality which is processed by non-systematic connectionist networks and has its correctness conditions provided by a modest biosemantics; but this type of content is not properly representational. Finally, I consider the consequences that such a verdict has on eliminativist views that look to connectionism as a means of radically reconceiving our understanding of cognition.

Considering food and wine tasting as a case study, this paper aims at discussing the problems this peculiar object presents to a semiotic gaze. The richness of these meaningful practices {{and the need to}} make the tasters’ experiences attestable and analysable requires different methodologies, such as interviews, videos and participant observation. How do these typically ethnographical tools integrate in the semiotic perspective? Moreover, may the sensory sciences’ methodology help to develop a semiotic analytical model which allow to discover the hidden aspects of signification?

40|$|Measuring {{perceived}} {{health status}} through the single item "How is your health in general?" has appealed to many researchers. Understandably, {{as it is}} an easy to administer, highly reliable measure, 'vith strong predictive validity and -at the individual level- high content validity. However, although many (mostly quantitative) {{studies have been conducted}} on the single-item measure of self-assessed health, investigators {{have not been able to}} determine all dimensions which are involved in health-assessments. This illustrates that the greatest advantage of the single-item measure on self-assessed health over other measures of perceived health, the fact that it is fully individualised, is at the same time its greatest disadvantage; the process of health assessment is more or less a "black box".

40|$|We {{propose a}} well behaved, conserved volume {{quantifier}} for Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC) violating matter in a static spherically symmetric traversable wormhole and check it against some classic solutions {{of general relativity}} with a well known scalar field source. Our quantifier firmly establishes the conclusion that traversable wormholes can be supported by arbitrarily small quantities of exotic matter. It is shown that an earlier formulation leading to that conclusion suffers from crucial inadequacies. PACS number(s) : 04. 70. Dy, 04. 62. +v, 11. 10. Kk Traversable wormholes are just as good a prediction of Einstein’s general relativity as are black holes. The notion of exotic matter required to construct such wormholes has found a novel justification in the phantom matter field that accounts for the dark matter on a cosmological scale. There arises a natural enquiry {{as to how much}} of such exotic matter, violating specifically the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC), is required to support a traversable Lorentzian wormhole on a local scale. <b>This</b> <b>questio...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that there exists a PCP {{characterization}} of NP where the verifier makes 3 queries and has a one-sided error that is bounded away from 1; and also that 2 queries do not suffice for such a characterization. Thus PCPs with 3 queries possess non-trivial verification power and motivate the task of determining the lowest error {{that can be achieved}} with a 3 -query PCP. Recently, H astad [11] has shown a tight characterization of NP by constructing a 3 -query PCP verifier with "error" arbitrarily close to 1 = 2. Unfortunately, this verifier makes two-sided error and H astad makes essential use of this feature. One-sided error, on the other hand, is a natural notion to associate with a proof system, since it has the desirable property that every rejected proof has a short counterexample. The question of determining the smallest error for which there exists a 3 -query PCP verifier making onesided error and accepting an NP-complete language, however, remained open.

40|$|Abstract. The {{discovery}} of a new boson with a mass around 125 GeV {{has been established in}} July 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC collider. More than twice as much data was collected by the end of 2012. The analysis of the full data sample, collected with pp collisions at 7 and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012, has now allowed for considerable progress in understanding the nature of the new boson. The new boson is found to be a Higgs boson, with properties as expected for the scalar boson H resulting from the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model. A review of the latest ATLAS and CMS results on the H boson is presented here. 1 Introduction: the Standard Model and the Higgs Boson Over the past four decades, the standard model (SM) of particle physics has provided a remarkably accurate description of numerous results from accelerator and non-accelerator based experiments. Yet, until very recently, the question of how the W and Z gauge bosons acquire mass remained an opened question. <b>This</b> <b>questio...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} resource-based theory can be {{considered}} as a special case of the labour theory of value. Marx's development of the labour theory of value is used as a basis for exploring resource-based theory. The stages in the Circuit of Capital provide the structure for this exploration. Five categories of labour power are defined and developed which assists us in the exploration of various competitive phenomena of interest to strategy scholars. The resource-based theory of the firm (RBT) (Peteraf, 1993; Wernerfelt, 1984) argues that resources that are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and imperfectly substitutable are an organisation's main source of sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991). Whilst most of the contributions to this view have focused on the ease with which valuable resources can be imitated, less consideration has been paid to what makes particular resources valuable in the first instance. Most contributions start from an assumption of a resource’s value, and then proceed to consider issues of imitability (Miller and Shamsie, 1996).
