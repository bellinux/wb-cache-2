The function of the collector is the converting of solar radiation falling on its surface to {{energy in the form}} of sensible or latent heat in'a fluid which is-passed through the collecting unit. Numerous types of solar energy collectors have been devised.

The heated air from the equator does indeed commence to flow in an upper current, and the cooled air from the pole in an under current; but, as the upper currents of air are speedily cooled by exposure to space, and the under currents are <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>contact</b> with the earth's surface, they constantly change places--the lower current becoming the upper, and vice versa. But they do not change direction. The Equatorial Current ascends, rushes north to a point about latitude 30 degrees, where, being sufficiently cooled, it swoops down, and continues its Northward rush along the earth. At another point the Polar Current quits the earth, and soaring up, in consequence of its recently acquired heat, becomes the upper current. This change in the two currents takes place twice in their course.|$|R
40|$|Abstract � A new {{ultrasonic}} {{method for}} monitoring the temperature distribution inside a material being heated or cooled is presented. The {{principle of the}} method {{is based on the}} temperature dependence of the velocity of ultrasonic wave propagating through a material. An effective inverse analysis coupled with a finite difference calculation is used to determine the one-dimensional temperature distribution inside a thick plate. To verify the practical feasibility of the ultrasonic method, experiments have been demonstrated. A single side of a steel plate of 30 mm thickness is <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>contacting</b> with a heater of 200 ºC and subsequently cooled down by water. Ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements are then performed for the steel during the heating and cooling. A change in the transit time of longitudinal ultrasonic waves across the steel is continuously acquired and used to determine the temperature distribution inside the steel. The temperature distribution and its transient variation determined by the ultrasonic method almost agree with those obtained using thermocouples installed in the steel. Thus, it is verified that the present method can be a promising means for real-time monitoring of temperature profiles in materials being heated or cooled...|$|R

If a model GS separates much farther north than CH, then northward GS meanders, which pinch off warm core eddies (rings), are not possible or are strongly {{constrained by the}} Grand Banks shelfbreak. Cold core rings pinch off the southward GS meanders. The rings are often re-absorbed by the GS.

The system proposed for extracting {{heat from the}} rock and onverting it to electricity is comprised of two distinct subsystems (see Figure 1) at very different stages of their technological evolution.

The pyrometamorphic ejecta are compositionally heterogeneous at the macro- and micro-scale, and are classified as buchites; that is, glass coupled with a high-temperature, low-pressure modal mineralogy. Three distinct facies (i. e. cordierite-plagioclase, mullite-plagioclase palisade and tridymite-clinopyroxene) are recognized among the buchites, whose bulk-rock chemistry is compatible with aluminous- to silica-rich protoliths. Abundant mineral growth (e. g. plagioclase palisades and clinopyroxene coronae) occurs at the contact between the ejecta and the crystal-rich host shoshonitic basalt, which typically coats the pyrometamorphic blocks. Mineral constraints, pseudoporphyritic microstructures, plagioclase relict phenocrysts and major and trace element compositions strongly support {{the origin of the}} buchite ejecta as hydrothermally altered rocks from theVancori edifice (a period of activity spanning > 10 kyr), which underwent high-temperature, low-pressure contact metamorphism. In the uppermost magmatic system of an active island arc volcano, such as Stromboli, volcanic and subvolcanic rocks usually undergo alteration processes induced by acid-sulphate hydrothermal systems. The circulation of acidic fluids results in leaching of the Stromboli rocks (in {{the upper part of the}} volcano edifice) and, depending on the pH, temperature and exposure time to the hydrothermal fluids, production of different alteration facies. The hydrothermally altered Stromboli rocks show facies consistent with argillic to silicic alteration, containing abundant hydrous sulphate and hydroxy-sulphate minerals such as the alunite group minerals, hexahydrite, millosevichite, pickeringite and kieserite.

This paper presents the design and development of a micro- cogeneration prototype (< 6 kWe) for single-family households. The unit is based on a commercially available internal combustion engine (ICE) and generator, optimized and modified to be fuelled by natural gas, coupled to a two-step exhaust heat recuperating system. The work starts with the thermodynamic analysis of the ICE operating cycle and the assessment of thermal energy that can be recovered from the exhaust gases and through the engine cooling system. The analysis included the study of gas-mixture composition, combustion, heat loss to engine walls and water- vapour mass transfer. The main innovation is the exhaust gases heat recovery system, developed in two stages. The first stage consists on a direct heat exchanger where water is <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> direct <b>contact</b> with hot jets of exhaust gases, while the second stage heat exchanger involves further cooling of the saturated gases and condensation of evaporated water.

40|$|The {{geothermal}} energy is everywhere {{beneath the surface}} of the earth. The earth’s interior is enormous thermal reservoir of energy, which can be utilized if favorable geological conditions exist. The electricity generation in 1942 at Larderello was a commercial success. The installed geothermoelectric capacity had reached 127 650 kWe. Several countries were soon to follow the example set by Italy. In 1919, first geothermal wells were drilled at Beppu in Japan, followed in 1921 by wells drilled at The Geysers, California, USA. In 1958 a small geothermal power plant began operating in New Zealand; in 1959 another one in Mexico, in 1960 in the USA, followed by many other countries in the years to come. The heat source can be either a very high temperature (> 600 °C) magmatic intrusion reaching relatively shallow depths (5 - 10 km) or, as in certain low-temperature systems at the Earth's normal temperature, which increases with depth. The reservoir is a volume of hot permeable rocks from which circulating fluids extract the heat. The reservoir is generally overlain by a cover of impermeable rocks and connected to a superficial recharge area through which the meteoric waters can replace or partly replace the fluids that escape from the reservoir through springs or are extracted by boreholes. The geothermal fluid is water, in majority of cases the meteoric water, in the liquid or vapour phase, depending on its temperature and pressure. This water often carries chemicals and gases such as CO 2, H 2 S, etc. Another source of underground heat is so called the hot dry rock.

The spectra are dominated by a broad emission feature caused by warm amorphous silicates, and by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In HD 163296 we nd aliphatic carbonaceous dust, the rst detection of this material in a HAEBE star. The silicate band shows a large variation in shape, due to variable contributions of three components: (i) a broad shoulder at 8. 6 m; (ii) a broad maximum at 9. 8 m; and (iii) a narrow feature with a broad underlying continuum at 11. 3 m. From detailed modeling these features can be identied with silica (SiO 2), sub-micrometer sized amorphous olivine grains and micrometer sized amorphous olivine grains in combination with forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4), respectively. Typical mass fractions are 5 to 10 per cent of crystalline over amorphous olivine, and a few per cent of silica compared to the olivines.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of undesired matter at {{heat transfer surfaces}} (fouling) is a severe problem to industry. The growth of calcium sulphate dihydrate an heated metal surfaces has been examined and a mechanism for the effect of surface roughness {{on the amount of}} deposition has been proposed. A novel piece of equipment was designed and constructed in which the growth of crystals on heat transfer surfaces with different surface roughnesses could be observed under controlled solution conditions. The test section was a transparent rectangular channel into which three 25 mm diameter test pieces could be inserted such that the polished faces were planar with the rear face of the channel. The back faces of these test pieces were <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>contact</b> with hot water. Using Reynolds numbers of 300 to 13, 500 and calcium sulphate solutions with bulk concentrations from 20 to 50 mM Ca" 2 "+, no gross effect due to surface roughness was seen. However a limited effect, which distinguished grit-blasted surfaces from polished surfaces, was found in experiments with a bulk concentration from 28 to 33 mM Ca" 2 "+. In all of the experiments it was observed that the presence of bubbles enhanced crystal growth. It was also found that the amount of deposition formed on any surface decreased with decreasing dissolved oxygen content of the bulk solution. It is suggested that a bulk concentration of approximately 33 mM Ca" 2 "+ is a critical level of supersaturation, which corresponds with the so-called metastable limit of supersaturation. The surface roughness effect may be associated with two factors. Firstly, as the critical supersaturation is approached crystal growth is enhanced at certain sites, in particular the edges of bubbles. Secondly, very rough surfaces, such as grit-blasted surfaces, more readily support and initiate bubble formation and consequently the grit-blasted surface shows greater growth. Additional work with a different test rig, using a stagnant solution, indicated that suppression of bubble formation during an experiment, either by initially degassing the surface or by pressurising the system, decreased the amount of crystal growth. This work suggests that a surface roughness effect exists which is related to the presence of bubbles at the surface. Consequently the amount of deposition can be decreased either by controlling the formation of the bubbles (e. g. by completely degassing both the solution and the surface, and pressurising the system), or by polishing the surface. However, the surface roughness effect was most apparent between the very coarse, grit-blasted surfaces (R_a #approx =# 2. 90 #mu#m) and the medium finish 180 or 240 Grit surfaces (R_a #approx =# 0. 23 #mu#m). Little or no a further improvement was obtained in polishing to a mirror finish. i. e. 0. 25 or 0. 1 #mu#m (R_a #approx =# 0. 03 #mu#m). Therefore, for industrial purposes, further polishing beyond removing gross roughness would not appear to yield sufficient benefit to justify the large cost involved. It is recommended that further work be undertaken to determine whether the deposition which occurs in the absence of bubbles is influenced by the surface roughness, and whether other chemical systems and surfaces behave similar to the calcium sulphate - stainless steel system studied in this work. Moreover, additional work should be undertaken to examine the effect of surface physical properties on crystal and bubble nucleation and growth.

40|$|Contact-type RF MEMS {{switches}} {{have demonstrated}} low on-state resistance, high off-state impedance, and very large bandwidth; however, their power handling capability is low due to failure caused <b>by</b> <b>contact</b> <b>heating.</b> This paper examines <b>contact</b> <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> measuring V-I curves for contacts in gold switches. Multiphysics modeling allows extraction of contact temperature. Contacts {{are found to}} soften and self-anneal at a temperature of about 100 ¡C, corresponding to a contact voltage of about 80 mV. Larger contact force induces a larger decrease in contact resistance during softening, suppressing contact heating. The data provide {{a better understanding of}} micro-scale contact physics, leading to design for switches for improved power-handling capability...|$|R
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> passing current through the resistance caused <b>by</b> the <b>contact</b> between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|R
