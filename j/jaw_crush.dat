40|$|This paper {{develops}} two {{optimal control}} {{models for the}} energy management of a mining crushing process based on jaw crushers. The performance index for both models {{is defined as the}} energy cost to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use electricity tariff. The first model is referred to as a variable load-based optimal control with the feeder speed and closed-side setting of the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> as control variables. The second model is the optimal switching control. From the simulation results, it is demonstrated that there is a potential of reducing the energy cost and energy consumption associated with the operation of <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> stations in deep mines while meeting technical and operational constraints. Due to the inefficiency of the <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> machine, whose no-load power consumption is between 40 and 50 % of its rated power, the optimal switching control technique is shown to be a better candidate in reducing both energy cost and consumption of the <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> station. The benefit of having an ore pass with a big storage capacity is shown to be of great importance in achieving more energy cost reduction of the primary <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> station while improving the switching frequency profile associated with the switching controller.

40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> shows that the forces on the moving jaw plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b> <b>Jaw</b> plate wear has considerable affect on the life of <b>jaw</b> <b>Crusher</b> which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the fixed jaw should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{analytical}} perspective {{is used to}} develop a fundamental model of a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b> Previously, <b>jaw</b> crushers were modelled in regard to certain aspects, for example, energy consumption (Legendre and Zevenhoven, 2014) or kinematics (Oduori et al., 2015).

40|$|The {{physical}} and mechanical characteristics of intact rocks {{depend on the}} way of their formation, sustained deformations {{and the process of}} wearing a specific rock has been exposed to.

5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of comminution. Comminution of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> (1m > P80 > 100 mm), cone crusher (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer <b>crusher.</b> Primary <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|R
40|$|Mining is very {{important}} globally. The total amount of mines worldwide {{is estimated to be}} 100, 000 – 150, 000 [1]–[3]. Mining’s share of global energy consumption is ~ 5 % [4]–[6]. Previous studies made on vehicles [7], [8] and paper machines [9] indicate that even 20 – 30 % of total energy is lost due to friction. Similar studies on the energy losses due to wear have not been made. This thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, the global mining industry, energy consumption in mining, and wear and friction in mining are examined. In the second part, case studies of highly energy consuming devices, a haul truck, a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> and a grinding mill, are made. From all mines, 70 – 80 % are surface mines and 20 – 30 % are underground or mixed mines. The largest mining countries are China, USA, Australia, India, and Russia [1]. The mining process can roughly be divided into three operational stages: extraction, haulage, and processing. In addition to these three, there is the group of supporting activities. When the energy consumption distribution in surface and underground operations was studied it was discovered that most of the energy goes to processing and sup-porting activities. In the case studies the energy losses due to friction are examined by making energy distribution models. Previous studies and literature on this field was used as a frame of reference in this work. The effect of wear is evaluated by calculating the costs caused by replacement parts and wear-related maintenance. The obtained results indicate that friction losses in the rigid frame haul truck are 24 %, in the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> 30 %, and in the grinding mill 50 % of the total energy consumption. The annual costs of wear are in the haul truck 40, 000 €, in the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> 100, 000 €, and in the grinding mill 825, 000 €. The total annual costs of wear and friction compared with the purchase price of a new device are 28 % in a haul truck, 13 % in a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> and 34 % in a grinding mill. Energy savings can be obtained with improving energy efficiency, planning the mining operations and maintenance, and with material selections...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{stiffness}} of swing plates {{has not been}} varied with changes in rock strength. Rock strength has only been of interest {{because of the need}} to know the maximum force exerted by the toggle for energy considerations. Thus a swing plate, stiff enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (q_u) of up to 308 MPa, may be overdesigned (and, most importantly, overweight) for crushing a softer fragmental limestone, amphibolites. Design of lighter weight jaw crushers will require a more precise accounting of the stresses and deflections in the crushing plates than is available with traditional techniques. Efforts to decrease energy consumed in crushing have lead to consideration of decreasing the weight of the swing plate of jaw crushers for easily crushed material. In the present work the design of the swing jaw plate using point-load deformation failure (PDF) relationships along with interactive failure of rock particles as a model for such a weight reduction.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to perform a static force {{analysis}} of the single toggle <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> mechanism and to obtain the force transmission characteristics of the mechanism. In order to obtain force transmission metrics that are characteristic {{of the structure of}} the mechanism, such influences as friction, dead weight, and inertia are considered to be extraneous and neglected. Equations are obtained by considering the balance of forces at the moving joints and appropriately relating these to the input torque and the output torque. A mechanical advantage, the corresponding transmitted torque, and the variations thereof, during the cycle of motion of the mechanism, are obtained. The mechanical advantage that characterizes the mechanism is calculated as the mean value over the active crushing stroke of the mechanism. The force transmission characteristics can be used as criteria for the comparison of different <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> mechanism designs in order to select the most suitable design for a given application.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of the crushing process used to obtain recycled concrete aggregates on the performance of concrete made with those aggregates. Two crushing methods were considered: primary <b>crushing,</b> using a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> and primary plus secondary crushing (PSC), using a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> followed by a hammer mill. Besides natural aggregates (NA), these two processes were also used to crush three types of concrete made in laboratory (L 20, L 45 e L 65) and three more others from the precast industry (P 20, P 45 e P 65). The coarse natural aggregates were totally replaced by coarse recycled concrete aggregates. The recycled aggregates concrete mixes were compared with reference concrete mixes made using only NA, and the following properties related to the mechanical and durability performance were tested: compressive strength; splitting tensile strength; modulus of elasticity; carbonation resistance; chloride penetration resistance; water absorption by capillarity; water absorption by immersion; and shrinkage. The results show that the PSC process leads to better performances, especially in the durability properties. © 2014 RILE...|$|R

The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.|$|R
