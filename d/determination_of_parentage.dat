40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} of the Bachelor ofLaws degree, Strathmore university law schoolIn 2014, the Reproductive Health Care Bill was introduced in Parliament. The Bill affords a chapter for the regulation of altruistic gestational surrogacy arrangements, a non-commercial agreement between two parties, in which one party agrees to bear a child of which the party is not genetically related to and upon the birth of the child relinquish all parental rights over the child to the other party. The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>parentage</b> <b>of</b> the child born from such an arrangement has been a legal tussle for courts in Kenya to contend with since neither the current laws nor the proposed Reproductive Health Care Bill provide direction as to whom parental rights are entitled upon the birth of the baby. The objective of this research paper is to determine which party is entitled to these parental rights. On the one hand, these rights may be entitled to the surrogate since she carried and gave birth to the child while the rights may also be entitled to the intending parents who contracted the surrogate and initiated the whole process. Either way, the lack of legal direction on the issue has led to uncertainty and controversies. Therefore, this paper conducted a qualitative study which comprised of a literature review <b>of</b> the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>parentage</b> in gestational surrogacy arrangements. First, this paper explored the theoretic framework underpinning altruistic gestational surrogacy arrangements. Second it addressed the state’s and the societal interest in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>parentage</b> in these arrangements and third, it undertook a comparative review of the legal framework in the United Kingdom and South Africa which offer guidance for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>parentage</b> in an altruistic gestational surrogacy agreement in Kenya. Consequently, this paper finds the law of contract is sufficient to ensure the validity of the terms of an altruistic gestational surrogacy arrangement. Thus, the intending parents should have primary parental rights upon the birth of the child. Furthermore, this paper also asserts that the inevitable role played by the state in implementing a legal framework that recognises the intending parents as the legal parents of the child born from an altruistic gestational surrogacy arrangement in Kenya...|$|R
40|$|From {{the moment}} a child is born, she is a {{juridical}} person endowed with constitutional rights. A child’s parents, however, do not become legal parents until a state statute grants them the fundamental right to raise one’s child. The state, therefore, exercises considerable power and discretion when it drafts the parentage statutes that determine who becomes a legal parent. This article asserts that the state, through its parens patriae power, {{has a duty to}} act as an agent for children when it drafts its parentage statutes. In particular, the state must adopt parentage statutes that satisfy children’s fundamental right to legal parents at birth. This right derives from the Substantive Due Process privacy right to form intimate, familial relationships, as well as the right to intimate association and ensures that a child may develop the parent-child relationships necessary to preserve her liberty, protect her rights, and define her identity. To guarantee children’s fundamental right to legal parents at birth, states must reform their current parentage statutes. This article argues that states must first replace all presumptions in parentage statutes with clear <b>determinations</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>parentage</b> at birth. Next, states must grant legal <b>parentage</b> <b>of</b> children conceived through sexual reproduction to the child’s genetic parents. For children conceived through assisted reproductive technology, states must grant legal parentage to the intended parents. By adopting statutes that assign children parents from these respective groups, states ensure that the persons {{who are most likely to}} act in the child’s best interest become the child’s legal parents. In so doing, the state fulfills its parens patriae obligation to guarantee every child’s fundamental right to legal parents at birth...|$|R

The thesis concerns not only with the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> paternity, but also with maternity determination, which is mentioned with regard to assisted reproduction and surrogacy. Emphasis is placed on both, current legislation and the new Civil Code coming into effect on 1 January 2014. The thesis is divided into eight chapters. The introduction discusses possible views on the concept of parenthood. Furthermore, it introduces the issue <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> <b>determination,</b> especially in connection with the increasing number of children born outside marriage. The following chapter is devoted to legislative regulation <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> itself. Firstly, it elaborates the history of such regulations with focus on Roman law and the Austrian Civil Code. Subsequently, it describes the current legislation and briefly comments on the new Civil Code, which is further discussed in the corresponding chapters.

40|$|<b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> is {{fundamental}} {{to the study of}} biology and to applications such as the identification of pedigrees.

40|$|Infection due to bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) is endemic in most cattle-producing countries {{throughout the}} world. The key elements of a BVDV control programme are biosecurity, elimination of persistently infected animals and surveillance. Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is a notifiable disease in Belgium and an official eradication programme started from January 2015, based on testing ear notches sampled during the official identification and registration of calves at birth. An antigen-capture ELISA test based on the detection of BVDV Erns protein is used. Ear notch sample may {{also be used to}} characterize the genotype of the calf when appropriate elution/dilution buffer is added. Both BVDV antigen-ELISA analysis and animal traceability could be performed. With regards to the reference protocol used in the preparation of ear notch samples, alternative procedures were tested in terms of BVDV analytic sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, as well as quality and purity of animal DNA. The Allflex DNA Buffer D showed promising results in BVDV diagnosis and genome analyses, opening new perspectives for the livestock industry by the exploitation of the animal genome. Due to the high number of cattle involved in the Belgian official BVDV eradication programme based on ear notch tags sample, a large database on both BVDV status of newborn calves and cattle genome could be created for subsequent different uses (e. g. traceability, <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage,</b> genetic signatures throughout the genome associated with particular traits) evolving through a more integrated animal health...|$|E
40|$|Perithecial wall {{tissue is}} {{maternal}} in origin. When a protoperitheciating lawn {{is used as}} female parent, all the perithecia that appear promptly are of maternal origin. However, perithecia continue to be formed, and {{there is always a}} possibility that late-forming perithecia might have originated from the fertilizing parent. In situations where <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> is critical, as when distinguishing the nuclear or mitochondrial basis of a trait or determining whether a strain is female-fertile, presence of the per- 1 mutation in one parent or the other will provide assurance regarding which strain functioned as female (protoperithecial) parent and which as male. per- 1 protoperithecia and perithecia are unable to form black pigment, and any progeny from nonblack perithecia are known to have been mothered by the per- 1 parent. The per- 1 mutant has been used effectively to demonstrate the parentage of perithecia on opposite sides of a barrage in confrontations between strains of opposite mating type. (See Figure 37 in Perkins et al. 2001.) Procedure A strain carrying a type- 1 allele of per- 1 is used as one parent. (Type 2 is more difficult to score.) Lawns of opposite mating type are fertilized reciprocally after protoperithecia are present. Color of the perithecial wall reveals which parent served as maternal parent. Regardless of which parent was maternal, half of the ascospores will be per- 1 and hence unpigmented. Special precautions must be taken if it is desired to obtain per- 1 progeny in pure culture, because per- 1 ascospores germinate without heat shock.

Test applications include the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> and ancestry, prediction of future susceptibility and the diagnosis of genetic disorders. The developments and challenges for health professionals and consumers presented by developments in genetic testing continue to be a focus of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). This NHMRC statement is aimed at health professionals and policy makers. It concerns DNA genetic tests that are used in the diagnosis of medical conditions or in an attempt to provide information about an individual’s risk of developing health-related conditions. It distinguishes between the fields of medical genetic testing and direct-to-consumer testing, serves to highlight the factors considered integral to the appropriate delivery and use of health-related genetic testing, and assists health professionals in managing the health and wellbeing of Australians. Genetic testing, along with the methods by which a genetic test is offered, has both benefits and pitfalls. Individuals may undergo Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing out of curiosity for seemingly trivial things, such as to discover more about their ear wax or whether they possess genetic variations for curly hair, allowing greater engagement and appreciation for science and for what makes them unique. However, of potential concern is the packaging of such tests ‘for fun ’ when they also offer findings that affect, or are considered as affecting, clinical outcomes. 1 Irrespective of whether a genetic test is offered through a health professional (medical genetic tests), or directly to consumers (DTC genetic tests), NHMRC considers the following three elements to be integral to the appropriate delivery and use of health-related genetic testing: • professional involvement and education • a robust evidence base • consumer information and support.

40|$|Considers {{whether the}} outcome of a family law matter is {{affected}} by the way in which a child 2 ̆ 7 s family was formed and who {{is considered to be a}} 2 ̆ 7 parent 2 ̆ 7 under the Act. This report provides a response to the request from the former Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, for the Family Law Council to consider a range of issues in relation to who is considered to be a parent of a child under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) (Family Law Act). The reference responds to the increasing diversity of families in Australia and the rapidly changing nature of reproductive technology and community attitudes to family formation. It also reflects a concern to ensure that as far as possible children are not disadvantaged by the nature of their family or the way in which it was formed. In its work, Council has considered the complex interaction of the legal and social aspects of families with a focus on the outcomes for children. Council has also considered Australia’s international human rights obligations as well as Australian, state and territory laws. Council conducted a number of consultations with community organisations, representatives of the Courts and the legal profession, government departments and academics. Council also made a public call for written submissions from interested members of the public. Council conducted its own research through searches of the relevant case law and academic literature. The cases were analysed with the aim of identifying who is a legal parent and whether the current provisions of Part VII of the Family Law Act lead to outcomes for children that are appropriate, consistent and non-discriminatory. In addition, Council identified a range of issues where there was uncertainty in the law and inconsistencies at both the state/territory and federal levels and between different Commonwealth agencies. Council also reviewed the data on the diversity of family forms and structures in Australia, which show that many children are living in families that are not based on the traditional form of a married couple and children who are biologically related to both parents. Council has taken all of this information into consideration in formulating its response and recommendations. The complete set of recommendations is provided at the end of this Summary. Council is making a general recommendation that the Australian Government introduce a federal Status of Children Act which would provide a clear statement of parentage laws for the purposes of all the laws of the Commonwealth. The rationale for this recommendation has developed out of Council’s consideration of all the issues raised by the terms of reference. Council’s work on this reference has reinforced its view that the appropriate focus of concern for Part VII of the Family Law Act is resolving disputes about post-separation care and parenting arrangements for children. In decision making in this area, the courts have consistently been guided by the principles of the best interests of the child (as they have developed) and not by the legal status of the adults who vi i i FAMILY LAW COUNCIL - REPORT ON PARENTAGE AND THE FAMILY LAW ACT | DECEMBER 2013 care for those children. In other words, the fact of parentage (or legal parenthood), although obviously important, is not the determinative question in disputes arising under Part VII. In contrast, a range of different considerations may apply to the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> for the purposes of other Commonwealth laws, including those relating to citizenship and migration, which raise issues that are different from the concerns pertinent to post-separation parenting matters.  ...|$|E
40|$|The Act makes {{sweeping}} changes to Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s child and spousal support enforcement procedures by shifting {{the bulk of}} enforcement authority from the court system to the Child Support Enforcement Agency of the Department of Human Resources (DHR). First, the Act amends several of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s alimony and child support statutes. It removes {{the statute of limitations}} for foreign judgments of child or spousal support orders and provides that child or spousal support orders cannot be changed retroactively or become dormant. It makes late child support payments judgments by operation of law, sets a time limit for contempt hearings, and allows for the revocation, denial, or suspension of recreational licenses for support order non-compliance. It requires income deduction orders to be entered with all orders establishing, enforcing, or modifying a support order and allows the IV-D Agency to provide for withholding upon the accrual of a thirty-day arrearage without the need for a hearing or order. The Act also requires notice to the obligor and lays out procedures for contesting withholding orders. Second, the Act amends numerous statutes governing the parent-child relationship. It allows the father, in a DHR-initiated paternity determination petition, to intervene to legitimize the child if the mother consents to such legitimation, and it disentitles the parties to the right to a jury trial in procedures to determine paternity. Under the Act, a party may move that parents and the child or children submit to genetic testing if the motion is accompanied by a sworn affidavit alleging or denying paternity, and the DHR is allowed to order genetic tests when paternity has not been established. The Act creates a rebuttable presumption of paternity, which can be overcome by clear and convincing evidence, and allows for a temporary support order pending <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage.</b> It also directs the trier of fact to receive evidence of the cost of prenatal car, birth, and genetic testing without foundation or third-party testimony. Further, it provides that when both parents have signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity and the acknowledgment is recorded in the putative father registry, the acknowledgment constitutes a legal determination of paternity unless a parent rescinds within sixty days. Third, the Act makes extensive amendments and additions to the Child Support Recovery Act. It expands the duty to furnish information to DHR or its authorized contractors, concerning and obligor, to any entity in Georgia including profit, nonprofit, and governmental employers and provides for punishment for noncompliance with such request for information. Also expanded is the duty of all employers doing business in Georgia to report the hiring or rehiring of persons to the state support registry. The Act provides that the final administrative order for support shall have the safe effect as an order of a superior court and shall be enforceable. It also requires the IV-D Agency to provide all involved parties with notice and copies of orders. The Act provides the IV-D Agency with broad authority to identify, and file and perfect liens on an obligor 2 ̆ 7 s property, including real and tangible personal property as well as some intangible property. It also directs DHR to safeguard against the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain information. Further, the Act establishes the Department of Administrative Services Bank Math Registry, which will contain information only on obligors whom the IV-D Agency believes owe child support and are not under order, and those who are delinquent by one month or more. The Act specifies procedures to be used by the financial institutions, the IV-D Agency, and the Department of Administrative Services, and establishes punishment for noncooperative financial institutions. Through the Bank Match Registry, the IV-D Agency has the authority to identify, encumber, and/or seize account assets of delinquent obligors. Fourth, the Act provides that the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) be superseded by the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). UIFSA outlines jurisdictional procedures and rules when dealing with out-of-state judgments or parties. It provides extended jurisdiction and full faith and credit among and between the states as well as a method to determine which order is controlling when multiple orders have been issued with regard to an obligor and an obligee...|$|E
