Since its foundation, the University's academic life has been interrupted only twice: 1898 to 1899, during the Philippine revolution against Spain; and 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of Manila, when the University of Santo Tomas was transformed by the Japanese military into an <b>internment</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|E

As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst <b>Internment</b> <b>Camp</b> at Amherst, Nova Scotia.

This situation lasted until 18 September 1918, when the British and Greek Armies, {{under the command of}} General George Milne attacked in the Lake Doiran Sector. The Bulgarian Army—now in retreat—signed an armistice on 30 September 1918.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick {{was still}} in Germany {{at the start of}} the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben <b>internment</b> <b>camp</b> near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a {{laboratory}} in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of the Philippines, UPCA was closed and the campus converted into an <b>internment</b> <b>camp</b> for allied nationals and a headquarters of the Japanese army. For three years, the college was {{home to more than}} 2,000 civilians, mostly Americans, that were captured by the Japanese. In 1945, as part of the liberation of the Philippines, the US Army sent 130 11th Airborne Division paratroopers to Los Baños to rescue the internees. Only four paratroopers and two Filipino guerrillas were killed in the raid. However, Japanese reinforcements arrived two days later, destroying UPCA facilities and killing some 1,500 Filipino civilians in Los Baños soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS {{ceased to}} exist. Numerous {{members of the}} SS, many of them still {{committed}} Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe. On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and using a false passport. At an <b>internment</b> <b>camp</b> near Lüneburg, he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule. Several other leading members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps. He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the International Military Tribunal in 1945–46.|$|E

50|$|In 1944, Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans {{expelled}} Axis {{forces from}} the region and village was included into new socialist Yugoslavia. For many reasons that historians are still uncertain and divided about, new Yugoslav authorities sent those Gakovo citizens who remained in the country into <b>internment</b> <b>camps</b> (Many Gakovo citizens, however, had left the country in 1944, following the defeated German Army). Gakovo {{was one of the}} sites of these post-World War II <b>internment</b> <b>camps</b> for the ethnic Germans (Danube Swabians) (See: List of concentration and <b>internment</b> <b>camps</b> - Yugoslavia). Gakovo and the nearby village of Kruševlje had at its maximum about 30,000 detainees, of whom 11 to 12 thousand died from starvation, cold and disease. <b>Internment</b> <b>camps</b> were abolished in 1948 and remaining Gakovo citizens were forced to work for two years as indentured slaves throughout Yugoslavia. In the next decades, most of them emigrated from the country. Memorials to the victims of the Gakovo prison camp have been erected within the town.|$|R
