5|$|In 1932, {{at the end}} of his five-year {{contract}} with the newspaper, Ponsford successfully applied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the staff of the Melbourne Cricket Club. He was appointed to an unspecified office job working for the club secretary Hugh Trumble, which required him to transfer his cricket and baseball allegiances from St Kilda to Melbourne. The Herald unsuccessfully tried to retain his services, and Keith Murdoch—the Editor-in-Chief of the Herald, and later, the father of Rupert Murdoch—visited the Ponsford home to lobby against the move. Ponsford's new role included managing the staffing arrangements and crowd control at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Australian rules football and cricket matches. In 1956, following the retirement of Vernon Ransford, Ponsford unsuccessfully applied for the position of club secretary, effectively its chief executive officer and one of the most prestigious positions in Australian cricket. However, in the event recently retired Test cricketer Ian Johnson was appointed to the position. Ponsford remained with the club until his retirement in June 1969.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Willie Stone is only six years old, but he yearns to be a fireman. He is much impressed with the parade of firemen he sees in his hometown, so much so in fact that he basely deserts his sister on the streets to follow the 'smoke eaters.' But Willie is only a little boy, and despite his enthusiasm, he is soon weary and footsore. His plight, added to his tears, attracts {{the attention of a}} kindly fireman who is driving with his engine back to quarters. The lad's discomfort is soon forgotten, for the fireman gives him a ride back to the engine house. There Willie gravely applies to the captain <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the uniformed force, and is jokingly accepted. But he does not see the humor in it and follows the other men to the bunkroom, where he takes part in their sports." ...|$|E

2500|$|The eight {{possible}} abbreviations <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> a compass, e.g., NNW (north-northwest) or ESE (east-southeast), {{occur with}} some frequency.

Alternatively, compass point answers are more frequently clued as [...] "XXX to YYY direction", where XXX and YYY are two place names. For example, SSW might be clued as [...] "New York to Washington DC dir". Similarly, a clue such as [...] "Right on the map" [...] means EAST. A clue could also consist of objects that point a direction, e.g., [...] "vane dir." [...] or [...] "windsock dir.".|$|E

I saw him {{on the campaign trail}} more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E
