25|$|Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto {{manufacturers}} in the U.S. typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation {{would have a}} Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track cartridge obsolete in <b>car</b> <b>installations</b> because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, {{as the cost of}} building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no manufacturer offered factory-installed cassette players.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the sport, cars would often collide with each other and become entangled, with malletmen {{frequently}} thrown from the <b>cars.</b> <b>Installation</b> of rollcages over the radiator and rear platforms of the cars helped prevent injuries to players, but falls did result in severe cuts and sometimes broken bones if players were run over by the cars, though deaths due to auto polo were rare. Most of the cars would usually be severely wrecked or demolished by the time the match was finished, leaving most players uninsurable for costly material and bodily damages incurred during the game. A tally of the damages encountered by Hankinson's British and American auto polo teams in 1924 revealed 1564 broken wheels, 538 burst tires, 66 broken axles, 10 cracked engines and six cars completely destroyed during the course of the year. The sport waned in popularity during the late 1920s, mostly due to the high cost of replacing vehicles, but did have a brief resurgence in the Midwestern United States after World War II.|$|R

50|$|A {{child safety}} seat (infant safety seat, child {{restraint}} system, child seat, baby seat, restraining car seat, car seat, etc.) is a seat {{designed specifically to}} protect children from injury or death during collisions. Most commonly these seats are purchased and installed by consumers, but car manufacturers may integrate them directly into their vehicle's design and generally are required to provide anchors and to ensure seat belt compatibility. Many jurisdictions require children defined by age, weight, and/or height to use a government-approved child safety seat when riding in a vehicle. Child safety seats provide passive restraints and must be properly used to be effective. However, research indicates many child safety restraints are often not used properly. To tackle this negative trend, health officials and child safety experts produce child safety videos to teach proper <b>car</b> seat <b>installation</b> to parents and caregivers.|$|R

Scope of the thesis was to {{investigate}} clean side duct and optimize it for compressor performance. After literature review work was narrowed down and focused on swirling airflow and its influence on turbocharger compressor performance from efficiency and NVH point of view. Throughout thesis work CFD simulations were used to design swirl generators and investigate swirl behaviour in the ducts. Then, flow bench experimental tests were done to validate CFD simulations and define best settings for swirl modelling. Finally, experimental tests were done in turbocharger test rig to investigate swirl influence on compressor performance. Thesis outcome was a set of guidelines for Air Induction System group, that covers swirl creation methods and swirl effect on compressor performance. Results showed that swirling motion can move compressor map improving surge or choke limit. In addition, small amounts of positive swirl can also improve compressor efficiency up to 0. 8 %...|$|R

The powertrain concept consists of a single-shaft engine with a ceramic inner shell for containment of hot gasses and support of twin regenerators. It uses a fixed-geometry, lean, premixed, prevaporized combustor, and a ceramic radial turbine rotor supported by an air-lubricated journal bearing.
