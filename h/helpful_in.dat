5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful. However, {{the vast majority of}} mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> another.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings may be <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E

5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} are <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> {{the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of a biopsy is often helpful {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} amphibians {{evolved in}} the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.|$|E

5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} {{may have been}} particularly <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many enzyme inhibitors in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them digestible.|$|E
5|$|Weather ship {{observations}} {{proved to}} be <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> wind and wave studies, as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did not. They were also <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships' significant cost. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts {{leading up to the}} Great Storm of 1987. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M ("Mike"), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.|$|E
5|$|While {{the moment}} from {{gyroscopic}} forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} significant part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> motorcycle racing.|$|E

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> identification.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E

5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can {{be shown to be}} uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E
5|$|The day Cariappa {{took over}} the reins of the Indian Army, 15 January 1949, was marked as {{official}} Army Day and celebrated annually. As {{the chief of the}} Army, Cariappa was instrumental {{in the formation of the}} Territorial Army in 1949. Though the National Cadet Corps had been already formed in 1948, it was Cariappa who extended support during its formative years. These two complimentary branches of the Army later proved to be very <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> the wars India fought in later years.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to display {{information}} quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|While the North and South {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geo{{magnetic poles}} leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant may be <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E
