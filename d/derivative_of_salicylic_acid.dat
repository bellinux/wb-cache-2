In this paper, synthesis and characterization of the ternary copper(II) complexes of neocuproine (2, 9 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline, Neo) and salicylate ligands (Sal) are reported. In addition, the crystal structures of ([Cu(H 2 O) (5 -Cl-Sal) (Neo) ] (1), [Cu(μ-Sal) (Neo) ] 2 (2), Cu 2 (μ- 5 -Cl-Sal) (5 -Cl-HSal) 2 (Neo) 2]·EtOH (3)) were determined. In order to compare structural and biological properties of the prepared complexes, spectroscopic and biological studies were performed. Results of X-ray diffraction show that prepared complexes form three types of crystal structures in a given system: monomeric, dimeric and dinuclear complex. The preliminary study on the DNA cleavage activity has shown that the complexes under study behave as the chemical nucleases in the presence of added hydrogen peroxide with slight differences in the activity (1 > 2 > 3). The complexes 1 and 2 exhibited nuclease activity itself indicating the interaction of complexes with the DNA. It has been proposed that the enhanced destructive effect of the complexes 1 and 2 on the DNA is a result of two possible mechanisms of action: (i) the conversion of closed circular DNA (form I) to the nicked DNA (form II) caused by the copper complex itself and (ii) damage of DNA by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) —products of the interaction of copper with hydrogen peroxide by means of Fenton reaction (hydroxyl radicals). Thus the biological activity of the prepared Cu(II) complexes containing <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and phenanthroline molecules is substantiated by two independent mechanisms. While <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acids</b> in the coordination sphere of copper complexes are responsible for radical-scavenging activity (predominantly towards superoxide radical anion), the presence of chelating ligand 2, 9 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline significantly enhances capability of Cu(II) complexes binding to DNA via intercalation...|$|R

A chemical <b>derivative</b> <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> aspirin, was synthesised and mass produced {{by the end of the}} 19 th century and is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. Its cardioprotective properties are well established; however, recent evidence shows that it can also act as a chemopreventive agent. Its antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions occur through the inhibition of cyclooxygenases. The precise mechanisms leading to its anticancer effects are not clearly established, although multiple mechanisms affecting enzyme activity, transcription factors, cellular signalling and mitochondrial functions have been proposed. This review presents a brief account of the major COX-dependent and independent pathways described in connection with aspirin’s anticancer effects. Aspirin’s unique ability to acetylate biomolecules besides COX has not been thoroughly investigated nor have all the targets of its primary metabolite, salicylic acid been identified. Recent reports on the ability of aspirin to acetylate multiple cellular proteins warrant a comprehensive study to investigate the role of this posttranslational modification in its anticancer effects. In this review, we also raise the intriguing possibility that aspirin may interact and acetylate cellular molecules such as RNA, and metabolites such as CoA, leading to a change in their function. Research in this area will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of this drug. The common household drug, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has been around for more than a century.

Crystal engineering has the major purpose to understand the intermolecular interactions and principle of packing in molecular crystals and also helps in the deliberate design of novel materials with NLO application targeted structures and properties. The hydrogen bonding ability helps to modification of the chemical compounds changes the optical properties of corresponding crystals. The lack of boundless π-electron delocalization, moderate optical nonlinearity, low optical transparency, and low laser damage threshold are the major limitations in organic nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In order to beat the above shortcomings, some new class of crystals such as semi-organic crystals have been developed. The coordination ability of organic acids towards the metal ions is currently of great significance, due to their usage in the materials research for optical and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties [1 - 2]. To achieve such goal, we have selected a <b>derivative</b> <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> proton-transfer compounds of 5 -sulfosalicylic acid, to explore its structural diversities and interesting topologies [3]. 5 -sulfosalicylicacid (5 SSA) is an attractive ligand, possessing three substituent groups such as the sulfonic acid (SO 3 H), the carboxylic acid (COOH) and the phenolic groups (OH). The presence of the numerous oxygen atoms in three substituent groups usually results in hydrogen-bonding associations, and it can form mono, di and tri anionic ligand species through deprotonation, also the structures having significant interlayer π-π interactions between the cationic and anionic species [4].

The short-term ulcerogenic in vitro and in vivo anti-platelet properties, pharmacodynamic profiles, and extent of hepatic extraction of these phenolic esters were compared with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). The more lipophilic esters (longer carbon chain length in O-acyl group) show significantly less gastrotoxicity in stressed rats than does aspirin after a single oral dose. The in vitro and in vivo anti-platelet studies show that these phenolic esters inhibited (1) arachidonate-triggered human platelet aggregation and (2) thrombin-stimulated rat serum thromboxane Ag production by platelets in the clotting process almost as effectively as aspirin. The hepatic extractions <b>of</b> these O-acyl <b>derivatives</b> are significantly higher than those of aspirin.

After alkaline hydrolysis, both fractions from elicited cells showed a greatly increased content of 4 -coumaric, ferulic, and 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, as well as 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde and vanillin. Two minor peaks were identified as tyrosol and methoxytyrosol. The pretreatment effect is most pronounced at a low elicitor concentration. Its specificity was elaborated for coumarin secretion. When the parsley suspension cultures were preincubated for 1 d with 2, 6 -dichloroisonicotinic, 4 - or 5 -chlorosalicylic, or 3, 5 - dichlorosalicylic acid, the cells exhibited a greatly increased elicitor response. Pretreatment with isonicotinic, salicylic, acetylsalicylic, or 2, 6 -dihydroxybenzoic acid was less efficient in enhancing the response, and some other isomers were inactive. This increase in elicitor response was also observed for the above-mentioned monomeric phenolics, which were liberated from cell walls upon alkaline hydrolysis and for "lignin-like" cell wall polymers determined by the thioglycolic acid method. It was shown for 5 -chlorosalicylic acid that conditioning most likely improves the signal transduction leading to the activation of genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase and 4 -coumarate: coenzyme A ligase. The conditioning thus sensitizes the parsley suspension cells to respond to lower elicitor concentrations.

40|$|Preliminary {{successes in}} the {{development}} of biologically active synthetic polymers have demonstrated a need for {{a deeper understanding of the}} interactions between soluble synthetic polymers and biological molecules or biological surfaces. For example, we have shown that some polymeric <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> exhibit antibacterial activity specifically against Gram-negative strains, while the low molecular weight analogues are non-specific. A plausible interpretation of this result is that polymerization produces an antibacterial,agent which is highly hydrophobic, and which therefore interacts more strongly with the lipid-rich wall of the Gram-negative cell than with the lipid-poor wall of the Gram-positive cell. Unfortunately, there exists in the literature very little, if any, information which one can use to assess this idea; virtually nothing is known about the nature and magnitude of the interactions of soluble synthetic polymers with cell surfaces. The situation is quite different with natural polymers: intense study of natural macromolecules such as insulin, bacterial toxins and various plant and animal lectins has in some cases yielded quite thorough understanding of their cell-surface interactions. The objective of our work in this area is to bring the understanding of synthetic polymer-membrane interactions to a comparable level. Using prior work on natural polymers as a guide, we have undertaken experiments of three kinds: i) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which allows one to observe structural changes in the membrane which result from interaction with a polymeric solute, ii) cell agglutination (aggregation) measurements, which allow a rapid assessment of the magnitude of interaction and which can identify specific binding sites, and iii) direct binding (adsorption) measurements using radiolabelled synthetic polymers. In all of these experiments, we are using human red blood cells (erythrocytes), or red cell "ghosts" prepared by hypotonic hemolysis; that is, we have selected the human red cell membrane as a model natural membrane. This selection was based on three factors: i) the erythrocyte membrane is readily isolated, ii) calorimetry has been used previously to investigate the interaction of small molecules with erythrocyte and iii) systemic use of polymeric drugs can produce undesirable side effects which may be related to interaction with the red blood cell. The present paper demonstrates the use of high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry in the study of the interaction of synthetic polymers with cell surfaces...|$|R

We synthesized some diorganotin 2, 6 -pyridinedicarboxylates. The dimethyltin compound has been found inactive in vitro, whereas the di-n-butyltin, di-t-butyltin and diphenyltin compounds were found more active than cisplatin(2). In order to increase the water-solubility <b>of</b> these diorganotin <b>derivatives,</b> which might be a way to increase the antitumour activity following Atassi(4), we converted them(5) into their tetraethylammonium halide adducts. o 0 + Et 4 N(*) X(’) 0 oINEt 4 (+) X The in vitro antitumour activity of the tetraethylammonium halide adducts of these diorganotin 2, 6 pyridine dicarboxylates (see table 11) (5) is not better than that of the parent molecules, even if their solubility in protic and also in less polar solvents is considerably enhanced.

40|$|Seven 3 -hydroxy- 4 -pyridinecarboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>derivatives</b> (HPs), aza-analogues <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{structurally}} {{close to}} other potent inflammatory pyridine compounds such as aminopyridinylmethanols and aminopyridinamines, were synthesized, and their anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated. The synthesis {{was performed by}} adopting a general procedure involving an intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition of oxazoles with acrylic acid to form various substituted pyridinic acids. The newly synthesized HPs did not exhibit cytotoxic activity on human monocytes-derived macrophages at concentrations up to 102 M. Anti-inflammatory activity of the compounds was screened in vitro by evaluating the capability to inhibit cytokines release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated human macrophages. 3 -hydroxy- 1 -methyl- 4 -pyridinecarboxylic acid (24) {{was found to be}} the most active HP. At 10 M concentration, HP 24 reduced LPS-induced and nuclear factor-kB activation and cyclooxygenase- 2 expression, while increased intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) mRNA transcript level. Indeed, pre-treatment of LPS-exposed human macrophages with PPAR-γ specific antagonist completely prevented HP 24 -induced TNF- and IL 8 down-regulation, demonstrating that the PPARγ pathway is mandatory for the HP 24 anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, daily treatment with HP 24 ameliorated the outcome of DSS-induced colitis in mice, significantly reducing colonic MPO activity and IL- 1  tissue levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{esterification}} <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> with methanol {{was carried}} out over a series of Ce 4 +modified cation-exchange resins. The effect of different reaction conditions was studied on the conversion <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the optimal reaction parameters were obtained. The experimental results indicated that Ce(SC&# 094;A) Olx 7 was an effective catalyst for the synthesis of methyl salicylate. The conversion <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> could reach 93. 3 % while its selectivity was more than 99. 0 %.

40|$|We have {{recently}} purified calorigen, the natural trigger for heat {{production in the}} inflorescences of Sauromatum guttatum Schott (voodoo lily), a thermogenic plant, and identified it as <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Since then an analytical assay was developed that allows the quantitation <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in plant tissues. This assay was used to demonstrate that on the day preceding the day of blooming the levels <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in the thermogenic organs (appendix and lower spadix) of the voodoo lily increased almost 100 -fold, reaching a level of 1 μg/g of fresh weight. The level <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in the appendix started to rise {{in the afternoon and}} reached its maximum in the late evening, whereas the maximum accumulation <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in the lower spadix occurred late at night. The increase in <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> level in the appendix was followed the next morning by a spectacular metabolic burst that lasted for about 7 hr and at its peak increased the appendix temperature by over 12 °C. The second, 14 -hr-long, thermogenic episode in the lower spadix started late at night and ended on the following morning, after maximum temperature increases of more than 10 °C. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in both thermogenic tissues promptly returned to basal, preblooming levels {{at the end of the}} thermogenic periods. The thermogenic response was under strong photoperiodic and developmental control, with <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> eliciting much stronger thermogenic responses in light than in darkness. Similar surges in <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> occurred in nonthermogenic male and female flowers, while the concentration <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in the spathe remained consistently below 20 ng/g of fresh weight. Of 33 analogs <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> tested, only 2, 6 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were thermogenic.

Factors were two petunia varieties (Sonja pink and an Iranian variety), two irrigation levels (70 and 40 percent of FC) and three <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> doses (0, 1 and 2 mM). There were significant differences between varieties in response to different irrigation levels and <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> doses. Flower number per plant, flower diameter, leaf area, shoot and root dry weight, biomass, chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance decreased by higher drought level.

Introduction of pchBA into CHA 0 increased the production <b>of</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in vitro and in the rhizosphere of tobacco, but did not improve the ability of CHA 0 to induce systemic resistance in tobacco.
