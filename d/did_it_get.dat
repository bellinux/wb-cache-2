United States, 446 U.S. 156 (1980), the US Supreme Court {{ruled on}} the city's {{argument}} that the Attorney General had acted incorrectly in failing to approve the city's changes to its election system and its annexations.

By Evolution or by Creation? is {{criticized for}} its {{dependency}} on Francis Hitching, who is cited thirteen times. The book presents Hitching—a TV writer and paranormalist with no scientific credentials—as an evolutionary scientist. Richard Dawkins also criticizes {{the book for}} implying that [...] "chance" [...] is the only alternative to deliberate design, stating, [...] "he candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and natural selection." ...|$|E

[...] The song becomes brasher and brassier, {{and more and more}} articles of clothing come off. Ultimately, Louise becomes a major burlesque star and does not need her mother any longer. After a bitter argument between Rose and Louise, who has become the sophisticated [...] "Gypsy Rose Lee," [...] Rose realizes Herbie and June are both gone, and now Louise is lost to her as well. Rose, feeling sad, useless and bitter, asks [...] "Why did I do it? What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> me?" [...] ("Rose's Turn"). All of Rose's unrequited dreams of her own stardom and her personal demons surface. She fantasizes about her own lit-up runway and cheering audience, but finally admits [...] "I did it for me." [...] After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively step toward reconciliation in the end.|$|E
