40|$|This study {{examined}} the disciplinary behaviors displayed at secondary education institutions located in Turkey and the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments</b> imposed for those behaviors. The study made an attempt to reveal how <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments</b> imposed at high schools were distributed by different variables and whether those punishments varied by year, school type, gender, grade, and province. That was a historical study because it focused on six semesters between the years 2006 and 2009. That was also a descriptive quantitative study as it revealed the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments</b> imposed at the above-mentioned schools. Research data were analyzed via SPSS package.

In addition, teachers impose punishments, which should normally be inflicted in the last resort, in the first place.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the rewards and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments</b> received by secondary teachers in schools operating under the Ministry of National Education in Turkey. Data were collected from personnel cards of the relevant general directorates within the Ministry of National Education. Data were reduced to frequency counts and percentages for further analysis. Differences in socio-political environments may account for findings that: (1) teachers received a greater number of punishments than rewards during the period under examination (1982 through 1986), and (2) <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments</b> occurred more frequently in the most and 'least developed regions of the country. Further reflection suggested that punishments may be used more frequently than rewards because punishments rather than rewards have been historically emphasized in the teaching profession; because the criteria for rewarding teachers remains ambiguous; because rewarding is not used systematically to motivate, convince or influence teachers for educational effectiveness; and because the objective and policies of the educational system continue to remain too abstract to be used as criteria for teacher achievement.

Military drummers were also employed on the parade field, when troops passed in review, and in various ceremonies including ominous drum rolls accompanying <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments.</b> Children also served as drummer boys well into the nineteenth century, though less commonly than is popularly assumed; due to the nature of the job, experienced older men were preferred.|$|R

50|$|If the {{military}} person {{is no longer}} in service, the summary disciplinary procedure cannot be used and {{the military}} has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue. In such cases, the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members. In sentencing, disciplinary punishments cannot be used. Instead if a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishment,</b> an ordinary day-fine is sentenced. Typically, this is the case when a reservist is absent from an obligatory refresher exercise or a conscript is, after the commission of crime, declared unfit for duty for medical or security reasons.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other crimes, the {{military}} crimes have separate sentence ranges {{for peace and}} wartime.

For example, desertion carries, in the peacetime, a sentence of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishment</b> or up to one year in prison. During wartime, it carries a mandatory prison sentence of not more than four years, and, if the crime caused a particularly immediate danger to the unit, a mandatory minimum of one year, with a maximum sentence of ten years.|$|E

If the SPSU problems related to the conditions of the prisoners, medical care, release on parole, <b>disciplinary</b> <b>punishments</b> etc. become known to the public from the direct source of information, i.e. through regular visits of penitentiary institutions by civil society activists, then public at large will be aware of these problems and eager to resolve them. Next, public and authorities could join their efforts in seeking the ways for addressing the said problems. In practice, however, the openness of penitentiary institutions’ system is only declared by the SPSU that claims that it is ready for the humanitarian changes and adherence to human rights, while in fact it is not implemented. The broader the opportunities and competences of public activists in visiting the penitentiary institutions, the better is constructive dialogue and cooperation.|$|R
