Extremely high levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2. 5 μm or less (PM 2. 5) with dominant components of sulfate and nitrate are responsible for the haze pollution. Although <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> is thought {{to play an important role}} in the production of sulfate and nitrate during haze episodes, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the effect of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> on haze formation in China by using the 3 -D models due to of a lack of treatments for heterogeneous reactions in most climate and chemical transport models. In this work, the WRF-CMAQ model with newly added heterogeneous reactions is applied to East Asia to evaluate the impacts of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> and the meteorological anomaly during January 2013 on regional haze formation. As the parameterization of heterogeneous reactions on different types of particles is not well established yet, we arbitrarily selected the uptake coefficients from reactions on dust particles and then conducted several sensitivity runs to find the value that can best match observations. The revised CMAQ with <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> not only captures the magnitude and temporal variation of sulfate and nitrate, but also reproduces the enhancement of relative contribution of sulfate and nitrate to PM 2. 5 mass from clean days to polluted haze days.

40|$|The current thesis {{presents}} a detailed modelling {{study of the}} selective oxidation of ethane over noble metal coated surfaces in short contact time reactors. Computational studies were performed featuring heated gas streams flowing through ceramic-foam catalysts coated with platinum and followed by a long inert section. The detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms, with coupled surface and gas-phase chemical reactions, were explored via extensive reaction path and sensitivity analyses to assess the relative contributions of the homogeneous and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistries</b> and to establish the key heterogeneous pathways driving the chemical processes. A comprehensively validated detailed chemical mechanism {{was used for the}} gas phase. The mechanism initially featured 44 chemical species and 271 reversible reactions and was later extended to 176 reactants with 993 reversible reactions. Heterogeneous models describing the surface chemistry were derived on the basis of classical kinetic collision theory and with energy barriers obtained from Density Functional Theory studies combined with the Unity Bond Index-Quadratic Exponential Potential method. The derived surface mechanisms account for differences in site occupation and surface bonding types and include four reaction classes (direct adsorption, adsorption on an adsorbate, surface reactions with adsorbed reactants and uni-molecular surface reactions including desorption) via 35 adsorbed chemical species and 284 reversible reactions. The complete chemistry was thoroughly evaluated by comparison with multiple sets of existing and new experimental data provided by industrial partners. Key modelling parameters in the process, such as streams velocities, temperature profiles, catalyst loading and pressure were critically examined. The reaction dynamics were validated with C 2 H 6 /O 2 /H 2 mixtures with different initial hydrogen contents and with oxygen to carbon weight ratios ranging between 0. 25 and 0. 9.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{reactions}} in the Antarctic stratosphere are {{the cause of}} chlorine activation and ozone depletion, but the relative roles {{of different types of}} polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in chlorine activation is an open question. We use multi-year simulations of the chemistry-climate model ECHAM 5 /MESSy for Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) to investigate the impact that the various types of PSCs have on Antarctic chlorine activation and ozone loss. One standard and three sensitivity EMAC simulations have been performed. In all simulations a Newtonian relaxation technique using the ERA-Interim reanalysis was applied to simulate realistic synoptic conditions. In the three sensitivity simulations, we only changed the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> on PSC particles by switching the chemistry on liquid, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and ice particles on and off. The results of these simulations show that the significance of heterogeneous reactions on NAT and ice particles for chlorine activation and ozone depletion in Antarctic winter and spring is small in comparison to the significance of heterogeneous reactions on liquid particles. Liquid particles alone are sufficient to activate almost all of the available chlorine, {{with the exception of the}} upper PSC regions between 10 and 30 hPa, where temporarily ice particles show a relevant contribution. Shortly after the first PSC occurrence, NAT particles contribute a small fraction to chlorine activation. <b>Heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> on liquid particles is responsible for more than 90 % of the ozone depletion in Antarctic spring in the model simulations.

40|$|The {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo produced the largest loading of stratospheric sulphate aerosol {{in the twentieth}} century. This heated the tropical lower stratosphere, affecting stratospheric circulation, and provided enhanced surface area for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry.</b> These factors combined to produce record low values of "global" total ozone column. Though well studied, there remains some uncertainty about the attribution of this low ozone, with contributions from both chemical and dynamical effects. We take a complementary approach to previous studies, nudging the potential temperature and horizontal winds in the new UKCA chemistry climate model to reproduce the atmospheric response and assess the impact on global total ozone. We then combine model runs and observations to distinguish between chemical and dynamical effects. To estimate the effects of increased <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> on ozone we compare runs with volcanically enhanced and background surface aerosol density. The modelled depletion of global ozone peaks at about 7 DU in early 1993, in good agreement with values obtained from observations. We subtract the modelled aerosol induced ozone loss from the observed ozone record and attribute the remaining variability to `dynamical' effects. The remaining variability {{is dominated by the}} QBO. We also examine tropical and mid-latitude ozone, diagnosing contributions from El Niño in the tropics and identifying dynamically driven low ozone in northern mid-latitudes, which we interpret as possible evidence of changes in the QBO.
