5|$|A mutant who is {{the field}} leader of the X-Men and a teacher at Xavier's Institute, he shoots {{uncontrollable}} beams of concussive force <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and wears a visor to control them. Cyclops is captured and brainwashed by Stryker. He is engaged to Jean.|$|E
5|$|A mutant who is Xavier's second-in-command and the X-Men's field leader, {{as well as}} an {{instructor}} at the Institute. He is engaged to Jean Grey. His powers include a strong red beam of force shooting <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> which is only held in check by sunglasses or a specialized ruby-quartz visor, which also enables him to control the strength of the beam to fire when in combat.|$|E
5|$|With this decision, {{development}} proceeded swiftly. The team quickly {{decided the}} setting would be islands in an ocean, determining {{it would provide}} interesting visuals and mechanics in the cel-shaded style. This in turn inspired the central sailing feature. Some features drew skepticism; for instance producers Miyamoto and Tezuka requested {{an explanation for the}} characters' exaggeratedly large eyes. The team jokingly suggested having Link shoot beams <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> before deciding to have him focus his gaze on significant objects nearby, giving hints to observant players about what to do next.|$|E
50|$|Psyklop has {{a single}} {{compound}} eye, like all members of his race. He can fire energy blasts <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> and <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> allows him to instantaneously hypnotize a victim through beams of light <b>from</b> <b>his</b> single <b>eye.</b>|$|R

5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
25|$|Round 3 – Ptolomaea: {{the third}} region of Cocytus {{is named after}} Ptolemy, who invited his {{father-in-law}} Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark Atropos has cut their thread"). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, Bolgia 5) and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice ("And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness").|$|E
500|$|A mutant, who is X-Men's field leader, Cyclops emits {{powerful}} energy blasts <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and must}} wear specially made glasses {{to prevent the}} destruction of anything he looks at. Although {{he is in a}} committed relationship with Jean Grey, her Phoenix persona kills him early in the film. Marsden saw no problem in having a smaller role, as the films opted to feature Wolverine as the standpoint character, and feeling that [...] "it's difficult when you have however many new characters that you're trying to introduce to an audience in 90 to 120 minutes, to give everyone their due." ...|$|E

500|$|In chapter 38, High {{says that}} there are many men in Valhalla, and many more who will arrive, yet they will [...] "seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] In chapter 51, High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnarök, after Fenrir's son Sköll has {{swallowed}} the sun and [...] his other son Hati Hróðvitnisson has swallowed the moon, the stars will disappear from the sky. The earth will shake violently, trees will be uprooted, mountains will fall, and all binds will snap – Fenrisúlfr will be free. Fenrisúlfr will go forth with his mouth opened wide, his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw the earth, and flames will burn <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and nostrils. Later, Fenrisúlfr will arrive at the field Vígríðr with his sibling Jörmungandr. With the forces assembled there, an immense battle will take place. During this, Odin will ride to fight Fenrisúlfr. During the battle, Fenrisúlfr will eventually swallow Odin, killing him, and Odin's son Víðarr will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf. This foot will bear a legendary shoe [...] "for which the material has been collected throughout all time." [...] With one hand, Víðarr will take hold of the wolf's upper jaw and tear apart his mouth, killing Fenrisúlfr. High follows this prose description by citing various quotes from Völuspá in support, some of which mention Fenrir.|$|E
2500|$|Count Dracula {{appears as}} a villain on Super Friends in an episode {{entitled}} [...] "Attack of the Vampire", originally released on October 14, 1978. In the episode, Dracula arises and tries to turn the whole Earth's population into vampires. The Super Friends battle Dracula, who transforms Superman and the Wonder Twins into vampires. Instead of biting them, Dracula uses intense beams <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to transform his victims into vampires.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1977 {{animated}} {{version of}} The Hobbit, Smaug was voiced by Richard Boone. [...] In general, Smaug's {{design in the}} animated version is consistent with Tolkien's description, save for his face: for rather than the traditional reptilian look associated with dragons, Smaug's face in the animated version has distinctly cat-like features including fur, enlarged ears, and canine teeth. His hypnotic speech is absent, but his acute eyesight is portrayed by highbeam-like lights projected <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Any {{person who}} wished to join the Katipunan was {{subjected}} to certain initiation rites, resembling those of Masonic rites, to test his courage, patriotism, and loyalty. New recruits underwent the initiation rite three at a time so that no member knew more than two {{other members of the}} society. The neophyte was first blindfolded and then led into a dimly lighted room with black curtains where his folded cloth was removed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> An admonition, in Tagalog, was posted {{at the entrance to the}} room: ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Liston's {{attempts}} {{to knock out}} a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by TKO. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed {{to the edge of}} the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: [...] "Eat your words!" [...] He added, [...] "I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{memories}} of Svetlana Aliluyeva, Chiaureli approached her father with the idea to combine the fate of his son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, in the plot. Stalin promptly rejected this. Soviet actor Artyom Karapetian claimed Chiaureli's wife, actress Veriko Anjaparidze, told him Stalin was so outraged when he heard of this that Lavrentiy Beria – who was standing nearby – [...] reached into his trousers' pocket, [...] "presumably, for his gun." [...] The director's daughter, Sofiko Chiaureli, recounted that her father [...] "knew he was saved" [...] when Stalin wiped tears <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he watched Gelovani descend from the plane and muttered [...] "If only I had gone to Berlin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fawell, under {{pressure}} from prosecutors, became a key witness against Ryan and Warner. He agreed to a plea deal that cut the prison time {{for himself and his}} fiancee, Andrea Coutretsis. Fawell was a controversial witness, not hiding his disdain for prosecutors from the witness stand. According to CBS Chicago political editor Mike Flannery, insiders claimed that Fawell had been [...] "much like a son" [...] to the former governor throughout their careers. At Ryan's trial, Fawell acknowledged that the prosecution had his [...] "head in a vise", and that he found his cooperation with the government against Ryan [...] "the most distasteful thing I've ever done". Nonetheless, he spent several days on the witness stand testifying against Ryan and Warner. Fawell, once a tough-talking political strategist, wept on the witness stand as he acknowledged that his motivation for testifying was to spare Coutretsis a long prison sentence for her role in the conspiracy. The jury was twice sent out of the courtroom so that Fawell could wipe tears <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and regain his composure.|$|E
