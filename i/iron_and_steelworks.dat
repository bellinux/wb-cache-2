5000|$|In 1917 {{building}} {{began to}} house the workmen of the Dorman Long <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> which was founded by Sir Arthur John Dorman. Previous to this the only house in Dormanstown was Westfield House. The first 300 houses built were designed by the architects Stanley Davenport Adshead (1868-1946), Stanley Ramsey(1882-1968), and Professor Patrick Abercrombie (1879-1957) and were designed and laid out as a Garden Village. A railway track was laid where Ennis Road now stands, and was used to bring materials from Dorman Long <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> to build the houses.|$|E
50|$|Dorlonco {{houses are}} steel framed houses {{designed}} by Adshead, Ramsey and Abercrombie and built using steel {{produced by the}} Dorman Long <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks.</b> They were neo-Georgian in style. The first of the Dorlonco houses were built in Dormanstown (1919) to house the Dormon Long Steelworkers and were demolished in the year 1979.|$|E
50|$|The {{mining area}} around Kiruna and Malmberget <b>and</b> the <b>iron</b> port <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> at Luleå made Norrbotten County {{one of the}} first, and most prominent, regions of heavy {{industry}} in Sweden, and the wider region has remained {{at the forefront of}} mining and steel smelting and alloying technology.|$|R
5000|$|T414: Built in November 1956 as DE02 for BHP, {{was used}} at their <b>Iron</b> Knob <b>and</b> Whyalla <b>Steelworks.</b> Was not {{included}} in Morrison-Knudsen rebuild program {{like the rest of}} the class. In 2006 it was sold to SCT Logistics and rebuilt with a cab similar to those on the fourth and fifth generation Ts, and renumbered T414.|$|R
25|$|Wollongong has a {{distinctly}} multicultural population. Many migrants {{were attracted to}} the area by the job opportunities at the Port Kembla steelworks in the post-war period, and settled in surrounding suburbs such as Cringila, Warrawong and Coniston. By 1966 about 60% of the wage earners at the Australian <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> Steel <b>steelworks</b> were born overseas coming from over 70 countries. These included British, Macedonians, Portuguese, Greeks, Bosnians, Croatians, Serbians, Germans, Turks, and Chileans. With {{the end of the}} White Australia policy these were followed by Indo-Chinese refugees in the 1970s, Indians, Filipinos, Chinese, Malays and Pacific Islanders in the 1980s and 1990s. The university continues to attract students and staff from all over the world, with around 5,000 overseas student enrolments.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} sculptures in Barrow commemorating the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks,</b> {{the largest of}} which resembles a large book {{describing}} {{the history of the}} works on Duke Street. Two sculptures of steelworkers {{can be found at the}} centre of Dalton Road and 'Red Man's Way' - a coastal path alongside the Walney Channel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} of Dormanstown Village {{was completed in}} 1920 and had enough housing for 342 families. Three of the streets were named after the architects (Adshead, Ramsey and Abercrombie). Dormanstown Village was built because of the increased amount of labour needed in Dorman Long <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> to manufacture munitions for the UK in World War I.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1950s, when the Liujia Gorge Dam and {{hydroelectric}} project came into operation in neighboring Gansu province, Xining {{has been linked}} by a high-tension electrical grid to both Liujia and Lanzhou. It also uses local coal from mines at Datongxian to the north. A modern woollen mill was installed at Xining before 1957. The city also has a leather industry and is a market for salt from the Qaidam region. During the late 1950s medium-sized <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> were built there, supplying metal to Lanzhou.|$|E

50|$|Named {{after and}} {{built by the}} Dorman Long <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> in the 20th century, the area was {{originally}} built on the doorstep of the popular seaside town Redcar, for Dorman's hundreds of steel workers and their families. The company built the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the steelworks was for some time considered {{the best in the}} world. The workers were well looked after by Dorman and it brought new opportunities and wealth {{for the people of the}} area. Dormanstown is also the site of Arriva North East's main bus depot for the Redcar area.|$|E
50|$|An early diesel {{built in}} the 1950s, Consett <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>Steelworks</b> No.10 is the last example of {{in-house}} production of locomotives by industrial railways in the North East. It was conceived in their Templetown workshops to satisfy {{a need for a}} 300 hp shunter with mechanical transmission, and was based on a Hunslet design. It was built by reusing many parts from steam locomotives. Eventually redundant to Sentinel's with hydraulic transmission, it was donated in 1976 to the Tyne and wear Museums Service by the work's later owner, the British Steel Corporation. No.10 is operational, however is not frequently used.|$|E

50|$|Only {{the main}} {{entrance}} arch remains, this was re-constructed in {{a different part of}} the works in 1987,and is currently occupied by Stagecoach Buses. The rest of the site is now being occupied by a number of industrial parks and the campus of Furness College. Despite this, Barrow's infamous 'Slag bank' is a lasting reminder of the town's industrial past. The slag bank contains over a century's worth of waste from the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> which was dumped in north Hindpool, adjacent to Walney Channel. Since the 1990's, an ongoing scheme has been reclaiming the derelict and contaminated land by laying soil on top of the heap.|$|E
50|$|The Austrian {{national}} government carefully persuaded the Americans to save Linz. In {{the summer of}} 1946, when allied negotiations on Linz reached a stalemate, the Americans decided to restore Linz unilaterally, regardless of British or Soviet opinion. Tactics of reconstruction became a subject of a debate between the Department of State, which advocated nationalization, and the U. S. Army, represented by Mark W. Clark, who stood for privatization. The diplomats prevailed, and the Austrian government was allowed to nationalize the former German assets at will. The mills of Linz were nationalized in July 1946 as the VÖEST (Vereinigte Österreichische Eisen und Stahlwerke, United Austrian <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>Steelworks).</b>|$|E
50|$|All of {{the retail}} parks were built on former {{industrial}} land that during the early to mid-20th century {{played a major role}} in not only Barrow's but the entire country's economy. Hindpool Retail Park, alongside Craven Park stadium were built upon the site of the Barrow Jute Works which operated from 1870 to 1948. Cornerhouse Park and Cornmill Crossing were built on a site originally occupied by a cornmill and large interchange of the Furness Railway, while Hollywood Park was constructed on the southern perimeter of the former <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> which was operated by the Barrow Hematite Steel Company between 1859 and 1963 and was at one point the largest steelworks on earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{founding}} of Port Talbot <b>Steelworks</b> in 1902, <b>and</b> Margam <b>Steelworks</b> in 1916, was {{brought about by}} the need for <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel producers to now import both ore and fuel, enabling an upscaling in volumes of production and hence economies. Resultantly, iron ore imports through Port Talbot reached 300,000 tons per annum by 1930, and 3,000,000 tons per annum by 1960.|$|R

5000|$|Garnock Rugby Club {{plays on}} the Lochshore Playing fields, what {{was part of the}} old loch area, {{infilled}} by the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> in the 19th century. The club is an amateur rugby union club and currently plays in the Scottish National League Division 1. The club was formed in 1972 {{as the result of a}} merger of the Old Spierians and Dalry High School FP clubs. [...] This was a response to the amalgamation of feeder schools Spier's and Dalry High (along with Kilbirnie Central and Beith Academy) to form Garnock Academy, which happened around the same time. The Old Spierians club had been founded in the early years of the 20th century and joined the Scottish Rugby Union in 1911.|$|E
5000|$|Iron {{prospector}} Henry Schneider {{arrived in}} Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. In 1850 extensive hematite deposits were discovered of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. Schneider Hannay & Co. {{was founded in}} 1859 and was renamed the Barrow Hematite Steel Company in 1865. Officially registered on 1 April 1864, Sir James Ramsden acted as Managing Director and Josiah T. Smith became General Manager of the Barrow Hematite Steel Company. The Hindpool <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> were expanded to include ten blast furnaces and 18, 5-ton Bessemer converters by 1866, which were physically separated by the Furness Railway.|$|E
50|$|Built in 1914 by the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG (GBAG) {{to provide}} {{a link to the}} GBAG mines of Rheinelbe, Alma and Pluto as well as {{supplying}} the ironworks of 'Schalker group' with imported ore. Around the same time, and up to 1929 the industrial railway of Erzbahn was built, serving the Schalker and Bochum group <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks.</b> Between 1937 and 1968 Grimberg harbour was one of the major ports on the canal. In 1968 steel production {{at the southern end of}} the Erzbahn at Bochum ended, in 1982 the Schalker works closed - with this the use of the port for transport of iron ore ended. Such was the emphasis on iron ore that much of the port now stands empty, part of it nowadays is used for the processing of recycled materials for the building industry, as well as a storage facility.|$|E
50|$|From {{the former}} freight yard, the now {{dismantled}} railway sidings {{ran to the}} nearby firms of the Balcke-Dürr company and the Wilhelm Pulch foundry <b>and</b> <b>steelworks.</b> The former freight yard {{was replaced by a}} station parking area.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{anomalies}} {{detected in}} Britain by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) thermal alert system correspond mostly to industrial gas flares (at hydrocarbon installations <b>and</b> <b>steelworks)</b> <b>and</b> to fires in rural settings. Gas flares are also detected from several North Sea hydrocarbon production platforms. The {{effectiveness of the}} MODIS thermal alert system and its geolocational precision and accuracy is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of Port Talbot as an industrial centre started from {{the turn of}} the 20th century.

5000|$|Dowlais came to {{prominence}} in the 18th and 19th centuries because of its <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks.</b> By the mid 1840s there were between 5000 and 7000 men, women and children employed in the Dowlais works. During the early to mid 1800s the ironworks were operated by Sir John Josiah Guest and (from 1833) his wife Lady Charlotte Guest. Charlotte Guest introduced welfare schemes for the ironworkers. She provided for a church and a library. The school (dating from 1819) was improved and extended, becoming [...] "probably {{the most important and}} most progressive not only in the industrial history of South Wales, but of the whole of Britain". In the 1850s, after Sir John's death, the works became under the control of a board of trustees. In 1865 the Bessemer steel making process was introduced to Dowlais, with £33,000 being spent on a new steelworks. Steel production at Dowlais eventually ceased in 1936 due to the Great Depression, although the iron foundry continued until 1987.|$|E
50|$|In May 1643, Furness was {{occupied}} and plundered {{by a large}} Royalist force commanded by Richard Viscount Molyneux. Later that year they prepared to march to the relief of Thurland Castle in South Lonsdale, then besieged by Colonel Rigby, but Rigby took some of his men over the sands and met the Royalists at Lindal, where they were routed. The Parliamentarians looted the Dalton neighbourhood before retreating to Cartmel the same night. In 1644 the Royalists remained in control of Furness, though the country folk were hostile to them, and Parliament ships landed at Piel Island to aid in a rising. After a fight at Hawcoat the resistance was quashed, and the Parliament ships left for Liverpool. After collecting the king's rents, the Royalists left for Cartmel. After the Restoration of the monarchy, one Furness landowner, Colonel Sawry, attempted a rising.Iron had been mined in Furness since prehistory, and by the late 18th century ore was being exported from Barrow. The Furness Railway {{was built in the}} 19th century to cater to the increasing demand. <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> were established at Barrow, and the town's population grew from 325 in 1847 to 51,712 in 1891, surpassing Dalton's and Ulverston's. Mining in Furness reached its peak in 1882, when 1,408,693 tons of ore were won. At the same time, tourism in the Lake District increased, popularised in part by the work of John Ruskin and William Wordsworth.|$|E
5000|$|Puerto Ordaz (...) {{is a city}} in Bolívar State, Venezuela.Is a Venezuelan {{city that}} is in the west of the Municipality Caroní and that {{conforms}} next to San Felix what is called Ciudad Guayana. Puerto Ordaz is one of the Latin American cities best planned by the maximum criteria of urban organization. It is an ordered city of the Bolivar state, in the east of Venezuela. Founded in 1952 as a port of mining export {{on the banks of the}} Caroní River, at the point where it flows to the Orinoco River; Puerto Ordaz is home to mining and hydroelectric companies. Its airport serves as a link between the small airports in the jungle area of State Bolivar and the rest of the country. It lies south of the Orinoco, where the river is joined by the Caroní River. The city, officially founded in 1961, is actually composed of the old town of San Félix at the east and the new town of Puerto Ordaz (...) at the west, which lies on the confluence of the Caroní and Orinoco Rivers and is the site of the Llovizna Falls. There are bridges across the Caroni and a new bridge across the Orinoco (Second Orinoco crossing). The city stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco. With approximately one million people, it is Venezuela's fastest-growing city due to its important <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steelworks</b> and aluminium industries. The city has a large hydroelectric power plant, Macagua Dam. Guayana City is one of Venezuela's five most important ports, since most goods produced in Bolívar are shipped through it, onto the Atlantic Ocean via the Orinoco river. Due to its planned nature, the city has a drastically different feel to it than many other South American cities. The towers of the Alta Vista district recall Barranquilla, and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States in the 1950s, including 'cookie cutter' homes, sidewalks, and patterned lawns. This is an artifact due to the presence in the 1960s and early 1970s of US Steel, an American company with iron mining operations in the region. US Steel built housing for hundreds of its American expatriate workers and families, who lived in Puerto Ordaz and other communities until the nationalization of the Venezuelan steel industry forced the company and its workers to leave.|$|E
