5|$|After {{defeating}} Maxentius in 312, Constantine disbanded the Praetorian Guard, {{ending the}} latter's 300-year existence. Although the instant reason was the Guard's {{support for his}} rival Maxentius, a force based in Rome had also become obsolete since emperors now rarely resided there. The imperial escort role of the Guard's cavalry, the equites singulares Augusti, was now fulfilled by the scholae. These elite cavalry regiments existed {{by the time of}} Constantine and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> by Diocletian.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp and as an {{ecosystem}} for diverse species of birds and fish. Shrimp farms have been established inland to circumvent restrictions on the bay. The area close to shore is prone to flooding, and can sometimes accumulate large populations of mosquitos. As a consequence, no major settlements <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> on the bay. However, the small communities of Port Alto and Carancahua have been established on the western and eastern shores, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre.

The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After the suppression of the uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E

The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and during the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.|$|E

Top leadership in Student Government, Homecoming, and the most elite campus fraternal organizations, rank among its members.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Tibbers Castle is undocumented, {{and it may}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> in the 12th or 13th century as a timber castle.

5|$|This is {{the period}} from around 1500 to 1800. In the 1530s, the monasteries were {{dissolved}} and their lands bought from the king by various important families in Somerset. By 1539, Glastonbury Abbey was the only monastery left, its abbot Richard Whiting was then arrested and executed on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. From the Tudor to the Georgian times, farming specialised and techniques improved, leading to increases in population, although no new towns seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded.</b> Large country houses such as at Hinton St George and Montacute House were built at this time.|$|E
5|$|Drakri Hermitage (brag ri ri khrod), {{also known}} as Bari Hermitage (sba ri ri khrod) lies about three {{kilometres}} north and slightly east of downtown Lhasa. Drakri, believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> by the abbot of Pha bong kh in the 18th century, {{was used as a}} meditational retreat by Klong rdol bla ma ngag dbang blo bzang (1719–1794), one of the most renowned scholars of the Lhopa Regional House (Lho pa khang tshan) of the Jé College (Grwa tshang byes). Drakri Hermitage had control over Garu Nunnery since its early history and supervised the training of the Garu nuns until 1959. In 1959, the monks of the hermitage were evicted and the hermitage was turned into the notorious Drapchi Prison, which gained a reputation for being one of the most severe penal institutions run by the Chinese in Tibet.|$|E
5|$|The hermitage is {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> by Phrin las rgya mtsho (d. 1667), who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death. He was {{a student of the}} Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native Nyangbran and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a “site investigation” (sa brtag) to determine the most auspicious location on which to build the monastery. The Dalai Lama made the treasure (gter) discovery of the self-arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang’s lower temple. However, the initial hermitage fell into ruin and the official founding of the monastery is credited to Phrin las rgya mtsho's nephew, Sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, in around 1696.|$|E
