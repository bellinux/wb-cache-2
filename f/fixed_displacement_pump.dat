50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked pulleys, wheels or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a variable displacement pump and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} in auto-motive {{transmissions}} to provide pressurized fluid to various hydraulic components in the transmission and also lubricate the mechanical components. The output flow of these pumps increases with speed, almost linearly, but the flow requirements often saturate at higher speeds resulting in the excess flow draining back to the sump. This represents a parasitic loss in the transmission leading to a loss in fuel economy. To overcome this issue, variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have been used in}} the transmission, where the output flow is reduced by controlling the <b>displacement</b> of the <b>pump.</b> The use of these pumps in automatic transmissions, has resulted in better fuel economy as compared to some types of <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> However, the literature does not fully explore the benefits of variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> to a specific type of transmission namely, dual-clutch transmission, that has different pressure & flow requirements than an epicyclic gear-train. This paper presents an analysis on the effect of pump selection on fuel economy in a five speed dual clutch transmission of a commercial vehicle. Models of the engine, transmission & vehicle are developed along with the models of two different types of pumps: a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> gerotor <b>pump</b> and a variable <b>displacement</b> vane <b>pump.</b> The models are then parameterized using experimental data and the fuel economy of the vehicle is simulated on a standard driving cycle.

5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic <b>pumps</b> are positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> while hydrodynamic <b>pumps</b> can be <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted.

The model of the EHPV ™ is then compounded with the model of the hydraulic circuit. The resulting mathematical model for which the control design is targeted is found to be 6 th order. For such high order system, the control design was implemented using modern digital state space techniques, which include an integral controller and a deadbeat full order predictive observer.

40|$|Variable <b>displacement</b> vane <b>pumps</b> (VDVP) are {{one type}} of {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> used in automatic transmission vehicles for lubricating the gears, cooling the transmission and actuating the clutches. Though <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are widely used, they output a constant effective flow at a given speed. Depending on pump sizing considerations, the pump can be oversized at high speeds because flow demand of the transmission is independent of engine speed. The excess flow returns to the tank through an orifice that causes the oil to heat up, increasing the energy required for cooling and reducing {{the efficiency of the}} transmission. A VDVP is used because the effective flow is adjustable to meet transmission demands any speed. The VDVP studied in this paper is unstable because of a feedback loop between pressure fluctuations at the pump’s outlet and the control system. To design a better VDVP with increased stability and controllability, a simulation model of the current pump design needs to be validated against measurements. Therefore a test rig design with required pump modifications is proposed in this study. Six pressure sensors are installed such that they measure the pressure in each of the <b>pump’s</b> <b>displacement</b> chambers.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{precisely}} controlling {{the position of}} a hydraulic actuator using an on/off valve is developed. Since valves exhibit little power loss when they are fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is more efficient than throttling valve control and can achieve flow variation without the expense or bulk of a variable displacement pump. Mating a pulse-width-modulated (PWMed) on/off valve with a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a smoothing accumulator creates a software enabled variable displacement pump. A drawback of using digital valve control for hydraulic systems is that the relatively low speed of the currently available switching valves results in a significant ripple in the pressure and flow rate. We propose a solution to this problem by using a throttling valve to shield the actuator from the ripple in the output. This creates an effective load sensing system with the throttling valve used only to provide a small known pressure drop between the supply and the load. This approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional technique of using throttling to vary the full flow. This paper presents an averaged model of the system and a nonlinear controller to achieve position control of an actuator. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} {{on the use of}} <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> in {{parallel}} connection to control the velocity of a multi-chamber cylinder piston. The system’s basic principle was to combine the discrete flow supply control of parallel pumps with the discrete effective area control of a multi-chamber cylinder to produce a speed control resolution high enough for accurate velocity tracking and positioning. Some throttling was used in the return line to control the system with overrunning loads. The properties of the system were tested with a 1 -DOF boom mockup mimicking a medium-sized mobile machine boom. The test system revealed a feature that caused load acceleration to drop when the effective cylinder area was reduced during movement. Additionally, some delay was observed in accelerating the piston against the load force. These two system properties along with the discrete control method resulted in mediocre speed and position tracking in the system when movement was directed against the load force. The system was able to control restricting and overrunning loads as well as a large inertia mass with a low load force. The system’s energy losses were low considering that no pressure accumulators were used, but the throttling losses in the return line and the lack of energy recuperation leave room for improvement...|$|R

Energy saving in the {{electro-hydraulic}} system (EHS) {{that currently}} exists in most inverter used to adjust {{speed of the}} asynchronous motor (ASM) which drive a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> The most controller commonly used control system such as PID and multi-input single-output (MISO) fuzzy controller.

In the paper the transfer function that relates the pressure in the main gallery with the valve spool position is determined.

The experimental procedure used to measure the frequency response of the valve is also described. The test rig was provided with a servovalve used to generate a sinusoidal excitation pressure with variable frequency. The valve frequency response was evaluated by means of two pressure transducers at the two ends of the pilot channel.

40|$|The {{splash plate}} slurry {{spreader}} is inexpensive and robust {{but it is}} not environmentally friendly. It releases most of the ammonia (NH 3) in slurry, emits strong odours and distributes the remaining nutrients unevenly. The object of this report is to identify improvements to slurry spreaders that may eliminate these shortcomings. Several gases are released during and after slurry spreading. NH 3 contributes to acidification of the environment and is emitted almost entirely from agriculture. Over 30 % of European NH 3 emissions come from slurry spreading. The Gothenberg agreement (UNECE, 1999) requires a reduction in national NH 3 emission to 8 % below 1990 levels. Emission of this gas from band, TF (trailing foot) and injector slurry spreaders is 40, 40 and 20 % respectively of that from conventional splash plate machines. A switch to spreaders with lower emissions would provide sufficient reduction to satisfy the Gothenberg objective. Odour from livestock units gives rise to many complaints but {{there is little evidence that}} it is a health hazard. Emission of the vapours from slurry spreaders is in the order; (splash plate) >(band) > (TF and injector). Other gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are released primarily after injection. Infection of humans by slurry-borne organisms is not common. In general the differences between spreaders in regard to pathogens are not significant but this conclusion may not apply in all cases. Slurry nutrients amount to 40 % of the N and 65 % of the P required in agriculture. Several commercial and experimental methods exist to measure slurry nutrient content. Field application using a splash plate and vacuum tanker gives highly variable distribution. Any of the other spreaders reviewed here combined with a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> achieve more uniform application. Accurate spreading reduces the need for excess application so losses to water from soil are reduced. This conforms to the Water Framework Directive. Deep injection and incorporation can reduce loss of P from slurry but other spreading methods will not normally reduce the risk of P loss at spreading time. The proposed tanker consists of a closed tank with running gear fit for road and field conditions. A TF spreader is fitted at the back. The slurry is handled by a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> which fills the tank or empties it through the spreader. The pump must be protected from obstacles so an intake filter or chopper filter should be included. This slurry spreader would reduce emission of NH 3 and odour and increase the recycling of slurry nutrients to crops. It is more expensive than splash plate machines but if widely adopted it could be an economical solution to the UNECE requirement to reduce NH 3 emissions. Alternatives to improving spreaders exist. These include digesting slurry, and reducing emissions from livestock housing and slurry storage. With the exception of digestion these offer poor prospects of success especially in relation to odour reduction and exploitation of slurry nutrients. The cost of providing this equipment on Irish farms is likely to be between € 200 m and € 800 m and depends on the options chosen. End of Project Repor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenerally speaking, {{hydraulic}} control {{systems can be}} divided into two different driving concepts. The first one is the well-known valve-controlled system and the second one is the pump-controlled system. The former possesses the feature of fast dynamic response. However, the poor energy-saving performance is its major fault. On the contrary, the pump-controlled hydraulic system has the significant advantage of energy-saving which meets the current demand in modern machine design. In this paper, the simulation analysis using Matlab/Simulink and DSHplus for a newly developed energy-saving hydraulic tube bender is conducted. Instead of the conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> hydraulic <b>pump,</b> the new hydraulic tube bender utilizes an internal gear pump with AC servomotor as its driving power source. In the new energy-saving hydraulic circuit, the use of conventional pressure relief valve is no longer necessary since the demanded flow-rate and pressure output can be precisely obtained by continuously changing the speed of the AC servomotor. In addition, from the simulation results, it is shown that the energy-saving performance of load-sensing control scheme is somewhat better than that of constant pressure control scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the newly developed hydraulic tube bender can save up to 40 % of energy consumption in a working cycle as compared to the conventional hydraulic tube bender...|$|R

40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or bleed off valves (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed off valves represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a bleed off valve, but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of hydraulic systems are controlled using a metering valve {{or the use}} of variable displacement pumps. Metering valve control is compact and has a high control bandwidth, but it is energy inefficient due to throttling losses. Variable displacement pumps are far more efficient as the pump only produces the required flow, but comes with the cost of additional bulk, sluggish response, and added cost. In a previous paper [1], a hydromechanical analog of an electronic switch-mode power supply was proposed to create the functional equivalent of a variable displacement pump. This approach combines a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) on/off valve, a check valve, and an accumulator. The effective pump displacement can be varied by adjusting the PWM duty ratio. Since on/off valves exhibit low loss when fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is potentially more energy efficient than metering valve control, while achieving this efficiency without many of the shortcomings of traditional variable displacement pumps. The system also allows for a host of programmable features that can be implemented via control of the PWM duty ratio. This paper presents initial experimental validation of the concept as well as an investigation of the system efficiency. The experimental apparatus was built using available off-the-shelf components and uses a linear proportional spindle valve as the PWM valve. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve variable control function more efficiently than a valve controlled system, and that by increasing the PWM frequency and adding closed-loop control can decrease syste...|$|E
40|$|The oil {{distribution}} system of an automotive {{light duty engine}} typically has an oil pump mechanically driven through the front-endancillaries-drive or directly off the crankshaft. Delivery pressure is regulated by a relief valve to provide an oil gallery pressure of typically 3 to 4 bar absolute at fully-warm engine running conditions. Electrification of the oil pump drive {{is one way to}} decouple pump delivery from engine speed, but this does not alter the flow distribution between parts of the engine requiring lubrication. Here, the behaviour and benefits of a system with an electrically driven, <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a distributor providing control over flow to crankshaft main bearings and big end bearings is examined. The aim has been to demonstrate that by controlling flow to these bearings, without changing flow {{to other parts of the}} engine, significant reductions in engine friction can be achieved. The study has been conducted on a 1. 5 litre, 4 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. By reducing the feed pressure to the bearings from a baseline pressure of 3 bar absolute to 1. 5 bar absolute, reductions in engine rubbing friction mean effective pressure of up to 14 % has been achieved at light load. Similar reductions in friction were recorded across a speed range of 1000 - 2000 rev/min and net indicated mean effective pressures up to 3. 5 bar. The ranges were conservatively limited to protect against bearing damage. The paper reports details of the oil system modifications and the test results. The fuel economy benefit due solely to the friction reduction, not including any benefit from a reduction in oil pump work, is around 1 ½ % over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). The reduction in friction is demonstrably significant and represents an area with great potential to improve engine efficiency...|$|E

"December 2012 "Pumps and motors are commonly connected hydraulically to create hydrostatic drives, also known as hydrostatic transmissions. A typical hydrostatic transmission consists of a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> motor. Maximum efficiency is typically created for the system when the motor operates at maximum volumetric displacement. The objective of this research is to determine if a hydrostatic transmission with a variable displacement motor can be more efficient than one with a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> motor.

40|$|The rising use of {{vehicles}} and herewith the yearly decrease in available amount {{of crude oil}} left on the earth accompanied by a continuously increasing price puts high stress on the vehicle industry. Furthermore, Humans face a growing increase in the global environmental pollution concerns and tough emission standards constrain the maximum amount {{of vehicles}} emission to reduce air pollution. All of these factors force automobile and vehicle manufactures into never-ending effort to satisfy these requirements. Hence, the development of new vehicles to further reduce fuel consumption and emission is a mandatory. The high power density of hydraulic pumps/motors and hydro-pneumatic accumulators make hydraulic technology look promising for vehicles' transmission and its integration in the automobile industry should be considered. Furthermore, a reasonable price, reliability and long life time of hydraulic units are good enough and required for this purpose. The recently developed hydrostatic units, that meet the increased requirements of high efficiency over a wide range of operation offer, new capability for hydrostatic drivelines in vehicle applications. This thesis primarily addresses the potential of hydraulic transmission for use in automobiles. The analysis and simulations assume baseline vehicle specifications and components of a mid-sized passenger car. Three hydraulic drivetrain configurations were investigated. A continuously variable hydrostatic transmission integrated with an engine controlled to operate on the ideal fuel efficiency line is first introduced. Then, a secondary controlled hydrostatic transmission equipped with conventional hydrostatic units and an energy recovering system working under engine on/off control strategy is also investigated. Alongside the above, an innovative series full hydraulic hybrid drivetrain, referred as “the Hydrid” and its key components are researched in detail throughout the thesis. The general architecture of the Hydrid was introduced by the Dutch organization Innas BV, replacing the mechanical transmission with a distinct series hydraulic transmission which includes innovative components such as a three port-plate hydraulic transformer, <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and in-wheel hydro-motors designed on the floating cup technology. A generic power management strategy of the system power flows is developed by rule based algorithm, and the most efficient power flow control for each driving pattern is established.

40|$|In this research, {{two types}} of {{hydrostatic}} transmission systems (HTS) were analyzed comprehensively, namely valve-controlled and displacement-controlled systems. The valve-controlled HTS utilized a pump driven by the wind turbine rotor, a proportional flow control valve, and two hydraulic motors. A 5 th order nonlinear model of the system was developed, simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK platform, and then validated on a test-bench. The validation {{results showed that the}} model accurately predicted the system performance. Then, the validated model was used to evaluate the performance of such a system with desired operation of a wind power plant. It was found that the valve-controlled system was not suitable for this application due to consistent power loss and operational conflicts between the HTS and desired outcome of a wind power plant. ^ Next, displacement-control configurations were analyzed. One configuration comprised of a variable displacement pump with fixed displacement motor (variable-pump/ fixed-motor) and another configuration comprised of a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> with a variable displacement motor (xed-pump/variable-motor). Considering wind turbine speed/power characteristics and the hydraulic circuitry, it was assessed that the variable-pump/fixed-motor configuration yielded lower eciency at low wind speeds and required a larger pump unnecessarily. The fixed-pump/variable motor HTS showed potentials for wind power harvesting; therefore it was selected for further analysis in this research. The power and speed characteristics of the rotor as the prime mover of the pump and the need for efficient operation of the pump and the xiv motor required a unique system design that is very different than that of conventional hydrostatic systems. A component sizing methodology was proposed to improve annual energy production of a HTS. It was shown that with optimal operation planning, a wind turbine with hydrostatic transmission system (HTSWT) can generate equal or more energy than that of a geared WT. ^ To further improve the modeling accuracy, a nonlinear multivariable model of the fixed-pump/variable motor HTS was developed. Two main control objectives were defined for the system, namely: maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the instantaneous wind and stabilizing the generator speed tightly as mandated by the stringent grid connectivity codes. To design a robust control configuration in order to achieve these objectives, a relative gain array (RGA) analysis was performed. The RGA suggested a novel input-output pairing for the system. Considering results of the RGA analysis, a decentralized multivariable control system was designed. For wind MPPT, an innovative control law was derived independent of direct wind speed measurement. For generator speed control, a feedback linearization technique was implemented to maintain the generator speed precisely at the grid frequency. Operation of a community scale hypothetical HTSWT (600 kW) with the designed control system was simulated with MATLAB/SIMULINK software. It was shown the at any wind speeds and under very large wind perturbations, the maximum power is harvested from wind using the proposed decentralized control system. Additionally, the generator was driven with zero steady state error and less than 0. 15 Hz frequency deviation during wind transients. Robustness of the control system was examined under wide range of plant uncertainties. Even for a turbine with unknown rotor specifications, the designed control law was able to track near-maximum wind power. ^ To ensure that the maximum power is delivered by a HTSWT, a constrained optimal control formulation was investigated. A real-time optimal feedback control adapted from Pontryagin minimum principle was designed for the HTSWT system in order to maximize energy output for any given operating condition. The optimal control law minimized the overall loss at any operating points. Finally, a conceptual xv HTS design featuring variable-pump/variable-motor was studied. It was shown that the additional control input, pump displacement, enables the HTSWT to eliminate the trade-off between aerodynamic efficiency and transmission eciency at low wind speeds. Consequently, the output power from a variable-pump/variable-motor HTS is shown to exceed that from a fixed-pump/variable motor HTS. This output power improvement was significant at low wind speeds. ...|$|E

Hydraulic systems offer {{a range of}} benefits, such as high power density, ruggedness, linear actuation, and low cost, which {{have led to the}} use of hydraulic actuation systems throughout a wide range of industries. However, they also typically suffer from lower efficiency than competing methods of actuation, which limits their appeal in some applications, and presents a threat to their continued prevalence as energy efficiency becomes increasingly important. The relatively low efficiency of hydraulic systems {{is due in part to}} inefficient components, such as pumps and motors, and partially due to the typical method of control, which uses throttling valves to place restrictions in the flow path to dissipate excess power as heat. Several approaches to reducing throttling losses have been studied, such as using pumps, motors, or transformers to control individual actuators, or creating circuits with multiple pressure levels to reduce the pressure drop across individual valves. However, these approaches often suffer from high cost and size requirements, or experience reduced control performance, which can limit their appeal. An alternative approach is to use high-speed on/off valves to charge and discharge energy storage elements to transform the power flow rather than restricting it. Different configurations of switching hydraulic circuits can be used to create variable pumps, motors, actuators, or transformers. This approach can significantly reduce the power loss that is typically associated with controlling hydraulic systems using conventional valves. However, control using high speed switching valves presents several challenges. The most significant drawback is the power ripple that results from the discontinuous nature of the control valves. While this can be mitigated using energy storage elements, such as inertias and accumulators, it cannot be completely eliminated. Furthermore, there is a fundamental trade-off between the degree of smoothing and the speed of response of the system. In chapter 2 the system dynamics of a switching system are studied in the context of a specific switching circuit, the Virtually Variable Displacement Pump (VVDP), and it is demonstrated that the trade-off between ripple and response time can be improved by increasing the Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) frequency and through the use of feedback control. An example of the VVDP circuit, which uses an on/off valve to load and unload a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> with an accumulator to smooth the output flow, is shown experimentally to improve the efficiency of the control system by up to 43 % over a throttling valve system when operating at 2. 5 Hz. However, this efficiency benefit is reduced to 24 % when the switching frequency is increased to 10 Hz. This highlights another challenge with designing switching circuits: the power loss mechanisms that occur in on/off valve controlled systems, particularly transition throttling and compressibility losses which occur every switch, can reduce the potential efficiency benefits and must be taken into account as PWM frequencies are increased. The throttling loss that occurs as the valve transitions between states is often the largest source of power loss in on/off valve systems operating at moderate to high PWM frequencies. The long transition time of many conventional switching valves places an upper limit on the PWM frequencies that can be achieved while still providing an efficiency benefit. To reduce the effect of the transition loss, the concept of hydraulic soft switching is introduced in chapter 3 which, in simulation, reduced the transition loss by 81 %. This technique, which mimics a concept from switching electrical converters, provides temporary flow paths for the hydraulic fluid to bypass the transitioning on/off valve, thus avoiding most of the transition throttling. Another power loss that must be considered, particularly at high PWM frequencies, is the power needed to actuate the on/off valve. While increasing the PWM frequency can be effective at reducing the output ripple and the size of the energy storage elements, the energy needed to accelerate the switching elements in conventional on/off valves at high PWM frequencies is not insignificant. If the kinetic energy of the switching element is not re-captured, the power needed to actuate the valve increases with the PWM frequency cubed. To address this problem, a novel type of rotary valve that spins at a constant speed is presented in chapter 4. This rotary valve achieves high PWM frequencies by alternately connecting a fixed port in the housing to supply or tank as the spool rotates. The duty ratio, which describes the fraction of the rotation that the valve is “on,” is adjusted by moving the valve spool axially. The fact that the valve rotates with a constant speed eliminates the need to accelerate the valve element, meaning the valve must only overcome viscous friction. This has the potential to enable much higher switching speeds than conventional valves. However, with this novel valve architecture, there are a number of design trade-offs that must be negotiated. In chapter 4, the design of the rotary valve, in the context of both a VVDP and a Virtually Variable Displacement Pump/Motor (VVDPM), is formulated as a constrained power loss minimization problem to determine the optimal design parameters. For the VVDPM, this optimization is done for a device that is operating as the wheel motor in a Hydraulic Hybrid Passenger Vehicle. In addition to losses due to throttling across control valves, hydraulic system efficiency is degraded by power losses within hydraulic components, such as pumps and motors. The majority of these losses stem from leakage and friction caused by high pressure applied to elements that move relative to each other. In conventional piston type devices, which are common in the hydraulics industry, the displacement of the unit, and thus its power output, is varied by changing the stroke length of the pistons as they are rotated. This method maintains high pressure on the same number of pistons, regardless of the power output, resulting in leakage and friction losses that do not decrease with the power output and a sharp drop in efficiency at low displacements. In order to address this problem, a different form of on/off control can be used: direct control of individual pistons in a pump/motor. Using this method, pressure is removed from pistons to reduce the pump/motor displacement, which allows the power losses in the system to decrease with displacement. In chapter 5, the power loss mechanisms in both a conventional and discrete piston device are compared, and the potential efficiency benefit is highlighted. One challenge with creating discrete piston controlled pump/motors is designing the control valves to operate quickly and efficiently enough to provide effective control of the pressure in the piston chambers. Designs have been proposed that use two fast-acting electrohydraulic valves to connect the piston to supply or tank. This approach provides flexibility in selecting the disabling strategy and valve timing, but it also leads to designs that are expensive and complicated to control. The requirements for a discrete piston control valve are that it must switch quickly, especially as the pump/motor shaft speed increases, require little actuation power, and have repeatable timing with respect to the pump/motor shaft position. These characteristics match well with the two degree of freedom rotary valve described in chapter 4. In chapter 6 several valve designs based on the rotary valve concept are proposed, and a mechanism using the rotary valve as a pilot stage driving three-way spool valves is selected, analyzed, and designed as a part of a discrete piston controlled pump/motor. The detailed design of a discrete piston prototype, which uses hydro-mechanical rather than electrohydraulic control valves is described, and experimental results are presented in chapter 7. While high internal leakage caused by manufacturing challenges limited the experimentally demonstrated efficiency, estimates of the power loss without the internal leakage, analytical equations, and simulation results demonstrate the potential of the discrete piston control approach. Whether they are used to create switching circuits that avoid the losses associated with conventional throttling valves, or if they are used to reduce the leakage and friction losses in a discrete piston controlled pump motor, on/off valves can be used to improve the efficiency of hydraulic control systems. However, the design of switching valve controlled systems is not without challenges, and this thesis examines many of the potential benefits, as well as difficulties in creating efficient and effective solutions using on/off valves...|$|E
