He scored it for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and an orchestra of four trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), two recorders (Fl), three oboes (Ob), {{two of them}} also playing oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{addresses}} continuous fusion <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> fusion pairs {{which are}} extensions of discrete fusion <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> continuous <b>frames.</b> The study of equalities and inequalities for various frames has seen great achievements. In this paper, using operator methods we establish some new inequalities for continuous fusion <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> fusion pairs. Our results extend and improve ones obtained by Balan, Casazza and Găvruţa.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been huge {{attention}} paid to equiangular tight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> their constructions, {{due to the fact}} that the relationship between these <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> quantum information theory was established. One of the problems which has been studied is the relationship between equiangular tight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> covering graphs of complete graphs. In this thesis, we will explain equiangular tight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> covering graphs of complete graphs and present the results that show the relationship between these two concepts. The latest results about the constructions of equiangular tight frames from projective geometries and Steiner systems also has been presented...|$|R
5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} recovery was fastest during the first six months, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a semi-monocoque <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to {{the area around the}} engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine.|$|E
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} effects of <b>framing</b> <b>and</b> default {{settings}} in annuity demand after conducting a survey-based experiment with over 3, 000 members of a Dutch occupational pension plan. The {{participants were asked to}} allocate their real projected pension accrual between a life annuity and a partial lump sum. In particular, we investigated the joint effects of consumption <b>and</b> investment <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> gain <b>and</b> loss <b>frames.</b> We present strong evidence for <b>framing</b> <b>and</b> default setting effects in annuity demand. We also find robust evidence of individual characteristics of influence annuity demand, highlighting the importance of heterogeneity among participants. <b>Framing</b> <b>and</b> default effects remain significant when we control for individual characteristics. We conclude Dutch plan members generally welcome the partial lump sum option over full annuitization. <b>Framing</b> <b>and</b> default settings are generally capable of predictively steering annuity demand. The precise effect framing may have also depends on the institutional environment, which predefines the perspective through which individuals filter annuities...|$|R

Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the cast-iron curb sections.|$|E
5|$|According to Abdul Baqir Zein, {{the mosque}} was first built in 1700 {{at the foot}} of Mount Padang, then moved to the bank of Batang Arau, as the Dutch colonial {{government}} intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port. It was later moved to its present location. However, the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 with a wooden <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> a roof made from Sago palms. According to this documentation, a sturdier mosque was built in 1805. Another history of the mosque, from the Culture and Tourism Department of the City of the Padang, suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805. The small mosque had stone flooring, wood and dirt walls, and a pyramidal ceiling like the mosques in Java.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960–61 season, Crozier {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his time in the OHA-Jr. Due to his small <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> size, Crozier was not a favourite with either scouts or critics. Despite this, the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) recruited Crozier to fill in for their injured starting goaltender, Denis DeJordy that same season. Appearing in three games, Crozier recorded two wins and a 2.31 goals against average (GAA). Crozier returned as the starting goaltender for the Teepees for the 1961–62 season. He also had short stints with the Sault Ste. Marie Thunderbirds of the Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL), and the Bisons.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E

5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of Hands and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by <b>Frame</b> <b>and</b> 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E
5|$|In Peru, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} shot, {{but more often}} revered and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yawar Fiesta is a celebration, the pinnacle {{of which is the}} tying of an Andean condor to the back of a bull, allowing the condor to kill the bull with its talons before being released. This ceremony is a symbolic representation {{of the power of the}} Andean peoples (the condor) over the Spanish (the bull).
