40|$|The high {{population}} pressure in central Kenya has lead to continuous cultivation with minimal application of nutrient, resulting in nutrient depletion. A {{study was conducted}} to determine the effect of 'Push-pull' (intercropping maize with desmodium and napier grass) strategy management and nitrogen application on maize grain yield and soil fertility on smallholder farmer’s fields in three districts of central Kenya highlands. The experiment design was a split plot design with two factors ('Push-pull' vs monoculture and manure (5 t/ha) only vs manure and fertilizer (40 kg/ha) replicated in three areas with a total of 24 farms in central Kenya. Soil and plant samples were analyzed for macro-nutrients and micro-nutrient {{at the beginning and end}} of the season. The quality of fodders and manures was tested by measuring crude protein and fibre content, ash content and dry matter content. I found an increase in maize yield in 'Push-pull' fields compared with monocultures with only manure added (5 t/ha) and the yield increased even more with modest application of fertilizer (40 Kg N/ha) combined with manure (5 t/ha). The average maize grain yield in "good" farms (i. e. both manure and fertilizer added) with 'Push-pull' cropping system was 186. 4, 86. 46 and 49. 79 percent above the yield in, monocultures and 'Push-pull' in field with only manure, and monoculture in "good" farms respectively.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{identify}} biological and socio-economic constraints and opportunities for livestock development in coconut plantations in Sri Lanka. One {{part of the study}} focussed on the use of participatory rural appraisal to establish felt needs of different <b>farmer</b> <b>categories</b> in terms of feeding practices. Small coconut land holders ( 6 ha) kept livestock for indirect (secondary) benefits such as weed control, social status and security. With an increase of land area, the objectives of keeping livestock deviate from direct to indirect benefits. The total benefits either as direct or indirect were more than double the value of live weight production. The major constraint of livestock keeping for small holders in the area was small land area, lack of grazing lands and low milk price. The major issue in livestock keeping for large coconut holders was shortage of feed during dry seasons. A second part of the study tried to establish biological production potentials based on feed supply of different <b>farmer</b> <b>categories.</b> Of the two areas selected, the coconut dominant area had lower maximum live weight production or milk production than that of the paddy dominant area despite higher availability of natural grass in coconut plantations. Natural grasses in paddy fields, with a feeding value higher than that under coconuts, combined with use of rice bran led to higher live weight production in the paddy dominant area. However, in paddy dominant areas, the small size of individual land holding is more critical and causes many farmers to give up dairying. Coconut dominant areas have a potential to keep animals for indirect benefits owing to the larger size of land holdings. In general, the nutritive value of 50 % of the available feeds in both areas were below maintenance level. Part of this study aimed to assess usefulness of a few 'on the shelf feeding technologies. Biologically speaking, gliricidia was found to be a potential source of feed but farmers' awareness about the potential feeding value of gliricidia was low (26 %). Particularly farmers that keep livestock for indirect production (63 %) found time required for collection of gliricidia a reason for low adoption of this potential feed.

Results reveal that the change in Chinese smallholder agriculture has been complex and multidimensional. All three factors exert profound influence and shape the current state of Chinese agriculture. Massive rural-urban migration has resulted in labour shortages, which in turn have led to a reduction in agricultural diversity and land use intensity and a shift from traditional labour-intensive technologies to modern capital-intensive technologies. However, because of well-developed agricultural markets, input use levels are similar across <b>farmer</b> <b>categories</b> (such as income diversification), helping to maintain productivity. Furthermore, reduced profits from farming due to increasing input prices and decreasing output prices have exerted pressure on smallholders to increasingly turn to nonfarm activities and have also triggered a thriving informal land transfer market, which was previously non-existent.

40|$|Smallholding in the cocoa {{sector has}} been seen as a {{hindrance}} to production and productivity growth due to the ageing of the cocoa farmers, limited access to credit, low level of education and low adoptability of innovations. In order to curb this, policy makers have resorted to implementing policy instruments that encourage the extension of small rural farms into larger farms, thereby undermining the challenges that large-scale farmers might have to deal with. This study was aimed at measuring the relative economic performances of small-scale and large-scale cocoa farmers. Constrained by the on-going policy debates {{and the nature of the}} data, the criteria used for comparison were land productivity, cost of production, marketing strategies and profitability; as well as the factors affecting them. The analysis was based on primary cross-sectional data obtained from cocoa farmers in the Nyong and Mfoumou Division of the Centre Region of Cameroon. Results reveal that smallholders have higher yield and higher profit margins than large-holders, but that they are less efficient in marketing their produce, and that they incur equal costs on average. Smallholders and large-scale farmers were also observed to have similar socio-economic characteristics except for their household sizes; that is, smallholders have small families of 5 persons as opposed to 11 persons for large-scale farms. The most prominent socioeconomic factors determining farmer’s economic performance include household size and experience in cocoa farming. The most common marketing strategy adopted predominantly by large-scale farmers was group selling, hence no statistical difference between their selling prices. Therefore operating large cocoa farms is neither an efficient nor a sustainable method of raising cocoa production and family income. However the co-existence of both <b>farmer</b> <b>categories</b> is encouraged. Thus the study proposes that policy debates should address issues like the optimal size of a cocoa farm in Cameroon and the effective farming system required to achieve higher efficiency and sustainability of cocoa farms...|$|R

It seeks to identify who is food insecure and where they are, why they risk food insecurity and what options exist to reduce their vulnerability. Using the sustainable livelihoods framework and collecting qualitative and quantitative data from two selected districts of Balangir and Dhenkanal under Village Level Studies Project, the paper looks at five livelihood groups, notably marginal and small scale farming households, labouring rural households, mining worker households, rural artisan households and scheduled tribal households. Even though Orissa is virtually self-sufficient in food grains, {{there is a significant}} prevalence of food insecurity in the state and around 9 percent of the population are classified as extremely food insecure consuming less than 1, 800 kcal per day. The situation varies significantly within the state: 15 percent of the population in the southern region are extremely food insecure compared to 3 percent of the population living in the coastal areas. The study finds that food insecurity and vulnerability are mainly caused by a limited physical as well human asset base, slow economic growth, limited or no access to welfare provisions and public services, lack of land reform and difficulties in accessing credit institutions. Based on the findings of the analysis, the paper identifies key interventions to address the immediate food needs of the most vulnerable and to stimulate rural development, in particular promoting agriculturally linked livelihoods. Proposed interventions include increased investment in agricultural research, improved watershed development, developing financial services and promoting small scale industries as well as micro enterprises and strengthening anti-poverty programmes within the state.

Educated farmers were in majority in FFS farmers while; conversely illiterate farmers were in majority in the <b>category</b> of non-FFs <b>farmers.</b> In <b>category</b> of FFS <b>farmers</b> livestock farming was their primary income as reported by majority (31. 3 %) of FFS farmers and in the case of non-FFS farmer’s crop sale was their primary income source as reported by 28. 4 % of non-FFs farmers. In addition to that both FFS and non-FFS farmers also earn income from nonfarm sources like business, job, foreign remittances and labour. FFS training program had positive and significant impact on the knowledge level of farmers regarding citrus production and protection practices. T-test statistics showed highly significant (P< 0. 05) difference in knowledge level of FFS farmers and non-FFS farmers...|$|R

Facultad de Agronomía e Ingeniería Forestal {{and can be}} found at: [URL] open trade policy, implemented during the last few decades, has greatly transformed Chilean farmers and their production systems. As a result, farmers can be grouped into three categories based on their market-production orientation: domestic, transitional or export producers. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the factors underlying the decision to produce for a particular market and compare the three groups of farmers based on data from the 2007 agricultural census. A generalized ordered logit model was used to analyze different methods of production, and non-parametric methods were used to compare the groups. Results show that some <b>farmers</b> change <b>categories</b> in sequence; <b>farmers</b> that produce for the domestic market can later produce for the foreign market and eventually specialize further in the production of exports. The three types of farmers differ in several aspects. Beyond the indisputable role of geographic attributes and irrigation in producing exportable species, export-oriented producers have more modern characteristics than those producing for the internal market: they are more educated, have access to various financial resources, benefit from state-funded programs, have better managerial skills and are active users of technology...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a typology of the dairy farms situated in Central Macedonia, Greece, based on their environmental management practices. The empirical analysis uses data from a survey of 123 dairy farms in the study area. The farms are categorized into alternative profiles, using a two-step cluster analysis; the clustering is based on the results of a Categorical Principal Component Analysis, by means of which the variables describing environmental management practices are grouped into dimensions. Then, the characteristics of <b>farmers</b> of each <b>category</b> are explored by estimating a Multinomial Logit Model. The results illustrate that when it comes to the environment, dairy farmers in Central Macedonia adopt diverse farming practices, some of which are detrimental, while others promote environmental protection and, at the same time, ensure acceptable incomes for dairy farmers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this descriptive, {{correlational}} study was to evaluate dairy farmers? adoption characteristics and use of a Milk Collection Center (MCC) in the Western province of Rwanda. A snowball sampling method was used to identify participants (N = 53). Farmers answered a research instrument related to their use and perception of the MCC and potential price points for educational services including, artificial insemination training, mastitis treatments, vaccinations at the MCC, training in milking techniques, on-site veterinarian services, and milk quality testing. The study showed that Rwandan dairy farmers had agreeable attitudes toward the Gisenyi MCC and were influenced by distance to MCC, access to credit, and low cost of technologies. No significant relationships existed between <b>farmers?</b> adopter <b>categories</b> (early vs. late) and their overall attitude toward the MCC. However, relationships existed between individual adopter characteristics and overall attitude toward the MCC. Farmers {{were willing to pay}} for certain educational services, such as artificial insemination training and mastitis treatments. Vaccinations at the MCC and artificial insemination training were farmers? highest valued services. Positive relationships existed between price points and importance of educational services. The MCCs must appeal to their target client, the dairy farmer, and listen to their wants and needs to be successful and have an impact. By drawing attention to the positive attributes of the MCC, participation increases amongst the farmers wouldbenefit the MCC and the Rwandan dairy market, in addition to helping dairy farmers have a more stable market to sell their product and receive the assistance needed...|$|R
