5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it <b>is</b> <b>blamed</b> for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E

5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction <b>is</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who <b>is</b> <b>blamed</b> for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{we have seen}} 'moral panics' over {{literacy}} education fuelled by the media in the British, Australian, Canadian, and American press (Barron, 2000).

Too often children <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for poor attention, disruptive behavior or disinterest; parents <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for disorderly family routines and turmoil in the home; teachers <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to teach traditional values and get their students to perform; and teacher educators <b>are</b> <b>blamed</b> for failing to impart the necessary knowledge to reach children who lack mainstream social values and literacy practices. As long-time researchers of literacy, {{we know it is}} no easy matter to disrupt discourses of blame that attend literacy failure and underachievement...|$|R

Albedo, who is working with U-TIC for his own goals, sets out in pursuit of MOMO.|$|E
