50|$|In aviation, {{the top of}} descent, also {{referred}} to as the TOD or T/D, is the computed transition from the cruise phase of a flight to the descent phase, {{the point at which the}} planned descent to <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>altitude</b> is initiated. The top of descent is usually calculated by an on-board flight management system, and is designed to provide the most economical descent to approach altitude, or to meet some other objective (fastest descent, greatest range, etc.). The top of descent may be calculated manually as long as the distance, air speed, and current altitude are known.|$|E
5000|$|When used on {{approach}} to landing, VNAV follows a calculated approach path from a <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix or waypoint to the runway, i.e. waypoints within the FMS navigation database. The path {{can either be}} based on stored database altitudes as displayed on the altimetry system ("baro VNAV"), or as corrected within more advanced FMS equipment for temperature errors: significantly low temperature otherwise causing a shallow <b>approach.</b> During <b>final</b> landing <b>approach,</b> <b>altitude</b> must be controlled more accurately than heights referenced to mean sea level (MSL) as barometric altimetry provides. An ILS glide slope signal originating from the landing point provides needed vertical alignment down to the final 100 ft. Commercial pilots rely on visual cues, and a down-looking radar altimeter annunciator that calls out above ground level (AGL) height ("50", [...] "40", [...] "30", [...] "20", [...] "10"), in order to time the flare seconds before touchdown.|$|R
50|$|The Kh-22 uses an Isayev liquid-fuel rocket engine, fueled with TG-02 (Tonka-250) and IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid), {{giving it}} a maximum speed of Mach 4.6 {{and a range of}} up to 600 km. It can be {{launched}} in either high-altitude or low-altitude mode. In high-altitude mode, it climbs to an altitude of 27000 m and makes a high-speed dive into the target, with a terminal speed of about Mach 4.6. In low-altitude mode, it climbs to 12000 m and makes a shallow dive at about Mach 3.5, making the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> at an <b>altitude</b> under 500 m. The missile is guided by a gyroscope-stabilized autopilot in conjunction with a radio altimeter.|$|R
40|$|A {{conflict}} detection and resolution tool, Terminal Tactical Separation Assurance Flight Environment (T-TSAFE), {{is being developed}} to improve the accuracy and reduce the false alert rate beyond currently deployed technology. The legacy system in use today, Conflict Alert, relies primarily on a dead reckoning algorithm. By adding altitude intent information for {{conflict detection}} and resolution, T-TSAFE may improve conflict detection accuracy. In addition to verifying T-TSAFE’s efficacy over Conflict Alert, an initial human-in-the-loop study suggested possible avenues of tool improvement through heuristic analysis. Results of this analysis were then used to guide a follow-up T-TSAFE investigation, which is described in this paper. This follow-up study tested four experimental conditions. The first two conditions varied conflict detection with and without altitude clearances entered into the tool by the controllers via keyboard. The other two conditions varied the presence of Automatic Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA), an FAA tool used for monitoring <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> [1]. One of these <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> conditions used regular alerts in the data block without cones and the others used ATPA cones between different aircraft (i. e., a cone graphic shown in the flight display) as a warning for possible compression errors in the <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> Entering <b>altitude</b> clearances into T-TSAFE was expected to reduce false alerts but did not, possibly due to the short duration of the runs, which did not allow for a large enough frequency of altitude entries to study the issue adequately. Also, the test conditions did not significantly impact {{the duration of the}} alert or the controller’s response time to the alert. The subjective data showed that controllers favored the ATPA cones over the T-TSAFE alerts in the data blocks on <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> Results also indicate manageable levels of workload and situation awareness, which combined with other results, seem to indicate promise for T-TSAFE as a viable air traffic control tool, pending further research and adaptation...|$|R
50|$|IAP charts are {{aeronautical}} charts that {{portray the}} aeronautical data {{that is required}} to execute an instrument approach to an airport. Besides depicting topographic features, hazards and obstructions, they depict the procedures and airport diagram. Each procedure chart uses {{a specific type of}} electronic navigation system such as an NDB, TACAN, VOR, ILS/MLS and RNAV. The chart name reflects the primary navigational aid (NAVAID), if {{there is more than one}} straight-in procedure or if it is just a circling-only procedure. A communication strip on the chart lists frequencies in the order they are used. Minimum, maximum and mandatory altitudes are depicted in addition to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for emergencies. A cross depicts the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix (FAF) <b>altitude</b> on NPAs while a lightning bolt does the same for PAs. NPAs depict the MDA while a PA shows both the decision altitude (DA) and decision height (DH). Finally, the chart depicts the missed approach procedures in plan and profile view, besides listing the steps in sequence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first officer}} was flying the plane during <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> The aircraft's <b>altitude</b> and {{airspeed}} were high, but were within company limits. The rain was now heavy {{enough that the}} runway lights were visible only intermittently after each windscreen wiper stroke. Just before touchdown the captain, concerned about the long touchdown point (over a kilometre past the runway threshold) and unable to {{see the end of}} the runway, ordered the first officer to perform a [...] "go-around" [...] and the first officer advanced the throttles but did not engage the Takeoff/Go-around switch (TO/GA). At this point visibility improved markedly and the landing gear contacted the runway, although the aircraft continued to accelerate. The captain then decided to cancel the go-around by retarding the thrust levers, even though he was not flying the plane. This caused confusion as he did not announce his actions to the first officer who was still flying the plane. When over-riding the first officer's actions, the captain inadvertently left one engine at TO/GA power and as a result cancelled the preselected auto-brake settings.|$|R

5000|$|In the US, it {{is called}} the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix (FAF) and marked on a NACO IAP by a {{lightning}} bolt symbol and on a Jeppesen terminal chart {{by the end of the}} glide slope path symbol. It is the point in space where the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment begins on the instrument approach; the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> point on a non-precision approach is marked by a maltese cross symbol. In the US, where the approach navigation aid is on the field and there is no depicted, the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> point is [...] "where the aircraft is established inbound on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course from the procedure turn and where the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> descent may be commenced".|$|R

50|$|This {{accident}} was blamed {{entirely on the}} bad judgment of the Captain, Gale C.

He allowed the plane to fly the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment (in visual conditions) at a descent rate of 2,300 feet per minute (3 times the safe descent rate). When the plane crossed the outer marker, which marks the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment, it was 2,000 feet too high.|$|R
