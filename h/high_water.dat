5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous <b>high</b> <b>water</b> levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River {{to reduce the risk of}} boats washing downstream during <b>high</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

40|$|The recent {{evolution}} of extreme <b>high</b> <b>waters</b> along the severe cyclone-risk coasts of the Bay of Bengal (the {{east coast of}} India and Bangladesh) was assessed using long-term (24 – 34 years) hourly tide gauge data available from five stations. The <b>highest</b> <b>water</b> levels {{above mean sea level}} have the greatest magnitude towards {{the northern part of the}} Bay, which decreases towards its south-west. Extreme <b>high</b> <b>waters</b> were observed to result from a combination of moderate, or even small, surges with large tides at these stations in most of the cases. Increasing trends, which are significant, were observed in the extreme <b>high</b> <b>waters</b> at Hiron Point, at the head of the Bay. However, the trends in extremes are slightly lower than its mean sea level trend. For the other stations, Cox's Bazaar, Paradip Visakhapatnam and Chennai, no significant trends were observed. At inter-annual time scales, changes in extreme <b>high</b> <b>waters</b> in the Bay of Bengal were found to be influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole...|$|R

5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though <b>high</b> <b>water</b> frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When <b>high</b> <b>water</b> closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|The pudús are herbivorous, {{consuming}} vines, {{leaves from}} low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit.

5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during <b>high</b> <b>water</b> levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} led {{to moderate}} to severe inland flooding, with high waters reported along U.S. Route 460 in Prince George County, U.S. Route 17, and several other roads. The rainfall led to river flooding, including minor to moderate flooding along the Rivanna and James Rivers, moderate flooding along the Appomattox River, and moderate to major flooding along the Meherrin, Nottoway, and Blackwater Rivers. In Isle of Wight County, a driver attempted to cross <b>high</b> <b>water</b> on the James River Bridge and was killed when the water washed the car off of the road.|$|E
5|$|<b>High</b> <b>water</b> {{remained}} in Salcha through the 31st, though {{the crest of}} the flooding had passed. Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha, and water-borne debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts. By early afternoon on the first, the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area.|$|E

5|$|<b>High</b> <b>water</b> {{volume in}} wet seasons {{does most of}} the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E
5|$|In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, {{an advance}} party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road {{through the woods}} and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was {{possible}} at <b>high</b> <b>water</b> to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over <b>high</b> <b>water</b> temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested {{that there may have been}} only a small amount of sewage released but the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a <b>high</b> <b>water</b> table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E

Numerous metals and other substances contaminate the creek. These include iron, aluminum, manganese, and sulfates. The creek's discharge at Westport ranges from 4 to 6280 cubic feet per second and the pH ranges from 5.5 to 8.6. It also experiences abnormally <b>high</b> <b>water</b> temperatures.|$|E
