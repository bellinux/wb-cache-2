5000|$|Cable <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{the pieces}} that tie the system together. The cable {{attaches}} into {{one side of}} the fitting, while the other side attaches to the post (frame structure). Cable ends may tension, or just attach to the frame, depending on the individual needs of the project. [...] The requirements needed to decide whether to use tensioning or non-tensioning fittings are generally dependent upon the manufacturer's system requirements, your local building codes, and ICC requirements. To determine the type of cable <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> needed, you'll need to know the distance you expect a single piece of cable to run without stopping, and the amount of tensioning ability of the fitting you expect to use.

50|$|Bracing wires must be {{carefully}} rigged to maintain the correct length and tension. In flight the wires tend to stretch under load and on landing some may become slack. Regular rigging checks are required and any necessary adjustments made before every flight. Rigging adjustments may {{also be used to}} set and maintain wing dihedral and angle of incidence, usually {{with the help of a}} clinometer and plumb-bob. Individual wires are fitted with turnbuckles or threaded <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> so that they can be readily adjusted. Once set, the adjuster is locked in place.|$|E
5000|$|Cable Tension: An {{incredible}} amount of tension is generated on the end posts when ten or more cables, each tensioned at 200-400 lbs. over a height of 36" [...] to 42” exists. Underestimating the tension of cables applied to end poles can cause a safety hazard. Cable can have too much deflection allowing body parts to slip through, or cables can merely [...] "pull out" [...] of the <b>end</b> <b>fittings,</b> causing the cable rail to fail. Poorly designed end posts {{will result in a}} railing where the cables cannot be properly tensioned without an unacceptable amount of cable deflection. End posts to which the tensioning hardware attaches must be constructed so that they will not deflect perceptibly.|$|E
50|$|The {{end of a}} {{wire rope}} tends to fray readily, and cannot be easily {{connected}} to plant and equipment. There are different ways of securing the ends of wire ropes to prevent fraying. The most common and useful type of <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> for a wire rope is to turn the end back to form a loop. The loose end is then fixed back on the wire rope. Termination efficiencies vary from about 70% for a Flemish eye alone; to nearly 90% for a Flemish eye and splice; to 100% for potted ends and swagings.|$|R

The most common and useful type of <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> for a wire rope is to turn the end back to form a loop. A thimble can be installed inside the loop to preserve the natural shape of the loop and protect the cable from pinching and abrading {{on the inside of}} the loop. The loose end is then fixed back on the wire rope by means of a swaged sleeve (ferrule). The thimble prevents disrupting of the wires.|$|R
