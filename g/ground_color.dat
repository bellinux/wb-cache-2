5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish <b>ground</b> <b>color,</b> which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the <b>ground</b> <b>color,</b> often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown <b>ground</b> <b>color,</b> with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic <b>ground</b> <b>color</b> of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and this color is usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the background color is whitish, and a few have dark background colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green periostracum.|$|E

25|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a pale tan to pinkish tan <b>ground</b> <b>color</b> that becomes darker towards the foreline, overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–18 (13.4) crossbands. Characteristically, both the <b>ground</b> <b>color</b> and crossband pattern are pale in A. c. contortrix. These crossbands are light tan to pinkish tan to pale brown in the center, but darker towards the edges. They are about 2 scales wide or less at the midline of the back, but expand to a width of 6–10 scales {{on the sides of the}} body. They do not extend down to the ventral scales. Often, the crossbands are divided at the midline and alternate on either side of the body, with some individuals even having more half bands than complete ones. A series of dark brown spots is also present on the flanks, next to the belly, and are largest and darkest in the spaces between the crossbands. The belly is the same color as the <b>ground</b> <b>color,</b> but may be a little whitish in part. At the base of the tail there are 1–3 (usually 2) brown crossbands followed by a gray area. In juveniles, the pattern on the tail is more distinct: 7–9 crossbands are visible, while the tip is yellow. On the head, the crown is usually unmarked, except for a pair of small dark spots, one near the midline of each parietal scale. A faint postocular stripe is also present; diffuse above and bordered below by a narrow brown edge.|$|E
25|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a <b>ground</b> <b>color</b> that may be cream, buff, yellowish-brown, pink, or ash gray, overlaid with 28-47 dorsal blotches subrhombic or subelliptical in shape.

25|$|The color-pattern {{consists}} of a pale buff, grayish, reddish, olive or pale brown <b>ground</b> <b>color,</b> overlaid middorsally {{with a series of}} variably colored, but mostly whitish spots, edged with dark brown, and separated by lighter interblotch patches. A series of white bows run dorsolaterally. The top of the head has a whitish cruciform or trident pattern and there is a faint stripe running from the eye to the angle of the jaw. The belly is whitish to pinkish, uniform in color or with brown dots that are either faint or distinct.|$|E
25|$|C. cadaverina is {{a fairly}} large species, ranging {{anywhere}} from 9-14 millimeters long. and has many characteristics that are common to its family, Calliphoridae. These characteristics include their metallic color, having bristles on their meron as well as having plumose arista. This species is known for having a shiny metallic blue abdomen {{for which it is}} named. It has a dark blue or black thorax and distinctive darker blue stripes present on the dorsum behind its head. Along with these other characteristics, C. cadaverina also has white calypters, a bare stem vein, and a parafacial with a <b>ground</b> <b>color</b> ranging from black to reddish brown with a yellow covering.|$|E
25|$|The {{color pattern}} is highly variable, {{including}} a <b>ground</b> <b>color</b> {{that may be}} olive, brown, tan, gray, yellow, or (rarely) rusty. The body markings are highly variable, as is the degree of contrast: in some specimens the pattern is very well defined, while in others it may be virtually absent. In general, however, the body pattern consists {{of a series of}} dorsolateral blotches, rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, which extend from the first scale row {{to the middle of the}} back. These blotches may oppose or alternate across the midline, often fusing to form bands. They also have pale borders, which in some cases may be prominent, and may be invaded from below by tan or gray pigment, occasionally dividing them into pairs of ventrolateral spots. The belly may be white, cream or yellowish gray, with an increasing amount of gray to black mottling posteriorly that may fade again under the tail. The head usually does not have any markings other than a moderately wide postocular stripe that runs from behind the eye back to the angle of the mouth. The iris is gold or bronze, with varying amounts of black reticulation, while the tongue is black.|$|E
