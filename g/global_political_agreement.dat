40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{examining}} the reasons behind most failures of governance, including fault lines in institutional and professional specialisation, and in ideology. These three, forever competing within and between themselves, frustrate attempts to find solutions {{to some of the}} world's most pressing challenges. Not least among these are environmental challenges, where preferences and priorities that are geographically, professionally or ideologically narrow inevitably fail to achieve solutions for the greater good. What role can the Commonwealth play in addressing the fracture lines that bedevil solutions for climate change and biodiversity? It may help to stimulate global action on these issues if it can encourage agreement across multidimensional global boundaries. We know the Commonwealth is not a leading global force for controlling climate change or biodiversity loss; but if it had the political will it could be an exemplar of how, between a group of vastly diverse countries across the globe-and on the <b>global</b> <b>political</b> stage-binding <b>agreement</b> and positive action on climate change and biodiversity could be promoted and perhaps achieved. One of the strongest features of the Commonwealth is the generation of long-standing legal and ethical norms whose appeal is obvious even if their implementation is lacking. These norms should not be limited to the rule of law, democracy and human rights, but should include environmental norms because these too are fundamental to a satisfactory human condition.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is an {{examination}} of the Southern African Development Community's (SADC) conflict resolution role (through multilateral mediation) in the Zimbabwe conflict and to determine how this role impacted on the development and outcome of the conflict. The underlying problem {{is not so much the}} intervention of SADC but the process and impact thereof. The primary research question is: Would the events in Zimbabwe and the outcome of the 'Zimbabwe-problem' have been substantially different without the involvement and conflict resolution role of SADC? This question is underpinned by two subsidiary questions: Firstly, what was the conflict management role, including that of conflict resolution, that SADC played? Secondly, did this role contribute to a positive outcome by overcoming limitations and how? In response the argument is that SADC, despite institutional limitations and operational constraints, played a positive role that prevented an escalation of the conflict and that contributed to a de-escalation thereof on account of its mediation. The study includes a framework for analysis to explore the conflict resolution role of a regional organisation in intra-state (domestic) conflict; a contextualisation of SADC's role with reference to the nature, scope and development of the 'Zimbabweproblem' as conflict; the analysis of the conflict resolution role through SADC mediation; and an evaluation of key findings as a basis for policy and research recommendations. The study is demarcated in conceptual, temporal and geopolitical terms. At a conceptual level, the key variables are conflict, conflict resolution and the role of international (regional) organisations. In terms of time-frame, the study covers the period from 2002 to 2014. The commencement year of 2002 is based on the constitutional and humanitarian crises that emerged and necessitated SADC intervention. The concluding year of 2014 marks the first full year since the end of the <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement's</b> (GPA) Government of National Unity (GNU) and allows for a retrospective assessment of the outcome(s) of SADC's role. The noncomparative case study focuses on Zimbabwe as the national-level and SADC as the regional-level (Southern African) units of analysis. The research design is that of a historical case study and entails a critical literature-documentary analysis. Although SADC's initial response and involvement was delayed and limited, it developed into a concerted mediation effort and a dedicated conflict resolution role. This role, despite limitations and constraints, overcame challenges and produced a settlement agreement. It is evident that events in Zimbabwe and the outcome of the 'Zimbabwe-problem' would have been substantially different and undeniably more detrimental (even disastrous) not only to Zimbabwe but also to the Southern African region without SADC's involvement and conflict resolution role. Its intervention contributed to the de-escalation of the conflict and to acceptable levels of stability (unstable peace) in the region and within the country. A retrospective and diachronic assessment confirms a relative improvement in political, economic and social conditions (if juxtaposed with the first decade of the 2000 s. This, however, does not imply a termination of the conflict and the existence of stable peace. The residue of dissatisfaction produced by the GPA; the prevailing electoral and constitutional contestation; and the authoritarian and repressive regime trends still apparent in Zimbabwe attest to continued latent and manifest conflict. This confirms the tenet that intra-state conflict is never really terminated, seldom resolved but only managed in an effective manner to produce a minimally acceptable outcome of unstable peace.

40|$|The July 31 st 2013 Elections in Zimbabwe {{ushered in}} a renewed period of {{political}} domination by ZANU(PF) and its President, Robert Mugabe. This election followed five years of a SADC- facilitated <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement</b> (GPA), which was put into place after a contested presidential run-off election in June 2008. The recent elections, which once again established ZANU(PF) ’s mastery over the country’s political domain, were passed as free and peaceful by SADC and the African Union but contested by both Movement for Democratic Change parties and the western countries.

This study offers a theoretical analysis of the challenges to national healing, reconciliation and development in Zimbabwe, post June 2008. The study argues that the challenges to national healing and reconciliation are embedded in the struggles for political hegemony. It posits that national healing and reconciliation are processes that have {{a direct impact on}} the political ascendency and fortunes of the main rival political parties, the MDC and ZANU-PF. The study also discloses that national healing and reconciliation in Zimbabwe are bleak because the ZANU-PF regime on whose watch violence occurred still controls the levers of political power making national healing and reconciliation difficult. The study stands on Gramsciâ€™s theory of hegemony to analyse the challenges to reconciliation and healing in Zimbabwe.

40|$|This Discussion Paper draws {{attention}} to the often overlooked aspects of the limits, poverty and contradictions embedded in the “unfinished business” of the Zimbabwe nation state project. It is located within the broader context of the crisis of the nation-state in an African continent increasingly buffeted by waves of globalisation. It also revisits the debate on whether postcolonial nationalism can completely avoid reproducing the racial and ethnic discrimination that characterised its colonial past. Zeroing in on Zimbabwe, the paper argues that the nation-state crisis has roots in the legacy of settler colonialism, the ethnic fragmentation that marked the history of the liberation movement and the character of the nationalist elite. Its critique of the politics of the nationalist and political elite, the Lancaster House Agreement, the National Democratic Revolution and the <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement</b> makes this paper an important contribution to the debates on the real legacy of the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe and the prospects for a common national identity based on nationalism, social justice, inclusive democracy and development in the country...|$|E

40|$|Partners in Zimbabwe's <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement</b> (GPA), a legal {{instrument}} regarding {{the formation of}} a government of national unity (GNU) between Zimbabwe's political contestants, MDC-T, ZANU (PF), and MDC-M, after the internationally condemned June 27, 2008 presidential run-off elections between the MDC-T and ZANU (PF) presidential candidates, have openly disagreed on their perception of the targeted sanctions that were imposed on some members, institutions, and business organizations owned by or associated with the pre-GNU government by the USA and EU in 2001 and 2002, respectively, as a direct response to the incumbent government's alleged slide into, among other things, authoritarian rule, lawlessness, misgovernance, and violations of human and people's rights. ZANU (PF) has always blamed MDC for calling on Western governments and the USA to impose sanctions on the pre-GNU government to weaken it and effect regime change. This paper seeks to examine the seemingly paradoxical sanctions discourse within Zimbabwe's political establishment where targeted sanctions are seen both as an impediment not only to economic growth but also to political stability and, at the same time, as a convenient tool to garner political mileage by both ZANU (PF) and MDC formations...|$|E
40|$|URL] held â€˜freshâ€™ {{elections}} on July 31, 2013 {{under a new}} constitution. This was {{in line with the}} provisions of the <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement</b> (GPA), a political power-sharing compromise signed between Zimbabwe's three main political parties, following the heavily disputed 2008 harmonised presidential and parliamentary elections. The GPA established in Zimbabwe a Government of National Unity (GNU). On the road to making a new constitution, political differences and party politicking always seemed to take precedence over national interest. This political polarity in Zimbabwe resulted in the heavy polarity of the media, especially along political ideological grounds. The new constitution-making process and all its problems received heavy coverage in almost all national newspapers. This article analyses the discourse-linguistic notion of â€˜objectivityâ€™ in â€˜hardâ€™ news reports on the new constitution-making process by comparing the textuality of â€˜hardâ€™ news reports from two Zimbabwean national daily newspapers: the government-owned and controlled Herald and the privately owned Newsday. Focusing on how language and linguistic resources are used evaluatively in ways that betray authorial attitudes and bias in news reporting, the article examines how the news reports uphold or flout the â€˜objectivityâ€™ ideal as explicated through the â€˜reporter voiceâ€™ configuration, and within Appraisal Theory...|$|E

The paper concludes that the sum of all this has had the effect of exposing SADC and it being perceived as a weak regional organisation...|$|E
40|$|The role of SADC {{mediators}} in Zimbabwe {{resulted in}} a power sharing deal that was signed by {{the leaders of the}} opposition and the ruling party. It brought to an end the conflict aroused by the March as well as the July 2008 elections. A government of national unity was formed through that deal. However, the Zimbabwe story has not been given enough attention as to establish what influenced the deal. To begin with, the parties who presented diverging views, who could not each other before, managed to reach an agreement that binds them to work together to help rebuild Zimbabwe. A lot has been said about Zimbabwe and the mediation itself; however, {{there is a lack of}} analysis as to what informed the deal.

The specific focus of the {{study is a}}n analysis of the four peace agreements signed in this period namely; the 1978 Internal Settlement, the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement, the 1987 Unity Accord and the 2008 <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Its central thesis is that coloniality in its multifaceted invisible forms is largely responsible for conflicts that have engulfed Zimbabwe and for compromising the chances of success of the four peace agreements.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore the concept of “re-branding a {{destination}} ” as a key element to enhance sustainable tourism development. The study sought to measure the destination’s attributes that determine sustainable tourism development vis-a-vis the perceived tourists ’ image. The study concludes that the concept of re-branding a destination is vital in destination marketing. Cognizant of the strategic role of destination re-branding, the study notes that there are a number of non-tourism factors which are still prevailing, such as political, social and environmental issues, which can significantly impact negatively on brand equity and the overall destination’s competitiveness. Furthermore, the study observes that the concept of re-branding a destination may become more of rhetoric than practice if authorities fail to embrace the holistic nature of destination branding. Whilst there has been stability on the economic front, there are contradictory political undertones which have a strong bearing on sustainable tourism development. As such, the bad image generated by such negative publicity has the potential to derail the re-branding process thereby rendering it ineffective. The study concludes that for sustainable tourism development to be realized, the destination needs to deal with some of the political hot spots of the <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement</b> (GPA) which have the potential to tarnish the image of a destination.

40|$|The power-sharing {{agreement}} in Zimbabwe has {{ushered in a}} period of engagement between the diaspora and homeland government, marking a distinct change from the hostility that characterised relations over previous years. This article discusses the politics of this repositioning and the character of the new diasporic organisations formed {{in the wake of the}} <b>Global</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Agreement</b> to take forward agendas of development and reconstruction at home. It argues that these new diasporic organisations have tried to create non-partisan platforms for engagement, have an elite social base, and connect responsibilities for development at home with the desire for formal political rights. Despite an apparent convergence of interest around development and reconstruction on the part of an array of diaspora groups, as well as the Zimbabwean and British governments, there are, nonetheless, tensions among these actors that this article seeks to reveal. It argues that a key issue shaping conversations over engagement is the divergence of interest within the diaspora between those with and without security in their states of residence. This divide is likely to become more salient in the context of a large-scale return programme, especially if there is ongoing uncertainty in Zimbabwe and if repatriation is conceived as a final one-way movement rather than as part of an ongoing circulation in which people may choose to maintain transnational lives. This discussion of the Zimbabwean case thus contributes to broader debates over the tensions that characterise policies of ‘diaspora engagement’...|$|E
