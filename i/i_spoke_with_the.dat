5000|$|Senator D'Amato also {{assisted}} {{in the case of}} Janet Franquet, a 32-year-old Long Island woman and used her case as another example of insurance company denials. Ms. Franquet was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in late 1997[...] She required a mastectomy, after chemotherapy to try to shrink her tumor, and desired reconstructive surgery to restore the breast. Upon contacting her insurance carrier, her reconstructive surgeon, Dr. Todd Wider, learned that her insurance plan, a self-funded plan, refused to cover the reconstructive surgery, and considered it cosmetic. The carrier recommended using a skin graft. Dr. Wider went ahead and performed the surgery for free, but he was outraged by the carrier's decision. Wider also crusaded to change the law, contacting a number of politicians. Speaking {{on the floor of the}} Congress, D'Amato said when he had heard that an insurance carrier had denied Ms. Janet Franquet coverage for her surgery: [...] Mr. President, I decided that I would give Mrs. Franquet's insurance company a call. When <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Medical Director, he told me that [...] "replacement of a breast is not medically necessary. This is not a bodily function and therefore cannot and should not be replaced" ... Luckily for her, Dr. Todd Wider agreed to forgo payment of this surgery. ... I ask you, Mr. President, how many other Janet Franquets are out there? Will they be lucky enough to have a Dr. Wider to take care of them? ... Too many women have been denied reconstructive surgery because insurers have deemed the procedure cosmetic and not medically necessary. It is absolutely wrong. On October 21, 1998, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) was signed into federal law. Since passage of this law, many thousands of women have had reconstructive surgery after mastectomy.|$|E

40|$|A Comprehensive Study Of The Patent Application ProcessAndrew SchichoFaculty Sponsor: Bahram Nassersharif, Mechanical EngineeringNext year I will be {{attending}} graduate school {{to attain a}} PhD in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. During this time, I will be completing a research fellowship which involves the study of new forms of green energy. The field of green energy is expanding and new inventions {{have the potential to}} be incredibly profitable if they are efficient and competitive in today’s market. It is likely that my research will need to be protected from competitors looking to create similar products for harvesting green energy. In order to better prepare myself to write applications for patents on this research, I have completed a comprehensive study of the patent application process. This project has allowed me to discover the pathway to a successful patent application from the position of a researcher at a university or college. During my study of the patenting process, I contacted university professors and interviewed them about their experiences patenting research. After this, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Division of Research and Economic Development to discover more about how the University of Rhode Island handles research patents. I was allowed to sit in on an Intellectual Property Committee meeting, during which time a multidiscipline team of professors gathered to hear about the research being done by their colleagues. The Division of Research and Economic Development’s staff explained the types of patents and their associated costs. Research deemed profitable by the committee is funded and proceeds to be reviewed by a patent lawyer who helps the researcher formally apply for a patent. Finally, I acquired a successful and unsuccessful patent application for comparison and contrast. From these experiences and my private studies of the U. S. patent office website, I have created a detailed guide of all the information a researcher might need to complete the patent application process...|$|E

40|$|When I was {{appointed}} fellowships advisor at UAB {{back in the}} late 1990 s and before the formation of the National Association of Fellowships Advisors, as a first order of business <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> university’s few former winners and finalists about their experiences applying for nationally competitive scholarships. One such former applicant, now an accomplished professor who had graduated from our honors program a number of years prior, was evidently still haunted by his Rhodes interview as he told me about the questions he had been asked by and the answers he had given to his interviewers, answers that did not win him the scholarship. I met another former student and applicant who looked off into the distance—think Ajax’s thousand-yard stare—when remembering the one interview question that stymied him so completely he knew he had begun to circle the drain. After those two conversations, I resolved that, regardless of whatever else I might accomplish in my role as advisor, I intended to make sure that no student would be scarred by the process. My mantra for the six years I held the position was “Do no harm. ” It’s a pretty good oath for fellowships advisors, I feel, to this day. Competing for a major award is difficult even for stellar students. Done well, the process is edifying and extraordinarily helpful not only for those who win but also for those who don’t. Students who apply for prestigious national scholarships have, at minimum, a significant jumpstart on their graduate school plans and applications; more importantly, they have learned, through rigorous self-examination, about themselves and their values, interests, and career goals. Ample arguments and evidence for the positive and lasting value of competing for these major awards can be found in Suzanne McCray’s edited compilations Beyond Winning: National Scholarship Competitions and the Student Experience and Nationally Competitive Scholarships: Serving Students and the Public Good...|$|E

Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chief-editor of a publisher, who showed great interests in my research project on labor education in China, and agreed to publish it when it is completed. Inclusion, I deem the conference trip supported by A&PDF is very productive, and I greatly appreciate the financial support that I have received. Chinese proletariat was young and numerically weak in the 1920 s. These workers nevertheless played a decisive role in the great strike wave culminating in the mid- 1920 s. Western scholars have provided conflicting narratives of the Chinese labour, but they mainly worked within the same paradigm of social class, with emphasis on workers’ socio-economic and cultural lives as precondition of their emergence as a political force. This paper looks at a different dimension of Chinese labour movement through examination of workers’ activism and militancy in the context of Communist and nationalist movements. More specifically, it explores the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ’s propaganda and educational work as a key component of Communist labour unions’ organizational and mobilization strategy. This paper will first look at Shanghai workers’ anti-imperialist strike in 1919 as stimulation to left-wing May Fourth intellectuals’ embrace of Marxism and identification with workers. Then it traces the mass education campaign popular {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century as the prelude of the CCP’s education drive among workers. Further, two main components of CCP’s mobilization strategies—labour periodicals and workers’ school [...] will be discussed to show their contributions to workers’ unionization and militancy. Little work has been done on this theme both in China and in the West. Finally, this paper tries to shed light on the relation between intellectuals and workers in reference to Lenin and Gramsci’s theories on the issue...|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the breast milk section of the health risk {{assessment}} (Fitzgerald et al. 1992), as well as continued studies that resulted from a partnership between the Akwesasne community and the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany, demonstrated that fish consumption led {{to higher levels of}} PCBs in Akwesasne residents. Fingerprinting analyses established that fish caught in the St. Lawrence River offshore from the GM site were contaminated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same lightly chlorinated PCB congeners as the sediment collected offshore from the GM plant. This contamination was primarily Aroclor 1248, the PCB mixture used in GM’s die casting machinery (Hwang et al. 1993; Fitzgerald et al. 1995). This contamination was then traced from fish to humans: breast milk samples from women who ate local fish had a congener pattern that was much closer to perch, the preferred species of fish, than that found in women who ate little or no fish (Fitzgerald et al. 1998; Hwang et al. 2001). Similarly, Mohawk men who ate the most fish had a congener pattern similar to the fish studied (although their serum was more likely to contain more chlorinated PCB mixtures such as Aroclor 1254 and 1260, which have been traced to the Great Lakes, than the local mixture, Aroclor 1248) (Fitzgerald et al. 2007). This series of studies was significant because it demonstrated how PCBs could be fingerprinted as they migrated offsite from an industrial source, and traced into fish and then humans. Many Mohawks <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> referred to <b>the</b> St. Lawrence as the “lifeblood” of the community. By the contamination of the river, and hence the fish, Mohawk bodies were subsequently contaminated as well. Therefore cessation of fish consumption, which distanced Mohawks from this river, was lauded by the public health community as a means for preventing further exposure to contamination.|$|R
