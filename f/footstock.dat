A screw at the back was screwed into the heel of the boot, and three small spikes at the front kept the skate steady. There were holes in the <b>footstock</b> for leather straps to fasten it to the foot. The metal blades were {{slightly}} higher at the back than the front. In the 1890s fen skaters started to race in Norwegian style skates.|$|E
