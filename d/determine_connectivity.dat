40|$|We {{introduce}} a new family of connectivity-based garbage collectors (Cbgc) {{that are based on}} potential objectconnectivity properties. The key feature of these collectors is that the placement of objects into partitions is determined by performing one of several forms of connectivity analyses on the program.

The contributions of this paper are 1) a novel family of garbage collection algorithms based on object connectivity; 2) a detailed description of an instance of this family; and 3) an empirical evaluation of Cbgc using simulations.

Naturally occurring elemental signatures (or composition) in the otoliths of fish are an ideal natural tag due to the metabolic inertness of otoliths, continuous growth including daily increments and incorporation of elements that are influenced by environmental variables. In this paper, I review the use of otolith chemistry to <b>determine</b> <b>connectivity</b> between estuarine and coastal habitats focusing on assumptions of using elemental signatures as natural tags, consequences of violating these assumptions and finally providing examples of the application of natural tags to <b>determine</b> <b>connectivity.</b> As a first step to determining connectivity, it is important to determine whether fish residing in different estuaries do in fact have different elemental signatures. Spatial differences must be determined for each species of interest since variability has been found between species collected from the same location. For retrospective determination of origins of fish, it is also necessary to ensure either that there is no temporal variation at both the small (e. g. among months within a year) and large scale (e. g. among years) or to match adults to the appropriate year class of juveniles. In addition, fish should be collected from all possible source groups contributing to the group mixture. The majority of studies that show connectivity between estuarine and open coastal populations using otolith chemistry have determined the contribution of different habitats or estuaries to the adult population, although natal homing has also been examined.

This study focuses on Green River reservoirs in the Wells Draw study area where oil production response to implemented waterflood is poor and {{a better understanding of the}} reservoir connectivity is required to enhance future secondary oil recovery. Correlating the sand bodies between well locations in the area remains difficult at 40 -acre well spacing. Thus, interwell connectivity of the reservoirs is uncertain. Understanding the reservoir connectivity in the Wells Draw study area requires integration of all static and dynamic data for generation of probabilistic models of the reservoir at the interwell locations. The objective of this study is two-fold. The first objective was to <b>determine</b> reservoir <b>connectivity</b> at the interwell scale in the Wells Draw study area. To achieve this goal, I used well log and perforation data in the Wells Draw study area to produce probabilistic models of net-porosity for four producing intervals: (1) Castle Peak, (2) Lower Douglas Creek, (3) Upper Douglas Creek, and (4) Garden Gulch. The second objective was to find readily applicable methods for <b>determining</b> interwell <b>connectivity.</b> To achieve this goal, I used sandstone net thickness and perforation data to evaluate interwell connectivity in the Wells Draw study area.

We here review the results of such a framework for free-living marine nematodes. Although field experiments have illustrated substantial dispersal in nematodes at ecological time scales, analysis of the genetic diversity illustrated the importance of priority effects, founder effects and genetic bottlenecks for population structuring between patches < 1 km apart. In contrast, only little genetic structuring was observed within an estuary (< 50 km), indicating that these small scale fluctuations in genetic differentiation are stabilized over deeper time scales through extensive gene flow. Interestingly, nematode species with contrasting life histories (extreme colonizers vs persisters) or with different habitat preferences (algae vs sediment) show similar, low genetic structuring. Finally, historical events have shaped the genetic pattern of marine nematodes and show that gene flow is restricted at large geographical scales. We also discuss the presence of substantial cryptic diversity in marine nematodes, and end with highlighting future important steps to further unravel nematode evolution and diversity. </p...|$|E

Connectivity patterns of these regions may inform on mechanisms of action for DBS of these targets. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography were performed in 13 nondepressed subjects to <b>determine</b> <b>connectivity</b> patterns of SCCwm and ALIC. Tract maps were generated for each target in each subject, and tract voxels were coded as being unique to either target or shared. Group level tract maps were generated by including only those voxels common to at least 10 of 13 (> 75 %) subjects. RESULTS: The two targets have distinct patterns of connectivity with regions of overlap. The SCCwm showed consistent ipsilateral connections to the medial frontal cortex, {{the full extent of}} the anterior and posterior cingulate, medial temporal lobe, dorsal medial thalamus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and the dorsal brainstem. The ALIC seed, in contrast, demonstrated widespread projections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Common to both targets, albeit through distinct white matter bundles, were connections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, nucleus accumbens, dorsal thalamus, and hypothalamus.

40|$|The {{dispersal}} {{stages of}} organisms with sessile adults {{must be able}} to select habitats with suitable conditions for establishment and survival, and must also be able to reach those locations. For marine planktonic larvae, movement due to currents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimming behaviour, so transport is largely passive. Current patterns are determined by the interaction of geography with tidal forces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose an area-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features and meteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns and resultant connectivity among populations remains unclear. In this study, we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelled hydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spaced habitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. Larvae released from regions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitat availability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully. Extensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positive impact on the number of larvae arriving, as did low current velocities. However, relationships between numbers of arriving larvae and local geographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations. Local geography alone explained up to 50 % of the variance in success of larvae released and around 10 % of the variation in the number of larvae arriving at each site, but coastline properties fall short of predicting dispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows that meteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact strongly with local geography to <b>determine</b> <b>connectivity</b> in coastal areas...|$|E

One approach to unravel this knotty problem is to image serial thin sections of neural tissue with an electron microscope. In this thesis, I describe the first application of large scale serial electron microscopy to the ganglion of the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana. The leech ganglion is an ideal preparation for this experiment as it is compact enough in size that it is feasible to collect images spanning an entire ganglion. Here, I discuss results we collected from two image volumes of leech tissue. One spans a small region of adult ganglion neuropil, while the other includes an entire ganglion belonging to a juvenile leech. In these volumes, I reconstruct three-dimensional representations of neuronal arbors and locate the synapses between them. In Chapter 2, I show that we can differentiate neurons on the basis of where synaptic input and output sites are distributed throughout their arbors. In Chapter 3, I show that we can locate the synapses between pairs of neurons previously known to be connected, and that we can discover new synapses anatomically that are then recovered physiologically. Together, these results demonstrate the potential that this “connectomics” approach has when applied to the already physiologically accessible leech ganglion...|$|R
