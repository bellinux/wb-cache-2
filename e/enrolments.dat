5|$|With the English Reformation and the {{breaking}} of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; <b>enrolments</b> fell and teaching was neglected.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{province}} began including {{the school in}} their reports on student dropout rates. At the time, its rates were the highest in {{the province}}, with a total of six dropouts for every 100 students enrolled. In contrast, the district average was 0.9 dropouts per 100 <b>enrolments,</b> and the provincial average was 2.4 dropouts. The following year, the school's rate dropped to 5.4, remaining three percentage points above the provincial average. In 2007, it fell 2.2 points, down to 3.2 dropouts per 100 students, and finally settled at 2%, 0.2 percentage points below the provincial average of 2.2%.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} enrolled in Victorian universities was 241,755 at 2004, an increase of 2% on the previous year. International students made up 30% of <b>enrolments</b> and account for the highest percentage of pre-paid university tuition fees. The largest number of <b>enrolments</b> were recorded in the fields of business, administration and economics, with nearly a third of all students, followed by arts, humanities, and social science, with 20% of <b>enrolments.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1984 {{a change}} to the Commonwealth Electoral Act allowed for a closing date for the {{lodgement}} of changes to the electoral roll before an election. The period during which new <b>enrolments</b> and update of details could be made was set at seven days after an election is called. Many people either enrol or change their enrolment details in this period. For example, prior to the 2004 federal election 423,993 changes to enrolment received before the roll closing date. Of these, 78,816 were new <b>enrolments</b> and 225,314 were changes of address.|$|E

25|$|In 1880, {{the school}} became a Superior Public School, {{reaching}} {{a peak of}} over 1000 students in 1884. The school on Bolton Street was enlarged soon after and other schools opened, causing a drop in <b>enrolments.</b>|$|E
50|$|As a consequence, overall <b>enrolment</b> has trended up {{over the}} last decade. Whilst <b>enrolment</b> at Year 7 fell away from the very high initial levels it did trend up again until 2006. However, <b>enrolment</b> has fluctuated from this point {{including}} a sharp drop again in 2007. At Prep level, <b>enrolment</b> trended up until 2005 but declined steadily from this point. Current <b>enrolment</b> is 1176 in Years 7-12, and 751 in Years P-6, a total of 1927 students. With the ongoing growth in new housing estates in the surrounding area, and the steady supply of rental accommodation in the neighbourhood, the <b>enrolment</b> projection for the college is steady.|$|R
50|$|<b>Enrolment</b> {{has been}} {{compulsory}} for federal elections since 1912. Today, <b>enrolment</b> is mandatory for Australian citizens {{over the age}} of 18. <b>Enrolment</b> is optional for 16 or 17 year olds but they cannot vote until they turn 18. An individual has 8 weeks after turning 18 to register but may register at any time with no penalty being enforced for failure to register. <b>Enrolment</b> is voluntary for residents of Norfolk Island.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyze the influence of education on gross domestic regional product at 33 provinces in Indonesia. The analysis method that used in {{this research}} is multiple regressions with six independent variables such as literacy rate, years of school, <b>enrolment</b> rate 1, <b>enrolment</b> rate 2, <b>enrolment</b> rate 3, and population. The result shown that years of school and population had an influence on gross domestic regional product in Indonesia, and literacy rate, <b>enrolment</b> rate 1, <b>enrolment</b> rate 2, and <b>enrolment</b> rate 3 didn’t have an influence of gross domestic regional product.

25|$|The school Principal from 1997 to 2001 was Mark Anderson. On {{his arrival}} in 1997 <b>enrolments</b> had dropped from 1145 to 484 in the {{previous}} ten years. Anderson introduced a gifted and talented program to target the specialist needs of certain student interests to combat this {{and by the time}} of his departure, <b>enrolments</b> stood at over 600. In January 2002 Anderson took up the appointment of the founding Principal of the Sydney Secondary College, which had been created through the amalgamation of three inner-city high schools.

The <b>enrolment</b> data record comprises one or multiple biometric references and arbitrary non-biometric data such as a name or a personnel number.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{examines the}} relationship between country-level development indicators and the major indicator of the second Millennium Development Goal on education, the net <b>enrolment</b> ratio in primary education, using econometric analysis of panel data. Given that majority of studies analyzing the determinants of primary school <b>enrolment</b> use data from household surveys containing information about individuals, the study presented in this bachelor thesis investigates, whether variation in primary school net <b>enrolment</b> ratios can be explained using aggregate country-level data on adjusted net <b>enrolment</b> ratios and factors measuring development of particular economies. This study uses data on 192 countries for the period 1999 - 2012. The findings suggest that data on development are definitely useful in analyzing the determinants of school <b>enrolment,</b> but more detailed data containing information about individuals are needed to assess the causes of different levels of <b>enrolment</b> in individual countries in order to design policies to achieve universal primary education.

40|$|Abstract Household {{income has}} been shown to matter for children's school <b>enrolment,</b> in {{particular}} in settings where households face tight liquidity constraints caused by the lack of insurance and limited possibilities to smooth consumption through credit and savings. However, so far only few studies have made an effort to quantify the income elasticity of school <b>enrolment,</b> in particular in the Sub-Saharan African context. The empirical problem in identifying the causal impact of income on <b>enrolment</b> is to control for parental ability, which is largely unobserved, and to deal with reverse causality and measurement error. This paper uses for identification a natural experiment in Burkina Faso, a country with particularly low <b>enrolment</b> rates. The results show that naive estimates largely underestimate the true income elasticity of school <b>enrolment.</b> The results can provide a basis for safety net policies.

40|$|Over the years, <b>enrolment</b> {{rates of}} school-aged {{children}} have significantly been declining {{in spite of}} government efforts at stimulating school <b>enrolment</b> in Nigeria. It is equally discovered that while primary <b>enrolment</b> is nominally increasing, in real terms, it is abysmally nose-diving. Therefore, this paper examined the impact of primary school <b>enrolment</b> on economic growth in Nigeria between 1980 and 2010. The study utilized the Ordinary Least Square estimation techniques to analyze the empirical model of the study. The findings of the empirical investigation confirm that primary <b>enrolment</b> is veritable tools through which appreciable economic growth can be enhanced in Nigeria. The study equally observed that primary <b>enrolment</b> exhibit a strong predictive power in explaining variation in economic growth in Nigeria. The paper therefore recommends that there is need for government to adequately and conscientiously fund the education sector {{in the light of}} weak and sluggish trend of primary <b>enrolment</b> in Nigeria. Effective collaboration between the government and private sector is also considered indispensible for the development of education sector in Nigeria...|$|R
