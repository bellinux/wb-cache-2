5|$|Edward <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of}} the period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Drusus {{was married}} to his {{paternal}} cousin, Livilla, to bring him closer to the Julians.

5|$|Stories also link Bahuchara {{to gender}} {{variance}} after she becomes divine. One myth concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince {{in a dream}} and ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command {{them to do the}} same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be impotent. This myth is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.|$|E
5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|Piru Singh {{was born}} on 20 May 1918, in village Beri, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. He {{was the son of}} Lal Singh. His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh always hated school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his class teacher for quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, and never returned to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in their farm, and <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well-built and handsome youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E

25|$|The live-action {{portrayal}} closely {{follows the}} animated version, {{but with some}} differences.

Approximately half of the newly hatched chicks will be male and would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> roosters, which do not lay eggs. For this reason, the hatchlings are culled based on gender. Most of the male chicks are usually killed shortly after hatching.|$|R

25|$|There are variances {{about the}} Momotarō's process of growth; {{one is that}} he grew up to meet the {{expectation}} of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do anything. It {{is possible that the}} Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children.

25|$|Baldwin <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a capable, if not brilliant, {{military}} commander. By age 24 however, Baldwin felt {{he could}} take some responsibility in governance. Melisende had hitherto only partially associated Baldwin in her rule. Tension between mother and son mounted between 1150 and 1152, with Baldwin blaming Manasses for alienating his mother from him. The crisis reached a boiling point early 1152 when Baldwin demanded the patriarch Fulcher to crown him in the Holy Sepulchre, without Melisende present. The Patriarch refused. Baldwin, in protest, staged a procession in the city streets wearing laurel wreaths, a kind of self-crowning.|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of their}} yearly raids, usually in the late winter or spring, the Comanche drove their {{captured}} livestock back to Texas. They sold or traded the horses and mules at several American trading posts as far north as Bent's Fort in Colorado. They needed the captives, mostly children, as laborers. The boys were put to work taking care of their horse herds. The girls assisted in household chores, including preparing buffalo skins for sale as robes. The boys often <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Comanche warriors and the girls often became one of several wives of Comanche men. A few of the captives were ransomed.|$|E

25|$|In France {{during the}} chaotic {{years of the}} French Revolution and its aftermath, the younger Audubon <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{handsome}} and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly {{found out that he}} was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer's qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He was cheerfully back on solid ground and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds.|$|E
25|$|Robert Hooke {{was born}} in 1635 in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles. Robert {{was the last of}} four children, two boys and two girls, and there was an age {{difference}} of seven years between him and the next youngest. Their father John was a Church of England priest, the curate of Freshwater's Church of All Saints, and his two brothers (Robert's uncles) were also ministers. Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church. John Hooke also was in charge of a local school, and so was able to teach Robert, at least partly at home perhaps due to the boy's frail health. He was a Royalist and almost certainly a member of a group who went to pay their respects to Charles I when he escaped to the Isle of Wight. Robert, too, <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a staunch monarchist.|$|E
