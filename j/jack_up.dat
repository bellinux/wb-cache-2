5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the {{continued use of}} tolls by suggesting they were necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E
500|$|Within the level, {{there were}} four large lakes or meres, of which the biggest was Whittlesey Mere. It was used for leisure boating, and was {{described}} by Celia Fiennes in 1697, who stated that it was [...] long and [...] wide, and noted that it was sometimes dangerous, since it was prone to sudden winds rising up 'like hurricanes'. In order to maintain and improve the route between Salters Lode Sluice on the Great Ouse and Stanground Sluice on the River Nene, another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1754. This created Commissioners to manage the waterways, with powers to charge 3 old pence (1.25p) per ton on goods entering the system through either of the sluices. Agricultural produce was carried through Salters Lode, bound for Kings Lynn, while coal, timber and groceries moved in the opposite direction. Pleasure boats were specifically excluded from paying tolls, as were certain products including manure, compost, malt dust, pigeons' dung and some varieties of oil cake. Another account {{of the system is}} provided by George Walpole's Journal of the Voyage round the Fens in 1774, which was made in a fleet of nine boats, all of which were towed by a single horse called Hippopotamus when there was insufficient wind for sailing. Carpenters were employed to <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> or remove bridges which were too low for the boats to pass, and although the expedition lasted for 22 days, Walpole only recorded one gang of lighters, which delayed them as Salters Lode.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later, the Landlord finds his flat burgled, his life savings gone. He {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from his middleman Uncle Seven, offering him a job to kidnap baby Lee on behalf of a triad boss, who claims the baby is his grandson. Enticed by the HK$7 million reward, Thongs and Octopus accept the job without knowing its objectives, finding out only after the Landlord has fled the Lees' mansion with the baby. Disgusted by the idea of kidnapping a baby, Thongs threatens to return him, but relents after the Landlord tells him of his predicament. En route to their rendezvous point in Sai Kung, the trio encounter a police road block which the Landlord attempts to outrun, only to crash his van down a hill. As the police close in on them, the stuck Landlord instructs Thongs and Octopus to leave with the baby. While in custody for reckless driving, the Landlord learns of the baby's value through the news. He phones Thongs, instructing him not to hand the baby over to anyone prior to his release so he can <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> the price. Over the next few days, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby, developing a strong bond with him. The two begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife. Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the non-delivery of his [...] "grandson", sends his men to retrieve the baby from Thongs' flat. Confronted by both the triads and Police Inspector Mok, Thongs and Octopus go into hiding with the baby.|$|E

500|$|The Bears {{kicked off}} the regular season at home against the Cincinnati Bengals. The game was the teams' first meeting since 2009, in which the Bengals won 45–10. Since , the Bears dropped two of three games to the Bengals, winning 24–0 in 2001, while losing 24–7 in 2005 and 45–10 in 2009. The two teams entered with {{defenses}} that {{ranked in the top}} six in 2012, but the Bears were ranked 16th in scoring at 23.4 points per game and 28th overall on offense, while the Bengals had an average score of 24.4 PPG and were 22nd in total offense. Among the Bears' strategies that should be utilized include trying to protect Jay Cutler, as six of the Bengals' linemen had combined for 129 career sacks. The Bears' offensive line allowed 44 sacks in 2012, and as a result, changed the line by adding veterans Jermon Bushrod and Matt Slauson to supplement Roberto Garza on the left, while rookies Kyle Long and Jordan Mills joined Garza on the right side, marking the first time the Bears offensive line featured two rookies since Jim Covert and Rob Fada in 1983. The Bears' defense had to apply pressure to Andy Dalton, whose quick release led to four play-action touchdown passes to A. J. Green in 2013, the third most in the NFL. Bears' radio announcer Jeff Joniak wrote, [...] "Marc Trestman owns the element of surprise, a true asset in Week 1. There is not much tape on Trestman for the Bengals to game plan from. It's old tape with very different personnel from a different time and place in the NFL. Trestman will try to use this asset to his advantage and a quick strike early in the game will <b>jack</b> <b>up</b> the crowd, and give the team a foundation to build on." [...] The Bears captains team captains for the season, starting with the Bengals game, were Cutler and Roberto Garza on offense, Lance Briggs and Julius Peppers on defense and Patrick Mannelly on special teams. 2013 was Mannelly's sixth consecutive season as captain, the fifth season for Cutler, third for Garza, fourth for Peppers and first for Briggs.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the morning}} Jack was sent {{out with the}} four-and-twenty cows, and the place {{he was told to}} drive them to had not a blade of grass in it for them, but was full of stones. So Jack looked about for some place where there would be better grass, and after a while he saw a field with good green grass in it, and it {{belonging}} to a giant. So he knocked down a bit of the wall and drove them in, and he went up himself into an apple-tree and began to eat the apples. Then the giant came into the field. [...] "Fee-faw-fum," [...] says he, [...] "I smell the blood of an Irishman. I see you where you are, up in the tree," [...] he said; [...] "you are too big for one mouthful, and too small for two mouthfuls, and I don't know what I'll do with you if I don't grind you up and make snuff for my nose." [...] "As you are strong, be merciful," [...] says <b>Jack</b> <b>up</b> in the tree. [...] "Come down out of that, you little dwarf," [...] said the giant, [...] "or I'll tear you and the tree asunder." [...] So Jack came down. [...] "Would you sooner be driving red-hot knives into one another's hearts," [...] said the giant, [...] "or would you sooner be fighting one another on red-hot flags?" [...] "Fighting on red-hot flags is what I'm used to at home," [...] said Jack, [...] "and your dirty feet will be sinking in them and my feet will be rising." [...] So then they began the fight. The ground that was hard they made soft, and the ground that was soft they made hard, and they made spring wells come up through the green flags. They were like that all through the day, no one getting the upper hand of the other, and at last a little bird came and sat on the bush and said to Jack, [...] "If you don't make an end of him by sunset, he'll make an end of you." [...] Then Jack put out his strength, and he brought the giant down on his knees. [...] "Give me my life," [...] says the giant, [...] "and I'll give you the three best gifts." [...] "What are those?" [...] said Jack. [...] "A sword that nothing can stand against, and a suit that when you put it on, you will see everybody, and nobody will see you, and a pair of shoes that will make you ran faster than the wind blows." [...] "Where are they to be found?" [...] said Jack. [...] "In that red door you see there in the hill." [...] So Jack went and got them out. [...] "Where will I try the sword?" [...] says he. [...] "Try it on that ugly black stump of a tree," [...] says the giant. [...] "I see nothing blacker or uglier than your own head," [...] says Jack. And with that he made one stroke, and cut off the giant's head that it went into the air, and he caught it on the sword as it was coming down, and made two halves of it. [...] "It is well for you I did not join the body again," [...] said the head, [...] "or you would {{have never been able to}} strike it off again." [...] "I did not give you the chance of that," [...] said Jack. And he brought away the great suit with him.|$|E
