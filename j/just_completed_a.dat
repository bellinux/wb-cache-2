5|$|In 1897, Gallaher's Ponsonby club {{won eight}} of their nine matches {{en route to}} the Auckland club championship. He was {{selected}} to play for Auckland against the New Zealand representative side that had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> tour of Australia. The Aucklanders won 11–10 after scoring a late try; it was only New Zealand's second loss of their eleven-match tour. Later that year Gallaher was selected for Auckland's three-match tour where they defeated Taranaki, Wellington and Wanganui. Wellington's defeat was their first loss at home since the formation of the Wellington Rugby Football Union in 1879. The following season was less eventful for Gallaherhe played much of the season for Ponsonby, but injury prevented his selection for Auckland.|$|E
5|$|The second type, {{triggered}} by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a 3D map and passing {{through all of}} a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a Chaos Emerald; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become Super Sonic at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles. Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a post-credits scene in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.|$|E

5|$|Gamma: Hyde of the Dark Dimension follows Okabe, and {{is set in}} the gamma attractor field; he {{got there}} when {{attempting}} to undo the changes caused by his friend Luka Urushibara's D-mail in the Steins;Gate game. He discovers that in this world line, he is a Rounder partnered with Moeka Kiryu, and that they have <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> mission to kill Europol agents who have discovered their identities. He runs to the laboratory to shift to the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe from becoming a dictator, leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a catastrophy and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and is not expected to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that they are like family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E

25|$|In mid-August 1971, {{authorities}} removed Genie from Butler's {{house and}} returned her to Children's Hospital. Later {{the same day}} they transferred her to David Rigler's home, where she stayed for approximately four years. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, one of whom left for college shortly after Genie arrived. For the duration of Genie's stay Rigler's wife, Marilyn, was her teacher; Marilyn had graduate training {{as a social worker}} and had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in both nursery schools and Head Start Programs.

25|$|In August 1811, {{three months}} after Fort Astor was established, David Thompson {{and his team of}} British North West Company explorers came {{floating}} down the Columbia to Fort Astoria. He had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> journey through much of western Canada and most of the Columbia River drainage system. He was mapping the country for possible fur trading posts. Along the way he camped at the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers and posted a notice claiming the land for Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort on the site (Fort Nez Perces was later established there). Astor, concerned the British navy would seize their forts and supplies in the War of 1812, sold to the North West Company in 1812 their forts, supplies and furs on the Columbia and Snake River. The North West Company started establishing more forts and trading posts of their own.|$|E

25|$|In early August, Hansen {{suggested}} to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler's application, and Rigler initially {{balked at the}} idea but decided to talk it over with his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training {{as a social worker}} and had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in nursery schools and Head Start Programs. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, which Jay Shurley said made them consider themselves more suitable guardians for Genie than Butler. They ultimately decided that, if no one else would, they were willing to temporarily care for Genie until another suitable foster home became available. Rigler acknowledged the proposed arrangement would clearly put him in a dual relationship with her, but Children's Hospital and authorities decided that, in the absence of other adequate options, they would consent to making the Riglers Genie's temporary foster parents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the other}} semifinal, Rutgers faced LSU. Rutgers's {{appearance}} in a Final Four game seemed improbable {{earlier in the}} season, when the Scarlet Knights lost four of their first six games, and played so poorly that their coach C. Vivian Stringer revoked their access to their locker room. However, their play, particularly their defense, improved, and they were now a game away from a possible appearance in a national championship game, if they could defeat LSU, who had Sylvia Fowles as a dominant center. Fowles, who {{would go on to}} be the second overall WNBA draft pick the following year, had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> double-double against Connecticut, scoring 23 points, snaring 15 rebounds and blocking 6 shots. Rutgers held her to five points while missing eight of her ten field goal attempts. Rutgers pulled out to a 37–19 lead at halftime, and went on to win, holding LSU to 35 points, an NCAA record low in a Final Four game.|$|E
25|$|On the {{emergence}} of the communist regime in Romania, Celan fled Romania for Vienna, Austria. It was there that he befriended Ingeborg Bachmann, who had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Facing a city divided between occupying powers and with little resemblance to the mythic capital it once was, which had harboured the then-shattered Austro-Hungarian Jewish community, he moved to Paris in 1948. In that year his first poetry collection, Der Sand aus den Urnen ("Sand from the Urns"), was published in Vienna by A. Sexl. His first few years in Paris were marked by intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, as expressed in letters to his colleagues, including his longtime friend from Cernăuţi, Petre Solomon. It was also during this time that he exchanged many letters with Diet Kloos, a young Dutch singer and anti-Nazi resister who saw her husband of a few months tortured to death. She visited him twice in Paris between 1949 and 1951.|$|E

25|$|At {{approximately}} 1:30 on {{the morning}} of 14 September 2005, the cliff over the houses of Hatlestad Terrasse broke apart; the resulting slide of clay, mud and rocks did not collapse the buildings. The debris flowed through the ground floors of several houses and buried ten people. Occupants on higher floors were not touched by the flowing debris and were then evacuate through non-first floor windows. The municipality and the city hospital were both put on disaster alert, and a large number of emergency responders, including 12 ambulances, were sent to the scene. The first unit to reach the site was a fire engine which arrived only three minutes after the slide, as it was already in the area, having <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> water draining mission, and it was able to use its siren to awaken residents for the start of an evacuation. In addition to firefighters and paramedics, the Civil Defense and the National Guard also responded. Search dogs were used to locate survivors because heavy machinery could not be deployed due to the unstable nature of the ground; the extraction of buried survivors was made by hand, and with tools such as axes and shovels.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine Department Air Force {{was formed}} on 6 May 1941 as the War Department hastily {{reversed}} course {{and attempted to}} upgrade its air defenses in the Philippines.

Marshall had also given Clagett a top-secret mission to go to China in mid-May for a month of observation and assessment of Japanese tactics. The PDAF's only major unit, the 4th Composite Group, consisted of five squadrons based at two grass fields: Clark and Nichols. A third airfield, Nielson Field, lacked facilities and was used primarily as an administrative strip for nearby Fort McKinley. An isolated sod auxiliary strip at Iba on the west coast was used for gunnery training. PDAF's materiel was centrally located in the Philippine Air Depot at Nichols Field, easily targeted from the air and highly inflammable. The only existing antiaircraft defenses were a single battery of four 3-inch gun M1903 guns and a searchlight platoon at Fort Wint at the entrance to Subic Bay, which would only be marginally reinforced in September.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration asked Whiting {{to search}} for the wreck of the U.S. Navy {{submarine}} , which sank 15 nautical miles (28km) off Cape May, New Jersey, in September 1920. Whiting, which had <b>just</b> <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> summer in port at Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts, to conduct hydrographic survey operations in New England, paused off Cape May in late July 2001 {{to search for}} the wreck. Whitings survey department approached the project as it would any typical hydrographic survey. Information on snags – obstructions on the ocean bottom that snarl fishing nets and gear – that local recreational fishermen had reported and reports of possible locations of the wreck from divers that had visited it provided Whiting with possible targets for her search. After her crew had prepared a plan for a systematic search, Whiting moved from target cluster to target cluster, mapping the ocean bottom using sidescan sonar. After eight hours of searching, Whiting found the wreck of S-5 directly over one of the suspected targets, made a sonar image of the wreck, and recorded its exact location. Whiting then made several more passes over the wreck to acquire additional images of it at various angles before leaving the scene. NOAA donated the sonar data NOAAS Whiting gathered to the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, for archiving and display.|$|E
