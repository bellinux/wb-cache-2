40|$|Traditionally, {{international}} {{real estate}} investments are mainly conducted through direct investments in foreign properties. Due to the recent securitization and globalization trends {{in the real estate}} capital markets, the international real estate securities investment has been growing fast and gaining more popularity than the direct real estate investment because of its absence of the portfolio management and monitoring problems. Foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposure is inevitable for the international investments. To minimize the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> and hedge investment returns, investors have been spending a huge amount of time and money on developing and implementing currency hedging strategies without paying enough attention on studying and testing the significance of the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk.</b> Since {{there is no doubt about}} the existence of the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk,</b> the importance of studying foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> is to avoid unnecessary hedging costs. By forming 6 study questions, applying the international real estate securities market indexes & U.

Is the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> significant across time? 2. Does the significance of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> change across time? 3.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide new {{evidence}} on the pricing of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> {{in the stock market}} by testing international asset pricing models (IAPMs) under varying market structures and different exchange rate measures. It is composed of three essays. In the first essay, I test unconditional asset pricing models with <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> using country, portfolio and firm level data from nine emerging markets (EMs). It is shown that unlike the case for developed markets where unconditional tests often fail to detect a significant <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premium in stock returns, <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> is unconditionally priced in EMs. However, when local market risk is introduced in the model to take into account potential segmentation effects, <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia are totally subsumed by local risk premia for most countries especially at the firm level. The second essay examines the significance of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> in conditional IAPMs using multivariate GARCH-in-Mean specification and time varying prices of risk. The model tested assumes partial integration and uses real exchange rates to account for both inflation <b>risk</b> and nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>risk.</b> The main empirical results support the hypothesis of significant <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia in EMs equity returns even after accounting for local market <b>risk.</b> The <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia are also economically significant as they represent on average 18 percent of total premium, and may reach up to 45 percent of total premium for some countries over sub-periods. In the third essay, I test for the pricing of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> in stock returns using globally diversified sector portfolios. The {{purpose of this}} test is to examine the effect of cross-currency diversification on the global price of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk.</b> Since there is no previous evidence on this issue, I use data on the G 7 countries and EMs. The results suggest that the effects of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> may be less significant in pricing global assets such as global...|$|R

Drawing from the closed-end country fund literature, {{we argue that}} both differential access to information by foreign versus local investors and different sources of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> that investors face (economic or translation exposure) will lead to different pricing of the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> associated with American Depositary Receipt (ADR) investments. We apply a two-step method to country portfolios of ADRs of Australia, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Our results show that foreign investors generally price <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> differently from local investors, and that the source and magnitude of differences in <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> pricing vary significantly across countries. Although significant differences in pricing <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> between foreign and local investors are observed for Australia, France, and Japan, no such pricing difference is noticed for the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the pricing differences observed for Australian and French ADRs are mainly attributed to the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> of underlying share returns (economic exposure), whereas the pricing differences for Japanese ADRs are mainly attributed to the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> associated with currency translation (translation exposure).

40|$|An {{important}} issue in global corporate risk management {{is whether the}} multinationality of a firm matters {{in terms of its}} effect on <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposure. In this paper, we examine the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposure of US firms during 1983 - 2006, comparing multinational and non-multinational firms and focusing on the role of operational hedging. Since MNCs and non-multinationals differ in size and other characteristics, we construct matched samples of MNCs and non-multinationals based on the propensity score method. We find that the multinationality in fact matters for a firm's exchange exposure but not in the way usually presumed - the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposures are actually smaller and less significant for MNCs than non-multinationals. The results are robust with respect to different samples and model specifications.

The analysis {{is based on the}} stochastic discount factor methodology, which imposes a no arbitrage condition on the relationship between the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premium and its macroeconomic determinants. Estimation results suggest that U. S. inflation and consumption growth are important factors driving the risk premium, which is in line with the standard C-CAPM model. In addition, growth in international oil prices influences the risk premium, reflecting the important role played by the hydrocarbon sector in GCC economies. The methodology employed in this paper can be used for forecasting the risk premium on a monthly basis, which has important practical implications for policymakers interested in the timely monitoring of risks in the GCC.

40|$|Market {{segmentation}} and <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> are {{two main}} factors that distinguish international financing and investment decisions from domestic ones. Existing studies of market segmentation have been conducted within a framework in which <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> is not explicitly recognized. This paper performs a joint test of market segmentation and <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> pricing based on individual stock data from seven major countries, outside of the U.

The maximum likelihood method is used to estimate risk premia, and factor analysis is used to provide additional evidence on the pricing of risk factors. The results indicate that (a) {{the factor structure of}} asset returns is internationally heterogeneous, (b) many national capital markets can be described as partially segmented, rather than the polar cases of complete segmentation or integration, and (c) <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> is a significant factor affecting asset returns in addition to the domestic and world market risk factors. © 1997 JIBS.
