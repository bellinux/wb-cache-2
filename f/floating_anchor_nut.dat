50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a <b>nut</b> plate, <b>anchor</b> <b>nut</b> or <b>anchor</b> plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> and as <b>floating</b> <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts.</b> The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate Vespel for potential application on the Solid Rocket Booster to replace all-metal deformed self-locking <b>nuts</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> and be used as self-locking elements for bolts and screws. The Vespel self-locking elements were tested for prevailing torque retention at room temperature, after heating to 450 F and exposure for 3 hr, breakaway torque at 450 F and for vibration at a level consistent with the maximum expected on the SRB at lift-off and reentry. The investigation revealed Vespel has properties that can provide a self-locking capability for threaded fasteners up to 450 F and it can be used in <b>nuts</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> for installation on the SRB. Vespel elements in bolts did not meet all our SRB requirements for reuse, however, we have defined a design for Vespel elements in nuts/anchor nuts that fully meets all requirements. It is recommended that No. 1, 1 / 4 in. and 5 / 16 in. nuts/anchor nuts be procured for use on the SRB. This system will eliminate the galling problems now encountered and achieve a much higher reuse life than the present deformed nut design...|$|R

40|$|Italy is {{a country}} {{susceptible}} to various and numerous natural disasters; landslide hazard {{is certainly one of}} the most important topics here, so the research for innovative and cost-effective solutions for landslide stabilization has great scientific and socio-economic relevance. This PhD fits the context by studying and developing a new technique for the stabilization of landslides, called “floating anchor”, both in theoretical and applied aspects. The technique involves the installation of passive nails in the landslide body, cemented along the entire profile with a sufficient foundation in the deep stable soil. The anchors fit the slope according to a discontinuous geometry without a continuous facing. Each anchor head connects only to a small concrete plate (the “floating” element), which may be bored in the soil. The reinforcements absorb by frictional contact a portion of the shear stress induced by the moving landslide, slowing down its evolution process until it completely stops. It is a modular and flexible technique; the system fits the soil deformations without losing effectiveness. The PhD work analyses all the components of the system in order to assess the geotechnical and structural behaviour. A comparison with the techniques commonly used for landslide stabilization highlights the main advantages of the <b>floating</b> <b>anchors,</b> both in efficiency and cost terms. An important part of the research focuses on the experimental analysis in a 1 g scale physical model of the behaviour of floating plates as a function of their shape. An equation for the calculation of the bearing capacity of the floating plate with the introduction of specific shape and volume factors has been determined. A FEM analysis provides a numerical model calibration based on the experimental results and highlights the influence of the plate on the soil stress-strain state. Specific guidelines for the design of <b>floating</b> <b>anchors</b> are proposed according to two physical-mathematical configurations: one “static” short-term approach and one long-term approach, assuming a non-linear viscous behaviour of the soil. At last, some applications complete the research: the development of a particular enhanced anchor bar (the “composite anchor”), and the design and execution of some stabilization works with <b>floating</b> <b>anchors</b> in four real landslides activated in North-Eastern Italy in conjunction with the exceptional rainfall that affected the area in autumn 2010. The monitoring of the stabilized slopes proves the viability and technical efficiency of the method...|$|R
60|$|It may {{be easily}} {{believed}} {{that there was no}} conversation during those hours of elemental strife, though the thoughts of each were busy enough. At last the thunder ceased, or, rather, retired as if in growling defiance of the world which it had failed to destroy. Then the sky began to lighten a little, and although the wind did not materially abate in force it became more steady and equal. Before noon, however, it had subsided so much that Moses suggested the propriety of continuing the voyage. To this Van der Kemp agreed, and the <b>floating</b> <b>anchor</b> was hauled in; the large paddle was resumed by the hermit, and the dangerous process of turning the canoe was successfully accomplished.|$|R

"I should lash {{the mast}} and the sail and our paddles and the {{firewood}} together, fasten our mooring rope {{to them and}} throw them overboard, that would keep us head to sea--because these things would all float in the water, and the wind would not get hold of them.

You see our weight would be down quite low in the boat then, and that would keep her steady. Oh, we should get on capitally if there were plenty of room for us to drift." ...|$|R

40|$|Safe {{participation}} in the sport of rock climbing is dependent on using a range of equipment and using appropriate techniques. However, the level of safety achieved {{will depend on the}} specific equipment used, in terms of design, type, adequate load rating and condition, and also upon the climbing technique as this can significantly help to minimise any impact loads in the advent of a fall. In addressing these issues, this paper describes some mechanical tests which have been carried using a specially designed drop load rig in which falling weights have been applied to samples of climbing rope to establish impact loads. The load-time histories have been recorded and peak loads have been compared with those determined theoretically. In addition, some new and also used <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> have been test loaded to failure and the different failure modes which resulted are described. Finally, the general design of climbing equipment is discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

60|$|The spar and sail acted {{not only}} as a <b>floating</b> <b>anchor,</b> but as a breakwater, and the white crested waves, which came on as if they would break upon the boat, seemed robbed of half their {{violence}} by the obstruction to their course, and passed under the felucca without breaking. For forty-eight hours the gale continued; {{at the end of that}} time it ceased almost as suddenly as it had begun. The sun shone brightly out, the clouds cleared entirely away. It was some hours before the sea went down sufficiently for Gervaise to attempt to get the spar on deck again. It was a heavy task, taxing his strength to the utmost, but after a deal of labour it was got on board, and then raised to its position at the masthead; the sail was shaken out, and the felucca again put on her course.|$|R
50|$|In the atmosphere, {{the risk}} factors of wind and {{lightning}} come into play. The basic mitigation is location. As long as the tether's anchor remains within two degrees of the equator, it {{will remain in the}} quiet zone between the Earth's Hadley cells, where there is relatively little violent weather. Remaining storms could be avoided by moving a <b>floating</b> <b>anchor</b> platform. The lightning risk can be minimized by using a nonconductive fiber with a water-resistant coating to help prevent a conductive buildup from forming. The wind risk can be minimized by use of a fiber with a small cross-sectional area that can rotate with the wind to reduce resistance. Ice forming on the cable also presents a potential problem. It could add significantly to the cable's weight and affect the passage of elevator cars. Also, ice falling from the cable could damage elevator cars or the cable itself. To get rid of ice, special elevator cars could scrape the ice off.|$|R
