5|$|We should infer in {{the case}} of a {{beautiful}} dwelling-place that it was built for <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> and not for mice; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the dwelling-place of the gods.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the palace and <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> became {{symbols of the}} {{slightly}} risqué glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.|$|E

50|$|It {{was placed}} in <b>its</b> <b>owner's</b> back garden and was given a {{cosmetic}} makeover. In the 1990s, <b>its</b> <b>owner</b> died and <b>its</b> future became uncertain.

5|$|During the Civil War, Troy's {{industries}} {{played a}} key role in supporting the Union cause. The Burden Ironworks is said to have supplied all the Union Army's horseshoes, and another local ironworks supplied the USS Monitors hull plating. <b>Its</b> <b>owners</b> would later produce the first Bessemer process steel in the United States after the war.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling {{families}} in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs {{were kept in}} luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later spread {{to other parts of}} Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, 2012, {{upon the}} {{announcement}} of the fourth-generation iPad, the third-generation iPad was discontinued.

5|$|The 2010 {{off-season}} proved limited {{activity on}} the Avs' part. Stan Kroenke bought full ownership in the St. Louis Rams of the NFL in 2010. Since the NFL does not allow <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> to hold majority control of major-league teams in other NFL cities, Kroenke turned over day-to-day control of the Denver Nuggets and Avalanche to his son Josh {{toward the end of}} 2010, and must sell his controlling interest in both teams by 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Odeon Cinema {{was opened}} 2 June 1952 and, was later rebranded {{in the early}} 21st century as the Forum cinema. <b>Its</b> <b>owners,</b> however, {{struggled}} to meet tough competition from the Cineworld Cinemas group, which opened a 10 screen multiplex on the waterfront centre in St. Helier on reclaimed land in December 2002 and the Odeon closed its doors in late 2008. The Odeon is now a listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Skye Bridge {{opened in}} 1995 under a private finance {{initiative}} {{and the high}} tolls charged (£5.70 each way for summer visitors) met with widespread opposition, spearheaded by the pressure group SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls). On 21 December 2004 {{it was announced that}} the Scottish Executive had purchased the bridge from <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> and the tolls were immediately removed.|$|E
50|$|Using GPS asset {{tracking}} technology can allow a locationized gun to transmit a message though a cellular network to <b>its</b> <b>owner</b> if {{the gun is}} removed from its normal location. GPS tracking could then allow its location to be known by <b>its</b> <b>owner</b> and/or law enforcement to assist in recovery of the gun.|$|R

5|$|The western tomb {{was built}} {{subsequently}} {{to the eastern}} one and seems to have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre, <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family {{to be buried in}} Abusir, the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor.|$|E
5|$|Against the {{background}} of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to <b>its</b> <b>owners.</b> In August, after the East India Company refused to grant a loan, Lord Cottington seized the company's stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 (far below its market value), promising to refund the money with interest later.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to <b>its</b> <b>owners,</b> and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear who cares for David's well-being.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Department of National Heritage {{bought the}} castle from <b>its</b> <b>owners.</b> The {{government}} agency English Heritage {{took control of}} the castle in 1984 and a scheme to reopen the property to visitors was put forward in 1993. This included a final assessment of the archaeological work of the previous decades, and the castle finally opened to the public again in 1994. As of 2015, the castle is open to visitors through guided tours organised by the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|It {{closed in}} 1840 after <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> {{suffered}} bankruptcy, but re-opened in 1841. It changed hands in 1842, and was permanently closed in 1859. The land was redeveloped {{in the following}} decades, but slum clearance in the late 20th century saw {{part of the original}} site opened up as a public park. This was initially called Spring Gardens and renamed in 2012 as Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. It is managed as a public park by the London Borough of Lambeth. Vauxhall Gardens is depicted in a tile motif at Vauxhall tube station, done in about 1971 by George Smith.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} the {{serialisation}} of Cigars that Wallez was embroiled in a scandal after {{he was accused of}} defaming the Bureau of Public Works. The accusation resulted in a legal case being brought against the newspaper, and in response <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> demanded Wallez's resignation, which was tended in August 1933. Without Wallez, Hergé became despondent, and in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 and 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
5|$|Middleton was {{occupied}} before the Norman Conquest and {{recorded in the}} Domesday Book of 1086. It developed as a manorial estate and <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> began to exploit the coal seams that outcropped within its boundaries. At {{the start of the}} Industrial Revolution a wooden wagonway was built to link the coal pits to Leeds. The colliery agent, John Blenkinsop designed an iron railway and its first steam-powered locomotive which was built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck. The coal mines on which the local economy was based lasted until 1967 and the railway is preserved and run by a trust after operating for 200 years.|$|E
5|$|The 141 W. Jackson address {{hosted the}} former tallest {{building}} in Chicago designed by William W. Boyington {{before the current}} Holabird & Root structure, which held the same title for over 35 years until being surpassed in 1965 by the Richard J. Daley Center. The current structure {{is known for its}} art deco architecture, sculptures and large-scale stone carving, as well as large trading floors. An aluminum, three-story art deco statue of Ceres, goddess of agriculture (particularly grain), caps the building. The building is a popular sightseeing attraction and location for shooting movies, and <b>its</b> <b>owners</b> and management have won awards for efforts to preserve the building and for office management.|$|E
