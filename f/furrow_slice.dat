The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the <b>furrow</b> <b>slice</b> from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

40|$|Double {{cropping}} of paddy fields {{has become}} possible under rainfed condition {{with the introduction}} of improved varieties of rice with shorter term of growth and higher yields (HYVs) that were introduced in the 1960 s, and has progressively grown since then in Sri Lanka. The double cropping coupled with the labour intensive paddy production technology affected not only on the previous system of low-land utilization but also buffalo keeping and upland farming which were closely integrated with low-land farming during the single cropping. The dissemination of double cropping has compeled farmers to concentrate more on the improvement and maintenance of soil fertility, that might be exhausted through continuous cropping. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine and ascertain the development trend towards the double cropping of paddy fields with the changes of production technology and management strategies, from the aspect of improving soil fertility. For this purpose, a traditional village, Moragalla, was selected. Findings are summarized as follows: 1. The double cropping has been spread without any improvement of the field tracts. In addition to storing water for paddy fields, the higher and larger levees provided multipurposive benefits, such as grass cutting for buffaloes, growing some subsidiary crops on the top of levees, drying and temporarily storing reaped paddy produce. The usage of the levees in this way has coincided with single cropping of paddy fields, but has disintegrated mainly due to the changes of forming practices and the labour scarcity under the double cropping system since the 1960 s. The labour required for the maintenance of levees even has sometimes been cut. As a result, levee-breakes have tended to increase and accelerate soil erosion of the field. The reduction of the grass cut on the levees has also made it inconvenient for peasants to keep buffaloes. 2. The sharp reduction of buffalo numbers in the 1970 s was due to insufficient pasturing. The reasons for this were: (1) the lack of fallowed paddy fields which were fallowed in the yala season but were now raised to rice under the double cropping system in the paddy fields, (2) coconut lands on which the buffaloes previously pastured became scarce due to the introduction of intertilled crops such as banana, and (3) the decrease of waste lands, much of which had been reclaimed to coconut. The decrease in the number of buffaloes has resulted in poor manuring of paddy fields. 3. The lack of land improvement adversely affected not only on achieving higher yields of HYVs, but also the raising of other subsidiary crops on the paddy fields to improve the soil conditions through crop rotation. 4. Because of the yield sharing tenancy system and the traditional customs involved therein the adoption of advanced production technology is somewhat retarded. It goes without saying that there is less incentive for improving soil conditions under this system. 5. The iron (mold-board) plough replaced the indigenous wooden plough in the later part of the 1960 s. They were well suited for cultivating HYVs in the sense of ploughing speed and ploughing weeds under <b>furrow</b> <b>slices.</b> However, negatively, there have been some demerits. The ploughing with iron plough requires a larger quantity of water to cover the larger <b>furrow</b> <b>slices</b> and larger size of buffalo teams for trampling operations. The partial introduction of tractor ploughing since the 1960 s is also not more than a substitute for buffalo driven ploughing. 6. The development of farming practices has been centered on broadcast sowing on muddy soil with the application of chemical fertilizer both for basal and top dressings and chemical weedicides. This has tended to degenerate and ignore the traditional dry farming. It is the time to reevaluate the traditional dry farming, which has many merits, ie. : minimizing water requirements and labour input, and lowering farmers’ expenditure on chemical fertilizers and weedicides. 以上,スリランカのKurunegala県Moragalla村の家族経営による水稲作を中心とした経営様式の変遷を,農業生産力上昇のメカニズム,とりわけ地力再生産の在り方に注目し,近代的農法の発展過程を指標にして分析してきた. 時代の推移に伴い水稲の年 1 作(単作) から年 2 作(連作) になり,それが水田の土地利用率の向上をもたらし,農家の増収意欲を高め,農家への商品経済を浸透させてきた. この水稲作技術体系の変化は台地におけるココヤシ栽培や自給的野菜作部門と水牛飼育とも深い関係を持っている. Moragalla村における農業の変遷に見られる特徴を農法的視角から要約すれば以下の通りである. 1. 1950 年代までは水田畦畔の利用方法が水稲作の年 1 作と水牛飼育及び他の穀作や野菜作とうまく結びついていた. しかし水田の基盤整備が行なわれないままに,マハ期･ヤラ期を通ずる水稲の 2 期作が普及していったため,稲作の集約化は種々の困難に直面した. 水稲の 2 期作によって,貯水機能を兼ねた高い水田畦畔の補修労働が倍加したのみならず,畦畔の利用も規制され,水牛飼料(畦畔草) の採取が困難となり,また自給に供せられた穀物や野菜の作付けも困難となった. さらに水田休閑の解消は水牛の飼育を困難にし,頭数の減少をひきおこした. 水牛頭数の減少は,在来の木製犂に代えてより能率的な鉄製犂の導入を促していった. ここに見られる限り農法の近代化が進展している如くである. しかしその近代化は,水牛飼養を中心にした旧来の地力再生産機構の解体過程であった. 2. 従来からの田越灌漑のシステムはそのままであるため,改良品種の導入に伴って実施すべき用水管理は妨げられている. また農具の不備は,整地や除草作業の土で種々の困難をもたらしている. 水田畦畔は貯水機能を兼ねているため水牛の通行すら容易でない. 水稲の 2 期作化によってヤラ期における畦畔補修が必要となり,こうして畦畔補修作業は年 2 回遂行されるようになったが,時にその補修はおろそかになりがちである. 近年における畦畔決壊の増加傾向はそれを示すものであろう. 3. Moragalla村における小作には二種の形態が見られる. いずれの形態においても旧い社会的な慣習と結びついており,耕作者(小作人) の権利が抑制されている. そのため土地改良はおろか,稲の増収をはかるための改良技術の採用すらおさえられている. 4. 稲作の 2 期作化に伴って水牛の飼料基盤は縮小していったが,Moragalla村では,未墾地(台地) の開墾=ココヤシ園化によって一層飼料基盤は縮小された. 他方,乏しくなった堆肥や家庭残渣はココヤシ園に振向けられ,今ではMoragalla村の稲作は完全に化学肥料に依存することとなった. 5. 木製犂から鉄製犂への転換は,必ずしも深耕あるいは地力増進を契機とするものではなく,作業のスピード化と雑草抑制のためである. 大型トラクターの導入もまた同様の目的によっている. こうして地力による水稲の増収ではなく,化学肥料の増投による増収が追究されつつある. いまや省力化追求が稲作技術改善の中心的課題となり,除草も除草剤による傾向が顕著である. かつての地力維持の機構は解体されてしまったといっても過言ではない. 果たしてこのような変化が農法の進歩であろうか. 現在定着している湛水直播方式のみではなく,忘れられつつある乾田直播方式を軸にした農法を再検討すべきではないか. 用排水分離を前提にした耕地基盤の整備を考えるとき,代かき用水を必要としない乾田直播方式は極めて重要な意義をもつと思われる...|$|R

On the other hand, fertilizer treatment significantly, (p< 0. 05) decreased the carbohydrate and the calorific value of the leaves of the plants. The increase in the concentrations of these substances as a result of fertilizer of fertilizer treatment might be due to the role of fertilizer in chlorophyll content of plant’s leaves, which in turn enhanced the process of photosynthesis leading to increased synthesis of these substances. The decrease in the carbohydrate content might be due to its conversion to other materials in the plants. The results obtained were discussed in line with current literatures...|$|E
