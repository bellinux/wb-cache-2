50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> is {{a heater}} that works {{by using a}} fan to pass air over a heat source (e.g. a heating element). This heats up the air, which then leaves the heater, warming up the {{surrounding}} room. They can heat an enclosed space such as a room faster than a heater without fan, but, like any fan, create audible noise.|$|E

50|$|In {{convection}} heaters, {{heating elements}} either warm the air directly or heat oil or another filler, {{which in turn}} transfers heat to the air. The air then warms the objects {{and people in the}} space. Convective heaters are suitable for providing constant, diffuse heat in well-insulated rooms. Oil heaters warm up slowly but do not reach dangerous surface temperatures; wire-element heaters, which may be fan assisted, produce warm air more quickly but may pose a fire hazard. One particular type of convective heater is the <b>fan</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E

The DC01 became the biggest selling vacuum cleaner in the UK in just 18 months. By 2001, the DC01 made up 47% of the upright vacuum cleaner market.The company introduced a cylinder machine, the DC02, and produced a number of special editions and revised models (DC02 Absolute, DC02 De Stijl, DC05, DC04, DC06, DC04 Zorbster).

The ECC was standard equipment on the 1985-89 Buick Riviera and later the 1988-89 Buick Reatta, but was unpopular with consumers {{partly due to the}} technophobia of some traditional Buick customers, but mostly because of costly to repair technical problems suffered by the ECC's touchscreen which being the sole access method, would render climate control or stereo operation impossible.|$|E

50|$|On 11 November 2000, 161 {{passengers}} and one conductor boarded the funicular train {{for an early}} morning trip to the slopes. Prior to the passenger train leaving the lower terminus shortly after 9:00 am, the electric <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> in the unattended cabin {{at the lower end}} of the train caught fire, due to a design fault that caused the unit to overheat. The fire melted through plastic pipes carrying flammable hydraulic fluid from the brake system, resulting in the loss of fluid pressure which caused the train to halt unexpectedly 600 metres into the tunnel (this was a standard safety feature). Several minutes later, the train conductor, who was in the cabin at the upper end of the train (which was the front, since the train was ascending), realized that a fire had broken out, reported it to the control centre, and attempted to open the hydraulically operated doors, but the system pressure loss prevented them from operating. The train conductor then lost contact with the control centre, because the fire had burned through a 16kV power cable running alongside the length of the track, causing a total blackout throughout the entire ski resort.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This {{research}} focusses on investigating {{the sensitivity of}} thermal comfort to temperature in a heated space. Thermal comfort test sessions are conducted in a test house representative of a typical UK house during the winter season. A total of 119 participants {{took part in the}} series of tests conducted in the test house’s living room. Operative temperature in the heated space was maintained within the comfortable range recommended by CIBSE for a living room area in a UK house. Two different heating emitters were used for heating during the tests in order to examine their effects on occupant thermal comfort. Conventional radiators supplemented by a gas boiler and an electric <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> were investigated in the presence and absence of a circulation fan running {{in the corner of the}} room. Thermal comfort sensation of occupants was calculated using sensors installed in the living room (Fanger’s Predicted Mean Vote). At the same time the occupants were asked to fill in surveys which were used to record their Actual Mean Vote. From the test sessions conducted it was found that AMV predicted a neutral temperature of 23. 5 °C whilst PMV predicted a neutral temperature of 24. 0 °C thus PMV over predicted the occupant’s thermal sensation compared to AMV. For the four heating scenarios it was found that a convective <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> with a circulation fan causes the smallest temperature gradient (1. 0 oC) between ankle and head height for a seated occupant according to ISO 7730 standards. The highest temperature gradient was measured for <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> without a circulation fan (7. 3 oC).

Water quality parameters were measured weekly and room temperature was controlled using adjustable <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> and thermostat dipped in water. The results showed that embryonic development time varied with temperature with an inverse relationship. At a temperature range of 190 – 200 C it took six days for the eggs to hatch while the period was reduced to a half when the range was 310 – 320 C. The yolk absorption period was also inversely proportional to temperature...|$|E

5000|$|Electric <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> are {{unsealed}} appliances {{with live}} electric parts inside, {{so they are}} not safe to use in wet environments {{because of the risk}} of electrocution if moisture provides a conductive path to electrically-live parts. Electric <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> usually have a thermal fuse close to the heating element(s) to protect against overheating in the event of fan failure or air intakes becoming blocked, and a tip-over switch to shut the heater off when the fan outlet is not in the required orientation. Metal-cased heaters perform better in the case of possible fire-causing faults than plastic-cased ones, since the case will stay intact and is not flammable, but the metal case presents a higher risk of electrocution if a heater malfunctions.|$|R

50|$|Several {{efficiencies}} can {{be measured}} in regards to heaters, such as the efficiency of heating a room with a given amount of power, and the efficiency of the electrical generator which powers the heater and power loss from transporting the electricity over power lines. Measures may also consider how well a heater keeps the temperature of a space above a certain point. Such a measure would find inefficiencies in heating an already warm room. Many heaters (the majority of available models) are equipped with a thermostat to prevent this inefficient heating, which in turn reduces running costs. This feature was much more common in oil heaters than in the cheaper <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> until recently; thus many older oil heaters will be cheaper and more efficient to run than their contemporary <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> that lack the thermostat.|$|R
