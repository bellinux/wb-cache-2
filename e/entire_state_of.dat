5|$|October 23, 1878- The Gale of 1878, {{which makes}} {{landfall}} on North Carolina, brings hurricane-force winds to the <b>entire</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Delaware. The storm drops over 3inches (75mm) of rainfall {{in the northern}} portion of the state, flooding portions of Wilmington. The winds and rain from the storm damages or destroys many houses statewide. The flooding washes out railroads, roads, and bridges, and destroys many carriages in Dover. Crop damage is severe, as well. The strong winds wreck four ships, in total killing 14. A 7-foot (2.1m) storm surge in Lewes drowns four when they can't escape the rising waters. Beach erosion is severe, as well. Across Delaware, the hurricane kills18 and causes $45,000 in damage (1878USD, $1million 2008USD). It {{is one of only}} three storms to bring hurricane-force winds to the state.|$|E

5|$|Spain and {{subsequently}} Mexico controlled {{much of what}} is now the western United States until the Mexican–American War, including the <b>entire</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.|$|E

One of the routes assigned at this time was Route6, an Albany–Buffalo highway that followed the path of the Genesee Road and the Seneca Turnpike from Buffalo to Utica, the Mohawk Turnpike between Utica and Schenectady, and the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike from Schenectady to Albany. From Auburn to Chittenango, Route6 utilized most of the newer, northern branch of the Seneca Turnpike.|$|E

By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for the <b>entire</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E

About six days after Isabel made landfall, additional disaster recovery centers opened in Rock Hall in Kent County, California in Saint Mary's County, Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Chester in Queen Anne's County, Crisfield in Somerset County, Cambridge in Dorchester County, and Easton in Talbot County. Around a month after the hurricane, officials placed some residents unable to live in their damaged homes into travel trailers because they had no options for alternate housing, such as staying with a relative or friend.|$|E
