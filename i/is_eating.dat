Duchess eats greedily, believing she <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> her ham and veal pie.

She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring {{nature of the}} invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, and there are few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up its food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> in the fight and it falls to the ground below.|$|E

25|$|The Great Falls of the Missouri River formed {{because the}} Missouri is flowing over {{and through the}} Kootenai Formation, a mostly nonmarine {{sandstone}} laid down by rivers, glaciers, and lakes in the past.

The river <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> away at the softer nonmarine sandstone, with the harder rock forming the falls themselves.

25|$|One blessing over a {{particular}} food {{is sufficient for}} the entire meal and {{does not need to}} be repeated. A communal meal only needs one set of blessings for the entire group, but individuals dining together (albeit not as a group) must say the blessings individually. The food of primary importance is the one which a blessing is said for. However, if one <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> a sandwich, the blessing for the bread would be said rather than the blessing for the sandwich's contents, since bread is never considered being of secondary importance. One who drinks water should make a blessing over the water with the pie blessing.|$|E
25|$|IBD - Intestinal Bowel Disease causes {{frequent}} {{vomiting and}} weight loss in cats. Similar to Crohn's disease in humans, a cat's intestinal antibodies view food as the enemy and attack nutritional absorption {{as well as the}} cat's own organs and intestinal fluids. A daily immunosuppressant (such as Prednisolone)is required, as well as changes to the diet that include canned foods with single-source proteins and limited ingredients. Most felines with IBD also have several food allergies, including red meat proteins, fish oils, and gluten, which must be addressed in tandem with the disease. Regular vomiting in a cat is not okay; discuss the possibility of IBD with your vet. Undiagnosed or poorly-treated IBD can lead to death through malnutrition even in a cat who <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> regularly.|$|E

Elizabeth Nicholas, writing for The Sunday Times, thought David a [...] "gastronome of rare integrity" [...] who [...] "refuses... {{to make any}} ignoble compromises with expediency". Although John Chandos, writing in The Observer, pointed out that [...] "Let no one eating in London—with whatever abandon—imagine that he <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> Mediterranean food {{in the absence of}} Mediterranean earth and air", he finished his review by saying that the book [...] "deserves to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen".|$|E

500|$|Mike Masnick {{wrote about}} the case on Techdirt, commenting {{on the effect of}} Beck's actions on the meme's spread. He {{observed}} in retrospect it would have been advantageous for Beck to have simply done nothing rather than encourage the meme as a byproduct of his attempts to remove it from the Internet. Masnick pointed out that Beck's actions provided legitimacy to the meme's noteworthiness. Steffen Schmidt wrote of Beck's predicament in a Des Moines Register article: [...] "Mr. Beck has quite a task ahead of him. Shutting down one web site is like trying to eradicate Pueraria lobata the dreaded Kudzu vine that <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> the South." [...] Citizen Media Law Project observed Beck had exacerbated the situation by intimating legal tactics against Eiland-Hall, which served to increase the popularity of the meme and coverage of it among blogs.|$|E

[...] After which they all ridicule her she is worried that no one <b>is</b> <b>eating</b> a renewable source of food and finds some apples for the pioneers to eat, but they reject them. Eventually, she changes her last name to [...] "Appleseed", and leaves her family to journey across the United States and plant apple seeds wherever she goes. Meanwhile, the Simpsons change their surname to [...] "Bufflekill" [...] and they succeed in killing all the buffalo in the land. The travelers eventually starve, and just as they are about to cannibalize Homer, Connie returns and offers them apples instead.|$|E
