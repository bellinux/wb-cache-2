5000|$|Stearyl heptanoate, the ester of {{stearyl alcohol}} and heptanoic acid (<b>enanthic</b> <b>acid),</b> {{is found in}} most {{cosmetic}} eyeliner. It is prepared from stearyl alcohol, which may be derived from sperm whale oil or from vegetable sources.|$|E
5000|$|Heptanoic acid, {{also called}} <b>enanthic</b> <b>acid,</b> is an organic {{compound}} {{composed of a}} seven-carbon chain terminating in a carboxylic acid. It is an oily liquid with an unpleasant, rancid odor. [...] It contributes to the odor of some rancid oils. It is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and ether.|$|E
30|$|These {{compounds}} later underwent deep degradation to form benzene-type intermediates, {{the further}} oxidation of {{which resulted in}} aromatic ring cleavage and generation of aliphatic acids, such as hexanoic acid, <b>enanthic</b> <b>acid</b> and hexylacetic acid. Finally, these organic acids were decomposed to CO 2 to accomplish the entire mineralization process. The mechanism of the electrocatalytic oxidation process using Gd 3 +, Nd 3 + and Sm 3 + doped cerium oxides is briefly explained as follows.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} to contain <b>enanthic</b> (heptanoic) <b>acid,</b> palmic aldehyde, anisic acid, acetic acid, and phenols.|$|R
