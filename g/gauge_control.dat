50|$|Online {{computer}} control of steel making processes became a reality {{with the first}} use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was {{to set up the}} initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous {{computer control}} on November 1, 1962.|$|E

5000|$|However the new {{vessel was}} seriously {{overweight}} - {{by more than}} 100 tons - due to both design and Steel Supply, British Steel had installed a new Computerised <b>Gauge</b> <b>Control</b> at its Dalzell Plate production unit, and during the initial production of steel plate after its introduction it tended to produce plates still within the allowed manufacturing specification, but {{at or near the}} upper gauge allowed in the tolerance - resulting in the steel tending to be heavier than designed.In late autumn 1988 she was taken out of service for two weeks and sent to Tees Dockyard Ltd in Middlesbrough to be lengthened by 5.4 m (20 ft). The extent of this implant can most easily be observed when climbing the stairs from the car deck to the passenger accommodation. These stairs used to be a single flight, but now have a level section halfway up. The new length of hull made the vessel better both in terms of vehicle capacity (taking it to around 80) but also in that she handled better at sea with her overall speed increased slightly.|$|E

5000|$|The Mental and Motor Scales have {{remained}} relatively the same through all versions, with some changes {{made to the}} Behavior Rating Scale. These changes include: age range, norms altered to function more successfully with modernization, and greater validity and reliability. The Mental Scale presented in BSID-II assesses children using a normalized standardized scoring system - the Mental Development Index (MDI) - and a standard scoring system - the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI). The MDI is used to measure mental capabilities in children, including sensory and perceptual acuities, object constancy, memory, learning, problem solving, early verbal communication, early abstract thinking ability, and early number concepts. The PDI is used to <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> of the body, such as fine and gross motor skills. The Behavior Rating Scale presents a numerical assessment of a child's attention, arousal, orientation/engagement, emotional regulation, and motor ability. The BSID-III is most beneficial for studies regarding developmental, psychological, and neuropsychological information in children up to 42 months old; after 42 months of age the information becomes less reliable. [...] The amount of time required to administer the test depends greatly on {{the age of the}} child. This variability occurs because each portion of the test has specific instructions on how to administer it to the child. For instance, in the motor tasks there are certain positions the child is to be placed in. [...] When scoring the test, each task throughout both motor and cognitive is either given or not given credit based on how the child responds to the task that is presented. Notes are made along the way while administering the test if there are refusals made, items are omitted, or there is an issue with the caregiver report. In these cases, an examiner will go back and administer another exam to obtain data for that test.|$|E

Due to the coupled {{function}} of shape and <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> in rolling process, mutual effects {{must be considered}} when shape control or <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> is carried out. Traditional shape and <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> theories are of independent and the control systems are also separated, so {{it is difficult to}} ensure the quality of shape and gauge simultaneously. Based on the updated shape theory and a single parameter model of load distribution method, a combined shape and <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> method was developed, which can adjust rolling regulations on-line according to the deviation of strip crown measured at the exit of the rolling mill. The method can ensure gauge precision while strip crown is adjusted and the purpose of combined shape and <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> is reached...|$|E
40|$|To {{minimize}} the longitudinal strip thickness {{error in the}} hydraulic cold rolling industries and improve traditional AGC control scheme on this problem, we put forward a secure <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> system based on Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) and intelligent PI control strategy. The traditional automatic <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> (AGC) scheme depended on personal experience about the parameters. The new <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> system decreases the longitudinal strip thickness error via fuzzy control and ARM-based computing. Besides, this new system can be smaller than the traditional AGC system, and so {{is much easier to}} transport. The Fuzzy control scheme can increase the robustness of the ARM-based <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> system against some disturbances.

40|$|Automatic {{rolling process}} is a {{high-speed}} system which always requires high-speed control and communication capabilities. Meanwhile, {{it is also a}} typical complex electromechanical system; distributed control has become the mainstream of computer control system for rolling mill. Generally, the control system adopts the 2 -level control structure—basic automation (Level 1) and process control (Level 2) —to achieve the automatic <b>gauge</b> <b>control.</b> In Level 1, there is always a certain distance between the roll gap of each stand and the thickness testing point, leading to the time delay of <b>gauge</b> <b>control.</b> Smith predictor is a method to cope with time-delay system, but the practical feedback control based on traditional Smith predictor cannot get the ideal control result, because the time delay is hard to be measured precisely and in some situations it may vary in a certain range. In this paper, based on adaptive Smith predictor, we employ multiple models to cover the uncertainties of time delay. The optimal model will be selected by the proposed switch mechanism. Simulations show that the proposed multiple Smith model method exhibits excellent performance in improving the control result even for system with jumping time delay...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} control is gaining {{importance}} {{in the field of}} allergic rhinitis (AR), with a visual analogue scale (VAS) score being a validated, easy and attractive tool to evaluate AR symptom control. The doctors' perception of a VAS score as a good tool for evaluating AR symptom control is unknown, as is the level of AR control perceived by physicians who treat patients. Methods: 307 voluntarily selected physicians attending the annual (2013) European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) meeting completed a digital survey. Delegates were asked to (1) estimate how many AR patients/week they saw during the season, (2) estimate the proportion of patients they considered to have well-, partly-and un-controlled AR, (3) communicate how they <b>gauged</b> this <b>control</b> and (4) assess how useful they would find a VAS as a method of <b>gauging</b> <b>control.</b> 257 questionnaires were filled out completely and analysed. Results: EAACI delegates reported seeing 46. 8 [standard deviation (SD) 68. 5] AR patients/week during the season. They estimated that 38. 7 % (SD 24. 0), 34. 2 % (SD 20. 2) and 20. 0 % (SD 16. 34) of their AR patients had well-controlled (no AR symptoms), partly-controlled (some AR symptoms), or un-controlled-(moderate/severe AR symptoms) disease despite taking medication [remainder unknown (7. 1 %) ]. However, AR control was assessed in many ways, including symptom severity (74 %), frequency of day-and night-time symptoms (67 %), activity impairment (57 %), respiratory function monitoring (nasal and/or lung function; 40 %) and incidence of AR exacerbations (50 %). 91 % of delegates felt a simple VAS would be a useful tool to <b>gauge</b> AR symptom <b>control.</b> Conclusions: A substantial portion of patients with AR are perceived as having uncontrolled or partly controlled disease even when treated.
