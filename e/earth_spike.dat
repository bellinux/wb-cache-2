As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the <b>earth),</b> <b>Spike</b> rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make people like him feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E
50|$|Spike {{was able}} to keep {{everyone}} from poking around in the Ark for a year or two, but he eventually stopped being Fortress Maximus full-time so he could live his life. Unfortunately, that meant some greedy/bored people were able to sneak into the Ark and poke around it in 1994... awakening Megatron! With nuclear weaponry turned against Earths cities by the Ark computer and zombie Decepticons roaming the <b>Earth,</b> <b>Spike</b> became Fort Max again and led a final battle alongside Josie Beller and G.B. Blackrock. The final battle was a bust: Fort Max was killed and Spikes mind and nervous system went with him.|$|E

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Decepticons' devastating attack on <b>Earth,</b> Commander <b>Spike</b> Witwicky met his dad inside a secret bunker where the {{remnants}} of the United States military had gathered to mount a desperate counteroffensive. Regrettably, Sparkplug had selected Spike for a mission to assassinate the leader of the Decepticons, Megatron, even though he feared his son would not make it back. It was a suicide mission, but Spike was the most qualified. Spike accepted, despite the consequences, but ignored his father's pleas for him to call his worried mother first.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, Bob and Lyn are rescued and rehabilitated at a camp run by PSIC, {{a private}} {{research}} firm engaged in psychic and psychological experiments on {{a herd of}} goats and some captured locals. To Lyn's dismay, Larry runs the firm and employs Django, now a depressed alcoholic. Bob spends time with Django and learns {{the ways of the}} New <b>Earth</b> Army. They <b>spike</b> the base's food and water with LSD and free both the goats and captured locals, in an attempt to remove the curse. Following this, Lyn and Django fly off in a helicopter, never to be heard from again, disappearing into the sky [...] "like all shamans".|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} use of unbalanced {{transmission lines}} was for electric telegraph communications. These consisted of single wires strung between poles. The return path {{for the current}} was originally provided by a separate conductor. Some early telegraph systems, such as Schilling's experimental needle telegraph (1832) and the Cooke & Wheatstone five-needle telegraph (1837) used by British railways required multiple code wires. Essentially, they were parallel bus coding. In these systems {{the cost of the}} return conductor was not so significant (one conductor in seven for Schilling's earliest needle telegraph and one conductor in six for the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph) but the number of coding conductors was progressively reduced with improved systems. Soon only one coding wire was required with the data being transmitted serially. Important examples of these single-wire systems were the Morse telegraph (1837) and the Cooke & Wheatstone single-needle telegraph (1843). In such systems the cost of a return conductor was fully 50 per cent of the cable costs. It was discovered that a return conductor could be replaced with a return path through the <b>Earth</b> using grounding <b>spikes.</b> Using <b>earth</b> return was a significant cost saving and rapidly became the norm.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} of all the Autobots' human allies, Spike Witwicky (voiced by Corey Burton in the English version and in the Japanese version by Show Hayami {{when he was young}} and by Masashi Ebara as an adult) was {{fourteen}} years old, aiding his father, Sparkplug, in his work on an offshore oil rig when the Transformers entered his life in 1984. A Decepticon attack on the rig left Spike and Sparkplug in peril where they were rescued by Optimus Prime. Afterward, they offered their friendship and aid to the Autobots, teaching them about the ways of <b>Earth.</b> <b>Spike</b> had a lot to learn about the robots in disguise, however, as one of his first actions saw him unwittingly bring the disguised Soundwave into Autobot Headquarters. He later aided Hound in battle against Rumble. When the Autobots were planning to return to their home planet of Cybertron, he intended to go with them.|$|E
6000|$|Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. [...] "He put {{his gloves}} on the chair, {{and he took}} the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. He thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him. As we know, he came back by the side gate. Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no {{possible}} escape. He forgot his gloves but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens {{in the direction of the}} bedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken refuge there. The <b>earth</b> round the <b>spike</b> had been left on the table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-pit and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?" ...|$|R
