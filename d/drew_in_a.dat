England U21s <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> UEFA European U21 Championship qualifying match there on 18 August 2006 against Moldova, in front of 13,556 spectators. In addition, a variety of other sports have been hosted at Portman Road, including athletics in 1927, an American football match in 1953, and several international hockey matches in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Lionel Barrymore (born Lionel Herbert Blythe; 1878–1954) was an American actor of stage, {{screen and}} radio. He also {{directed}} several films, wrote scripts, created etchings, sketches and composed music. He was the eldest {{child of the}} actors Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, and his two siblings were John and Ethel; these {{and other family members}} were part of an acting dynasty. Reluctant to follow his parents' career, Barrymore appeared together with his grandmother Louisa Lane <b>Drew</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stage production of The Rivals at the age of 15. He soon found success on stage in character roles. Although he took a break from acting in 1906–09 to train in Paris as a painter, he was not successful as an artist and returned to the US and acting. He also joined his family troupe, from 1910, in their vaudeville act.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening night}} was on Tuesday 13 September 1927 and <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crowd of 35,000 and the racing was {{dampened}} by persistent rain all evening. The opening race was the Chorley Wood Stakes {{and it was}} won by Baltard Castle over 500 yards {{in a time of}} 30.80 sec at 3-1 for trainer Sid Jennings. Another greyhound racing that evening was Ever Bright trained by John 'Jack' Kennedy and although only finishing third he would finish as runner-up in the 1927 English Greyhound Derby less than one month later. The original trainers were Kennedy, Jennings, William Spoor, Harry Buck and Reginald Grey. Track lighting was seen as a first time experience by most (football did not have floodlights for another 30 years).|$|E
500|$|Off {{the coast}} of Florida, the storm {{generated}} rough sea conditions with waves of up to 5ft (1.9 m); high surf lightly injured several swimmers and surfers in Brevard County. Strong rip currents swept dozens of people out to sea, but all remained unharmed and were quickly rescued. Additionally, the waves washed ashore venomous jellyfish that stung more than 200 people near coastal beaches. Scattered funnel clouds and waterspouts were reported overseas, though the phenomena dissipated soon thereafter without affecting land. Onshore, Bret's effects were minimal; weak morning showers and breezy winds briefly brushed Brevard and Volusia Counties. As the storm lifted out of the area, it <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large mass of dry air, limiting chances of much-needed rain to subdue a large wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp.|$|E

2500|$|Although Matsumoto <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of styles, certain {{features}} remain consistent. His characters have an air of intelligence without melancholy, and of cheerful optimism that is never saccharine. Other popular illustrators of the day were better suited to the niches in which Matsumoto was not in his element. The multi-talented and enormously popular Jun'ichi Nakahara (...) drew girls who were intelligent and stylish, but humor was not his forte. In the genre of sentimental melodrama, according to Akiko Horiguchi, no one was more popular than Hiroshi Katsuyama (勝山ひろし). But {{in an age when}} print media of all kinds were becoming increasingly visual, there was plenty of work to go around.|$|E

Recent Government actions to build political consensus on issues critical to reform have created a climate that is ripe for change. The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) acts as a champion for reform. The Minister, appointed in 1997, quickly established a committee for the reform of higher education (known as the HEEP Committee) which <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide range of stakeholders including industrialists and parliamentarians.
