5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E

40|$|A {{programmable}} FPGA-based {{digital logic}} circuit is enhanced with high-speed <b>emitter-couple</b> <b>logic</b> and optoelectronics laser drivers and receivers {{to create a}} testbed for evaluating methods of transferring parallel data words in sub-nanosecond bursts. The end application requires the transfer of entire address/data buss information within a single cycle of the computer processor, which is running at several gigahertz. In this paper, the programmable logic core is used to form a lowcost, yet very precise and flexible instrument for emulating the buss activity, converting the data to bitparallel format, transmitting optically, and capturing the received data. The testbed has been built to demonstrate complete end-to-end operation of a 4 -bit parallel slice of the communication channel. Bit periods shorter than 300 ps and timing precision of about 20 ps is demonstrated. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{equivalent}} of <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> {{made out of}} FETs is called source-coupled logic (SCFL).|$|E
50|$|For maximum performance, bipolar <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> was employed, {{even though}} its power {{consumption}} is large.|$|E
5000|$|Positive <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic,</b> {{also called}} pseudo-ECL, (PECL) {{is a further}} {{development}} of ECL using a positive 5V supply instead of a negative 5.2 V supply. [...] Low-voltage positive <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (LVPECL) is a power optimized version of PECL, using a positive 3.3 V instead of 5 V supply. PECL and LVPECL are differential signaling systems, and are mainly used in high speed and clock distribution circuits.|$|E
50|$|The concept, {{proposed}} in 1958, pioneered <b>Emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) circuitry, pipelining, and transistor memory with a design goal of 100x speedup compared to ILLIAC I.|$|E
50|$|Cydrome was {{a company}} {{producing}} VLIW numeric processors using <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) integrated circuits {{in the same}} timeframe (late 1980s). This company, like Multiflow, failed after a few years.|$|E
50|$|The R6000 was {{implemented}} with <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL). In the mid- to late 1980s, the trend was to implement high-end microprocessors with high-speed logic such as ECL. As MIPS was a fabless company, the R6000 chip set was fabricated by Bipolar Integrated Technology.|$|E
5000|$|After the Alto, PARC {{developed}} {{more powerful}} workstations (none intended as projects) informally termed [...] "the D-machines": Dandelion (least powerful, {{but the only}} to be made a product in one form), Dolphin; Dorado (most powerful; an <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) machine); and hybrids like the Dandel-Iris.|$|E
50|$|The chief {{designer}} of the circuits used in the IBM 608 was Robert A. Henle, who later oversaw the development of <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) class of circuits. The development of the 608 was preceded by the prototyping of an experimental all-transistor version of the 604. Although this was built and demonstrated in October 1954, it was not commercialized.|$|E
50|$|The {{present form}} of LVDS {{was preceded by}} an earlier {{standard}} initiated in Scalable Coherent Interconnect (SCI). SCI-LVDS was {{a subset of the}} SCI family of standards and specified in the IEEE 1596.3 1995 standard. The SCI committee designed LVDS for interconnecting multiprocessing systems with a high-speed and low power interface to replace positive <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (PECL).|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} performance, Cheetah had separate branch, fixed-point, and floating-point execution units. Many {{changes were}} made to the 801 design to allow for multiple-execution-units. Cheetah was originally planned to be manufactured using bipolar <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) technology, but by 1984 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology afforded an increase in the level of circuit integration while improving transistor-logic performance.|$|E
50|$|At General Electric Haanstra {{contributed to}} the design of Project Charlie, a line of medium sized {{machines}} intended to compete with System/360. He recommended the development of microcodeed peripheral controllers rather than hard wired units. It is likely that it was on his recommendation that <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) was chosen as the technology to be used for the new system.|$|E
50|$|The C2 was a crossbar-interconnected {{multiprocessor}} {{version of}} the C1, with up to four CPUs, released in 1988. It used newer 20,000-gate CMOS and 10,000-gate <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) gate arrays for a boost in clock speed from 10 MHz to 25 MHz, and rated at 50 MFLOPS peak for double precision per CPU (100 MFLOPS peak for single precision). It was Convex's most successful product.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) is a {{high-speed}} integrated circuit bipolar transistor logic family. ECL uses an overdriven BJT differential amplifier with single-ended input and limited emitter current {{to avoid the}} saturated (fully on) region of operation and its slow turn-off behavior.As the current is steered between two legs of an emitter-coupled pair, ECL is sometimes called current-steering logic (CSL),current-mode logic (CML)or current-switch emitter-follower (CSEF) logic.|$|E
50|$|The Cray-2 was {{the first}} of Seymour Cray's designs to {{successfully}} use multiple CPUs. This had been attempted in the CDC 8600 in the early 1970s, but the <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) transistors of the era were too difficult to package into a working machine. The Cray-2 addressed this through the use of ECL integrated circuits, packing them in a novel 3D wiring that greatly increased circuit density.|$|E
50|$|The VAX 8800 family central {{processing}} unit (CPU) operates at 22.22 MHz (45 ns cycle time) and is implemented with discrete <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) devices spread over eight modules. The majority of the ECL devices are macrocell arrays with 1,200 logic gates, while the general-purpose registers and floating-point units are custom logic devices developed by Digital. The CPU has 64 KB of cache implemented with 10 ns and 15 ns ECL random access memory devices.|$|E
5000|$|Each CPU was {{implemented}} with 13 Multi-Chip Units (MCUs), with each MCU containing several <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) macrocell arrays which contained the CPU logic. The gate arrays were fabricated in Motorola's [...] "MOSAIC III" [...] process, a bipolar process with a drawn width of 1.75 micrometres and three layers of interconnect. The MCUs were installed into a CPU planar module, which accommodated 16 MCUs and was 24 by 24 in in size.|$|E
50|$|Phase {{noise is}} {{another type of}} jitter {{observed}} in PLLs, and {{is caused by the}} oscillator itself and by elements used in the oscillator's frequency control circuit.

50|$|The X-MP CPU had {{a faster}} 9.5 {{nanosecond}} clock cycle (105 MHz), compared to 12.5 ns for the Cray-1A. It was built from bipolar gate-array integrated circuits containing 16 <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> gates each. The CPU {{was very similar}} to the Cray-1 CPU in architecture, but had better memory bandwidth (with two read ports and one write port to the main memory instead of only one read/write port) and improved chaining support. Each CPU had a theoretical peak performance of 200 MFLOPS, for a peak system performance of 400 MFLOPS.|$|E
50|$|The BiCMOS logic family {{employed}} the npn devices in the pull-up {{path of the}} BiCMOS gate, to form a low power CMOS logic family with high capacitive drive capability. Intel's BiCMOS technology was enabled by an innovative triple diffused npn transistor. This led to a highly manufacturable low cost process due to minimum number of additional process steps. In contrast, other companies employed BiCMOS to implement <b>Emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> for microprocessors, which consumed much more power. The BiCMOS circuits were developed for the Pentium processor family and its follow-on generations Pentium Pro, Pentium II processor family.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Gene Amdahl was {{committed}} to expanding {{the capabilities of the}} uniprocessor mainframe during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Amdahl engineers, working with Fujitsu circuit designers, developed unique, air-cooled chips which were based on high-speed <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) circuit macros. These chips were packaged in a chip package with a heat-dissipating cooling attachment (that looked like the heat-dissipating fins on a motorcycle engine) mounted directly {{on the top of the}} chip. This patented technology allowed the Amdahl mainframes of this era to be completely air-cooled, unlike IBM systems that required chilled water and its supporting infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|The Rice Institute Computer, {{also known}} as the Rice Computer or R1, was a 54-bit tagged {{architecture}} digital computer built during 1958-1961 (partially operational beginning in 1959) on the campus of Rice University, Houston, Texas, United States. Operating as Rice's primary computer until the middle 1960s, the Rice Institute Computer was decommissioned in 1971. The system initially used vacuum tubes and semiconductor diodes for its logic circuits; some later peripherals were built in solid-state <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic.</b> It was designed by Martin H. Graham.A copy of the machine called OSAGE was built and operated at the University of Oklahoma.|$|E
50|$|The 7030 CPU uses <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (originally called current-steering logic) on 18 {{types of}} Standard Modular System (SMS) cards. It uses 4,025 double cards (as shown) and 18,747 single cards, holding 169,100 transistors, {{requiring}} {{a total of}} 21 kW power. It uses high-speed NPN and PNP germanium drift transistors, with cut-off frequency over 100 MHz, and using ~50mW each. Some third level circuits use a 3rd voltage level. Each logic level has a delay of about 20 nS. To gain speed in critical areas emitter-follower logic is used to reduce the delay to about 10 nS.|$|E

5000|$|Physically indexed, {{virtually}} tagged (PIVT) caches {{are often}} claimed in literature to be useless and non-existing. [...] However, the MIPS R6000 uses this cache type {{as the sole}} known implementation. [...] The R6000 is implemented in <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic,</b> which is an extremely fast technology not suitable for large memories such as a TLB. The R6000 solves the issue by putting the TLB memory into a reserved part of the second-level cache having a tiny, high-speed TLB [...] "slice" [...] on chip. The cache is indexed by the physical address obtained from the TLB slice. However, since the TLB slice only translates those virtual address bits {{that are necessary to}} index the cache and does not use any tags, false cache hits may occur, which is solved by tagging with the virtual address.|$|E
50|$|The CPU had a 60 ns {{clock cycle}} (16.67 MHz clock frequency) and its logic was built from 20-gate <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> {{integrated}} circuits originally developed by TI for the ILLIAC IV supercomputer. The CPU had an extremely advanced architecture and organization for its era, supporting microcoded arithmetic and mathematical instructions that operated on scalars, vectors, or matrices. The vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture; where the vector operands were read from, {{and the resulting}} vector written to, memory. The CPU could be have one, two, or four vector lanes, allowing the CPU to produce one to four vector results every cycle, depending {{on the number of}} vector lanes installed. The vector lanes were also used for scalar instructions, and each lane could keep up to 12 scalar instructions in-flight simultaneously. The CPU, with four lanes, allowed up to 36 instructions in total across the entire CPU.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, SEL {{introduced}} a {{system based on}} <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) technology code named the Thunderbird. Its official marketing name became the Concept series, consisting of three models: the low-end [...] "coffee table" [...] Concept 32/67, and the refrigerator-sized Concept 32/87 and 32/97. These ran the company's proprietary MPX-32 operating system. With the additional of virtual memory hardware, the 32/67 and 32/97 models took on the designations of Powernode 6000 and Powernode 9000, with several variants of each available. These ran UTX-32, Gould's version of Unix based on a BSD 4.2 kernel developed by Purdue University to support multiprocessor systems. [...] The Powernode 9080 was a symmetrical dual processor system, with both processors having full access to memory and the I/O bus, and capable of being booted up from either processor. It was the first such commercially available system to run any version of Unix.|$|E
50|$|However, CMOS {{circuitry}} at {{that time}} was significantly slower than that of bipolar circuitry, especially the <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> that was widely used in vector supercomputer CPUs at the time. To compensate for this, the CPU was immersed in -196.15 °C liquid nitrogen for cooling. Although such cooling could potentially speed up the CMOS logic by a factor of four, in practice the liquid nitrogen cooling yielded an approximately twofold speed increase over air-cooled systems. However, because liquid nitrogen cooling yielded only marginal performance benefits, none of the ETA10 systems used such cooling for either the local or shared memories. It is of particular note that in order for this type of cooling to be effective, a closed-loop system was required. ETA had to innovate to make this possible, since there were not any commercially available solutions in the market. The 44-layer PCB was also innovative, and ETA had to develop new processes to manufacture it.|$|E
50|$|The vector {{processor}} has a 14 ns cycle time (clock rate of approximately 71.43 MHz). The vector registers are 256 elements wide, and each element is 64 bits wide. The S-810/20 has 32 of these registers, {{whereas the other}} models have 16. These registers are implemented with 1 kilobit (Kbit) bipolar RAM integrated circuits (ICs) with a 4.5 ns access time. All models have eight 256-bit vector mask registers and 48 vector address registers. All models have three load pipelines and one load/store pipeline for accessing the main memory. The S-810/20 has two lanes, each with two add, one multiply followed by add, and one multiply or divide followed by add floating point pipelines, {{for a total of}} twelve. The S-810/10 has one lane with the same configuration as the S-810/20 and therefore a total of six pipelines. CPU logic is implemented with two <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> gate array IC types, a 550-gate part with a 250 picosecond (ps) gate delay and a 1,500-gate part with a 450 ps gate delay.|$|E
50|$|The 1100/80 {{introduced}} a high speed cache memory - the SIU or Storage Interface Unit. The SIU was logically and physically positioned between the CAU(s)/IOU(s) and the Main Memory units. The {{first version of}} the 1100/80 system could be expanded {{to a maximum of}} two CAUs, and two IOUs. A later version was expandable to four CAUs and four IOUs. The CAU was capable of executing both 36-bit 1100 series instructions, and 30-bit 490 series instructions. The IOU, or Input/Output Unit was modular in design and could be configured with different Channel Modules to support varying I/O requirements. The Word Channel Module included four 1100 Series (parallel) Word Channels. Block Multiplexer and Byte Channel Modules allowed direct connection of high speed disk/tape systems, and low speed printers, etc. respectively. The Control/Maintenance Panel was now on the SIU, and provided a minimum of indicator/buttons since the system incorporated a mini-computer, based on the BC/7 (business computer) as a maintenance processor. This was used to load microcode, and for diagnostic purposes. The CAU, IOU, and SIU units were implemented using <b>emitter-coupled</b> <b>logic</b> (ECL) on high density multi-layer PC boards. The ECL circuitry utilized DC voltages of +0 and -2 volts, with the CAU requiring four 50 amp -2 volt power supplies. Power was 400 Hz, to reduce large scale DC power supplies.|$|E
40|$|High speed {{logic is}} used {{whenever}} improved system performance would increase a product’s market value. For a given system design, high–speed logic {{is the most}} direct way to improve system performance and <b>Emitter–Coupled</b> <b>Logic</b> (ECL) is one of today’s fastest forms of digital logic. Emitter – coupled logic offers both the logic speed and logic features to meet the market demands for higher performance systems. MECL Products ON Semiconductor (formerly a division of Motorola SPS), introduced the original monolithic <b>emitter–coupled</b> <b>logic</b> family with MECL I (1962) and followed this with MECL II (1966). These two families are now obsolete and {{have given way to}} the MECL III � (MC 1600 series), MECL 10 K�, PLL (MC 12000 series) and the new MECL 10 H � families...|$|E
