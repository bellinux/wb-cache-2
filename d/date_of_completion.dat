5|$|Construction for the Syretsko-Pecherska Line, the Kiev Metro system's third line, {{began on}} 23 February 1983. It had a {{projected}} <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> in 1986, although the line's opening was delayed {{until the end}} of 1989 due to the economic state of the Soviet Union at the time. The line's first segment was officially opened on 31 December 1989, and consisted of three stations; Zoloti Vorota–Palats Sportu–Mechnikova (named Klovska today).|$|E
5|$|The exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> {{is unknown}} but an extreme {{terminus}} ante quem {{is given by}} the death in 1431 of Pope Martin V, who {{is known to have}} visited the completed tomb; other factors may push the terminus ante quem back significantly into the 1420s. The most reliable such indication is that in September 1428 Jacopo della Quercia returned to Bologna and produced a wall tomb with Virtues reflecting in minute details the Cossa Virtues.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{regarding}} the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> are all known. It {{was intended as}} the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop– most likely {{with the aid of}} apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it was positioned on the high altar.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann. The project would upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would help make turns from US4 south to NY149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US4 and NY149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> for the $1.3million project would be in Fall2014.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edward's {{choice of}} {{architect}} is unknown, {{although it has}} been attributed to the mason William Arnold, who was responsible for the designs of Cranborne Manor and Wadham College, Oxford, and had worked at Dunster Castle, also in Somerset. Dunster has architectural motifs similar to those found at Montacute. Phelips chose as the site for his new mansion a spot close by the existing house, built by his father. The date work commenced is undocumented, but is generally thought to be c.1598/9, based on dates on a fireplace and in stained glass within the house. The date 1601, engraved above a doorcase, is considered to be the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} still under {{construction}} in January 1928, {{and at that time}} the estimated <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> was only a month away. The bridge finally opened to traffic on 14 April. The official opening of the bridge by the NSW Governor Dudley de Chair occurred on 10 July, and was celebrated by the cutting of the ribbon and an opening of the gates {{at each end of the}} lift span. In return he was presented with a silver cigarette case.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning {{the identity of}} the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show The Art of War had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han. Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the Art of War was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> are unlikely to be completely resolved. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li Quan and Du Mu.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} two documented first-person shooter {{video games}} are Maze War and Spasim. Maze War features on-foot gameplay that evokes modern first-person shooter games. Development {{of the game}} began in 1973 and its exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> is unknown. Spasim had a documented debut at the University of Illinois in 1974. The game was a rudimentary space flight simulator, which featured a first-person perspective. They were distinct from modern first-person shooters, involving simple tile-based movement where the player could only move from square to square and turn in 90-degree increments. Spasim led to more detailed combat flight simulators and eventually to a tank simulator, developed for the U.S. Army, in the later 1970s. These games were not available to consumers, however, {{and it was not}} until 1980 that a tank video game, Battlezone, was released in arcades. A version of the game was released in 1983 for home computers and became the first successful mass-market game featuring a first-person viewpoint and wireframe 3D graphics, presented using a vector graphics display.|$|E
5|$|Following {{more than}} two centuries of Arab rule, Armenia gained {{independence}} under the leadership of the Bagratid (Bagratuni) dynasty around 885. King Ashot III made Ani capital in 961, after which the city emerged as a prosperous urban center with 100,000 residents at its height. The construction of the cathedral began in 989. The architect Trdat was commissioned by Bagratid King Smbat II to build a cathedral in the new capital of the Armenian kingdom. The construction was halted when Smbat died in 989, according to an inscription on the south wall. Meanwhile, Trdat was hired to direct the repairs of the dome of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which had collapsed in an earthquake. Trdat returned from Constantinople in 993. The construction was continued and completed by Queen Katranide (Katramide), the wife of King Gagik I, Smbat's brother and successor. It was completed either in 1001 or 1010. According to Christina Maranci the generally accepted <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> is 1001, but it may have extended until 1010. The contradiction is based on the reading of the inscription of the cathedral's northern wall. The cathedral served as the seat of the catholicos, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church from its foundation in 1001 until the mid-11th century (1046 or 1051). Thus, for around half a century Ani was both the religious and secular center of Armenia.|$|E

However, he sees a bizarre tendency in that Amintiri skips over Cioculescu's time in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District is {{developing}} the West Lake Corridor project—a 9-mile {{extension of the}} south shore railroad from Hammond, IN south to the border of Munster, IN and Dyer, IN. The project will include two train stations in Hammond and two train stations in Munster (one station at Ridge Rd. & Manor Ave. and another station at Main St. & Columbia Ave.). In addition, a maintenance facility will be built either in Hammond or Dyer. If built in Hammond, then a layover facility will be built in Dyer.

Construction of the tunnel in Can Roca started in April 2007. Generalitat de Catalunya stated a budget of 178.8 million euros will be available for the construction of the Terrassa Metro, which will be made up of an addition to the Terrassa train stations belonging to the FGC line S1. FGC and Renfe budgets combined sum will sum 321 million euros. Renfe itself is going to build another station in the city: Terrassa Est - Passeig del Camp Parts of the Vallès line operated by FGC are actually already known under the collective name of Metro del Vallès, which will include the Terrassa service and the extension of S2 which will become Sabadell Metro in the almost adjacent municipality of Sabadell, which is already under construction.|$|E
