50|$|An <b>emagram</b> {{is one of}} four {{thermodynamic}} diagrams used {{to display}} temperature lapse rate and moisture content profiles in the atmosphere. The <b>emagram</b> has axes of temperature (T) and pressure (p). In the <b>emagram,</b> the dry adiabats make an angle of about 45 degrees with the isobars, isotherms are vertical and isopleths of saturation mixing ratio are almost straight and vertical. Usually, temperature and dew point data from radiosondes are plotted on these diagrams to allow calculations of convective stability or Convective Available Potential Energy. Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of a tephigram to indicate the winds at different heights.|$|E

50|$|However, {{using this}} {{configuration}} sacrifices the equal-area {{of the original}} Clausius-Clapeyron relation requirements between {{the temperature of the}} environment and the temperature of a parcel of air lifted/lowered. Although, it permits to analyze the cloud cover and the stability of the airmass, it thus does not permit to calculate the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). This is why the three other thermodynamic diagrams (<b>Emagrams,</b> tephigrams, and Skew-T log-P diagrams) are most often preferred, the latter in the USA now.|$|R
40|$|Lightning {{occurred}} in Alaska an extraordinary {{number of times}} 120, 000 a year, or 4 times more than average in 2004, 2005, and 2007, starting 500 forest and wild fires. Given the rainless conditions at the time, fires in 2004 and 2005 burned 10 % of Alaska’s forests. In 2007, however, fires were suppressed by rainy weather. To determine the causes of such unusual activity, we analyzed cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data for the last 22 years, since 1986, radiosonde data measured at Fairbanks, weather maps from various heights, and satellite images. This comprehensive analysis of thunderstorm activity clearly showed weather conditions during the disastrous lightning season of 2005. Yearly, monthly, and daily lightning trends and conditions surrounding ordinary cell thunderstorm formation over Alaska are discussed. Conditions related to the exceptionally large number of occurrences on June 15, 2005, were clarified based on 11 days of weather maps and <b>emagrams</b> and considering {{a wide variety of}} weather conditions. The most anomalous lightning conditions occurred when center of thermal low and 500 hPa persistent high was in close proximity over Alaska...|$|R
50|$|First devised in 1884 by Heinrich Hertz, the <b>emagram</b> is used {{primarily}} in European countries. Other countries use similar thermodynamic diagrams {{for the same}} purpose. However, {{the details of their}} construction vary.|$|E
50|$|A skew-T log-P diagram {{is one of}} four {{thermodynamic}} diagrams {{commonly used}} in weather analysis and forecasting. In 1947, N. Herlofson proposed a modification to the <b>emagram</b> that allows straight, horizontal isobars and provides for a large angle between isotherms and dry adiabats, similar to that in the tephigram. It was thus more suitable for some of the newer analysis techniques being invented by the United States Air Force.|$|E

Verys 1919 publication: [...] "The radiant properties of the earth from the standpoint of atmospheric thermodynamics" [...] (Occasional scientific papers of the Westwood Astrophysical Observatory).

40|$|Though {{the method}} of {{adiabatic}} charts {{has been applied to}} thermodynamical problems in meteorology for a long time, especially in aerology their use has been flourished remarkably during last twenty years, and in this period quick treatments of observational data of aerology and quick calculations of their heights were required, because many aerological observatories were established and at each place aerological observations were carried out several times a day. So far in meteorological circles a well known method by barometric formula has been used as procedures of height calculations for these data. (cf. 1 (i)). About twenty years ago, however, {{in order to reduce the}} complication inherent in these procedures, Stuve proposed a method to utilize adiabatic charts for this purpose, whose adoption has since prevailed quickly in the aerological circles. Moreover a few special adiabatic charts have appeared, suitable to the above requirement about the quick height calculation. At the same time some theories about height calculations on adiabatic charts and the mutual relations among these charts appeared also as below. We shall classify the recent development of these theories into the following four classes. (i) Stuve's theory to reduce the height problem of actual atmosphere on <b>Emagram</b> (T-logp) to that of isothermal atmosphere or dry adiabatic one. (ii) Theories of height calculation on Tephigram by Shaw, Brunt and Arakawa. (iii) Refsdal's theory of Aerogram. (iv) Yamaoka's theory for the transformation of adiabatic charts and his proposition of Taikisendzu (Atmospheric Chart). As shown in the above classification new adiabatic charts such as Aerogram and Taikisendzu have appeared recently, convenient to the height calculation on these diagrams. According to the author's opinion, contrary to the usual considerations about Tephigram, it belongs to the same family of adiabatic charts as Aerogram etc. as regards to the convenience of height calculation. Though the general theories for height calculation are described in the above classification (iii) and (iv), Yamaoka's (iv) is, however, considered to be superior to Refsdal's theory (iii). But there remains some questions to be discussed-their assumptions and mutual relations among these diagrams. In this paper we shall consider mainly these problems, and make good Yamaoka's theory, but in our paper the whole problem is treated quite differently from Yamaoka's. In 1 preliminary notes on fundamental equations and the theory for height calculation so far used are described as fundamentals for the further development of our theory. In 2 conditions to be satisfied for our aim are discussed, as the above coordinates lead to the partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere's type, its general solution being given in 3. In 4 the outline of Yamaoka's theory is described and its results are compared with ours. In 5 mutual relation among Aerogram, Taikisendzu and Tephigram is derived from our general formula and rough sketch of each case is also delivered...|$|E
