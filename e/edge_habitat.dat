The most mature upland forest is Best Woods (K17) and the oldest upland forest restoration is Stork Forest (G4). Until recent changes in land use, the upland forests were highly fragmented and shaped {{in such a way that}} they were plagued by edge effects.

50|$|Another {{endangered}} species is the flooded jellyskin (Leptogium rivulare). It {{is a native}} type of lichen that lives on trees on banks and edges of waterways. It has blue-grey lobes with small brown discs on top, which act as its fruiting structures. In the spring it is translucent and looks jelly like, hence the name. As it sucks in water and as the year goes on it takes on its grey and brown colors. They reproduce by producing spores, and they let out their spores in the springtime when there is high water. Their skin is packed with cyanobacteria, a type of blue green bacteria that uses photosynthesis to produce sugars and the jellyskin lives off the sugars produced. The main threat to the flooded jellyskin {{is that it has}} a very limited range. Even worse {{is that one of the}} tree species that the lichen commonly live on is black ash. Indirectly the lichen is in danger as the emerald ash borer made its way to North America. The black ashes dying off could also lead the flooded jellyskin to do the same. Also as housing developments are being put in, its waters <b>edge</b> <b>habitat</b> is diminishing, giving it a smaller range. A conservation effort has been to preserve waterside forests on public land, which is their preferred habitat.|$|E
50|$|The noisy miner {{has benefited}} from the {{thinning}} of woodland on rural properties, heavy grazing that removes the understory, fragmentation of woodland that increases the percentage of <b>edge</b> <b>habitat,</b> and urban landscaping practices that increase open eucalypt environments. It {{has been described as}} a 'reverse keystone' species, as it is colonizing an ever-increasing range of human-dominated habitats, and aggressively excluding smaller bird species from urban environments. This phenomenon has been also observed in rural areas. A field study across the South West Slopes of New South Wales, showed that the noisy miner's presence corresponded with reduced numbers of insectivorous birds such as fantails, whistlers, the restless flycatcher (Myiagra inquieta), and other honeyeater species, and that this decrease was most marked in sites with better access to water and nutrients. While it has been hypothesized that the proliferation of large-flowering grevillea cultivars has contributed to the abundance of noisy miners, recent research has identified the proliferation of lightly treed open areas, and the presence of eucalypt species as the most significant factors in the population increase. Large-flowered grevillea hybrids such as Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' can benefit the noisy miner, in that an abundance of resources is usually dominated by larger aggressive honeyeaters, and a continuous nectar source could provide an advantage for the non-migratory species. A field study in box-ironbark country in central Victoria found miner numbers were correlated with the occurrence of yellow gum (Eucalyptus leucoxylon), which reliably produces flowers (and nectar) each year. The abundance of the noisy miner is primarily determined by habitat structure.|$|E

50|$|More so than diurnal {{varieties}} of raptor, fairly {{significant numbers of}} owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded <b>edge</b> <b>habitat.</b> In a block of Wisconsin, great horned owls {{were responsible for the}} failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests. Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves. In a pair of studies from Colorado, the average weight of prey for long-eared owls was 28 to 30 g, 46 to 57.1 g for barn owl and 177 to 220 g for the great horned owl. Both young and adult great grey owls, despite their superficially superior size, are apparently hunted with impunity by great horned owls. In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations. Great horned owls were the leading cause of mortality in juvenile spotted owls (30% of losses) and juvenile great grey owls (65% of losses). Less is known about relations with the snowy owl, which may compete with great horned owls for food while invading south for the winter. Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} threats that Tropical Andes face every day. One {{of the main}} threats is human {{activities}} especially with the increasing population. Some activities include mining, logging, and construction. Humans also use land for agriculture and keep relocating once the land is used up. Valleys are severely degraded due to humans living there. Hydroelectric dams have also been put in the Tropical Andes and negatively pressured cloud forests. The 25 percent of land that is protected is still poorly managed with little help from the public from lack of education. Invasive species have also been {{a threat to the}} Tropical Andes' land and species, possibly brought in from humans. A couple invasive species include the American bullfrog and certain grasses used for cattle. [...] Humans have the ability to cause habitat loss and habitat fragmentation for species. The forest habitats that are threatened in the Tropical Andes are modified and destroyed 30 percent faster than lower tropical areas. [...] Fragmentation causes a separation within species and decreases the diversity of genes. There is the possibility of inbreeding to increase as well. An article also looked at fragmentation causing certain phenotypes to arise in organisms. By studying feathers of 2,500 individual bird species within nine forests, observation showed asymmetry linked with fragmentation. Asymmetry was lowest if the forest continued and highest with small or medium fragmentation. [...] They suggest asymmetry of bird feathers influenced by the stress of fragmentation and changing environments. That is one outcome from fragmentation in the Tropical Andes. A study by Niall O'Dea looks at bird communities in general and how habitat degradation impacts them. He compared the bird communities that reside in primary forests, secondary forests, <b>edge</b> <b>habitat</b> and agricultural land, all modified by humans. Most diversity was found in secondary forests and edge habitats but different species. While the agricultural land and primary forest held lowest diversity. [...] This study suggests within Andean montane forests, preserving secondary forests offers most benefit for these threatened birds. [...] Another serious threat to the Tropical Andes is global warming. Global warming is the effect of too much of greenhouse gasses trapped in the air that hold in heat. Some locations are increasing in temperature and others decreasing. The change in temperatures has a major effect on the Tropical Andes; some say more negative then deforestation. One serious issue is the melting of the glaciers in the mountains. It is estimated that 80 percent of freshwater comes from mountains and with them melting about half of the Earths population will be affected. [...] All over the world glaciers are melting, but the mountains in the Tropical Andes are very susceptible. It is said that a quarter of the Tropical Andes glacier has already begun retreating. These glaciers make up many species water supply, and the location could be in crisis if they melt away. Glaciers in the Andes provide two main functions; decrease seasonal discharge variability and provide greater specific discharge. [...] The article by Bryan Mark, predicts an increase in discharge as glaciers melt with the ability to trace glacier water melting into watersheds using isotopes. [...] Global warming can lead to the extinction of many species especially in hotspots. A study done by Jay Malcolm predicts less than 1 percent up to 43 percent of endemic biota will become extinct due to global warming. He also believes the Tropical Andes is in the top six vulnerable hotspots with the possibility of plant extinction exceeding 2000 species. Global warming is also causing an increase in diseases among amphibians. Considering the Tropical Andes is recorded to have the most amphibians, some restricted to this location, diseases could decrease the diversity greatly. Another other factor, that 400 of the amphibian species are already threatened. These deadly fungi have actually been linked to the extinction of dinosaurs. [...] One chytrid fungus that is infecting amphibians is the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This fungus will impair the amphibian's skin and reduce its ability to absorb. One example of an amphibian in the Tropical Andes is the genus Atelopus with 56 of the species Critically Endangered. Due to increase in temperature, the fungus has the ability to spread rapidly and thrive on living amphibians. [...] A new threat that is becoming researched is the effect from nitrogen deposition. The studies done in Europe have shown diversity among plants decreased due to nitrogen deposition. Current models are estimating what could happen to hotspots across the world if nitrogen deposition keeps increasing. By comparing to past research, nitrogen deposition has already increased 50 percent since the 1990s. Estimation for the future shows an increase by 100 percent in 2050. Considering the great plant diversity in the Tropical Andes, especially so many endemics, nitrogen deposition could be a severe threat. The decrease in plant diversity could cause a chain reaction on other species that depend on the plants. These are just few threats the Tropical Andes faces on a daily basis. The impact on the land is shown by a 75 percent decrease from original mass. Species effected are decreasing in numbers and increases the amount of species listed on the Endangered Species Act. It is worse when threatened species are endemic to the Tropical Andes. It is recorded 14 endemic mammals and 110 endemic birds are threatened in the Tropical Andes. Two species from the Tropical Andes have already become extinct.|$|E
