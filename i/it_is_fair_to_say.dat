25|$|The basic or {{classical}} twin-design {{contains only}} identical and fraternal twins raised in their biological family.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that {{scholars}} remain slightly puzzled that the effective and simple penannular brooch developed in this direction, {{though it is}} presumed that the reuniting of the terminals of pseudo-penannular brooches was partly to strengthen the brooch.

Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E

500|$|We {{must live}} with our {{virtually}} complete ignorance of Padarn’s life. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> however, {{that if he}} had died at Llanbadarn {{there would have been a}} shrine, traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn Garreg), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn, Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [...] ), if he didn't establish them himself.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E
500|$|During the revolution, {{there was}} an orgy of {{violence}} committed against the South Asian and Arab communities with thousands of women being raped by the Okello's followers, much looting and massacres of Arabs all over the island. The American diplomat Don Petterson described the killings of Arabs by the African majority {{as an act of}} genocide. Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that in parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man with a taste for cruelty frequently went on the radio to urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality. As a Pan-African nationalist who made his followers sing [...] "God Bless Africa" [...] whenever he marched through the streets, Okello appealed to the black majority, but at same time, as a militant Christian who claimed to hear the voice of God in his head, Okello's appeal on an island whose population was 95% Muslim was limited. It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by the voices in his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ. Okello claimed that Christ was an African and that Africa was God's special continent.|$|E

2500|$|Green {{is often}} {{confused}} {{with a plan}} authored by the Irish Republican Army and sent to German Intelligence (Abwehr) in August 1940.

[...] There are no details in Green {{on the politics of}} Ireland, only military capacity estimates.

2500|$|In some cases, {{the courts}} have also {{demonstrated}} an unwillingness to consult foreign constitutional case law, and have crafted a [...] "local conditions" [...] rationale which prescribes reading the Constitution [...] "within its own four walls {{and not in the}} light of analogies drawn from other countries such as Great Britain, the United States of America or Australia". This has been termed a conservative and restrictive approach that seems to undermine the court's duty to generously interpret fundamental liberties. However, it has been noted that this approach to constitutional interpretation was never applied consistently, and that [...] "it appears that the 'four walls' doctrine has quietly fallen out of fashion at least in practice, as courts now regularly consider foreign cases which have only persuasive, not precedential value. ... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the development of Singapore public law is not accomplished in a cloister sealed off from transnational models, but through a thoughtful engagement with foreign cases." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thucydides {{reports that}} when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or another woman of some significance) would customarily present him with his hoplon (shield) and say: [...] "With this, or upon this" [...] (Ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς, Èi tàn èi èpì tàs), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it). Unfortunately, poignant as this image may be, it is almost {{certainly}} propaganda. [...] Spartans buried their battle dead {{on or near the}} battle field; corpses were not brought back on their hoplons. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet, breastplate or greaves than his hoplon, since the former were designed to protect one man, whereas the hoplon also protected the man on his left. Thus the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier's subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms – messmates and friends, often close blood relations.|$|E
