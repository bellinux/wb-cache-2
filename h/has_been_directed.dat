5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>directed</b> {{to develop}} the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E

The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe7MoS9 ensemble.|$|E
25|$|Since its release, Sonic CD has {{received}} critical acclaim.

Since its initial release, Sonic CD has been ported to other platforms several times, first to Microsoft Windows as part of the Sega PC brand in 1996, and to PlayStation 2 and GameCube as part of Sonic Gems Collection in 2005. An enhanced port of the game, developed using the Retro Engine, was also released for various platforms and mobile devices in late 2011.|$|E

25|$|Criticism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>directed</b> at {{the cost}} to users of the SmartRider system {{compared}} to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by direct debit, which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end up paying $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E
25|$|Because of valerian's {{historical}} {{use as a}} sedative, antiseptic, anticonvulsant, migraine treatment, {{and pain}} reliever, most basic science research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>directed</b> at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA receptor. Many studies remain inconclusive and all require clinical validation. The mechanism of action of valerian in general, and as a mild sedative in particular, has not been fully elucidated. However, some of the GABA-analogs, particularly valerenic acids as components of the essential oil along with other semivolatile sesquiterpenoids, generally {{are believed to have}} some affinity for the GABAA receptor, a class of receptors on which benzodiazepines are known to act. Valeric acid, which is responsible for the typical odor of mostly older valerian roots, does not have any sedative properties. Valeric acid is related to valproic acid, a widely prescribed anticonvulsant; valproic acid is a derivative of valeric acid.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they were looking at the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>directed</b> to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E
