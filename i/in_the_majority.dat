5|$|A key step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of GWA {{studies is}} the {{imputation}} of genotypes at SNPs {{not on the}} genotype chip used in the study.

These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E
