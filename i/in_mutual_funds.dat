Berk and Green (2004) rationalize these patterns by arguing that more-skilled managers manage more assets but, because of diseconomies of scale, generate the same expected returns as less-skilled managers. To identify the causal impact of fund size on performance, we exploit the fact that small differences <b>in</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> returns can cause discrete changes in Morningstar ratings that, in turn, generate discrete differences <b>in</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> size.

Failure is one of the consequency that might be happen in transaction that was done <b>in</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>Fund</b> Collective Investment Contract, especially that was done by Manager of Investment that can cause the loss in investor. In fact, the loss investor that caused by Investment Manager failure face some difficulties in proposing a claim to law-court, even in Surabaya Stock Exchange such kind of the case is discussed internally so far. Either literatures and researches before have already describe how law protection was given by capital market’s rule (UUPM) and the rule that is made by Bapepam’s rule No. IV. B. 1 and No. IV. B. 2. Unfortunatelly, the rules that is written by Bapepam is not done maximally. Besides, neither UUPM not the rules that was made bay Bapepam can not rise all the problems that is happen <b>in</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> collective investment contract. The purpose of this research is to know the description about investor law protection <b>in</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> collective contract to failure by investment manager, how the rules regulate it and the way to overcome that problems based on the rules. The research methodology is descriptive qualitative. The data that have been collected is the data that describe how law-protection and the way to solve <b>Mutual</b> <b>Fund</b> Collective Investment Contract that is given by UUPM and Bapapem’s rule. The results of this research show that the law protection that is given by UUPM about <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> is merely about public rules and main rules. Besides, Bapepam’s rules that is made as technical rules do not mention detailly about the risk that might happen and restricted action and what kind of punishment that can be given.

Based on the explanation above, the thesis writer concludes that law-protection to investor <b>in</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> collective investment contract especially in failure case that is done by investment manager.
