5|$|RGIA was {{originally}} {{scheduled to open}} to commercial operations on 16 March 2008; however, the date was delayed due to protests from some airlines over the high <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> rates at the airport. Once the rates were reduced, the launch date was set for 23 March. Although Lufthansa Flight 752 from Frankfurt {{was scheduled to be}} the first flight to land at RGIA, two SpiceJet flights landed earlier. However, the Lufthansa flight still received the planned ceremonial welcome upon its 12:25 am arrival.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1989 as an affiliate of shipping conglomerate Evergreen Group, EVA Air has expanded to include air cargo, airline catering, <b>ground</b> <b>handling,</b> and aviation engineering services. Its cargo arm, EVA Air Cargo, links with the Evergreen worldwide shipping network on sea and land. Its domestic and regional subsidiary, UNI Air, operates a medium and short-haul network to destinations in Taiwan, Macau and China with its main hub in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. As of January 2016, EVA Air is the 6th safest airline in the world, with no hull losses, accidents, or fatalities since its establishment.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{had three}} Boeing 737-300 aircraft, built in 1994. Originally fitted with 136 seats each, they were later reduced to 124, and then {{increased}} to 142. The aircraft were owned by International Lease Finance Corporation and General Electric Capital, and cost NOK 2.25 million per month to lease, plus additional costs per hour. They were British-registered {{and operated by}} Air Foyle HeavyLift, while maintenance was performed by British Midland. Both companies are based in the United Kingdom. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> {{was carried out by}} SAS Ground Services in Trondheim, Bergen and Ålesund, and by Servisair in Oslo.|$|E

5000|$|Pournelle's view of {{corporate}} mega-projects {{is similar to}} that of Robert A. Heinlein as expressed in stories such as The Man Who Sold the Moon, or more recently in the work of Tom Clancy. Top executives concentrate on financial risk, while engineers on the <b>ground</b> <b>handle</b> logistics and are extremely competent. Incompetent engineers get fired. There are no meddling vice-presidents, craven middle managers or deadhead employees of the sort generally found in any large technical effort-mostly because Pournelle's corporations lack trade unions to prevent their expulsion.|$|R
5|$|The type was {{withdrawn}} from service in 1946; as of June that year the RAAF had 235 Vengeances on hand, but only required two. The aircraft were disposed of {{over the next}} six years, most being sold for scrap. Twelve Vengeance airframes were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy between 1948 and 1951 to be used for <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> and fire-fighting training. Only a single complete RAAF Vengeance, the former A27-99, was preserved. As of 1986 this aircraft was on display at the Camden Museum of Aviation in the outskirts of Sydney. At this time, most parts of the airframe of the former A27-247 were also held by the Aviation Heritage Museum in Perth.|$|E
5|$|Dragonair's own loyalty program, The Elite, {{that was}} {{launched}} on 12 February 2001, was merged into Cathay Pacific's The Marco Polo Club from 1 January 2007. Existing Elite members were offered similar membership by The Marco Polo Club. On 1 August 2007, the airline opened a joint regional office with Cathay Pacific in Beijing, that featured a dedicated {{area for the}} airline and its parent, and joined the Oneworld alliance as an affiliated member on 1 November, which its parent is a founding member. In addition, they opened the first airline-branded arrival lounge, The Arrival, at Hong Kong International Airport on 1 October 2008. The airline's <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> services subsidiary, Hong Kong International Airport Services Ltd (HIAS), was merged with Hong Kong Airport Services Ltd (HAS) on 1 November 2008 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific on 1 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E
50|$|The Condor was {{designed}} as a flight training glider specifically to introduce new pilots to hang gliding. As such it has a very large wing area, low wing loading, a stall speed of 13 mph and it is intended for use only under very light wind conditions. It was specifically intended for sale only to professional hang gliding instructors for teaching solo students during their early glider-handling lessons. It {{was designed}} to be easy to <b>ground</b> <b>handle,</b> launch and fly in very light winds from a shallow hill.|$|R

5|$|Trans Polar was a {{continuation}} of Tjøntveit's United States-based Trans Polar International, a retailer of general aviation aircraft. Born in Grimstad, Tjøntviet emigrated to the US in 1961 after receiving his pilot's license and became an American citizen in 1965. Trans Polar International agreed on 25 November 1969 to purchase two Boeing 720 jetliners from Eastern Air Lines. The original plans called for transporting new general aviation aircraft to customers around the world. Tjøntveit stated that the first aircraft would be delivered in May 1970 and followed by a second in December, and that Erik Sandberg would start working as vice president in May. The airline planned to hire ten pilots and had {{signed an agreement with}} Pan Am for <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> services. Trans Polar International stated they had made agreements to operate the aircraft transport flights for at least five years.|$|E

40|$|Eating in table-service {{restaurants}} {{has been}} implicated as {{a risk factor}} for Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 infection. To explore this association and learn about the prevalence of risky ground beef preparation practices in restaurants, the Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) assessed <b>ground</b> beef <b>handling</b> policies and practices in restaurants in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee. Eligible restaurants prepared and served hamburgers. EHS-Net specialists interviewed a restaurant employee with authority over the kitchen (defined as the manager) using a standard questionnaire about food safety policies, hamburger preparation policies, and use of irradiated ground beef. Interviews were followed by observations of ground beef preparation. Data from 385 restaurants were analyzed: 67 % of the restaurants were independently owned and 33 % were chain restaurants; 75 % of the restaurants were sit down, 19 % were quick service or fast food, and 6 % were cafeteria or buffet restaurants. Eighty-one percent of restaurants reported determining doneness of hamburgers by one or more subjective measures, and 49 % reported that they never measure the final cook temperatures of hamburgers. At least two risky <b>ground</b> beef <b>handling</b> practices were observed in 53 % of restaurants. Only 1 % of restaurants reported purchasing irradiated ground beef, and 29 % were unfamiliar with irradiated ground beef. Differences in risky <b>ground</b> beef <b>handling</b> policies and practices were noted for type of restaurant ownership (independently owned versus chain) and type of food service style (sit down versus quick service or fast food). This study revealed the pervasiveness of risky <b>ground</b> beef <b>handling</b> policies and practices in restaurants and the need for educational campaigns targeting food workers and managers. These results highlight the importance of continued efforts to reduce the prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in ground beef.

No discounts were therefore granted from SAS Ground Services or external <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> providers. Similarly, if a Snowflake aircraft became sufficiently delayed, a conventional SAS aircraft would be dispatched instead.|$|E
