In one place Mr. Hastings tells him, [...] "You have offered {{to give up the}} sum of four lacs of rupees to be allowed the free use of the remainder; but this we have refused." [...] In another he says, that, [...] "as many matters will occur which cannot be so easily explained by letter as by conversation, I desire that you will on such occasions give your orders to Sir John D'Oyly respecting such points as you may desire to have imparted to me." [...] The offer alluded to in the first passage does not appear in the Nabob's letters, therefore must have been in conversation, and declined by Mr. Hastings without consulting his colleague. A refusal of it might have been proper; but it supposes a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> in the Nabob not to be reconciled to the principles on which Mahomed Reza Khân was removed from the management of his affairs. Of the matters alluded to in the second, and which, it is said, could not be so easily explained by letters as in conversation, no explanation is given.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to know the characteristics of caregivers in two rural areas, to know if their health is worse than that of non-caregivers, and to determine the variables related to {{their perception of the}} burden. The study uses a non-experimental, observational design, i. e., case vs. control with 88 caregivers and 81 non-caregivers. The following variables were analyzed: sociodemographic, health and psychological well-being characteristics (GHQ 12, HAD-T, HAD-A, HAD-A), social support (Duke-UNC), head scale (Zarit), and Barthel Index. Differences between female caregivers and control group appear in the amount of illnesses, health consultations, psychological distress, anxiety, depression level and perceived social support. The subjective overload for female caregivers was related to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>incapacity</b> <b>of</b> the person being cared, hours of care and mental health variables. In men it was related to mental health variables. The anxiety and the social support predict 31. 8 % of the variability of the perceived burden. The results obtained confirm the impact on the health of caregivers...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between pain intensity, incapacity and medical image findings of patients with shoulder pain. METHODS:This was an observational analytical study with 54 patients with possible shoulder injury. Participants have answered an incapacity questionnaire, a pain intensity scale and then were submitted to image exams. Incapacity, pain intensity and image diagnosis were correlated, in addition to comparing pain intensity and level of incapacity among participants with and without medical image abnormalities. RESULTS:Mean pain intensity was 7. 4 ± 2. 52. There has been a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> (mean of 57. 2 %). Image findings have shown abnormalities in 59. 3 % of reports. There has been no correlation between image findings and pain intensity, as well as there has also been no correlation between image findings and incapacity. There has been high correlation between pain intensity and incapacity (Rho= 0. 67; p< 0. 001). Pain intensity and incapacity were not different between participants with and without some type of abnormality at image exams. CONCLUSION:Patients with shoulder complaints may have limitations to perform daily activities and pain, even with negative image findings...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the trends <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work in the Czech Republic since 1990. These trends {{are related to the}} {{legislative}} and socioeconomic changes, which are the results of transformation of socialist society towards capitalist society. In this thesis, there are followed three main indicators <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work. The number <b>of</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work per 100 sickness insured persons, which has dropped since the beginning 1990; the number of calendar days <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work per 1 case, which has on the contrary increased and the average percentage <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work, which has oscillated. The performed analyses have proved the crucial effect of sickness intensity (quantum) on changes of the values of mentioned indicators. The effect of intensity has explicitly outweighed the effect of age structure of population. Regression analysis has confirmed the hypothesis of causation of other factors, than only health factors, on the global level <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work. With respect to obtained information and level of sickness intensity by age and social groups, there is an issue of possibility and manner of reduction of their level, which exceeds the European average.

40|$|Original title: Belemmerd aan het werk The Netherlands {{was long}} {{known as a}} country with high {{sickness}} absenteeism rates and a burgeoning {{group of people who}} were unfit for work. In response to this, many policy measures have been introduced in recent decades which attempt to limit the benefit volume and foster the reintegration of people with health impairments. What is the position of the Netherlands today in this regard? The main trends in sickness absenteeism, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> for work and labour participation of people with health impairments are discussed in this report. The report also poses a number of more in-depth questions: Which employers are willing to take on people from vulnerable groups? What role do financial stimuli play in the reintegration to the labour process? How do subjective health perceptions influence labour participation? Which factors are important for the successful labour market participation {{of people who have been}} assessed as having an incapacity for work of less than 35 percent? Does the growth in homeworking and teleworking offer new opportunities for raising the labour participation rate of people with health impairments?

40|$|TTVURING {{the past}} 25 years acute {{illnesses}} of vari [...] " [...] ' ous types {{have been reduced}} in frequency, se-verity, and duration. In some instances the disease has been virtually eliminated {{by the use of}} specific therapeutic agents or preventive measures. Chronic illness has become the most urgent and frustrating problem facing the medical profession today. Un-fortunately, although some therapeutic agents are available which can relieve chronic diseases, in general we do not have treatment measures that specifically modify many of the chronic ailments. Consequently, the physician must devise a regime aimed at making it easier for the patient to live with his disease. Such a therapeutic regime contains two essen-tial features which at times cannot be actually separated. The first is aimed at preventing pro-gressions of the illness; the second is symptom re-lief to make the patient more comfortable. Both of these measures are aimed at maintaining physical and mental functioning at as high a level as possible. If the physician is to be successful, he must keep in mind that decreased activity or the physical disabilities that appear with chronic dis-eases can arise from two sources. The first is the actual physical impairment which interferes with activity. The second is psycho-social influences which reduce or aggravate the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>incapacity.</b> What Is Chronic Illness? Acute illnesses are ordinarily thought of as last-ing a few days to a few weeks followed by "re-covery. " There is little or no observable residual damage and impairment of function. Chronic ill-ness can be separated into two indistinct categories, both of which are characterized by observable irre-versible damage and impairment of function...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{aspects of}} self-concept which comprise the body-image and {{are essential for}} personal identification, are of particular importance in health restoration and maintenance. A study of 285 physically disabled adults variously suffering from spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and a control group of 100 able-bodied adults, investigated the effects of physical disability upon body-image. All subjects completed three 52 -item Body Cathexis scales and three 16 -item bi-polar adjectival Semantic Differential forms, while the disabled completed an additional 11 -item Activities of Daily Living form, {{in an attempt to}} identify and measure the form and content of three body-image components paralleling the three aspects of self identified by phenomenological theory, and four modes of adjustment in the body-image of the disabled. The influence of years of disablement and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>incapacity</b> upon body-image disturbance and the internal structure of the Body Cathexis and Semantic Differential scales were also investigated. Simple correlational analysis failed to isolate any parallel relationships between body-image and self-concept for either disabled or able-bodied individuals, although discriminant function analysis revealed that both concepts for the disabled differed significantly from those of normals. These findings indicated that the difference was one of content and not of formal relationships pertaining between the concepts. As a result, a tripartite theory of body-perception was proposed. The question of whether type of disability contributed significantly to variance was answered positively. The physically disabled tended to be separated out according to the nature of their disability which appeared to influence both body-image and self-concept. Four discrete modes of adjustment were identified by pattern analysis. Differences due to age and sex, disability type and years of disablement made no significant contribution to the type of adjustment adopted. Finally, the number of years of impairment and degree of functional incapacity had no influence upon body-image disturbance. Considering past research, the findings indicated there to be basic differences in body-image content between the physically-disabled and physically normal populations, but not in the formal structure. Further research is needed to investigate these differences, to isolate further modes of adjustment which might be manifest amongst those excluded from the 4 identified in this investigation and to verify and elaborate upon the usage of the tripartite theory of body-perception. Factor analysis provided confirmation for both the Body-Cathexis and Semantic Differential scales as being complex measures of the self, and enabled shortened revised scales to be introduced for both the able-bodied and disabled subjects. However, further research is required utilising such scales in studies of body-image in order to ascertain their reliability and validity in aiding the development of intervention strategies tailored {{to the needs of the}} disabled person, especially in light of the fact that body-image is increasingly being the single most important concept in the consideration of the physically disabled. The results of this research suggest that body-image is a function of numerous variables, of which physical disability is only one...|$|E
