5|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, Amarillo had <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its {{population}} grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after {{an increase in}} production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s.

5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the world's fastest {{recovering}} economies {{with high}} competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved {{to overcome the}} crisis {{better than any other}} developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused {{heavily on the}} equality {{between men and women}} and the rights of the child. Mackworth continued to strive towards equality for women and <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the leading feminist campaigners in Britain during the inter-war period. She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women.|$|E

His popularity fell until the economy of Sweden <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the strongest in Europe; this brought a resurgence of support for him, resulting in his government's re-election in 2010. Despite the Moderate Party getting its highest share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, Reinfeldt's government {{was reduced to a}} minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; but he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with {{the dedication of the}} Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E

5|$|The loss of ecclesiastical {{patronage}} {{that resulted}} from the Reformation created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls. Other forms of domestic decoration included tapestries and stone and wood carving. In {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century there was an increasing professionalisation and organisation of art. Large numbers of artists took the grand tour to Italy. The Academy of St. Luke was founded as a society for artists in 1729. It included among its members Allan Ramsay, who <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important British artists of the era.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{spent the}} summer of 1851 abroad, {{including}} a visit to Paris to see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the state Senate. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state's senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to meet again before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the second ballot, and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat Solomon W. Downs.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after he}} {{finished}} his education, he served for two years as rector of the collegiate school at St. John's Church in Warsaw. From October 1557 he tutored Jan Tęczyński, son of magnate Andrzej Tęczyński, and visited Vienna with his pupil, where he likely became closely acquainted with the Society of Jesus, a key order of the counter-reformation. He then returned to Poland, which <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main terrains of struggle between the Protestant Reformation movement and the Catholic Church's counter-reformation. From 1562 {{he served as a}} parson in Rohatyn, and around 1564 he took holy orders. That year he became a canon, and the following year he also served as chancellor of the Lwów chapter. From 1566 to 1567 he was chaplain at the court of castellan Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski (the royal secretary to King Sigismund II Augustus); after Tarnowski's death he returned to Lwów, taking up the position of the cathedral preacher.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough's insatiable {{ambition}} {{made him}} the richest of all Anne's subjects. His family connections wove him {{into the fabric of}} European politics (his sister Arabella became James II's mistress, and their son, the Duke of Berwick, <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> LouisXIV's greatest Marshals). His leadership of the allied armies consolidated Britain's emergence as a front-rank power. He successfully maintained unity among the allies, thereby demonstrating his diplomatic skills. Throughout ten consecutive campaigns during the Spanish Succession war, Marlborough held together a discordant coalition through his sheer force of personality and raised the standing of British arms to a level not known since the Middle Ages. Although in the end he could not compel total capitulation from his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise from a minor to a major power, ensuring the country's growing prosperity throughout the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1986 {{season the}} Browns lost {{standout}} safety and former defensive {{rookie of the}} year Don Rogers. Rogers died of a cocaine overdose leaving the team without one of its best defenders in the secondary for the 1986 season. Despite the tumultuous off season, 1986 marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854yards to a corps of receivers that included Brian Brennan, Newsome and rookie Webster Slaughter. On defense, cornerbacks Frank Minnifield and Hanford Dixon <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the NFL's premiere pass-defending duos. After a slow start, the Browns rose {{to the top of the}} divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at Three Rivers Stadium. A 12–4 record earned Cleveland home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that life exists on Europa, but Europa has <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
