5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left the city <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further {{reduced the number of}} people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|The monarchists {{leaned on}} the Swedish regime's year 1772 monarchist constitution, belittled the Declaration of Independence 1917 and {{proposed}} a modernized monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law, accepted by Russia in 1809, lost validity in the February Revolution, the might of the Russian Czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917 and Finnish republic was accepted on 6 December. The republicans were able to postpone processing of the monarchists' proposal in the parliament, {{and in the end}} a new monarchist constitution was not accepted in Finland.
