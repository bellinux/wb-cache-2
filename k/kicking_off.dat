50|$|<b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> was {{released}} in 1989. <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> was first developed for the Atari ST and then ported to the Amiga. Several expansion disks were released for <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2. In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 3 in 1994. The game used a side view instead of a top-down view and bore little resemblance to <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 apart from the name. Anco Software published the first versions of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> for the Amiga and Atari ST.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Toka Nono {{released}} <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 96 for Amiga and Windows. The game received average reviews. In 1997, <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 97 {{was released}} for Windows. The game received better reviews than <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 96 but still didn't become popular. Later the same year, Anco released <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 98 for the PC which received poor reviews. In 1998 <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> World was released {{for the original}} PlayStation, again developed by Toka and published by Funsoft.|$|R

They then joined No Doubt, who were promoting their Rock Steady album, to co-headline a trek around the United States; support came from The Distillers. <b>Kicking</b> <b>off</b> on October 15 in West Kingston, Rhode Island, the tour was routed down the Eastern Seaboard, and into Southern States before heading to the Pacific Northwest region and onto the American Southwest. The tour ended on November 27 in Long Beach, California. Garbage went on to perform one further show, in Hell, Grand Cayman.|$|E
5|$|There is circumstantial {{evidence}} that the rules also influenced Australian rules football conceived {{a couple of years}} later. The two codes shared the unique feature of lacking the offside rule. There are also similarities in the laws for <b>kicking</b> <b>off,</b> kick outs, throw-ins and the fair catch. Henry Creswick (possibly a relative of Nathaniel Creswick) was born in Sheffield but emigrated to Australia with his brother in 1840 (the town of Creswick is named after them). He moved to Melbourne in 1854 and became involved in the local cricket scene. He played first class cricket for Victoria during the 57–58 season alongside three of the founders of Melbourne Football Club including Tom Wills, the man credited with creating the original rules.|$|E
5|$|Many of the weekend's Premier League {{fixtures}} were {{rescheduled to}} avoid a clash with the final, with some <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> at 12:45 on Saturday and others on Sunday. By coincidence, Manchester City and Stoke City were scheduled {{to meet in the}} league on cup final day. The league match was rearranged for the Wednesday after the final. This prompted criticism from Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp, whose team was challenging Manchester City for a place in the 2011–12 Champions League. Redknapp stated that if Manchester City won the final, it would then be in Stoke City's interest to lose against Manchester City in the league match, as it would make Europa League qualification for Stoke more likely. Stoke City refuted this accusation strongly, but ultimately this scenario was avoided. Champions League qualification was settled four days before the final, when Manchester City beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in a league match.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco {{and signed}} a {{contract}} for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had {{little in common with}} <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> and <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2. In 2001-2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> and Player Manager series. <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2002 was released.

5|$|Pearl Jam {{played a}} show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; {{recordings}} {{from the show}} were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert {{to raise money for}} Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour.|$|E
5|$|After <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> {{to start}} the game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{gridiron}} football, {{the safety}} (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play {{that results in}} two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored {{in a number of}} ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can {{have a significant impact on}} the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick.|$|E

50|$|After {{the release}} of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> several sequels were {{released}}. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off).</b> <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to <b>Kick</b> <b>Off.</b> The game introduced {{a number of new}} features as well as several small alterations.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Steve Screech {{started a}} project called Ultimate <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> {{with the help}} of an early {{established}} <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> Association. The game was released by Anco in 2002 for PC and Mac with the name <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2002. The game received poor reviews and only sold 5000 copies. Later a sequel called <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2004 was planned. It reached beta status but it was never released. The project ended when Anco closed in 2003.|$|R
5|$|Miami was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{roughing}} the kicker during the field goal attempt, allowing Tech {{to kick off}} from the Miami 45-yard line following the score. Instead of <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> to Miami, Tech attempted an onside kick, which would allow Tech to retain possession if the ball was recovered by the kicking team after traveling 10 yards from {{the point at which}} it was kicked. The ball did not travel the needed 10 yards, however, and Miami began offense at its 37-yard line, where the ball rolled out of bounds. On Miami's first play after the kick, Kelly attempted a long pass into Tech territory, but the ball was intercepted by Tech's Mike Schamus at the Hokies' 12-yard line. With just 21 seconds remaining in the first half, Tech attempted to gain quick yardage in an effort to close within field goal distance. Though Lawrence picked up 15 yards and a first with a rush, the Hokies were unable to enter the Miami side of the field before time expired. At {{the end of the first}} half, Miami still held a 143 lead.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Epstein and Del Verne split kicking duties (sometimes in {{the same}} game). On September 16, 2000, Epstein missed a 24-yard field goal for the 2000 team with 3:24 {{remaining}} against to UCLA. Although Michigan got back within field goal range, John Navarre was intercepted on the 15-yard line and the team lost 23–20. In that game, Epstein, who totalled 400 punt yards on 9 attempts, had landed what would become his career high 5 punts inside UCLA's 20-yard line and executed his first career 60-yard punt. On October 14, he executed a 67-yard punt that was downed inside the 20-yard line and became his career long against Indiana. On November 4, Epstein was thwarted on an attempt {{to tie the game}} at the end of regulation when a 57-yard field goal attempt went through the hands of his holder against Northwestern in a 54–51 loss after Northwestern scored a go-ahead touchdown with 20 seconds left. Earlier in the game, he had completed a 6-yard forward pass and a 52-yard field goal. On November 18 against Ohio State in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry game, Epstein scored 8 points (a 25-yard field goal and 5 PATs). He dropped 3 of his 6 punts inside the 20 yard line and posted a touchback when <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> to Ohio State with 1:18 remaining to force them to attempt to drive from their own 20. He earned his second Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition. Epstein finished the season with 50 points (8–14 FGs and 26–28 PATs) and 55 punts for 2224 yards (40.4 average/19 inside 20). He earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter and placekicker. Epstein was one of 10 finalists for the inaugural Ray Guy Award. Michigan finished the season as Big Ten Co-champions with Purdue and Northwestern.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea <b>kicking</b> <b>off</b> the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the energetic performance of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided to take a shot, forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just wide. In the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to split open the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E
