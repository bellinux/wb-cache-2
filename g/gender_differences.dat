5|$|By the 1950s, Roosevelt's {{international}} role as {{spokesperson for}} women {{led her to}} stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA {{was no longer a}} threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position. She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect <b>gender</b> <b>differences.</b> These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded {{that of the}} males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{reports have}} found that adolescent, young adult, and middle-aged adult girls and {{women are more likely}} to be diagnosed with unipolar depression and report greater symptoms of depression when compared to boys and men of similar ages. What is less well-known is whether this <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> persists into late life. This literature review examines whether the well-known <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in unipolar depression continues into old age, and, if it does, whether the variables that are known to contribute to the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in unipolar depression from adolescence through adulthood continue to contribute to the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in the elderly, and/or whether there are new variables that arise in old age and contribute to the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in the elderly. In this review of 85 empirical studies from every continent except for Antarctica, we find substantial support for the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in depression in individuals who are 60 and older. More research is necessary to determine which factors are the strongest predictors of the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in depression in late life, and particularly whether the factors that seem to be responsible for the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in depression in earlier life stages continue to predict the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in the elderly, and/or whether new factors come into play in late life. Longitudinal research, meta-analyses, and model-based investigations of predictors of the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in depression are needed to provide insights into how and why the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in depression persists in older age...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The {{purposes}} of this study were (i) to investigate the effect of age on <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in Hawaii Ironman triathlon performance time and (ii) to compare the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> among swimming (3. 8 km), cycling (180 km), and running (42 km) performances as a function of age. METHODS: <b>Gender</b> <b>difference</b> in performance times and estimated power output in the three modes of locomotion were analyzed for the top 10 men and women amateur triathletes between the ages of 18 and 64 yr for three consecutive years (2006 - 2008). RESULTS: The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in total performance time was stable until 55 yr and then significantly increased. Mean <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in performance time was significantly (P < 0. 01) smaller for swimming (mean ± 95 % confidence interval = 12. 1 % ± 1. 9 %) compared with cycling (15. 4 % ± 0. 7 %) and running (18. 2 % ± 1. 3 %). In contrast, mean <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in cycling estimated power output (38. 6 % ± 1. 1 %) was significantly (P < 0. 01) greater compared with swimming (27. 5 % ± 3. 8 %) and running (32. 6 % ± 0. 7 %). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study provides evidence that <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in ultraendurance performance such as an Ironman triathlon was stable until 55 yr and then increased thereafter and differed between the locomotion modes. Further studies examining the changes in training volume and physiological characteristics with advanced age for men and women are required to better understand the age-associated changes in ultraendurance performance...|$|R

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} of the long-toed {{salamander}} varies greatly with elevation and climate. Seasonal dates of migration {{to and from the}} breeding ponds can be correlated with bouts of sustained rainfall, ice thaw, or snow melt sufficient to replenish the (often) seasonal ponds. Eggs may be spawned at low elevations as early as mid-February in southern Oregon, from early January to July in northwestern Washington, from January to March in southeastern Washington, and from mid-April to early May in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. The timing of breeding can be highly variable; of notable mention, several egg masses in early stages of development were found on July 8, 1999 along the British Columbia provincial border outside Jasper, Alberta. Adults migrate seasonally to return to their natal breeding ponds, with males arriving earlier and staying longer than females, and some individuals have been seen migrating along snow banks on warm spring days. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> (or sexual dimorphism) in this species are only apparent during the breeding season, when mature males display an enlarged or bulbous vent area.|$|E

To investigate the robustness of <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in color preference in a different culture, we tested 81 young adult Indians from a school of Design and compared them to 80 young British students in Psychology. A 35 -item International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) questionnaires were also administered to explore possible links between personality traits, gender schemata and color preferences. Results confirmed a <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in both cultures; participants collectively expressed a preference for cool over warm colors, while in addition females showed a preference for pink colors, with a warm bias for Indian females and a cool bias for British females. While these results extend <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> to Indian culture and support the universality of an underlying pattern they also reveal a culture-specific contribution essentially observed in females. In British participants, color preference was correlated exclusively with BSRI scores in females and overwhelmingly with IPIP scores in males; this gender-specific pattern of correlation was not replicated in the Indian sample.
