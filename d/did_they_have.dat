5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44 tries, 12 {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a new head coach, but also 13 new players in their squad, and a new captain after Anton Oliver took over the reins from Tane Randell. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, President Truman issued Executive Order 9835, {{which created}} the Federal Loyalty Program. This program {{authorized}} the Attorney General {{to create a}} list of organizations which were deemed to be subversive. Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment. Listed organizations were not notified {{that they were being}} considered for the list, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an opportunity to present counterarguments; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list. Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program, some challenges were successfully made.|$|E

Not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a new head coach, but also thirteen new players in their squad. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth that season. The Highlanders' 2005 season started with a loss to the Blues at Carisbrook. Following this the side won six games consecutively, {{the first time the}} franchise had ever done so. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Three weeks {{from the end of the}} round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} often {{described}} as the first major battle of the war in the Pacific in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war, unlike at Milne Bay, these actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective. Nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> such a profound impact upon the moral aspect of the war. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. As a result of the battle, Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base, which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region.|$|E
5|$|With the Gregorian missionaries, a third {{strand of}} Christian {{practice}} {{was added to}} the British Isles, to combine with the Gaulish and the Hiberno-British strands already present. Although it is often suggested that the Gregorian missionaries introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into England, there is no supporting evidence. The early archbishops at Canterbury claimed supremacy over all the bishops in the British Isles, but their claim was not acknowledged by {{most of the rest of}} the bishops. The Gregorian missionaries appear to have played no part in the conversion of the West Saxons, who were converted by a missionary sent directly by Pope Honorius I. Neither <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> much lasting influence in Northumbria, where after Edwin's death the conversion of the Northumbrians was achieved by missionaries from Iona, not Canterbury.|$|E

25|$|Nearly all {{of almost}} 500 cases of sodomy between persons {{concerned}} {{the relationship between}} an older man and an adolescent, often by coercion, {{with only a few}} cases where the couple were consenting homosexual adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a chance to avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years.

25|$|For {{the general}} growth of cricket in the United States, {{it was most}} unfortunate that this {{pioneering}} tour occurred only 18 months before the American Civil War began. If the war had not broken out, it is highly likely that two or three follow-up tours might have been arranged in the early 1860s, thus building on the interest created by the initial trip. As it was, the enthusiasm for cricket faded in the war years and the troops on both sides adopted the embryonic game of baseball. When English teams resumed tours to America in 1868, not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to try to rekindle the enthusiasm, but in baseball they had a serious rival to contend with.|$|E
25|$|The duo's later {{campaigns against}} Arakan (1545–1547) and Siam (1547–1549) however fell short. In both campaigns, Toungoo forces won all major open battles, {{and went on}} to lay siege to the capitals, Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya respectively. But they still had no answer to heavily {{fortified}} defenses equipped with Portuguese firearms, and had to retreat both times. Toungoo's own Portuguese supplied cannon had little impact on the walls of both capitals. Nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> enough manpower (19,000 and 12,000 troops respectively in Arakanese and Siamese campaigns) for long-term sieges. Nonetheless, despite the setbacks, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung by 1549 had built up the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, stretching from Pagan in the north to Tavoy in the south.|$|E
25|$|Although the Promontory event {{marked the}} {{completion}} of the transcontinental railroad line, it did not actually mark {{the completion of}} a seamless coast-to-coast rail network: neither Sacramento nor Omaha was a seaport, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> rail connections until after they were designated as the termini. The , which was the final section across the San Joaquin River near Lathrop, California, was finally completed in September 1869 connecting Sacramento in California. Passengers were required to cross the Missouri River between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, by boat until the building of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge in 1872. In the meantime, a coast-to-coast rail link was achieved in August 1870 in Strasburg, Colorado, by {{the completion of the}} Denver extension of the Kansas Pacific Railway.|$|E

[...] The subsequent major repairs undertaken across the whole British rail network are estimated to have cost in the order of £580 million. According to Christian Wolmar, author of On the Wrong Line, the Railtrack board panicked in the wake of Hatfield.
