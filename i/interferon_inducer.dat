40|$|These {{studies were}} {{designed}} to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of multiple doses of an <b>interferon</b> <b>inducer,</b> polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid, in encephalomyo-carditis virus infection of mice. The results indicated that suppression of a detect-able viremia was essential to the successful protection of mice from the lethal consequences of infection. The viremic phase of the infection could be delayed or partially suppressed without protection. The data strongly suggest that once {{the central nervous system}} had been seeded and virus replication had begun, inducer therapy was ineffective in altering the outcome of infection. This fact could be attributed in part to the low levels of interferon found in brain tissue after intraperitoneal administration of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid. Also, animals that received the most effective regimen of the <b>interferon</b> <b>inducer</b> and that survived the infection were not protected against a second infection with the same virus, an observation suggesting that the incidence of circulating antibody to encephalomyocarditis virus is reduced after the initial infection.

Mice that were infected with EMCV also possessed elevated levels of 2 - 5 A and 2 - 5 A synthetase in the four tissues examined, although the relative distribution differed from that observed with poly(I). poly(C), indicating that the <b>interferon</b> <b>inducer</b> affects the concentration and location of intracellular 2 - 5 A.

Antibody-treated animals had shortened viremia, early clearance of virus from tissues, and a reduced mortality rate. Dose response to antibodies was clearly demonstrated.
