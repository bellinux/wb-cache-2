5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous European states, was little more than a pawn of its neighbors (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its <b>domestic</b> <b>politics</b> almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>politics</b> in Eastern European {{countries}} {{continued to}} push for more enlargement, and political parties reluctant to move on NATO membership, such as the Bulgarian Socialist Party and Slovak HZDS, were voted out of office. Hungary's interest in joining was confirmed by a November 1997 referendum that returned 85.3 percent in favor of membership. Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia. Subsequently, he was {{appointed}} the State Minister on Defence, Security and Internal Affairs. In these positions, Sargsyan had {{a major role in}} the advance of the Armenian army. With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, a union of 5,000 war veterans, that had a great influence in Armenia's <b>domestic</b> <b>politics</b> in the post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power.|$|E

5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen {{through the prism of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>politics.</b> This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E
5|$|The PAP {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} returned to power by voters and has thus formed the Cabinet since Singapore's 1959 general election. The Government is generally {{perceived to be}} competent in managing the country's economy, and largely free from political corruption. Transparency International's 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, which compares countries according to {{the degree to which}} corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians, ranked Singapore in joint first place with Denmark and New Zealand out of 178 countries. In addition, Singapore was second only to New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, the Government has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, such as discouraging voting for opposition parties in the 2006 general election by stating that wards that elect opposition candidates will receive state-subsidized improvements to public housing only after all PAP-held wards have been attended to. It has also been accused of violating freedom of speech through Ministers bringing defamation suits against opposition politicians, and by restricting the circulation of foreign newspapers deemed to have engaged in <b>domestic</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Peng {{had been}} an {{alternate}} member of the Central Committee since 1934, a full member since 1938, {{and a member of}} the Politburo since 1945, but it was not until he became the leader of the PLA and moved permanently to Beijing, in November 1953, that Peng was able to attend regular political meetings and became active in <b>domestic</b> <b>politics.</b> Peng had been loyal to Mao's leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference, and continued to support Mao for several years after moving to Beijing. Peng (like Lin Biao) was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang's effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953, but then opposed Gao in 1954, once Mao made his own opposition clear. Mao did not take any action against Peng (or Lin), but Peng's involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu's supporters. In 1955 Peng supported Mao's efforts to collectivize agriculture. Along with Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Lin Boqu, and Luo Ronghuan, Peng opposed Mao's attempt to liberalize China's culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign, but then supported Mao's efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized the CCP later that year.|$|E

In return, Japan implicitly recognized Russia's lease of territory on the Liaodong Peninsula.|$|R
