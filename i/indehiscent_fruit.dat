The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre.|$|E

50|$|The flower {{heads are}} set {{individually}} {{at the tip}} of the branches. The lilac to purple corollas of the disc florets are deeply split, creating five coiled lobes. The anthers have stump tips, long pilose tails, and produce pollen that is higher than wide. The branches of the style are finely grainy on the outside. The one-seeded, <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> (called cypselas) may have long-pilose hairs or lack hair altogether, but are not bristly or barbed.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} of the seed coat bears a definite relation {{to that of the}} fruit. They protect the embryo and aid in dissemination; they may also directly promote germination. Among plants with <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruits,</b> in general, the fruit provides protection for the embryo and secures dissemination. In this case, the seed coat is only slightly developed. If the fruit is dehiscent and the seed is exposed, in general, the seed-coat is well developed, and must discharge the functions otherwise executed by the fruit.|$|R
50|$|The leathery, {{evergreen}} {{leaves are}} simple and alternate, with smooth or toothed margins and without stipules. The one-seeded, <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> is a thin-fleshed globose drupe. The flowers and fruits {{often do not}} develop until after leaf fall and thus appear naked on the branches. The fruits often do not mature until the year after flowering. The calyx is persistent.|$|E

Five species (M. kongkandae, M. leptostachyus, M. pallidus, M. philippensis, and M. repandus) are recognised. Mallotus chromocarpus is excluded from the section because it has more shared characters with the monospecific genus Octospermum, like the presence of <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruits,</b> absence of stipules, marginal extrafloral nectaries on the upper side of the leaf blade, broad connectives (shaped umbrella-like), and its occurrence in New Guinea, and is therefore probably closely related to it...|$|R

The one-seeded <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> (or cypsela) of the female florets are tiny, ovoid, with rows of stiff hairs on the ribs, and felty overall with long twin hairs, which have thin cell walls.

5000|$|In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> {{in which}} an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) {{surrounds}} a single shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. [...] These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, [...] "lignified" [...] stone (or pit) {{is derived from the}} ovary wall of the flower—in an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry.|$|E

The 21 to 41 oblong leaflets (i.e. 10 to 20 pairs plus terminal) have a sub-opposite or alternate arrangement. The leaflets close in overcast weather, and the foliage is popular with browsing animals. Their very small, sweetly scented flowers are creamy-white in colour. They appear in early summer, and are born in dense terminal or axillary clusters. The small and thin seed pods measure about 5 by 2 cm. They are papery in texture and lemon-yellow to pale brown in colour. The <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> which hold 1 to 3 seeds each, are often produced in profusion. They appear in clusters on horizontal branch tips, from late summer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) produce large, <b>indehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> {{that contain}} {{numerous}} large seeds. Seed dispersal in this species depends on rodents to dismantle fruits and extract the seeds which they disperse tens of {{meters from the}} source. Using camera trapping and fruits equipped with bobbins, I show that white-tailed antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus) and kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) moved intact, fallen fruits 6 to 7 m from trees before opening them. Pocket mice (Chaetodipus fallax and Perognathus longimembris) and pinyon mice (Peromyscus trueii) dismantled fruits in situ and harvested loose seeds but {{did not appear to}} move them. However, they readily harvested loose seeds. Mobilizing fruits may be an important, overlooked step in the seed dispersal process, especially if the <b>fruits</b> are <b>indehiscent.</b> Fruit-carrying behavior of rodents described in this study adds to the dispersal distance of Joshua tree seeds...|$|R
