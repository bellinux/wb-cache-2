40|$|Aquesta ponència forma part del Workshop internacional de doctorands organitzat pel Programa de Doctorat en Dret de la UAB i la Facultat de Dret de la UAB, amb el suport de l’École Européenne de Droit de l’Université Toulouse CapitolePublic Procurement Law is the {{acquisition}} of goods, works and services by a contracting authority {{through the use of}} a public contract. The general principles of Public Procurement Law dictate that suppliers are treated fairly and without discrimination whilst encouraging transparency, proportionality, competition and free trade within the member states. This area of law is mainly regulated by the EU through the use of Directives and their national equivalent, judge - made law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJEU’) and national courts. Due to the substantial amount involved throughout the life cycle of the public contract (including the contract value), it is paramount that the contract is awarded to the right supplier in order to attain value for money. As such, unqualified suppliers should be eliminated from the procurement exercise. Art. 57 (4) (c) of Directive 2014 / 24 /EU and reg. 57 (8) (c) of the UK Public Contracts Regulation 2015 (PCR 2015) specifies that a contracting authority m ay exclude an economic operator who by conviction by a final judgement is guilty of “grave professional misconduct”. With no definition of this phrase offered by Directive 2014 / 24 /EU, PCR 2015 and their predecessors, this paper seeks to examine the judicial interpretation of the concept of “ <b>grave</b> <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> ” through an analysis of key judgements from the Court of Justice of the European Union and national courts. The paper will conclude by identifying important lessons for contracting authorities and current or prospective suppliers when an issue of <b>grave</b> <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> arise...|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> in healthcare, a (generally) lasting {{situation}} in which patients are at risk or actually harmed, can jeopardise {{the health and well-being}} of patients and the quality of teamwork. Two types of <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> can be distinguished: misconduct associated with incompetence and that associated with impairment. This study aimed to (1) quantify home-care nursing staff’s experiences with actual or possible professional misconduct; (2) provide insight into the difficulty home-care nursing staff experience in reporting suspicions of <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> within the organisation and whether this is related to the individual characteristics of nursing staff; and (3) show which aspects of professional practice home-care nursing staff consider important in preventing <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct.</b> Methods A questionnaire survey was held among registered nurses and certified nursing assistants employed in Dutch home-care organisations in 2014. The 259 respondents (60 % response rate; mean age of 51; 95 % female) were members of the Dutch Nursing Staff Panel, a nationwide group of nursing staff members in various healthcare settings. Results Forty-two percent of the nursing staff in home care noticed or suspected <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> by another healthcare worker during the previous year, predominantly a nursing colleague. Twenty to 52 % of the nursing staff experience difficulty in reporting suspicions of different forms of incompetence or impairment. This is related to educational level (in the case of incompetence), and managerial tasks (both in the case of incompetence and of impairment). Nursing staff consider a positive team climate (75 %), discussing incidents (67 %) and good communication between healthcare workers (57 %) most important in preventing <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> among nursing staff. Conclusions Suspicions of <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> by colleagues occur quite frequently among nursing staff. However, many nursing staff members experience difficulty in reporting suspicions of <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct,</b> especially in the case of suspected impairment. Home-care employers and professional associations should eliminate the barriers that nursing staff may encounter when they attempt to raise an issue. Furthermore, advocating a positive team climate within nursing teams, encouraging nursing staff to discuss incidents and facilitating this, and promoting good communication between healthcare workers may be appropriate strategies that help reduce <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> by nursing staff.

40|$|AIM: <b>Professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> is a {{generally}} lasting {{situation in which}} clients are at risk or actually harmed because a health care professional lacks professional competences or provides irresponsible care and seems rather {{unable or unwilling to}} change this situation. This article aims to give insight in how professionals deal with signs of misconduct by colleagues of physicians. METHOD: 1214 RNs, CNAs and social workers in hospitals, psychiatry, care for people with disabilities, care for the elderly, and general practices completed a questionnaire (respons 59 %). FINDINGS: Nearly half (45 %) of the respondents described a case of (possible) <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> in the past year. Most (92 %) of the cases concerned someone within the own organization or practice. In at least 37 % of the cases the client safety was at risk, according to the responding professionals. However, client safety did not play a role in whether and how <b>professionals</b> reacted. <b>Professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> concerned incompetent <b>professional</b> behavior in 75 % of the cases. In 25 % of the cases impaired behavior (e. g. aggression, drugs misuse) was (also) reported. In 87 % of the cases action was taken thereon, often (67 %) talking with the person who (possibly) did something wrong. DISCUSSION: Management and executives are important in preventing and dealing with <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct,</b> but also the individual professional is responsible. CONCLUSION: When <b>professionals</b> notice <b>misconduct</b> they usually discuss it. <b>Professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> particularly is noticed within the ownorganization. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
