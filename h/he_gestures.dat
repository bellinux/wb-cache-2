25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed {{in the folds of}} a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> with his right hand toward the mountain summit. His left hand grips the reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds hang over the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is signed and dated.|$|E
500|$|Sometime later, mutant {{rights are}} finally {{obtained}} and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints McCoy as {{ambassador to the}} United Nations. Rogue reveals to Bobby Drake that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment. Meanwhile, Lehnsherr sits alone at a chessboard in a San Francisco park. As <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> toward a metal chess piece, it wobbles slightly, indicating his powers to be returning and the [...] "cure" [...] to be temporary.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and {{unsure of}} himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer [...] "forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and [...] "this seems to embarrass him". George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> to the Virgin gives {{the impression of a}} shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedländer observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face [...] "twisted into an empty smile".|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Patten was profusely casual: [...] "Don't want {{to worry}} you, old man, but I {{thought it might}} be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her." [...] <b>He</b> <b>gestured</b> toward Dilling as toward a master.|$|R
25|$|A career-spanning {{series of}} battles with Tie Domi of the New York Rangers, Winnipeg Jets and Toronto Maple Leafs. One of Probert's memorable {{confrontations}} {{was also the}} genesis of Domi's now-infamous belt <b>gesture,</b> where <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> to the crowd {{as if he had}} a championship title belt around his waist.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{the trees}} hid him, and {{presently}} he was thrusting through them and in sight again. She could see {{there was something}} different, and then she {{saw that he was}} hurrying unusually and then that <b>he</b> limped. <b>He</b> <b>gestured</b> to her, and she walked towards him. His face became clearer, and she saw with infinite concern that he winced at every stride.|$|R
50|$|Zeek: Ephraims pet. He's a {{beautiful}} falcon, with sharp markings, an angular beak, and piercing eyes. He has big, sharp talons, which <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> with as he speaks. He exudes confidence - and with excellent vision, he keeps {{an eye out}} for danger.|$|E
50|$|In Rembrandt's depiction, {{now in the}} Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, he {{presents}} the servant girl who recognizes Peter with a candle, illuminating Peter's face. Two soldiers look with suspicion as Peter speaks, while Jesus {{is shown in the}} distance, his hands bound behind him, turning to look at Peter. Peter's faces away from Jesus, and <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> with his left hand, although his expression is free of defiance.|$|E
50|$|Silus escorts Lilly {{from the}} water facility. He kisses Lilly and says she must do something. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> to a {{building}} then tells Lilly she must look after what she will find in there and keep {{it away from the}} Brotherhood. Lilly enters the building, and finds the other Brother, a dead woman, and a baby. The Brother tells Lilly the infant is the first female vampire ever born. The virus has created her and she is truly the first Perfect Creature.|$|E
60|$|St. Clare {{had started}} up, and, as his manner was when excited, was walking, with hurried steps, {{up and down}} the floor. His fine face, classic as that of a Greek statue, seemed {{actually}} to burn with the fervor of his feelings. His large blue eyes flashed, and <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> with an unconscious eagerness. Miss Ophelia had never seen him in this mood before, and she sat perfectly silent.|$|R
50|$|One of Thompson's {{most memorable}} games was the clash against Collingwood in Round 19. With the Roos {{trailing}} by almost 4 goals {{late in the}} 4th quarter, Thompson {{was part of a}} revival where the Kangaroos managed {{to take the lead in}} the dying moments. His contribution was 3 goals, including the matchwinner just before the siren. <b>He</b> <b>gestured</b> with a Hulk Hogan-style fist pump which remained one of the famous images of the 2005 AFL season.|$|R
50|$|On 5 November 2011 Archbishop Betori survived an {{apparent}} assassination attempt. An unidentified man confronted the archbishop outside his office, shot and wounded the prelate's secretary, and waved {{a gun at}} the archbishop before escaping. Fr Paolo Brogi, the archbishop's secretary, was reportedly in satisfactory condition after surgery to repair an abdominal wound. Archbishop Betori and witnesses stated that the gunman said something as <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> toward the prelate with his firearm, {{but they could not}} understand his intent.|$|R

5000|$|Amoghasiddhi is {{associated}} with the conceptual skandha or the conceptual mind (as opposed to the non-conceptual or sensational mind). His action towards the promotion of Buddhist paths is the pacification of evils. This is symbolised by Amoghasiddhi's symbol, the moon. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> in the mudra of fearlessness, symbolising his and his devotees' fearlessness towards the poisons or delusions. [...] He is usually coloured green in artwork and {{is associated}} with the air or wind element. His season is autumn and his heavenly quarter is the northern buddha-kṣetra called Prakuta.|$|E
5000|$|That Guy - A teen boy states [...] "I'm {{going to}} try meth just once, I'm not gonna be like that guy." [...] <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> towards an {{anonymous}} person, who deteriorates further, finally ending up shaking and sweating on a drug dealer's makeshift van-seat [...] "couch". We see [...] "that guy" [...] is the boy, deformed after months of meth use. A teen girl purchases from the dealer, saying [...] "I'm gonna try meth just once, I'm not gonna be like that guy," [...] indicating the now-wretched boy.|$|E
5000|$|He could mesmerize an {{audience}} simply by standing motionless and in complete silence, or by indulging {{in any one}} of his grand gestures or subtle mannerisms. <b>He</b> did not <b>gesture</b> often but, when he did, it meant everything. He would steal a scene with a mere nod, a shrug, a glance, a twitching of the fingers, a compression of his lips, or a hardening of his face. Slight inflections in his voice spoke wonders. [...] "Occasionally", Georg Schuttler pointed out, [...] "when it was least expected, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> or moved his body so quickly that the speed of the action was compared to the swift opening and closing of a camera’s shutter." ...|$|R
50|$|Sportswriter Bob Wolf of the Milwaukee Journal {{indicated}} that Mathews' {{election to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame may have been delayed because of his cool relationship with the media. Mathews seemed to resent the intrusion of reporters in his personal life, especially early in his career. <b>He</b> <b>gestured</b> with his fist at a reporter {{when he was in}} court on charges of reckless driving. He was angered by the presence of the media at his 1954 wedding ceremony at a county clerk's office.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} his life, in Bali, Van der Tuuk {{became an}} object of curiosity to Europeans. He lived in {{seclusion}} from western influences, and it was rumoured that his house was dusty, grimy and disordered. One official wishing to visit him was able to observe him from a distance, sitting on his veranda, holding a piece of Edam cheese. As soon as Van der Tuuk discerned his would-be visitor, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> as if to fend the visitor off, exclaiming, “I'm not at home!” ...|$|R
5000|$|In 52, Animal Man, Starfire, and Adam Strange are {{stranded}} on an alien planet. The trio escape, but are pursued by bounty hunters. They {{are joined by}} Lobo. In issue #36, during a battle with Lady Styx and her horde, Animal Man is killed by a necrotoxin, which causes its victims to rise again {{in the service of}} Lady Styx. Animal Man makes Starfire promise not to let him come back as a zombie. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> to the reader, saying, [...] "Look, they're cheering us on. I told you the universe likes me." [...] At the moment of his death, Ellen, still on Earth, senses his death and begins to cry.|$|E
50|$|The crowd clears {{when the}} {{policeman}} places the {{hand in the}} box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman. The androgynous young woman contemplates something happily while {{standing in the middle}} of the now busy street clutching the box. She is then run over by a car and a few bystanders gather around her. The young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window. The young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman's danger and subsequent death, and as <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> at the shocked young woman in the room with him, he leers at her and grasps her breasts.|$|E
5000|$|The Door, 12 X 18 feet, (3.65 X 5.50 meters), oil on canvas, 1985 A {{dominant}} figure {{mounted on}} a horse in the upper center of the painting seems to oversee the event symbolize authority and power. He rides near a figure {{standing in front of}} an open door of flaming hearth. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> with outflanked embraced arms and looks toward three headless figures walking towards him. A figure clutching a book seems to watch their pace while awaits their arrival. In critical opinion the headless figures are symbols of the conjunction of legalism and death. The figure in the doorway and the one with a book symbolize the intermediaries who carries out the law by obeying and upholding power.|$|E
6000|$|The {{three men}} stopped, and moved their heads {{as though they}} were looking about them. They turned their faces this way and that, and Nunez gesticulated with freedom. But they did not appear to see him for all his gestures, and after a time, {{directing}} themselves towards the mountains far away to the right, they shouted as if in answer. Nunez bawled again, and then once more, and as <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> ineffectually the word [...] "blind" [...] came {{up to the top of}} his thoughts. [...] "The fools must be blind," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|She shrugged her {{shoulders}} slightly. <b>He</b> understood the <b>gesture.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> towards {{perhaps the}} biggest bulge when he notes (in Chapter 1, [...] "Why State-of-Nature Theory?") the shallowness of his [...] "invisible hand" [...] {{explanation}} of the minimal state, deriving it from a Lockean state of nature, {{in which there are}} individual rights but no state to enforce and adjudicate them. Although this counts for him as a [...] "fundamental explanation" [...] of the political realm because the political is explained in terms of the nonpolitical, it is shallow relative to his later [...] "genealogical" [...] ambition (in The Nature of Rationality and especially in Invariances) to explain both the political and the moral by reference to beneficial cooperative practices that {{can be traced back to}} our hunter-gatherer ancestors and beyond. The genealogy will give Nozick an explanation of what is only assumed in ASU: the fundamental status of individual rights. Creativity was not a factor in his interpretation.|$|E

50|$|The {{main event}} was a {{triangle}} elimination match between nWo, Team Piper and Team WCW. nWo won. During nWo's celebration after the match, Sting rappelled {{down to the}} ring. When Scott Hall and Kevin Nash approached him, Sting attacked them with a baseball bat, then Randy Savage {{when he tried to}} intervene. After giving all three of them a Scorpion Death Drop, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> for Hollywood Hogan to come at him as well. Hogan did, and was promptly taken out by Sting as well. Sting's actions solidified his allegiance to WCW instead of the nWo, and he would become nWo's main adversary.|$|R
5000|$|Šćepović scored {{his first}} {{professional}} goal on 4 September 2010, netting {{the last of}} a 2-0 home success against FK Hajduk Kula. On 29 October of the following year, after netting the second in a 3-1 win against FK Smederevo, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> with his finger on his lips to [...] "hush" [...] some spectators in the east tribune of Partizan Stadium which had provoked him during the match. He also scored in Partizan's 2-0 win in the Eternal Derby against Red Star Belgrade on 26 November, being also given the Man of the Match award by Serbian newspaper Sportal.|$|R
5000|$|When sent to trial, David Birnie {{pled guilty}} to four counts of murder and one count each of {{abduction}} and rape. When asked why he had pled guilty, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> toward the victims' families and said, [...] "It's the least I could do." [...] He was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment. After being found sane enough to stand trial, Catherine Birnie was also sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Western Australia; under law at the time, both were required to serve 20 years before being eligible for parole.|$|R
5000|$|Gilbert and Sullivan expert Ian Bradley comments, [...] "Opera della Luna has {{achieved}} the rare feat of {{bringing in a}} new audience for G&S without alienating the old one." [...] Typical of reactions to the company's many appearances at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton is this Manchester Evening News review of the company's H.M.S. Pinafore in 2006:The festival proper opened with this inventive and entertaining production by M.E.N. Award-winning Opera della Luna. It's a cleverly pared-down version to suit the mere eight-strong company, plus five-person orchestra (and how haunting to hear Dear Little Buttercup as a violin solo by Rachel Davies). Jeff Clarke directs from the keyboard.... The cast {{is led by the}} irrepressible Simon Butteriss as Sir Joseph Porter. <b>He</b> <b>gestures,</b> minces and trips around to great comic effect, splendidly aided and abetted by the others... Ian Belsey makes an imposing and funny Captain.... Between them, they entertain hugely." ...|$|E
50|$|The scene {{moves back}} to Bosko and the horse. It {{seems to be}} an exact repeat of the earlier dance routine, with Bosko playing the horse's tail while the horse goes through his unique dance moves. Bosko {{eventually}} slides down the horse's neck and goes to feed the pigs, who seem to be squealing in hunger. He tilts a trash can into their trough, and they eat greedily. One of the piglets finds a bottle of booze and tries to loosen the cork. Eventually, he manages to open it using the other piglet's tail as a corkscrew. Bubbles begin to float out, and the piglets pop them merrily, making xylophone-like sounds that play How dry I am. They start drinking it and soon get drunk. Their father comes over and starts drinking from the bottle too. He laughs with a deep bass guffaw and sings One Little Drink, using nonsense syllables. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> expressively and flings the bottle away which shatters against Bosko's head.|$|E
5000|$|Wiens’ {{early work}} {{consisted}} of large-scale sculptures and installations, depicting fragments of heroic monuments. He used sculpture and installation to explore social issues and ideas {{of language and}} representation. He is {{perhaps best known for}} his large-scale watercolour close-ups of pine trees, which he began painting in 1996. The watercolours are detailed portraits of trees, including old-growth pines in Temagami, Ontario, and deciduous trees found in his local area. Wiens photographs the trees and then painstakingly reproduces their texture, colour and scale. The renderings are extremely detailed and dense. Wiens’ tree portraits also function as memorials to, or remnants of the destruction of Canadian forests. As John Armstong writes in C Magazine, [...] "Wiens creates, in his pinpoint framing and cool description, a chilly distance between the living trees and what we see in the gallery: <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> both romance and the deadpan optics of a ledger. Without any didactic tone, these paintings chronicle a simultaneously grim and poetic politic." ...|$|E
