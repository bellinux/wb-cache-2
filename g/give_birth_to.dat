5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> tadpoles.|$|E

5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> {{up to four}} cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> {{more than one}} infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E

5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy.

5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{are found}} in warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters. Both species are pelagic; M. birostris migrates across open oceans, singly or in groups, while M. alfredi tends to be resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they swallow with their open mouths as they swim. Gestation lasts over a year and mantas <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> live pups. Mantas may visit cleaning stations {{for the removal of}} parasites. Like whales, they breach, for unknown reasons.|$|E

5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{pregnant}} again, {{was aware}} of the dangers if she failed to <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality. At this time Henry began paying court to Jane Seymour. He gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane, in the presence of Anne, began opening and shutting it. Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled.|$|E

5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a litter {{of three or four}} kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
