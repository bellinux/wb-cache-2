5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows <b>deep,</b> <b>to</b> form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland. They {{were also used}} in smaller numbers to block roads. They frequently sported loops at the top for the attachment of barbed wire. There was also a tetrahedral or caltrop-shaped obstacle, although it seems these were rare.|$|E
5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E

50|$|Deep {{earthquakes}} {{originate in}} the subducted plate. Because the Pacific Plate is subducting under {{the eastern side of}} the North Island, there are frequent deep earthquakes east of a line from the Bay of Plenty to Nelson (the approximate edge of the subducted plate), with the earthquakes being <b>deeper</b> <b>to</b> the west, and shallower to the east. Because the Australian Plate is subducting under the Pacific Plate in Fiordland, there are frequent deep earthquakes near Fiordland, with the earthquakes being <b>deeper</b> <b>to</b> the east and shallower near the west. There are few deep earthquakes along the Southern Alps, because the two sides largely slide past each other.|$|R
5|$|After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's {{shirt and}} found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{force of}} 100 was outnumbered by the pirates and also outgunned, with Alligator {{mounting}} only 12 six-pounders, {{compared to the}} pirates' 14 cannon. Despite being outnumbered, Alligator and her crew were experienced veterans, having taken the Portuguese brig Marianna Flora the year before in a bloody action. Allen was also an experienced commander who had taken command of USS Argus during her engagement with HMS Pelican in the War of 1812. Though Alligator draft was too <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> chase pirate craft inshore, if need be, she could send her cutter, gig, and launch out with boarding parties to engage the pirates.|$|E
5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> the plantar fascia.|$|E

50|$|Zetterström first {{described}} {{the use of}} hydrogen as a breathing gas in 1943. From 1943 to 1944, {{a total of six}} ocean dives were made utilising this mixture with the <b>deepest</b> <b>to</b> 160 metres (96% hydrogen and 4% oxygen).|$|R
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} habitats, {{although}} shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that are away from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> forage effectively.|$|E
50|$|Flowers: Delicate, pendent, nodding, 2-3 cm closed orbs of pearly white, <b>to</b> pink, <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> pink, <b>to</b> almost wine-red, {{occasionally}} greenish. Flowers {{from late}} March- April-June- early July.|$|R
50|$|The flowers {{come in a}} {{range of}} violet-blue shades. From blue, <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> purple, <b>to</b> violet-blue, to violet, to dark violet. The flowers are 6-8 cm in diameter.|$|R

5|$|The panniculus carnosus is a {{layer of}} {{striated}} muscle <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> the panniculus adiposus. Although absent in hominoids, the panniculus carnosus is common in non-hominoid primates and non-primate mammals. In lower mammals {{the area of the}} panniculus carnosus can be extensive, almost covering the entire body {{in the case of the}} short-beaked echidna. Several human muscles are considered discrete muscles originating from the panniculus carnosus, and some researchers classify the axillary arch as a sporadic vestigial muscle of this type.|$|E
5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb <b>Deep</b> <b>to</b> O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Villa {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the best forwards of his generation, and one of the best Spanish strikers of all-time. An opportunistic, versatile and well-rounded player, Villa is naturally right-footed, but an accurate and powerful finisher with either foot, due to his ambidexterity, both inside and outside the area, despite his lack of height or physicality; he is also a set piece and penalty kick specialist. Villa is a quick, agile, and mobile team player, with excellent technique and dribbling skills, who is also known for his work-rate and intelligent offensive movement, as well as his ability to either create space for teammates or make attacking runs into the area. Due to his vision and passing ability, he is also capable of dropping <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> link up play with midfielders, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates, which has allowed him to be deployed as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder or as a winger throughout his career, in addition to his more common role as a centre-forward.|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearchers have {{reported}} empirical {{evidence that the}} <b>deep</b> approaches <b>to</b> learning account for significant successful learning. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between students' motivational goal orientation, {{their perceptions of the}} general education classroom learning environment, and <b>deep</b> approaches <b>to</b> learning strategies. Participants (N =  494) were first- and second-year college students enrolled in any of the general education courses in higher education in Thailand. All samples were chosen using the convenience sampling technique. They completed a self-report questionnaire for measuring motivational goal orientation, perceptions of classroom learning environment, and the level of taking <b>deep</b> approaches <b>to</b> learning. To analyze the relationship between several independent variables and a dependent variable, multiple regression analyses were used and a positive influence was found of motivational goal orientation and perceptions of general education classroom learning environment on the level of taking <b>deep</b> approaches <b>to</b> learning. These results suggest promoting the <b>deep</b> approaches <b>to</b> learning by students through their individual personal attributes and classroom learning environment factors...|$|R

5|$|During the 19th century, Lees Ferry {{served as}} a gateway for the {{expansion}} of white settlement from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> ford for most of the year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result {{of not being able to}} sustain themselves in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{close to}} the sea floor, the bignose shark feeds on bony and {{cartilaginous}} fishes, and cephalopods. It is viviparous, meaning the embryos are sustained to term via a placental connection. Females bear litters of three to 15 pups after a 10-month gestation period. Despite its size, this shark lives too <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> pose much danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range; the meat, fins, skin, liver oil, and offal may be used. The International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks enough information to assess the global conservation status of this species. However, the various fishing pressures within its range are cause for concern given its slow reproductive rate, and it may have already declined in the northwestern Atlantic and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Jeita I (sometimes {{referred}} to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of the}} source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive potsherds, burned bones and end scrapers. Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the Néolithique Moyen period of Byblos. Evidence of later occupation included a Chalcolithic tripod pot found by Father Fleisch and a combed-ware sherd suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age levels at Byblos.|$|E

50|$|The Haynesville Shale {{came into}} {{prominence}} in 2008 {{as a major}} producer of shale gas in East Texas and Louisiana. Producing natural gas from the Haynesville Shale involves drilling wells from 10000 ft and to 13000 ft deep; the formation becomes <b>deeper</b> <b>to</b> the south.|$|R
50|$|Rawhiti Cave was {{originally}} formed some one million years ago, before Dry River cut the valley <b>deeper</b> <b>to</b> its present position.

5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the <b>deep</b> <b>to</b> the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|Released by Apogee on December 14, 1990, {{the trilogy}} of episodes was an {{immediate}} success; Apogee, whose monthly sales had been around US$7,000, made US$30,000 on Commander Keen alone {{in the first two}} weeks and US$60,000 per month by June, while the first royalty check convinced the development team, then known as Ideas from the <b>Deep,</b> <b>to</b> quit their jobs at Softdisk. The team founded id Software shortly thereafter and went on to produce another four episodes of the Commander Keen series over the next year. The trilogy was lauded by reviewers due to the graphical achievement and humorous style, and id Software went on to develop other successful games, including Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993). The Vorticons trilogy has been released as part of several collections by id and Apogee since its first release, and has been sold for modern computers through Steam since 2007.|$|E
