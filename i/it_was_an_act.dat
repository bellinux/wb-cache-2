5|$|In July 1840, a {{delegation}} headed by Adolphe Crémieux and Sir Moses Montefiore left for Egypt {{to save the}} Jews of Damascus. Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali to transfer the investigation to Alexandria or have the case considered by European judges. However, their request was denied. The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E
25|$|The {{hostage crisis}} was {{resolved}} {{by a combined}} police and military intervention, which was able to rescue 10 hostages. The end of the crisis saw the deaths of five hostages, including Hamill, {{as well as all}} 16 hostage takers. It is unclear if the five deaths among the hostages was a consequence of the intervention or if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> commited by the inmates.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{examples}} of general amnesty for all people sentenced to death and awaiting execution took place in 1959 when, after de Gaulle's inauguration, all sentences were commuted (amnesty <b>is</b> not <b>an</b> executive clemency, rather <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of parliament).|$|R
2500|$|In the Catholic Church, {{prayer is}} [...] "the raising of one's {{mind and heart}} to God or the {{requesting}} of good things from God."

25|$|The Battle of Long Island led to British {{victory and}} {{the capture of}} New York City via a {{flanking}} move from Staten Island across Long Island. Hale volunteered on September 8, 1776, to go behind enemy lines and report on British troop movements. He was ferried across on September 12. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of spying that was immediately punishable by death and posed a great risk to Hale.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the arrest}} and {{imprisonment}} of Abune Tewophilos, Patriarch of Ethiopia, by the Marxist Derg regime that had deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, Pope Shenouda III refused to recognise the cleric who was installed as the Ethiopian Patriarch's successor. He, {{along with the}} Holy Synod, argued that the removal of Patriarch Abune Tewophilos was illegal and contrary to canon law, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of political interference. In {{the eyes of the}} Church of Alexandria, Abune Tewophilos remained the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia.|$|E

Lizano suspects poachers were involved, saying Mora was targeted for protecting the turtle nests. [...] Chacón said drug traffickers, who often are also poachers, were likely behind the killing.

500|$|On 23 January 1992, a {{press release}} was {{published}} by the President's Secretariat to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose. The decision triggered much criticism and a PIL was filed in the Calcutta High Court to revoke the award. The petitioner took objection to the conferral of the award and its posthumous mention of Bose, saying that honouring a personality higher than the award is [...] "ridiculous", and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of [...] "carelessness" [...] to classify such a person with past and future recipients. It said that the award cannot be conferred to Bose posthumously as the Government had not officially accepted his death on 18 August 1945. The petitioner requested the whereabouts of Bose from 18 August 1945 till date, {{based on the information}} collected by the 1956 Shah Nawaz Committee and the 1970 Khosla Commission. Bose's family members expressed their unwillingness to accept the award.|$|E

They were married in the Bolton Street Registry office, although none of her family were present as she had not informed them of the wedding. She wrote 'cinema usherette' as her occupation on the marriage certificate, {{even though she had}} never been one. They spent their honeymoon eating at Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where their son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema. She walked into 9Newcastle Road waving the marriage licence and said to her family, [...] "There!—I've married him." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of defiance against her father, who had threatened to disown her if she ever cohabitated with a lover. On their wedding night, she stayed at her parents' house, and Lennon went back to his boarding house. The next day, he went back to sea for three months, on a ship bound for the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|The {{gender of}} Marc Lépine's victims, {{as well as}} his oral {{statements}} during the massacre and suicide note quickly led to the event being seen as an antifeminist attack and {{as an example of the}} wider issue of violence against women. Feminist scholars consider Lépine's actions to spring from a widespread societal misogyny, including toleration of violence against women. Scholars have categorized it as a [...] "pseudo-community" [...] type of [...] "pseudo-commando" [...] murder-suicide, in which the perpetrator targets a specific group, often in a public place, and intends to die in [...] "a blaze of glory". [...] Criminologists regard the massacre as an example of a hate or bias crime against women, as the victims were selected solely because of their membership of the category of women, and those targeted were interchangeable with others from the same group. [...] Lépine's mother later wondered if the attack was not directed at her, as some would have considered her a feminist since she was a single, working mother. [...] Others, including television journalist Barbara Frum, pleaded that the massacre not be seen as an antifeminist attack or violence against women, and questioned why people insisted on [...] "diminishing" [...] the tragedy by [...] "suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> against just one group?" ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain".

50|$|For the {{majority}} of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water {{in the name of}} the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.|$|R
2500|$|The {{unfinished}} {{right hand}} with the paintbrush is conspicuous in the painting.

It was a love marriage, and {{to persist in}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of {{considerable}} courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) {{and for a time}} threatened to disinherit them. They had four daughters (three surviving), Ellen (1805–1883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons—Maurice (1803), Morgan [...] (1804), John (1810), and Daniel (1816)—all sat in Parliament. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.|$|E

Rather than challenge {{the status of the}} Shulhan ‘Arukh, however, Isserles established the status of the Shulhan ‘Arukh as the authoritative text. In most of the editions since 1574, the Shulhan ‘Arukh was printed with HaMapah, thus creating an interesting tension that was realized on the printed page. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of integrating the Sephardic tradition and its accommodation into the Ashkenazi world, the confirmation of the authority and its undermining appearing on the same page." ...|$|E
