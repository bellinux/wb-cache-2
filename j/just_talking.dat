[...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it.

In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E

[...] Pitchforks Tom Breihan felt that it [...] "works best when Jay and Kanye are <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> about how great they are," [...] adding that [...] "Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force ...

[...] Claire Suddath of Time called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album by two of hip-hop's finest artists—men {{with a lot of}} things to say and a lot of money to spend." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised West's [...] "attention to detail" [...] and found their [...] "wit and absurdity [...] entirely suited to the epic scale of productions."

500|$|In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong {{offensive}} numbers, {{finishing with}} a [...]325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two {{punch in the}} middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny was <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.|$|E

New York wide receiver Ike Hilliard had 10 receptions for 155 yards and two touchdowns.

[...] However, Carlivati said that this obstacle would always be there and that the audience would see close moments. These close moments include Todd helping Marty walk and physical contact between the two while he nurses her back to health. [...] "I think the thing about the two of them, the characters and the actors, is you feel a chemistry when they're <b>just</b> <b>talking,</b> so I don't necessarily categorize it as romantic," [...] stated Carlivati.

The Straits Times Rebecca Chua found that Lim's debut as director [...] "displayed some uncertainty". In the same year, Lim resigned from The Straits Times to set up TheatreWorks in February. TheatreWorks, the first adult professional theatre company in Singapore, was formed to [...] "promote theatre that is relevant to Singaporeans" [...] and create work for English-language actors. Lim served as the company's press and media relations consultant, in addition to acting in several of their plays. Lim also acted in the English-language versions of Kuo Pao Kun's influential plays The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole (1985) and No Parking on Odd Days (1986). Both productions travelled to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1987. Of the role he originated in The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole, Lim remembers: [...] "For me, [...] was panic stations. I had never done a long monologue. In drama school, we had to prepare monologues based on a Shakespearean character. Nothing like this, which was 30 to 35 minutes long.

I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> [...] "about the hand you've been dealt."

And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

2500|$|... "Attack" [...] {{had been}} around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be {{somewhat}} problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of the}} band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was <b>just</b> <b>talking.</b> I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it." [...] Jared told Josh Abraham that night [...] "This song deserves to be a hit just so we can tell this story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pitchfork stated [...] "T.I. {{has always}} been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other {{mainstream}} rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's [...] (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that [...] "Clifford “T.I.” Harris is one of America’s greatest songwriters. I’m not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> about hip-hop, either—even if you add in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has more ways to score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it’s pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it’s time to start talking." [...] Stylus Magazine noted [...] "T.I.’s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.’s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning “Top Back” to the slyly tender “Gone,” every chime chimes when it’s supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion’s share of the praise: the cataclysmic “What You Know” and ostentatious “Bankhead” both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.’s lines with velveteen strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn’t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won’t be T.I.’s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it’s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far." ...|$|E
