5|$|The backup to Justice League #6 {{hints at}} the {{formation}} of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The Secret Society was fully introduced in Justice League of America. In Justice League of America #1, it was revealed that the Justice League of America team was created by A.R.G.U.S. in order to stop the Justice League if needed, with each member being paired with someone in the Justice League. Justice League #18 introduces Firestorm, Element Woman and Atom as the newest members of the Justice League, as well as the Watchtower being hacked. It is revealed at the end of Justice League #20 that Atom is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. and is actually a member of the Justice League of America. She was chosen to act as a spy within the Justice League. In Justice League of America #4, Dr. Arthur Light is called in by A.R.G.U.S. to examine the Secret Society's communication coin. While doing so, it is manipulated from the other side causing Light to be <b>enveloped</b> <b>in</b> a white light, giving him powers. In Justice League of America #5, it is determined that the Secret Society's manor has stained glass with images of Pandora's Box, hinting at their interest in Pandora.|$|E

5000|$|ALOX12B targets Linoleic acid (LA). LA is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fatty acid in the skin epidermis, being present mainly esterified to the omega-hydroxyl residue of amide-linked omega-hydroxylated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in a unique class of ceramides termed esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine (EOS). EOS is an intermediate component in a proposed multi-step metabolic pathway which delivers VLCFAs to the cornified lipid <b>envelop</b> <b>in</b> the skin's Stratum corneum; {{the presence of these}} wax-like, hydrophobic VLCFAs is needed to maintain the skin's integrity and functionality as a water barrier (see Lung microbiome#Role of the epithelial barrier). [...] ALOX12B metabolizes the LA in EOS to its 9-hydroperoxy derivative; ALOXE3 then converts this derivative to three products: a) 9R,10R-trans-epoxide,13R-hydroxy-10E-octadecenoic acid, b) 9-keto-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, and c) 9R,10R-trans-epoxy-13-keto-11E-octadecenoic acid.

25|$|Sir William Crookes, a gem {{connoisseur}} {{as well as}} {{a chemist}} and physicist, was the first to discover radiation's effects on diamond color when in 1904 he conducted a series of experiments using radium salts. Diamonds <b>enveloped</b> <b>in</b> radium salt slowly turned a dark green; this color was found to be localized in blotchy patches, and it did not penetrate past the surface of the stone. The emission of alpha particles by the radium was responsible. Unfortunately radium treatment also left the diamond strongly radioactive, {{to the point of being}} unwearable. A diamond octahedron so treated was donated by Crookes to the British Museum in 1914, where it remains today: it has lost neither its color nor radioactivity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{establish}} and analyze the categories and application status of energy-saving products of building envelope in northern China, especially in severe cold and cold climate zones, the categories and statistic data of building envelope in northern China is gained in the classes of wall, door and window, through the way of referencing from the relevant literatures and data, investigating and visiting companies. The comparison {{and analysis of the}} date shows that the building <b>envelop</b> <b>in</b> northern China can basically meet the design requirement of heat preservation and energy-saving in severe cold and cold climate zones. Traditional products of building envelop are suitable for the multiple requirements and energy-saving need of modern architecture. Further research and development of new materials and technologies is needed but the restrain and lack of standardization in existing market should also be taken into consideration. The categories and statistic data in this paper play a reference role to other scholars and designers for researching the building <b>envelop</b> <b>in</b> severe cold and cold climate zones...|$|R

However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Soviet {{astronomer}} Otto Schmidt {{proposed that}} the Sun, in its present form, passed through a dense interstellar cloud, emerging <b>enveloped</b> <b>in</b> {{a cloud of dust}} and gas, from which the planets eventually formed. This solved the angular momentum problem by assuming that the Sun's slow rotation was peculiar to it, and that the planets did not form {{at the same time as}} the Sun. Extensions of the model, together forming the Russian school, include Gurevich and Lebedinsky (in 1950), Safronov (in 1967,1969), Safronov and Vityazeff (in 1985), Safronov and Ruskol (in 1994), and Ruskol (in 1981), among others However, this hypothesis was severely dented by Victor Safronov who showed that the amount of time required to form the planets from such a diffuse envelope would far exceed the Solar System's determined age.|$|E

In the biblical account, the fire and clouds are a direct consequence of the arrival of God upon the mountain. According to the biblical story, Moses departed to the mountain and stayed there for 40 days and nights in order to receive the Ten Commandments, the Written and the Oral Torah, and he did so twice because he broke the first set of the tablets of stone after returning from the mountain for the first time.|$|E

The American torpedo boat Foote, a 142-ton warship armed with three 1-pounder guns and three 457mm torpedo tubes, was sighted off Cayo Diana. Both ships soon opened fire on each other. The American fired more rapidly, but less accurately. Foote fired about 70 shots, of which only one hit Ligera, while Ligera only managed 10. The damage and casualties aboard the Spanish ship were minimal. Foote, meanwhile, took several hits that caused heavy damage. Foote left the combat <b>enveloped</b> <b>in</b> smoke with its boilers badly damaged. At the time the Spanish believed that the U.S. torpedo boat was the USS Cushing.|$|E
