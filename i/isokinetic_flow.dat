40|$|A total {{water content}} probe for flight and ground based testing is under development. Previous work has {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} a naturally aspirating isokinetic probe. Current work has concentrated on developing an evaporator to vaporize the liquid and solid water content of the inlet air, while maintaining <b>isokinetic</b> <b>flow</b> and conforming to the aerodynamic, power and geometric constraints in place for flight testing. Development has involved aerodynamic modeling of the system to ensure <b>isokinetic</b> <b>flow</b> at flight conditions and thermal modeling to produce a first iteration of the evaporator design. Wind tunnel testing verified the isokinetic properties {{of the system and}} the ability to vaporize the ice particles with a concentration expected to be encountered in flight.

During {{operation}} across {{a range of}} altitudes and water content conditions the probe has to maintain <b>isokinetic</b> <b>flow</b> and vaporize the solid and liquid water content. Modeling the evaporation of ice particles within the probe is described and correlations made between sea level and altitude results. Results of sea level and altitude testing at the National Research Council Canada and NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel are presented covering both ice crystals and super cooled liquid. Modifications to the probe to enhance its functions are also outlined. 9 2010 by Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A new compact, low cost, {{and high}} {{performance}} separator {{is being developed}} to help reduce the installed and O and M cost of geothermal power generation. This device has been given the acronym ''BLISS'' that stands for ''Boundary Layer Inline Separator Scrubber''. The device {{is the first of}} a series of separators, and in the case of injectates, scrubbers to address the cost-reduction needs of the industry. The BLISS is a multi-positional centrifugal separator primarily designed to be simply installed between pipe supports, in a horizontal position. This lower profile reduces the height safety concern for workers, and significantly reduces the total installation cost. The vessel can demand as little as one-quarter (25 %) the amount of steel traditionally required to fabricate many large vertical separators. The compact nature and high separating efficiency of this device are directly attributable to a high centrifugal force coupled with boundary layer control. The pseudo <b>isokinetic</b> <b>flow</b> design imparts a self-cleaning and scale resistant feature. This polishing separator is designed to remove moderate amounts of liquid and entrained solids...|$|E
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of idealised models which exhibit all the non-Newtonian flow phenomenology commonly seen in dense suspensions are investigated by particulate-dynamics computer-simulations. The objectives of these investigations are: (i) {{to establish the}} origins of various aspects of dense suspension rheology such as shear-thinning, shear thickening and dilatancy; (ii) to elucidate the different regions of a typical dense suspension rheogram by examining underlying structures and shear induced anisotropies in kinetic energy, diffusivity and pressure; (iii) to investigate the scaling of the simplest idealised model suspension; i. e. the hard-sphere model in Newtonian media {{and its relationship to}} the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>flow</b> curves obtained through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations; (iv) to preliminarily determine the effect of perturbations present in all real colloidal suspensions, namely particle size polydispersity and a slight 'softness' of the interparticle potential. Non-equilibrium isokinetic simulations have been performed upon;systems of particles interacting through the classical hard-sphere potential and a perturbation thereof, in which the hard-core is surrounded by a 'slightly soft' repulsive skin. The decision to base the present work upon isokinetic studies was made in order to obtain a better under- standing of suspension rheology by making a direct connection with previous NEMD studies of thermal systemst(93). These {{studies have shown that the}} non-linear behaviour exhibited by these systems under shear is atttributable to a shear-induced perturbation of the equilibrium phase behaviour. The present study shows this behaviour to correspond to the high shear region of the generalised suspension flow curve. Science and Engineering Research Council and Unilever Researc...|$|E
