50|$|Nepal {{relies heavily}} on foreign aid, and donors {{coordinate}} development aid policy through the Nepal Development Forum, whose members include donor countries, international financial institutions (such as the World Bank), and inter-governmental organizations (such as the United Nations). The United Kingdom is Nepal’s largest bilateral aid donor, and the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are the largest multilateral donors. Donors have been reported as losing confidence in Nepal {{as a result of}} political interference and corruption in poverty relief efforts as well as the country’s apparently poor capacity to utilize aid. According to World Bank figures, official development assistance increased from US$8.2 million in 1960 to US$369 million in 2003 and then fell to US$177 million in 2004. According to Nepal’s Ministry of Finance, total foreign aid committed in fiscal year (FY) 2003 was US$555 million, with 63.3 percent in grants and 36.7 percent in loans. In FY2004, total foreign aid committed was US$320 million, of which 37.7 percent was grants and 62.3 percent, loans. In June 2004, active World Bank credits totaled US$302 million, with the greatest portions allocated to the financial sector (US$91.5 million)and to energy and mining (US$75.6 million). By the end of 2012, the outstanding World Bank <b>IDA</b> <b>loan</b> totaled $ 1.48 billion.|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} reviews the lessons {{arising from the}} design and {{implementation}} of the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) Project in conditions of ongoing conflict and post-conflict recovery. While Uganda is not classified as a LICUS state, poverty levels, social indicators and economic conditions in the 18 districts of northern Uganda are comparable to those obtaining in many LICUS contexts, largely as a consequence of prolonged conflict in much of the region. NUSAF is premised on a demand-driven approach in which local communities identify, plan and implement sub-projects that improve local infrastructure, promote livelihood opportunities, and resolve conflict. The $ 133. 5 million project is funded by an <b>IDA</b> <b>loan</b> of $ 100 million, together with a government commitment of $ 13. 5 million, and local contributions of $ 20 million. NUSAF was initiated in mid- 2002 after an intensive two-year design process with three main objectives: reduced poverty, improved governance, and positive spill-over effects through conflict mitigation. The study focuses on how the lessons from earlier interventions in northern Uganda influenced the design of NUSAF, and reviews the lessons to date from scaling-up and implementing a demand-driven approach in conditions of ongoing conflict. Available evidence points to considerable demand from communities for project resources and rapid implementation of infrastructure and income generation projects, confirming the validity of working through local governments, NGOs and community organisations as an appropriate response to problems of endemic poverty, weak capacity and the legacy of violent conflict. ...|$|E
40|$|LiFeBATT has {{concentrated}} {{its recent}} testing and evaluation {{on the safety}} of its batteries. There {{appears to be a}} good margin of safety with respect to overheating of the cells and the cases being utilized for the batteries are specifically designed to dissipate any heat built up during charging. This aspect of LiFeBATT’s products will be even more fully investigated, and assuming ongoing positive results, it will become a major component of marketing efforts for the batteries. LiFeBATT has continued to receive prismatic 20 Amp hour cells from Taiwan. Further testing continues to indicate significant advantages over the previously available 15 Ah cells. Battery packs are being assembled with battery management systems in the Danville facility. Comprehensive tests are underway at Sandia National Laboratory to provide further documentation of the advantages of these 20 Ah cells. The company is pursuing its work with Hybrid Vehicles of Danville to critically evaluate the 20 Ah cells in a hybrid, armored vehicle being developed for military and security applications. Results have been even more encouraging than they were initially. LiFeBATT is expanding its work with several OEM customers to build a worldwide distribution network. These customers include a major automotive consulting group in the U. K., an Australian maker of luxury off-road campers, and a number of makers of E-bikes and scooters. LiFeBATT continues to explore the possibility of working with nations that are woefully short of infrastructure. Negotiations are underway with Siemens to jointly develop a system for using photovoltaic generation and battery storage to supply electricity to communities that are not currently served adequately. The IDA has continued to monitor the progress of LiFeBATT’s work to ensure that all funds are being expended wisely and that matching funds will be generated as promised. The company has also remained current on all obligations for repayment of an <b>IDA</b> <b>loan</b> and lease payments for space to the IDA. A commercial venture is being formed to utilize the LiFeBATT product for consumer use in enabling photovoltaic powered boat lifts. Field tests of the system have proven to be very effective and commercially promising. This venture is expected to result in significant sales within the next six months...|$|E
5000|$|On October 8, 2003, Paris Club members {{announced}} a new approach {{that would allow the}} Paris Club to provide debt cancellation to a broader group of countries. [...] The new approach, named the “Evian Approach” introduces a new strategy for determining Paris Club debt relief levels that is more flexible and can provide debt cancellation to a greater number of countries than was available under prior Paris Club rules. Prior to the Evian Approach’s introduction, debt cancellation was restricted to countries eligible for <b>IDA</b> <b>loans</b> from the World Bank under Naples Terms or HIPC countries under Cologne terms. Many observers believe that strong U.S. support for Iraq debt relief was an impetus for the creation of the new approach.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Multilateral {{development}} {{banks are}} frequently accused of "defensive lending", {{the practice of}} extending new loans purely {{in order to ensure}} that existing loans are repaid. We empirically examine this hypothesis using data on lending by and repayments to the International Development Association (IDA), which is the largest provider of concessional development loans to low-income countries. We argue that key institutional features of IDA both (i) potentially create incentives for defensive lending and also (ii) enable particularly sharp tests of the defensive lending hypothesis. We find that there is a surprisingly robust partial correlation between disbursements on new <b>IDA</b> <b>loans</b> and repayments on existing loans. However, a closer look at the evidence suggests that defensive lending is unlikely to be a major explanation for this partial correlation...|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{institution}} of the DAG/DAC, several developments in the early 1960s completed the institutional framework for aid that is still largely in place. In 1960, the World Bank opened a subsidiary, the International Development Association (<b>IDA)</b> to provide <b>loans</b> to developing countries on easier terms than the Bank's normal lending. The aid agencies of the large donor states were also set up at this time.|$|R
50|$|The IDA is {{a unique}} part of the World Bank as it {{requires}} continuous replenishment of its resources. Member countries replenish its funds through contributions in addition to supplementary funds provided by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Whereas the IBRD acquires most of its funds by raising capital on international financial markets, the IDA heavily depends on contributions from its member states. The IDA received 2 billion in special drawing rights ($3 billion USD) from the IBRD and IFC. Approximately half of the IDA's resources come from the 45 donating member countries. In its early years, the IDA received most of its replenishments from the United Kingdom and United States but, {{because they were not}} always reliable sources of funding, other developed nations began to step in and fill the economic gaps not met by these two countries. Every three years, member nations that provide funds to the IDA gather together to replenish the IDA's resources. These funds come primarily from well-developed countries including the United States, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom with 58% from the US, 22% from France, and 8% from the UK. As of 2014, there have been 17 IDA replenishment rounds. Fifty one member countries participated in the IDA's 16th replenishment of $49.3 billion USD. The <b>IDA's</b> <b>loans</b> and grants are usually not paid in full to the borrower at the outset, but rather disbursed incrementally as needed by the project. Most of the donor countries such as the United States commit letters of credit to the IDA which bear no interest and are not able to be transferred or revoked, and which are exchanged for cash as needed for project disbursal. Other countries pay their contributions in full on the date of commitment to the IDA so that it may cover its operating expenses. Donors receive no return of funds and repayments from borrowers are again loaned to future projects such that donors won't need to commit those funds again in the future.|$|R
50|$|The World Bank's (the IBRD and IDA's) {{activities}} {{are focused on}} developing countries, in fields such as human development (e.g. education, health), agriculture and rural development (e.g. irrigation and rural services), environmental protection (e.g. pollution reduction, establishing and enforcing regulations), infrastructure (e.g. roads, urban regeneration, and electricity), large industrial construction projects, and governance (e.g. anti-corruption, legal institutions development). The IBRD and <b>IDA</b> provide <b>loans</b> at preferential rates to member countries, as well as grants to the poorest countries. Loans or grants for specific projects are often linked to wider policy changes in the sector or the country's economy as a whole. For example, a loan to improve coastal environmental management {{may be linked to}} development of new environmental institutions at national and local levels and the implementation of new regulations to limit pollution, or not, such as in the World Bank financed constructions of paper mills along the Rio Uruguay in 2006.|$|R
40|$|Ghana’s {{largest and}} most {{important}} creditor {{for the past three}} decades has been the International Development Association (<b>IDA),</b> the soft <b>loan</b> window of the World Bank. That will soon come to an end. The combination of Ghana’s rapid economic growth and the recent GDP rebasing exercise means that Ghana suddenly finds itself above the income limit for IDA eligibility. Formal graduation is imminent and comes with significant implications for access to concessional finance, debt, and relations with other creditors. This paper considers the specific questions related to Ghana’s relationship with the World Bank, as well as the broader questions about the country’s new middle-income status...|$|R
40|$|Existing studies provide little {{evidence}} supporting {{the claim that}} an IMF program increases the propensity of private investors to lend to the country concerned (i. e., the catalytic effect). In this thesis I investigate whether countries have access to loans with better conditions after an IMF agreement. In contrast to empirical studies with similar approaches, however, I study debt maturity as an important indicator of better access to international financial markets, because a higher default risk {{of the country is}} associated with a shorter maturity structure of the international lending. I conduct an empirical analysis which takes into account both the maturity and the interest rate of public and publicly guaranteed private debt. A two stage least squares estimation method is used to avoid selection bias problems. Panel data covering 116 countries between 1984 and 2007 and two other subsets of this panel data (62 countries for the second sample and 48 countries for the third sample are selected based on the eligibility criteria to receive International Development Association (<b>IDA)</b> ’s concessional <b>loans)</b> are used to test the impact o...|$|R
50|$|The {{investment}} requirements for mechanized farming favored prosperous cultivators, and eventually most farms {{came to be}} operated by entrepreneurs who raised capital through mortgageable property or other assets in the urban centers. Through arrangements with other individuals, these entrepreneurs frequently managed to control additional plots beyond the legal limit of two. Their ability to obtain capital also permitted them to abandon depleted land and to move into newly demarcated uncleared areas, a practice that had a deleterious impact upon the environment, deprived the indigenous inhabitants of work opportunities, and increased desertification. In 1968, to expand the operator base and to introduce more control over land allocation, crops, and farming methods, the government established the Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC), an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. From 1968 through 1978, the <b>IDA</b> made three <b>loans</b> to the government to enable the MFC to provide technical assistance, credit for landclearing and machinery, and marketing aid to individual farmers and cooperative groups. The MFC also became the operator of state farms.In the late 1970s, about 2.2 million hectares had been allocated for mechanized farming, and about 420,000 hectares more had been occupied without official demarcation. About 1.9 million hectares in all {{were believed to be}} under cultivation in any one season. Of the officially allocated land, more than 70 percent was held by private individuals. Private companies had also begun entering the field, and some allocations had been made to them. State farms accounted for another 7.5 percent. About 15 percent of the total allocated land was in MFC-IDA projects. The largest proportion of mechanized farming was in Ash Sharqi Province, 43 percent; the next largest in Al Awsat Province, 32 percent; and about 20 percent was in Aali an Nil Province. Mechanized farming had also been initiated in southern Kurdufan Province through a project covering small-scale farmers {{in the area of the}} Nuba Mountains, but under a different government program. Proposals also have been made for MFC projects using mechanized equipment in other areas of southern Kurdufan (some have already been tried) and southern Darfur provinces. There were serious feasibility problems in view of competition for land and conflicts with traditional farming practices, difficult soil conditions, and the probable negative effect on the large numbers of livestock of nomads.|$|R
