When <b>your</b> online {{presence}} <b>has</b> {{been established}} {{and you have}} begun to add content to <b>your</b> <b>page,</b> you should {{continue to work on}} improving your online presence. This includes maintaining your rate and quality of posts to make sure that your followers do not lose interest in <b>your</b> <b>page.</b> For social media pages that allow for engagement with your followers (especially Facebook comments), be sure to respond to the questions and comments of your followers and to engage with the people that are interested in your content (including those with negative comments). To some extent, <b>your</b> <b>page’s</b> popularity will increase organically (i.e. people sharing the page with interested colleagues) but some level of advertising is also required. If you intend to share work with new colleagues or collaborators, conferences and workshops are a great place to highlight <b>your</b> social media <b>pages.</b> For the general public, joining in on larger conversations on popular topics in the news is a good start towards generating future interest in your specific line of work.|$|R
