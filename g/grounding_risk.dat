This paper analyzes the main access fairways to the Split City Port, {{as well as those}} leading to the Kaštela Bay and the North Port of Split. Small vessel maritime traffic is also analyzed, although it is neither continuous, nor follows any established main routes. The AIS vessel movement data served as the basic source of data for larger vessels, and arrival/departure reports of port authorities for other maritime traffic. Main access fairways, maritime traffic concentration and structure, as well as assessment of collision and <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> are defined in keeping with the obtained data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to estimate the probabilities of ship accident (collision or grounding) on the basis of ship maneuvering results. Assuming that trajectories of ship track or swept path are considered as the response ensemble of either a stationary or non-stationary random processes, the study then concentrates on estimating the response characteristics by analyzing of their power spectrum density. Finally, the extreme statistics of a ship exceeding the channel limits are determined {{on the basis of this}} information. In that way, it subsequently becomes possible to study channel width and channel depth in an integrated manner. A real probabilistic model of ship <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> for the whole channel has therefore been established.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a procedure {{to assess the}} risk of ship grounding in restricted channels. The admittance policies (sailing speed and minimum safe underkeel clearance) for safe navigation will be established. First-passage failure and extreme theory of a stationary random process, which is considered as the ship motion response, are investigated. Due to the stochastic variation of the ship speed, Vs, and dynamic underkeel clearance, KC, the ship motion response characteristics are predefined and stored in a computer model as functions of Vs and KC, which have to cover {{a broad range of}} wave conditions. This makes it possible for a "closer " analysis in real time to refine the assessment. A numerical example is given and the procedure is therefore quantitatively described. The procedure can be used not only in the prediction of <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> some hours before the ship enters the channel but for the optimal design of channel depths with respect to an acceptable probability of ship grounding. ...|$|E

40|$|Fish {{are among}} the organisms most damaged by aquatic {{contamination}} by pesticides, being ecologically relevant for their bioaccumulation and biomagnification skills of contaminants, which may present health risks to fish consumers. Several sublethal damages are known in fish due pesticide exposure, however, the mechanisms acting on their bioaccumulation, toxicity and elimination process are not yet fully understood. This paper reviewed basic concepts of bioaccumulation of pesticides in fish, including chemical behavior that drives their bioaccumulation, and major metabolic transformation processes in fish (absorption and elimination pathways, primary organs, enzymatic groups, phases and chemical reactions involved in biotransformations). We exemplified metabolites generated from reactions of detoxification and bioactivation (when the metabolite is more toxic than the parent compound) of organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids, commonly used as pesticides worldwide.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new simulation model for long-term optimization of channel depths {{in which the}} risk of ship grounding due to wave impacts {{can be considered for}} every ship transit. This new model includes four main components: (1) an exponential probability law for a number of ship departures; (2) a parametric model of the wave-induced ship motions; (3) modeling effects of tidal variations on the channel performance; and (4) a Poisson probability law for grounding model in a single random ship departure. A key procedure of the simulation process is to define a minimum underkeel clearance allowance for ship entrance and simultaneously determine downtime that correspond to an acceptable <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> for a specified ship and a generated environment condition. This new approach makes the simulation model more realistic as met in the real world port activities. So the results achieved from this model are more accurate than those from other methods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation-based method and a risk model of ship grounding {{for a long-term}} optimization of channel depths. The long-term optimization of channel depths {{should be considered a}} two-stage process: Firstly, establishing a ship entrance guidance to facilitate a required navigation safety with respect to an acceptable risk of ship grounding due to wave impacts. As basis for such guidance, ship motion responses are defined {{as a function of the}} sea state (described by significant wave height Hs and wave period T 2) and the transit condition (ship speed V and ship draft T). Secondly, using the Monte Carlo method and based on the established accessibility policy, a simulation model is developed to define a safe underkeel clearance allowance for ship entrance and simultaneously determine downtimes that correspond to an acceptable <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> for a specified ship and a generated sea state. The final results derived from the simulation model can be considered as the key parameters in analysis and selection of an optimal depth.

National airworthiness authorities have advocated {{the adoption of a}} risk-based approach, whereby regulations are driven by the outcomes of a systematic process to assess and manage identified safety risks. Subsequently, models characterising the primary hazards associated with UAS operations have now become critical to the development of regulations and in turn, {{to the future of the}} industry. Key to the development of airworthiness regulations for UAS is a comprehensive understanding of the risks UAS operations pose to people and property on the ground. A comprehensive review of the literature identified 33 different models (and component sub models) used to estimate <b>ground</b> <b>risk</b> posed by UAS. These models comprise failure, impact location, recovery, stress, exposure, incident stress and harm sub-models. The underlying assumptions and treatment of uncertainties in each of these sub-models differ significantly between models, which can have a significant impact on the development of regulations.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a great deal}} of {{research}} efforts in ship hydromechanics have been devoted to practical navigation problems in moving larger ships safely into existing harbors and inland waterways. An area of particular concern is the prediction of ship squat in shallow or restricted waters at different speeds. Squat may cause grounding of the ship which result in severe damage to the ship, and consequently higher repair bills and off hire losses. River Nile cruisers are encountering squat every movement due to lacking water depth and stand up to <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> day after day. In this paper a series of simple but practical useful theoretical models concerning ship squat problems in shallow waterways are discussed. Luxor-Aswan is a selected waterway for the present study. In the course of this study, characteristics of Luxor-Aswan waterway and main feature of existing Nile cruisers are outlined. Finally, theoretical squat analysis of a candidate Nile cruiser has been presented. The results show the position and magnitude of maximum squat, grounding speed has been also identified. It has been found that masters awareness of squat phenomenon and its prediction for each specific vessel is of great concern for vessel safety. This work can be useful for ship designers, naval architects and naval officers, who have to be aware of squat effects, with a specific end goal to avoid any squat related accidents...|$|E
40|$|Risk-based {{design is}} growing in {{importance}} due to the need of obtaining measures of the safety to aid making decisions regarding the optimal balance between safety and economy. Design against Accidental Limit State (ALS) is one aspect of risk-based design. Collision {{is one of the}} most probable types of accidental event. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to probabilistic assessment of hull girder failure in collision risk analysis. The procedures established and applied in this thesis may be applied in a wider context, e. g. in <b>grounding</b> <b>risk</b> analysis. The probability of collision-induced hull girder failure is dealt with by defining collision as a two-phase event, i. e. collision contact phase (Phase I) and post-collision phase (Phase II), for the struck vessel. Collision-induced hull girder loads are necessary to predict collision-induced hull girder failure in Phase I. Simplified external mechanics of collision are extended to consider collision-induced hull girder loads. Main challenge of this effort is to relate the radiation forces on part of the vessel to those on the whole vessel which is represented in terms of equivalent added mass. A simple method is proposed to solve it. The hull girder responses are also estimated by considering the ship to be flexible. A conventional modal superposition method as well as an alternative method is used. The focus of this thesis is the probability of collision-induced hull girder failure of struck vessels in Phase II, i. e. the probability of hull girder failure of vessels with collision-induced damages by using structural reliability methods. Relevant design collision scenarios are selected based on available information. Previous work on structural reliability of damaged vessels has mainly focused on scalarload process with extreme hull girder loads represented by those on intact vessels multiplied by load coefficients. This approach does not reflect the damage properties properly, which can be overcome by scenario-based assessment. Furthermore, vectorload processes should be considered in structural reliability analysis of damaged ships. First passage probability based on out-crossing rate, which is called the out-crossing rate method, can be used to perform reliability analysis of ships under vector-load processes. In this thesis, alternative methods are introduced to estimate out-crossing rate and they are compared and validated mutually for structural reliability analysis of a damaged oil tanker. Scenario-based reliability analyses are undertaken for a double hull oil tanker at full load condition with various collision-induced damages. Combined vertical and horizontal bending moments are considered and therefore the out-crossing rate method is used to predict the probability of hull girder failure. Collision scenarios are defined in terms of sea state, loading condition and damage properties etc. Ultimate strength of the damaged vessel is estimated by the Smith's method and is thus affected by damage height and vertical location. Damage length, penetration and longitudinal location determine which tanks are damaged and thus affect hull girder loads of damaged vessels. The sensitivity of the 3 -hour's failure probability of damaged vessels to sea state is investigated. The sea state associated with collisions from the HARDER project and that for North Atlantic from DNV are considered. The sensitivity of the short-term failure probability of damaged vessels to damage is also studied. The statistical database for collision-induced damage in the HARDER project is adopted to assess the probability of damages. Finally, as a particular issue for damaged vessels, the effect of sloshing in tanks on motions, hull girder responses and thus the probability of hull girder failure is investigated. The linear multimodal approach is implemented to study sloshing effects based on the assumption that the damaged tanks are of rectangular shape. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|E

For the placing on the market, monitoring is differentiated into case-specific monitoring (i.e. the confirmation of any assumption regarding the effect of the GMO) and general surveillance (i.e. the identification of adverse effects which were not anticipated).

The existing analysis tools can be classified into two categories, i. e. the object-oriented and the spacecraft-oriented methods, the latter being more accurate than the first one. The past object-oriented tools include objects of only simple shapes.

40|$|BOT-schemes are {{actually}} widely used. The new FIDIC ”Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey Projects” (Silver Book) {{meet the requirements}} {{for this kind of}} projects. However, these forms are not suitable if the construction will involve substantial sub-surface work or work in other areas which tenderers cannot inspect. An example for this would be hydropower development work with a large percentage of sub-surface works for caverns, water galeries, headrace tunnels and diversion galeries. Especially in South-East Asia there are many opportunities for the construction industry to engage in BOT schemes on the hydropower sector.
