Commentators {{have only recently}} begun to examine the law governing the departure of partners from law firms. The purpose of this Comment is to examine one small aspect of the law governing this mobility: the post-departure liability of departed lawyers for malpractice committed by the remaining, servicing (to the client), ex-partners. The discussion will demonstrate how a too rigorous application of partnership law to the law firm situation leads to bad law. The Comment suggests that the client-law firm retainer agreement, which of course commits the firm to provide each of its clients appropriate legal services, also presumptively authorizes the law firm to manage its personnel for all its clients 2 ̆ 7 best interests. The Comment further suggests that any understanding among the departed lawyer and her ex-colleagues {{with respect to the}} firm and all its clients 2 ̆ 7 best interests should normally result in the departed lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for her ex-colleagues 2 ̆ 7 post-departure malpractice. This should protect all interests without placing excessive and unnecessary burdens on large law firms. Part II briefly illustrates the problem. Part III discusses important precedent establishing that the departed lawyer remains liable for the post-departure malpractice of her ex-colleagues. Part IV demonstrates how this result, which is a surprise to many commentators, is poor policy (section A), unfair to the departed lawyer (section B), and inconsistent with client expectations (section C). Part V builds on Professor Hillman 2 ̆ 7 s recommended solution to satisfy all interests. Part VI briefly summarizes...|$|E
40|$|A {{development}} of a status of marine insurance warranties in the English law has been a lengthy process. Since the XVIII century, the English insurance warranty regime was governed by such rigid rules, as: the strict compliance doctrine, the absolute character of warranties, disregard to materiality or causative character of a breach and irrelevance of a future rectification. A unique remedy of automatic <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability,</b> introduced by the MIA 1906 s 33 (3), made the warranty regime even more beneficial to insurers and detrimental to assureds. In practice, this disproportion resulted in that the insurer was entitled to rely on an irrelevant breach of warranty to refuse a cover. Moreover, as the warranty regime is strikingly different from a general civil law approach to alteration of risk, its maintenance has become a hindrance for a process of internationalization of the English insurance law. Therefore, English courts and the insurance industry endeavored to mitigate harsh effects of warranties. Various measures of amelioration were adopted, {{but none of them}} could be described as a finale solution. In 2006, the UK Law Commission jointly with the Scottish Law Commission started a project Insurance Contract Law. The project concluded with an adaptation of the Insurance Act 2015, which envisaged significant changes of the warranty regime. This thesis intends to analyze the historical premises, the aims and the content of this reform, as well as its results: for instance, has the English insurance law solution became closer to approaches adopted in other civil law and/or common law countries? The main method of the research is a comparative analysis of the classical warranty regime in England, its alterations, introduced by the recent reform and the relevant approaches in other common and civil law countries. In conclusion, a summary of the {{development of}} the warranty regime and a brief outlook on future perspectives of warranties in the English marine insurance law are given...|$|E

He also petitioned to be cleared of liability for a sum of £100 given to him by the late King Edward II, during the conflict which led to King Edward's final downfall in 1327, to pay the wages of the soldiers at Gloucester, on the ground that he could produce no written evidence {{as to whether or not}} the wages had actually been paid, since he had given the money to one Simon de Reading.|$|R
50|$|The {{cesser clause}} {{has come into}} common use because, frequently, the charterers are not {{personally}} interested in the cargo. They may be merely agents, or may have chartered the vessel as a speculation {{to make a profit}} upon the bill of lading freight. The effect of the clause is that by the charterers shipping a full cargo, they fulfill all their obligations. The shipowner <b>discharges</b> them <b>from</b> further <b>liability</b> and takes instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight, demurrage, or dead freight that is payable. It has become established {{in the construction of the}} cesser clause that, if the language permits it, the cesser of liability is assumed co-extensive only with the lien given to the shipowner. In other words, the charterers are only released <b>from</b> <b>liabilities</b> that have been replaced by a lien given to the shipowner.|$|R

Failure to do so is known as non-disclosure or concealment (there are minor differences in the two terms) and renders the insurance voidable by the insurer.:§33(3): If warranty be not exactly complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> as <b>from</b> the date of the breach of warranty, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.:§34(2): where a warranty has been broken, it is no defence to the insured that the breach has been remedied, and the warranty complied with, prior to the loss.:§34(3): a breach of warranty may be waived (ignored) by the insurer.:§39(1): implied warranty that the vessel must be seaworthy at the start of her voyage and for the purpose of it (voyage policy only).:§39(5): no warranty that a vessel shall be seaworthy during the policy period (time policy). However, if the assured knowingly allows an unseaworthy vessel to set sail the insurer is not liable for losses caused by unseasworthiness.:§50: a policy may be assigned. Typically, a shipowner might assign the benefit of a policy to the ship-mortgagor.:§§60-63: deals with the issues of a constructive total loss. The insured can, by notice, claim for a constructive total loss with the insurer becoming entitled to the ship or cargo if it should later turn up. (By contrast an actual total loss describes the physical destruction of a vessel or cargo.):§79: deals with subrogation, i.e., the rights of the insurer to stand in the shoes of an indemnified insured and recover salvage for his own benefit.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the legal effect of breach of warranty in construction insurance contracts in Malaysia {{in light of the}} current developments in The English insurance law. The required data and information were collected from Malaysian and English court decisions dealing with breach of warranties in English marine insurance law from the online Malayan Law Journal published on the LexisNexis online database and from published textbooks related to insurance warranties. This study would help to offer judicial guidance to courts in Peninsular Malaysia on how to resolve the legal dilemma associated with breach of warranty in Malaysian insurance law. It was found out that the effect of breach of a continuing warranty will result in the contract of insurance remaining in existence and the risk is being treated as having incepted at the outset but automatically coming to an end as of the date of the breach. More so, the insurer is being <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> any future <b>liability,</b> although any liabilities of the insurer before the date of the breach are unaffected...|$|R
40|$|Like {{individuals}} and businesses, subnational governments sometimes face financial difficulties. Subnational government {{can get into}} financial problems in various ways, sometimes through economic or social misfortune; sometimes through incompetence or malevolence; sometimes through a stubborn unwillingness to make tough budgetary choices; and often {{through a combination of}} these causes. For creditors and citizens of those governments, the cause is less significant than the result [...] unnecessarily high taxes or woefully inadequate government services or both. The standards for establishing bankruptcy of an economic entity (whether an individual, corporation, or another unit, such as a local government) differ from country to country. However, the concept generally means that the entity is unable to pay its debts as they come due or to pay its debts in full. 1 Bankruptcy or insolvency law in many countries provides {{for the development of a}} plan that allows the debtor to resolve these debts through division of assets among the creditors in a way that treats the interests of the creditors with some measure of fairness. The intention is to protect the entity from its creditors so that the assets may be distributed equitably among the creditors and the debtor can be <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> further <b>liability.</b> The idea is to provide “breathing room” so that the debtor has some opportunity to make things right and may continue to exist if at all possible. The protection is usually through a specialized court or administrative body. The fresh start that bankruptcy affords is presumed beneficial to both the debtor and the creditors. Of course, some entities are beyond hope and the process leads toward complete financial liquidation rather than rehabilitation. subnational governments, bankruptcy, fiscal crisis, united states...|$|R
