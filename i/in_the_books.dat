500|$|According to Lindsey Weber of Vulture.com, the {{differences}} between <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and <b>the</b> film include Hazel mentioning the band the Hectic Glow many times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Gus is 17 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> but 18 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Gus has an ex-girlfriend, Caroline, who died from cancer which is not mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Hazel's former best friend Kaitlyn does not appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Hazel and Gus meet when she turns around to find him staring at her, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film they meet {{on the way to}} their support group. Gus dies more quickly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Hazel searches for <b>the</b> letter, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, Van Houten gives it to her. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Hazel shows forgiveness towards van Houten after Gus's funeral, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film she demands that he leave. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Hazel is a vegetarian but this is not referenced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.

5|$|Various {{changes to}} {{characters}} such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were {{seen by some}} to alter the tone and themes found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an {{original}} soundtrack {{based on the}} Shiva Trilogy books, was released.

Changes in the adaptation include the sequence of events in the prologue (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> it is Gared and not Will who survives and is beheaded by Eddard afterwards, and Arya's material is set before the arrival of the royal family), new scenes showing the Lannister twins' perspective, and Daenerys's wedding night showing Drogo not waiting for her to consent to sex.|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E

50|$|The plot is {{understood}} to be largely autobiographical, with de Sarre being Peyrefitte's alter ego <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Peyrefitte {{had a relationship with}} a younger student at a Catholic boarding school and, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> his love interest eventually committed suicide.|$|R
5|$|The {{adaptation}} to the screen has continued with the trend of including new scenes to flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially seen through {{the point of view}} characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, and the conversation between King Robert and Queen Cersei, and the young lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted at <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new {{location}} of the court is also introduced: Scottish actress Kate Dickie was cast as the Lady of the Eyrie, Lysa Arryn, also making her first appearance in this episode. Although Dickie does not resemble the physical description of Lysa given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> Martin stated that her acting in the auditions was excellent. The role of her son (renamed Robin in the series to avoid confusion with King Robert) went to Lino Facioli, and the knight of the Vale Ser Vardis Egen was played by Brendan McCormack.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E

5|$|As a writer, Sorabji is {{best known}} for his music criticism, the bulk of which is {{contained}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> Around Music (1932) and Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician (1947). He contributed to various well-known publications dealing with music in England, including The New Age, The New English Weekly, The Musical Times and Musical Opinion. He revised some of those articles and included them in his two books. His writings also devote attention to various non-musical issues: he was, among other things, a critic of British rule in India and a proponent of birth control and legalised abortion. Being homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in England, he wrote of the biological and social realities that homosexuals faced during much of his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Disney {{contracted}} with the Stratemeyer Syndicate and Grosset & Dunlap to produce two Hardy Boys TV serials, starring Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk. The {{first of the}} serials, The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, was aired on The Mickey Mouse Club in 1956 during the show's second season. To appeal to the show's audience, the Hardy Boys were portrayed as younger than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> seeming to be twelve or thirteenyears old (Considine was 15 and Kirk was 14 during filming). The script, written by Jackson Gillis, {{was based on the}} first Hardy Boys book, The Tower Treasure, and the serial was aired in 19episodes of fifteen minutes each with production costs of $5,700. A second serial, The Mystery of Ghost Farm, followed in 1957, with an original story by Jackson Gillis. However, for unknown reasons, no more serials were produced.|$|E
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E
5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do wonders for its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, and it helped in promotion. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency. The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album.
