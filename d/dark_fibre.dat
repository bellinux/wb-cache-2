40|$|Upgrades of undersea {{communication}} systems beyond their design capacity {{is an attractive}} alternative to deploying new cables. Increasing the per wavelength channel bitrate is an obvious way to facilitate this. Nevertheless, this comes with tightened performance requirements, such as improved noise and dispersion tolerance, which will reduce any available margins. Applying new modulation formats is a route to mitigate these effects. This paper discusses the technical challenges for carrying out upgrades, either as overlays or on <b>dark</b> <b>fibres,</b> and also presents recent research results on how to add capacity to systems currently operating with Nx 10. 7 Gbit/s RZ-ASK signals over transoceanic distances.

40|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD) provides an attractive means for securing communications in optical fibre networks. However, {{deployment of the}} technology has been hampered by the frequent need for dedicated <b>dark</b> <b>fibres</b> to segregate the very weak quantum signals from conventional traffic. Up until now the coexistence of QKD with data has been limited to bandwidths that are orders of magnitude below those commonly employed in fibre optic communication networks. Using an optimised wavelength divisional multiplexing scheme, we transport QKD and the prevalent 100 Gb/s data format in the forward direction over the same fibre for the first time. We show a full quantum encryption system operating with a bandwidth of 200 Gb/s over a 100 km fibre. Exploring the ultimate limits of the technology by experimental measurements of the Raman noise, we demonstrate it is feasible to combine QKD with 10 Tb/s of data over a 50 km link.

Field data from a sheep experiment in Uruguay revealed an excess number of zeros for dark spots. We compared the performance of four Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models under four simulation scenarios. All models performed reasonably well under the same scenario for which the data were simulated. The deviance information criterion favoured a Poisson model with residual, while the ZIP model with a residual gave estimates closer to their true values under all simulation scenarios. Both Poisson and ZIP models with an error term at the regression level performed better than their counterparts without such an error. Field data from Corriedale sheep were analysed with Poisson and ZIP models with residuals. Parameter estimates were similar for both models. Although the posterior distribution of the sire variance was skewed due to {{a small number of}} rams in the dataset, the median of this variance suggested a scope for genetic selection.

As of 15 December 2015, a total of 572 companies are registered under the IP-I category and 163 companies have been granted the access service license in 21 service areas.To reduce the capital expenditure, IP-1 companies and access service providers are entering into direct lease agreement with the individual property owners. The employees or representatives of the telecom company negotiates with the property owners and obtains the lease right for installation of mobile tower on the vacant land or roof top. A telecom tower company agrees to pay the monthly rent to property owners and both are entered into a long term registered lessor-lessee contract. Sometimes, family members of property owners obtain indirect benefits, such as securing the job of caretaker or security guard of the mobile towers and electric connection from the tower.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is becoming}} a routine technique in numerous forensic labs since it is fast and non-destructive. Recent work has shown that Raman spectra of dyes depend on the excitation laser wavelength used (resonance effects) and on the scattering ability of the dye molecule itself. Both factors together with fluorescence emission may affect the detection of a dye, especially within a mixture. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} their Raman behavior binary mixtures at various ratios have been prepared using five known dyes showing different scattering and fluorescent abilities. Their Raman investigation at 514 and 785 nm highlights the complementarity of these two resonant and non-resonant sources and the limitations of the Raman technique in the detection of both major and minor components of a dye mixture. Other investigations have been performed on binary and ternary known dye mixtures on cotton fibres by Raman spectroscopy and MSP-Vis. The combination of two laser sources leads in most cases to the detection of both or two out of three dye components. This Raman information reinforces clearly the confidence in MSP-Vis results. Indeed the contribution of the minor dye component is sometimes very small in the MSP spectrum and a visual inspection of the spectra in addition to inhomogeneous dyeing on cotton may result in difficult interpretation. For these reasons Raman spectroscopy is a very convenient technique to confirm or maybe specify the MSP results, especially for fibre types with common MSP spectra. Furthermore, MSP-Vis also showed some limitations with very light or very <b>dark</b> colored <b>fibres</b> whereas Raman spectroscopy could still discriminate between fibre types...|$|R
