5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide {{the success or failure of}} the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with <b>eighty-five</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E

40|$|Most {{individuals}} {{must decide}} how much of their marketable wealth should be annuitized at retirement. The natural alternative to annuitization is investing the wealth and withdrawing the exact same consumption stream as the annuity would have provided.

We propose a model in which retirees defer annuitization, via a "do-it-yourself " scheme, until it is no longer possible to beat the mortality-adjusted rate of return from a life annuity.

40|$|Abstract. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the second-line {{treatment}} for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Sri Lanka. Resistance to SP {{is caused by}} point mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (Pf-dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (Pf-dhps) genes of P. falciparum. We determined the genotype of Pf-dhfr and Pf-dhps and the clinical response to SP in 30 field isolates of P. falciparum from Sri Lanka. All patients treated with SP had an adequate clinical response. <b>Eighty-five</b> <b>percent</b> (23 <b>of</b> 27) of pure field isolates carried parasites with double mutant alleles of Pf-dhfr (C 59 R + S 108 N) and showed about 200 -fold higher levels of resistance to pyrimethamine than the wild type in a yeast system. None of the isolates had either known or novel mutations at other positions in the dhfr domain. In contrast, 67 % (20 of 30) of the isolates carried parasites that were wild type for Pf-dhps.

However, blood collection is not always welcomed, justifying the evaluation of OMT-based devices. In a cross sectional study carried out in May 2011 aimed at evaluating the level of awareness about OMT based HIV tests, questionnaires were administered to participants who consented {{to take part in the}} study. <b>Eighty-five</b> <b>percent</b> (n= 1520) <b>of</b> participants reported a lack of awareness of HIV oral screening before the study, and surprisingly, no association was found between the awareness of participants and their educational level (p= 0. 768). There was also no association (p= 0. 743) found between having had previous screening tests and awareness of oral testing. The percentage of participants who accepted the oral test before being informed about it was 31. 3 % (n= 1520). After sensitization, 76. 3 % (n= 1520) preferred oral screening for future tests (p= 0). These results reveal that if the OMT based test is affordable, its implementation as a screening tool in the general population could greatly increase participation in screening campaigns and is welcomed by those who want to self-test in a non-invasive way.
