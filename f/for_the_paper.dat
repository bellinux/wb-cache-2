5|$|Levin {{began to}} have {{difficulty}} with his balance as early as 1988, although Alzheimer's disease was not diagnosed until the early 1990s. From September 1995 his Times column appeared once weekly instead of twice, and in January 1997 the editor, Peter Stothard, concluded, despite a great admiration for Levin, that the weekly column should cease. Levin retired, though he continued to write <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> occasionally over the next year.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford {{began his}} working {{life at the}} State Savings Bank. On his return from England in 1926, the bank advised him {{that they might not}} {{tolerate}} so much leave for cricket in the future. Ponsford received a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club, which he was inclined to accept. This news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues. To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Herald—a local newspaper—employed him on the basis that he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
5|$|Upon Fleming's {{demobilisation}} in May 1945, {{he became}} the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, {{which at the time}} owned The Sunday Times. In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take three months holiday every winter, which he took in Jamaica. Fleming worked full-time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> until December 1959, but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when {{the full extent of}} the required federal appropriations became clear.

5|$|Following a major {{refurbishment}} of the Bridge Street {{base in the}} mid-1960s, the next milestones <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> came in 1973. The first was Sunderland A.F.C.'s 1–0 win over Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. Ian Porterfield's winning goal was headline news at the time, giving the Echo its all-time record circulation figure of 95,000copies of the Sports Echo. The second important event of 1973 was the 100th anniversary of the paper. Celebrations included a birthday party, with dignitaries such as Sunderland A.F.C. manager Bob Stokoe among the guests. Lord Buckton, the chairman of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, announced his retirement at the event, and was succeeded by his son, The Honourable Richard Storey. News of a move from Bridge Street to Pennywell, Sunderland, was also announced during the anniversary celebrations. The old newspaper building has since {{been replaced by a}} modern apartment block. The Echo name still lives on, however, as the project as been named Echo24.|$|E
5|$|From January to October 1890, Morris serialised his novel, News from Nowhere, in Commonweal, {{resulting}} in improved circulation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper.</b> In March 1891 {{it was published}} in book form, before being translated into French, Italian, and German by 1898 and becoming a classic among Europe's socialist community. Combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction, the book tells the tale of a contemporary socialist, William Guest, who falls asleep and awakes in the mid-20th century, discovering a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems; it was a depiction of Morris' ideal socialist society.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Nordale hired {{a recent}} University of Alaska Fairbanks {{graduate}} named Bob Bartlett. Bartlett had worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> during school vacations, {{but he made}} journalism a full-time job following graduation. For four years, Bartlett was the only reporter (other than the editor) who regularly wrote local stories. In late 1930, Bartlett was made the paper's assistant editor {{in lieu of a}} raise that the paper couldn't afford to pay. Bartlett remained the paper's assistant editor until 1933, when he became the secretary to Anthony Dimond, Alaska's delegate to the U.S. Congress. Bartlett became the delegate to Congress in 1945, and in 1958, when Alaska hosted its first election for state office, Bartlett was elected one of its first two U.S. Senators.|$|E

5|$|Still {{struggling}} financially, Marquis {{looked for}} a more prosperous practice in Virginia City, Montana, where he became friends with Samuel V. Stewart. He decided to set up practice in nearby Ennis, a town he expected would grow substantially. When the practice became successful, he moved his family to Ennis, {{and was able to}} pay off his debts. It was in Ennis that Marquis first took up writing after becoming friends with Robert A. Vickers, the founder of the Alder Gulch Times. Marquis was a correspondent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> submitting news that he had gathered on his medical rounds. Finding that Ennis was not expanding as he had expected, in 1904 he moved to Bozeman, but the move was not a success, and he again got into debt. Here a second daughter was born, Anna Rose Octavia. He had more success with a move to Clyde Park, where he established a well-respected practice. By 1910 he could afford to build a larger home for his family and exchanged horse and buggy transport for motor vehicles on his rounds. He occasionally addressed the Montana Medical Association conventions and acted as the Park County Health Officer. Marquis continued to write newspaper articles while at Clyde Park, mainly on historical or biographical themes.|$|E
