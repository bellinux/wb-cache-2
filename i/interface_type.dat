The card {{connector}} used {{for each type}} include: Type I and II use a 100-pin stacking connector, while Type III uses a 124-pin edge connector, i.e. the connector for Types I and II differs from that for Type III, where the connector is {{on the edge of}} a card, like with a SO-DIMM. The additional 24 pins provide the extra signals required to route I/O back through the system connector (audio, AC-Link, LAN, phone-line <b>interface).</b> <b>Type</b> II cards have RJ11 and RJ45 mounted connectors. These cards must be located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the RJ11 and RJ45 ports can be mounted for external access.|$|E

40|$|Interfaces {{are widely}} used as central design {{elements}} of Java applications. Although <b>interfaces</b> are abstract <b>types</b> similar to abstract classes, the usage of interfaces in Java applications may considerably differ from the usage of abstract classes. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces are meant to enable multiple inheritance in Java programs. Hence, interfaces are meant to encode shared similarities between classes belonging to different class-type hierarchies. Therefore, it is frequent to use <b>interfaces</b> as partial <b>types,</b> where an <b>interface</b> specifies one specific aspect or usage of its implementing classes. In this paper, we investigate interfaces' usage in Java applications from two perspectives. First, we investigate the usage of <b>interfaces</b> as <b>types</b> of classes belonging to different class-type hierarchies (i. e., <b>interface's</b> <b>type</b> variability). Second, we investigate the usage of <b>interfaces</b> as partial <b>types</b> of implementing classes (i. e., <b>interface's</b> <b>type</b> completeness) ...|$|R
30|$|Interfaces {{of child}} objects of a {{composition}} may be mapped to interfaces {{of the composition}} in order to externalize these internal interfaces {{to be used in}} relationships defined outside the composition. Similarly to relationships, since interfaces of a composition can be left undefined by a template, mappings can be established between <b>interface</b> <b>types</b> of child objects and <b>interface</b> <b>types</b> of the composition. Therefore, mappings must also to specify how to iterate on interface instances.|$|R

All six domain orientations in the lamellar structure of a modern alpha 2 gamma two phase alloy were therefore measured by means of convergent beam electron diffraction. The transformation matrices necessary for indexing crystallographically differently oriented gamma lamellae were systematically calculated. Based on these calculated matrices, the <b>interface</b> <b>types</b> between neighboring gamma laths could be determined unambigously.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Interface</b> <b>types</b> are {{a useful}} concept in {{object-oriented}} pro-gramming languages like Java or C#. A clean programming style advo-cates relying on interfaces without revealing their implementation. Haskell’s type classes provide a closely related facility for stating an in-terface separately from its implementation. However, there are {{situations in which}} no simple mechanism exists to hide {{the identity of the}} imple-mentation type of a type class. This work provides such a mechanism through the integration of lightweight <b>interface</b> <b>types</b> into Haskell. The extension is non-intrusive as no additional syntax is needed and no existing programs are affected. The implementation extends the treat-ment of higher-rank polymorphism in production Haskell compilers. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} object-oriented features of the new revision of the Ada Programming Language is the introduction of Abstract Interfaces to provide a form of multiple inheritance. Ada 2005 Abstract <b>Interface</b> <b>Types</b> are based on Java interfaces, and as such support inheritance of operation specifications, rather than the general complexity of inheritance of implementations as in full multiple inheritance. Real-time uses of Ada demand efficient and bounded worst-case execution time for interface calls. In addition, modern systems require mixedlanguage programming. This paper summarizes part of the work done by the GNAT Development Team to provide an efficient implementation of this language feature and simplifies interfacing with C++.

It was hypothesized that both field dependent and field independent users would complete tasks more quickly and accurately using both user <b>interface</b> <b>types.</b> From a population of traditional and non-traditional college students, 64 individuals volunteered to participate in the study. The Group Embedded Figures Test was used to determine field dependence -independence level and four groups of 16 formed for exposure to the 2 <b>interface</b> <b>types</b> in an experimental design. Analysis of variance procedures were used to determine the significance of learning differences between the groups. The results showed significant correlations between experience level and task performance. There were no significant interaction effects between field dependence - independence and exposure to the two <b>interface</b> <b>types</b> on performance. The findings of this study may have implications for designers of application software user interfaces and for those involved in application software training...|$|R
