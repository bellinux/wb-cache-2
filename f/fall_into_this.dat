5|$|A {{number of}} wild mammalians {{may be found}} in Canadian {{territory}} without being confirmed natives. Some were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced. These include the house mouse (Mus musculus), and Norway and black rats (respectively Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus). Other include escaped animals; the Coypu (Myocastor coypus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Hares (Lepus europaeus), as well as feral cats, dogs and horses <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category. Fallow deers (Dama dama) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) were introduced for hunting.|$|E
5|$|A pulmonic {{consonant}} is a consonant made by obstructing the glottis (the {{space between}} the vocal cords) or oral cavity (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Pulmonic consonants make {{up the majority of}} consonants in the IPA, as well as in human language. All consonants in the English language <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category.|$|E

5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been interpreted}} as evidence {{that it was a}} flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the {{feathers of}} Archaeopteryx <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> range. The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.|$|E

5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert {{tortoise}} (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. Interestingly, all the non-turtle reptiles <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common snapping turtle (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E

25|$|Mediterranean savannas are {{mid-latitude}} savannas in Mediterranean climate regions, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers, {{part of the}} Mediterranean forests, woodlands, {{and scrub}} biome.

25|$|All ten LPUs have an {{offender}} {{management unit}} (OMU) {{who work with}} partner agencies {{to concentrate on the}} offenders living on their areas identified as being particularly difficult or damaging.

25|$|The Vin doux naturel or sweet {{wines are}} wines where {{fermentation}} was stopped before completion. The added alcohol retains the grape sugar and guarantees its smooth taste. The majority of muscat wines <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category (Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Muscat de Mireval, Moscatell Catalan, Moscato d'Asti etc.) as do white port, and Madeira.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that Lindy Hop's most prestigious events have never used these criteria, usually having the simple judging value as who was the best/most-impressive Lindy Hop couple. The Harvest Moon Ball {{competition}} in New York City, The American Vernacular Jazz Institute's Hellzapoppin' Competition, and the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown all <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category.|$|E
25|$|Other {{human rights}} issues that are {{controversial}} include the case of Edward Snowden. However, the significance of human right does not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> case regarding whether Snowden received his fair trial or not. Rather, the human rights associated with the Snowden leaks are regarding the types of document Snowden released. Snowden released {{a significant amount of}} information on the U.S. government's surveillance program of its citizens to The Washington Post as well as foreign news reporters.|$|E

25|$|There are games which {{feature a}} heavy degree of {{shooting}} {{but do not}} <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> subgenre. Mega Man, Metroid, Vectorman, Jazz Jackrabbit, Earthworm Jim and Turrican are all platformers with a heavy focus on action and shooting, but unlike Contra or Metal Slug, platform jumping elements, as well as exploration and back-tracking, still figure prominently. Run and guns are generally very pure, and while they may have vehicular sequences or other changes in style, they stay focused on shooting throughout.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the {{counting}} can capture either the volume or {{the length of}} walks. Volume is {{the total number of}} walks of the given type. The three examples from the previous paragraph <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category. Length captures the distance from the given vertex to the remaining vertices in the graph. Freeman's closeness centrality, the total geodesic distance from a given vertex to all other vertices, is the best known example. Note that this classification is independent of the type of walk counted (i.e. walk, trail, path, geodesic).|$|E
25|$|Most taxes—including {{income tax}} and sales tax—can have {{significant}} deadweight costs. The {{only way to}} avoid deadweight costs in {{an economy that is}} generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change economic incentives. Such taxes include the land value tax, where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply, a lump sum tax such as a poll tax (head tax) which is paid by all adults regardless of their choices. Arguably a windfall profits tax which is entirely unanticipated can also <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category.|$|E
