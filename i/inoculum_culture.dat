This procedure provided sufficient infected exudate for gene expression studies in vivo. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify the relative expression of hlyA, hlyB, hlyC, hlyD, hlyE, hlyF, hlyG, and hlyIII mRNAs. The hlyA mRNA was induced approximately sixfold after 4 days postinfection compared with the mRNA levels in the <b>inoculum</b> <b>culture</b> prior to infection. The hlyB mRNA increased approximately sixfold after 4 days and 12 -fold after 8 days postinfection. Expression of hlyC mRNA increased sixfold after 1 day, 45 -fold after 4 days, and 16 -fold after 8 days postinfection, respectively. The hlyD and hlyE mRNAs were induced approximately 40 -fold and 30 -fold, respectively, after 4 -days postinfection. The hlyF expression increased approximately threefold after 4 -days postinfection. hlyG was induced approximately fivefold after 4 and 8 days postinfection. The hlyIII mRNA levels had a steady increase of approximately four-, eight-, and 12 -fold following 1, 4, and 8 days postinfection, respectively. These findings suggest that B. fragilis hemolysins are induced and differentially regulated in vivo. Both parent and hlyBA mutant strains reached levels of approximately 3 – 8 × 109 cfu/mL after 1 day postinfection. However, the hlyBA mutant strain lost 2 logs in viable cell counts compared with the parent strain after 8 days postinfection. This is the first study showing HlyBA is a virulence factor which plays a role in B. fragilis survival in an intra-abdominal abscess model...|$|E

Due to limited stock of fossil fuel and rapid increase of energy demand in Malaysia, bioethanol has become a very important and necessary alternative energy source in order to replace the limited fossil fuel stock. Hence, this paper presents the study on bioethanol production by using oil palm trunk (OPT) sap which mainly focusing on substrate concentration effect toward the yield, productivity rate, and kinetic behaviour of cell growth in different substrate concentration This research {{was carried out by}} using Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kyokai No. 7 in 200 mL conical flask, under 30 oC anaerobic condition. The research are focusing on the <b>inoculums</b> <b>culture</b> preparation, fermentation process, sample preparation, and analyzing methods. It was found that bioethanol production is increase when substrate concentration increase, from 14 g/L in 60 % substrate concentration, followed by 18 g/L in 80 % OPT sap to 22 g/L in 100 % OPT sap. With the highest sugar content in the medium, S. cerevisiae can produce faster ethanol production within 30 hours of fermentation duration. However, high bioethanol concentration in the process will cause the cell growth rate falls due to the product inhibition. Besides, glucose consumption rate were found out that inversely proportional to the substrate concentration whereas ethanol production rate and cell growth rate were directly proportional to the substrate concentration. Moreover, specific bioethanol production yield was found out that exceed 0. 482, 0. 516, and 0. 465 for 60 %, 80 %, and 100 % of substrate concentration respectively. These results will be useful in the future scale up processe...|$|R
30|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{immobilization}} of bacteria, pyrite was introduced into the process of bacterial oxidation of ferrous ions. Five grams pyrite was added into 90  mL adjusted 9 K medium with 10 % <b>inoculum.</b> The <b>culture</b> was cultivated at 42  °C and 180  rpm. After the ferrous ion in the solution was exhausted, the solution was stood and filtered to remove the supernatant. Then, 100  ml fresh adjusted 9 K medium was injected into the precipitation for the bacterial culture. Once the ferrous ion was exhausted, the solution was stood, filtered. In addition, the fresh medium was injected again. Samples of bioleaching solution were collected to analyze pH, Eh, and the concentrations of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +. The experiments were conducted in triplicate.|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of a study on the amino acid {{requirements}} of a strain of Streptococcus lacti 8, it was observed that the organism manifested adequate growth in the absence of added methi-onine. Further investigations with a number of strains of S. lactis revealed that all were able to manifest appreciable growth in the absence of added methionine. A detailed study using one of these strains showed that it responded favorably to the addition of amino acids previously shown to be precursors of methionine in the rat. It appeared that the organism readily synthesized methionine and that the pathway of the synthesis was strikingly similar to that established for the rat. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS The strain of S. lactis used in this study was from the departmental culture collection and was {{selected on the basis of}} its excellent growth in a synthetic medium. Throughout the experimental work the culture was carried in litmus milk and routinely transferred every seven days. The synthetic medium used was that of Henderson and Snell (1948). The modifications of this medium by Anderson and Elliker (1953) were not adopted in toto, the exception being the ascorbic level which was lowered to 20 mg per 100 ml of medium. The original medium was further modified to the extent that the citrate level of the medium was reduced to 10 mg per ml and acetate was deleted (Kizer and Speck, 1954). Each medium tested was inoculated initially from a 24 hr litmus milk culture using 0. 05 per cent inoculum and incubation at 32 C for 24 hr. This was followed by two serial 24 hr subcultures in the same medium using 0. 05 per cent of the previous 24 hr <b>culture</b> for <b>inoculum.</b> <b>Cultures</b> were tested in 2 ml of medium, and inoculatio...|$|R
